If you've read ""All the Light We Cannot See,"" you might remember that the walled city of Saint-Malo is featured prominently in that novel (and in its television adaptation, released in 2023). Saint-Malo is one of the many places in Brittany that is extremely popular with tourists.I've never visited Brittany, but I would guess that the man who recommended this book to me -- an older gentleman in his late sixties -- probably has. He told me he's planning to ride a BMW motorcycle through France this summer (in 2024), as part of a tour group. Anyway, back to the book.I assumed that reading the novel would evoke a sense of awe for the setting. But no. I'd recommend people simply watch YouTube videos of travelers touring the area, if anyone wants to armchair-travel this region. ""Death in Brittany"" has some of the most lackluster setting description I've ever read in a book. The fantastically dull 2021 mystery, ""The Last Thing He Told Me,"" featured more setting description than ""Death in Brittany"" did.... and that's really saying something. As to the characters, the protagonist is the classic archetype of murder-mysteries: the gruff, emotionally unavailable hard-boiled detective that this genre thrives on. White, male, able-bodied, neurotypical. You know the drill. This one's name is Commissaire Georges Dupin. He's crotchety and prone to whingeing, but he's also 'brilliant,' apparently, and always gets his man. Or woman, I should say. One of the mainstays of murder-mysteries is that the great 'plot twist' is usually the Big Reveal at the end that a WOMAN is the heinous killer: SURPRISE! Standard villain monologues, in which the dastardly female 'reveals all' to the stoic detective most often ensue. For readers who love to see Evil Women being stopped by the Lone White Man of Justice, and then listen to these women spilling their guts about 'why they did it' for no other reason than 'the plot said so,' this book will definitely satisfy.I honestly struggle to see any appeal in reading this book. Sure, it's a trope-fest, but it's the most lackluster sort of trope delivery I've ever seen. First, the action scenes are always skipped over, and summarized dully as backstory, despite the fact that there are only one or two places in the entire text in which there was any direct action.Second, the vast majority of the book is devoted to Dupin whingeing about how hungry and/or thirsty and/or tired he is. This is such a turn-off for me. If you enjoy protagonists who are constantly irritated by life in general, and never take care of themselves, choices which only exacerbate their incessant complaining, this book will be a huge hit.Third, the dialogue was also unpleasant. This novel read like a shoddy 1950s stage play, most of the time, and also like aliens from a distant galaxy were inhabiting the characters. People in the 2000s do not talk this way. Not in France or anywhere else. Fourth, I didn't even get some pleasant travelogue material out of this book. Dupin's 'asshole energy' toward everything, including the setting, did not endear me to Brittany. Dupin complained about the weather, the swarms of tourists, the 'inauthentic' restaurants that catered to tourists.... I got the impression that the author owns a second home in Brittany, and wrote this book just to make the whole area seem so unappealing to travelers that they stayed away, so the author would have an easier time finding parking around local attractions.The best character in this book was Dupin's second in command, a totally great guy named Le Ber. I really wish Le Ber had been the main character. But then the book would read more like a James Bond thriller, and completely lack the crusty hard-boiled detective stuff that lights up the mystery genre. Madame Cassel felt way too perfect to be real. I could say the same of Le Ber, but his unquestioned devotion to Dupin didn't rub me the wrong way, since they were on the police force together, and Le Ber was always getting paid for his work, whereas Madame Cassel was an unpaid 'helper' turned unpaid employee of Dupin, and doing it all with a smile and constant graciousness. It left a bad taste in my mouth.But for readers who love to see pretty white women falling all over themselves to serve the lone white detective who must 'get his man' (or Evil Woman) at any cost, then Madame Cassel will go over well.All of the characters in this book felt like they'd been ordered up from Central Casting, French noir subsidiary. I felt like I was watching a badly written play being staged, and all of these stock characters still had the script in their hands, their delivery was so stiff and unemotional. ""Death in Brittany"" is the most paint-by-numbers murder-mystery I've read in a while. It's the kind of book that is so boring and pointless, you feel your life slipping away into the void as you read it.I'm definitely not the target audience for this genre. Negative stars, for me personally. I'd rather sit in silence and watch paint dry. I would feel a lot less existential angst wasting my time in that way.Three stars because I recognize that this book is a super trope-fest, and that means it has plenty of fans. ""Death in Brittany"" is the first in a series of mystery novels starring Dupin. But my journey with this whingeing male lead ends here. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 05, 2024","Mar 08, 2024","Mar 05, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23014714-death-in-brittany

The story presents the act of lying to one's own children and spouse about paternity questions as a morally righteous act, and presents the act of toxic secret-keeping as 'mother knows best' parenting goalz. ""Tom Lake"" disgusted and sickened me. The plot twists are all revealed in the penultimate chapter, Chapter 20, and it was a horrifying level of mindf*ckery to realize I'd been following an unreliable narrator the whole time, a character who was not only happily participating in behavior that I morally condemn, but was also being touted as the moral hero of the story as well.I was ready to DNF this novel by page 80, it had become so wish-fulfillment ridiculous as well as utterly boring, but I was curious to know why this book is currently such a commercial success, and that kept me going. I reached the last page on March 3, 2024. My takeaways from this book are reflections on the extent that people lie to themselves and others to such a massive degree, and how so many people must want to believe that there aren't any consequences for lying to their own children about their identities. Lara is the protagonist, and it is my fervent hope that her eldest daughter, Emily, have children of her own one day, and that something happens with those children, medically, that reveals the true nature of Emily's parentage, and that Lara be brought to task for the lies she has so skillfully dished out to her children and spouse for the entirety of her marriage and motherhood. Not to mention the fact that Peter Duke never learned that he had a daughter. ""Tom Lake"" is the most saccharine novel I have read in quite a long time. Color me surprised when I learned, near the very last page, that I'd been consuming treacle poison with each sentence.I am NOT the intended reader for this book. I would recommend ""Tom Lake"" to no one.Negative stars. I often give my market research reads three stars, as a testament to the fact that I know that I am not the intended audience for a book that I hated.

DiGiulian mostly climbs rock surfaces, but she also competes in ice climbing and non-rock climbing surfaces, too. Before reading this memoir, I knew absolutely nothing about rock climbing, and I'd never heard of DiGiulian before. I'm also not on Instagram, so I'm completely unfamiliar with her huge following on social media. I've never seen any of DiGiulian's media content, either on her own social media platforms or in any of her mainstream media appearances. I only found out about this book a few weeks ago, because Aspen Winter Words featured DiGiulian as their February 2024 guest speaker. DiGiulian looks like a supermodel in the author photo for this event. She is a very beautiful young woman. I read this book in about two weeks, and while I did learn quite a bit about rock climbing, the book didn't leave me with a good impression of the sport. It seems like an activity that the ultra-wealthy engage in, flying all over the world, racing around in chartered planes and helicopters trying to 'outdo' each other nonstop. The competition for money, status, 'first' ascents [called 'sends'], and bragging rights, all while competing in a sport that requires hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, and probably a lot more than that for DiGiulian, just left a bad taste in my mouth. Other readers have remarked that there is a lot of unexamined, unremarked upon socioeconomic privilege in this book, and I definitely agree. It becomes really off-putting at times.DiGiulian is earnest and sincere. I do think she is speaking from the heart in these pages. ""Take the Lead"" is a 'success and meritocracy' narrative, and DiGiulian's commitment to positivity is relentless. I wanted to DNF so many times. I kept hoping for something deeper on the page, some richer level of soulfulness; I wanted a payoff for pushing through. But this book doesn't have the kind of depth I was hoping for. DiGiulian is honest about difficult aspects of climbing.

This book is making bank with Trump-hating Democrats. Since Liz Cheney voted with Trump over 93% of the time during her time in office, I fail to see the appeal. I tried my best to read this thing, I really did. I made it 110 pages in before I just couldn't take anymore, and DNF'd. The hypocrisy in these pages is thick enough to cut with a knife.Liz Cheney makes it abundantly clear that she is more than happy with Trump and the GOP, so long as the lies they are peddling are about bombing the sh*t out of people abroad, terrorizing and deporting immigrants, giving tax cuts to the wealthy, and doing everything they can to f*ck over the poor. But when Trump's lies put Cheney's own precious life at risk, and she is suddenly the one facing the fire of the GOP's jingoistic lies and total bullshit, well then, she draws the line, y'all. And boy, is she here to make it clear that she respects the U.S. Constitution. Or something like that.Liz Cheney wants it to be known that even though she did everything she could to put Trump in the White House, and staunchly supported him throughout his 2017-2021 term as U.S. President, she was pretty angry that he turned against her after the 2020 election, and treated her like common scum, and she's like, a real patriot, people. Plus a lot of Democrats apparently love her now. Liz wants to make sure the U.S. Constitution remains in place to keep people like herself safe from mobs. And she definitely wants to make sure that the jingoistic GOP rhetoric goes back to targeting people who don't have her pedigree.Way to go, Liz!

The book has a strong Prologue, and I enPublished in June 2018, ""There There"" is the highly acclaimed and bestselling literary debut of Tommy Orange. The book has a strong Prologue, and I enjoyed the first character introduction in Part I, that of Tony Loneman. But after that, this book consistently went downhill for me, dropping from a solid 4-star read into 2-star and even 1-star territory. The urge to DNF became unbearable, and I put the book down by page 100, then forced myself to pick it up again and keep reading. By page 105, I hit an internal wall of resistance so strong that my willpower to keep reading was crushed. That wall was made up of all the unspoken certainty that there would be no payoff for carefully reading this book. I skipped to page 220, and read the last 70 pages, to see where this was going. To see if I could dismantle my DNF wall, and carefully read the middle section. Sadly, the last 70 pages confirmed for me that my reader mind had not led me astray, that I had been right to close the door on this book.Due to my lack of investment, I know that these characters will not stay with me. As fiction, this book had zero emotional impact for me, other than moments of reflection in asking myself, 'Why isn't this working for me, when so many other readers 5-starred this book?'*spoilers ahead**stop reading here to avoid spoilers, thanks*I like that Orange used multiple narratives of grandmothers being primary caregivers for young children. I wish the overarching narrative had drawn that out more, and capitalized on the multiple women in this novel who completely shoulder the work of raising the next generation: what that means for a culture, and for society at large. I know that literary fiction draws its greatest source of power from all of the inferencing the reader is forced to do, but the level of inferencing in ""There There"" felt excessive, crossing the line from ""inferred conclusions"" into ""total meaninglessness"" and ""beyond the author's intention.""I like that multiple characters longed for their fathers. But then the text puts the missing fathers onto the page, too. So what is left completely unexplored is the psychology of abandoning children, as well as the psychology of fathering multiple children through rape. Even the psychology of two children born of rape and/or never knowing their biological parents who unwittingly sort-of date each other as adults: Orange introduces that reality to the reader only through complete inference, because the only thing one of the two characters is suddenly aware of is meeting her biological mother for the first time, whereas her male friend/colleague is meeting his biological father for the first time. Neither one even knows that they are half-siblings before the shooting begins. And maybe that's meant to be an unspoken theme of the book: the complicated, unknown ways that we are related to each other, as humans born of histories of rape and adultery, etc. But that was certainly not my takeaway. I don't see that inference being upheld by the novel. I feel like I'm trying to put meaning onto something that textually felt entirely random to the story and completely contrived by the author. Not for the purpose of making meaning, but for the purpose of spectacle. As to the mass shooting: the reader is left to infer that one of the drug dealers smuggled metal guns into the powwow, or most likely, more than one of them. This inference can be made by the fact that ammunition is smuggled into the powwow, so metal weapons were most likely smuggled in as well. The reader is left to infer that only metal weapons could produce the mass killing that takes place at the powwow, since Orange does show Tony Loneman having to throw down the 3D-printed handgun soon after firing it, because it is too hot to handle. Plastic guns are also notorious for lasting only one or two rounds before falling apart, and with so many bullets fatally wounding so many people in this climactic scene, representing dozens of bullets being fired in a matter of seconds, I can only assume that metals guns are in the hands of multiple killers.The reader is also left to infer why the drug dealers decided to kill their associates in public like that, during the robbery, rather than shoot them later, in secret, as would make any kind of logical sense. There is no explanation given as to why the objective to steal a box full of gift cards turns into a mass killing. Again, maybe Orange meant this as a reference to the tide of history: that in order for white colonists to steal something/take something by force, a mass killing had to take place. But this inference doesn't feel upheld by the text; it feels like me reaching for something to make meaning of a passage of text that felt entirely meaningless. Orange writes of Orvil's fate: ""She has to wait and see what the number of swings [of the hospital doors opening] will say. The doors come to a rest on the number eight, and Opal breathes in deep, then lets out a sigh and looks up to see what the doctor has to say."" (p. 285)Orange's follow-up novel is being published next month (February 2024), and Orvil is a main character in that book. ""Wandering Stars"" will pick up with Orvil again after surviving this shooting. I'm sad to say that I have zero desire to continue on with his story. I agree with ers who state that this book has more to say about poverty in general than about Indigenous people. I'd like to add that the dire consequences of parental abandonment, regardless of socioeconomic status, is a massive part of this book.In ""There There,"" the poverty and fractured families of the characters are both a legacy of racism and colonialism as well as a rupturing force cutting them off from their Indigenous history and identity. I appreciate reading about that reality. I picked up this book expecting to love it, especially after the Prologue opened the novel in such a powerful way.I also deeply appreciate that this novel is Orange's long meditation on his own fractured identity as a Native American, as an urban American whose white mother made the choice to cut him off from his Native father.This life experience makes for rich reading material. If Orange ever pens a memoir, I want to read it. But as to this novel, it fell flat for me. The choice to focus so much on poverty, familial abandonment, and sociopathic drug dealers felt like spectacle to me, just more depiction of Native Americans as alcoholic, substance-abusing f*ck-ups. People who are their own worst enemy. I really didn't need this. The depiction of an overweight millennial Native man living off his white mother, crying and whining and literally sh*tting his pants at age thirty, this also felt like spectacle to me. I don't feel like ""There There"" is doing the representation of urban Indians any favors. I personally recommend the work of Anton Treuer so much more. He has such a richer depiction of the varied lives of Native Americans, including urban Natives. And I know Sherman Alexie has been shunned by the literati, for his misogynistic behavior with women, to the point that Tommy Orange had to distance himself from Alexie and Alexie's support of his work, but I just want to say: Alexie's work also dealt with urban Indians. Including urban Indians who are completely cut off from their heritage, and have no ties to any tribal membership or reservation. I think that touting Tommy Orange as doing something that has never been done before has more to do with market positioning than it has to do with reality. Regardless, I'm glad that Tommy Orange has done so well with this book, and that for a great number of readers, this novel has had enormous value. I just wasn't the right audience for ""There There.""Three stars. ...more",Notes are private!,2,2,1,"Jan 26, 2024","Jan 27, 2024","Jan 26, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36692478-there-there

A vampire fairy tale, sympathetic portrayals of murdering Nazis, and [the part that I skipped] a blend of ""Schindler's List,"" ""Night,"" ""The Pianist,"" and other accounts of surviving the Holocaust make up the hearty fixings of this fictional meal.It amazes me that this novel is already over ten years old. I didn't know it existed until I decided I should finally read some books by Jodi Picoult, at the tail end of 2023. This was the second book of hers I have tried (read in January 2024), with ""Small Great Things"" being my first.I had to DNF ""The Storyteller"" around 40% of the way into the audiobook. I found this novel unbearable. It amazes me that anyone can even finish it.I thought this 2-star Goodreads  by Georgie, posted on December 18, 2023, was the very best plot summary and book  for this book that I've read:""A story within a story within a story and he’s the GOOD Nazi, okay!!!""Chef's kiss.And a big thank-you to all the one and two-star ers who described the book's ending in their s. I so appreciated seeing the plot twists spelled out. To know that those nonsensical twists were coming facilitated my decision to DNF. Getting to that ending was just not worth it to me.I do think that this novel followed the same formula that ""Small Great Things"" did: Picoult picked heavy nonfiction subjects (racism, the Holocaust) that she wanted to didactically describe to her readers, and for her fans, these books do a great job at teaching them things that they didn't previously know.I don't turn to novels for my nonfiction though. I also find what is being taught in these books incredibly faulty at times, to put it mildly. I think the didactic lessons in these novels are often as accurate as the medical information on popular dramedy TV shows.I do think that Sage, the main character in ""The Storyteller,"" turned a lot of readers off right away because she is having an affair with a married man at the start of the book. For me, I don't mind that the protagonist is making this choice. While it doesn't endear her to me, it doesn't make me want to DNF, either. Picoult's insistence that the reader sympathize with a murdering SS member, though: I could not take this. It enraged and sickened me, and it reminded me so much of her treatment of Turk in ""Small Great Things,"" how the reader was meant to be super compassionate toward an uber-violent U.S. neo-Nazi, who faces no consequences for any of his many crimes in the book.I can't take this in my fiction. Especially when the novel already exists in such a fantasy headspace, as this book does, with its extremely silly depiction of an FBI agent and the gratuitous violence on display in the vampire fairy tale, etc. For the readers who found this book ""way too dark, way too sad, and way too grim to keep reading,"" I totally feel that.A year after this novel was published, Anthony Doerr's ""All the Light We Cannot See"" hit bookstore shelves (in May 2014), and I was one of many thousands of readers who 5-starred that book. The Nazi characters are drawn in a way to evoke sympathy and compassion, while at the same time facing dire consequences for their choices. I was there for it.Ditto Ruta Sepetys' 2016 bestseller, ""Salt to the Sea."" Another sympathetic, compassionate examination of Nazis, and the children of Nazis, while not sparing anyone the dire consequences of those choices and realities. Josef (who has two other names in this novel) is spared the thing he most fears: having his ""legacy"" as an upstanding member of the New Hampshire community tarnished by the truth of what he has done (during WWII), by standing trial, and having the world know of his deeds. This is much the way Picoult treated Turk in ""Small Great Things."" And I just can't with it.Negative stars, for me personally. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

This novel is the third and final book I'll be picking up by Jodi Picoult.Published in 2020, ""The Book ofReading this book was an exercise in misery. This novel is the third and final book I'll be picking up by Jodi Picoult.Published in 2020, ""The Book of Two Ways"" is the 26th or 27th-ish novel in the canon of work by this bestselling author of women's fiction. (Picoult finds the term 'women's fiction' pejorative, but I think the term is useful and apt for describing her books.)In an interview promoting the novel's debut, Picoult stated that she was motivated to center this story on the theme of ""the one who got away,"" and claims that the vast majority of people who come to her book signings fantasize about ""going home to someone"" who is not their husband. You can hear the full excerpt at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxMFE...As someone who doesn't fit this target demographic, since I have never found myself fantasizing about ""the one who got away"" and I have not enjoyed any of Picoult's work, I'd also like to add that there is an aggressive lack of introspection in this novel. The book offers up a particular kind of power fantasy that is suited to a New Age/law of attraction wish fulfillment that I know readers often find really satisfying in fiction. It just really does *not* work for me. **unmarked spoilers ahead. Please beware**The story's central conflict is speaking to the sacrificial choice a lot of women make to provide full-time care to sick family members, underage family members who lack parents, the emotional labor of maintaining a marriage, and the relentless work of parenting one's own children. The female main character (Dawn/Olive), who has sacrificed every part of her own personal life in order to be a nonstop caregiver to family members, decides on a whim that she deserves the right to walk away from it all, and run back into the arms of ""the one who got away"": the lover and soulmate she had in graduate school, when she was still on her way to being ""an academic. An author. An archaeologist."" (p. 395) Before her mother's untimely death and an unexpected pregnancy (over fifteen years prior) made her turn her back on all of that.*Why* this character (Dawn/Olive) turned her back on her perfect lover, the immensely affluent and stunningly handsome Wyatt, who makes it clear at the end of the novel that he can work out any problem he needs to in order to be with Dawn -- this is never explained in the text. Dawn's entire plot set-up is meant to be vague and unbelievable so that readers can pour their own martyrdom-of-motherhood woes into the story, and be one with the vibes.In describing the book's plot, Picoult says that the story begins with Dawn on an airplane, and when the plane has ""an emergency,"" Dawn's life flashes before her eyes. The person she sees herself wanting to be with, right then, is not her husband (Brian) or their daughter (Meret), but her lover from graduate school (Wyatt).Picoult goes on to say that ""when the plane lands safely, [...] the book unfolds on two different paths, until you figure out really what the structure of the book might be."" (See the 2:50-3:00 minute mark on the YouTube link above.)I have no idea why an author would outright lie about her own novel this way. I can only assume that Picoult tells these lies because she didn't want to scare readers away from her book by stating the truth: that the novel opens with a horrific plane crash of a large, international commercial airliner (p. 5), and Dawn sustains a head injury that almost kills her. She has to receive emergency brain surgery to treat the ""epidural hematoma"" from the skull fracture caused by the crash. (p. 359)Also, this book does *not* ""unfold on two different paths."" This is a book with one, and only one, thru-story. And the vast bulk of this novel is told as backstory. For pretty much the entire novel, the reader is sifting through a whole bunch of flashbacks that are all told out of sequence. It's a deliberately coy form of storytelling that is purposefully confusing in order to give the novel a faux form of ""depth,"" and I resent it. Picoult is essentially tricking the reader into thinking there is more to the book than there is, simply by taking advantage of the reader's ignorance in the first fifty pages. Thanks, I hate it. Picoult often employs multiple narrators and copious use of flashbacks in her fiction, but ""The Book of Two Ways"" features one sole protagonist, and there is only one life that Dawn is living in this story. The Prologue (pages 3-7) introduces Dawn's current-time thru-story to the reader: she survives a horrific plane crash, walks away from the wreckage, and when an airline representative asks her where she would like to go, Dawn informs the reader: ""I open my mouth, and I answer.""That's the last line of the prologue (p. 7). The reader is left wondering: where will Dawn go? Then the vast majority of the book features all of the backstory that describes what led Dawn to being on board the plane that crashed. From page 9 all the way to page 359, the reader is solely reading Dawn's backstory, which finally catches up to the thru-story in the Prologue almost 90% of the way through the book. That's when the reader learns that Wyatt, the man's face Dawn saw when her life ""flashed before her eyes,"" was actually sitting right next to her on board that plane going down. This is finally the moment when the reader can put all of those flashback scenes into the right order. My friends, there are only 406 pages in this novel. And if you are wondering if those last few dozen pages provide some satisfying conclusion to the question of ""where will Dawn go?"" the answer is no. No, the book leaves the reader exactly where they are at the end of the Prologue. The novel even ends on the very same line:""I open my mouth, and I answer."" (p. 406)Will Dawn choose Wyatt, or Brian? Boston, or Egypt? Who knows, and who cares. Reader, you decide. Picoult has written the ultimate 'choose your own adventure' ending in this bonanza of nonsense titled ""The Book of Two Ways."" This novel is a giant exercise in futility. If pointless books are your jam, this one will certainly satisfy.The book's emotional climax appears on page 372, when Dawn tells her husband, Brian, why she abandoned her trip home from London, and hopped on a plane going to Cairo instead, to spend two weeks at Wyatt's dig site before they boarded the fateful plane that went down. Brian asks Dawn: ""Do you have any idea how selfish that was?""That is when Dawn finally reveals the entire point of this book:""Selfish,"" I repeat. ""Selfish? Do you know how many people I've put in front of myself for the past fifteen years? My mother. My brother. My clients. Meret. You. Even Wyatt. Everyone else's welfare was more important than mine. I am *always* the last person I think about. So just for a minute -- one *minute* -- I did. I know I didn't do this the right way, if that even exists. I know I should have told you what I was thinking, where I was going. But I had to go, for my own peace of mind. I couldn't stay here and pretend everything was fine, like usual, and let this eat away at me, wondering *what if.* Eventually, there would have been nothing left of me.""While I do genuinely feel bad that soooooo many women find themselves feeling this way, I was not feeling any sympathy toward Dawn. I was never convinced that sacrificing her career or her romance with Wyatt had been necessary. Especially by the end of the book, when it's made abundantly clear that she had never needed to do that. She'd just done it, for reasons that are never explained. But worst of all, the book was too massively unrealistic and ignorant to gain any of my buy-in for this protagonist. Dawn consistently read like a twelve-year-old, not the accomplished almost-academic of enormous intellect that she was supposed to be.Also, I just want to point out that Dawn is flying ""from Cairo to Boston"" when her plane crashes (p. 358), but in the Prologue, it's stated that the plane crashes ""short of Raleigh-Durham"" (p. 6), which makes no sense to me. Why is the plane that far south? The flight path from Cairo would've arced well north of Boston, to come down at Logan. How in the actual F did the plane end up trying to land at Raleigh-Durham instead? ""The Book of Two Ways"" is full of details like this, ones that make no sense and feel like the author thinks I am too ignorant to know that this book is full of shit.Many readers have complained that this novel features a lot of nonfiction material about Egyptology and quantum physics. That's true. Also true: none of this extensive material has any bearing whatsoever on the story. It's there as filler. It exists for no other reason than just to bump up the word count. And bump it up quite a lot.I'd recommend this book to any woman who deeply resents her husband and children, and fantasizes that her life would be perfect if she only tracked down ""the one who got away,"" as Dawn does in this novel. Also, since Dawn has a wonderful husband and an amazing teenage daughter, if a reader wants her to stay with her husband, instead of divorcing him to be with Wyatt, the ending is solely up to the reader. Dawn is deeply loved by two men who even get along with each other when they finally meet. The world is her oyster at the end of this book.For any reader seeking some strong martyrdom-of-motherhood vibes, and likes the idea of reading copious amounts of Egyptology and quantum physics information that has no bearing on the story, definitely add this one to your TBR.""The Book of Two Ways"" is a one-star read for me personally.But I'm giving it three stars as a market research read.I had hoped to read at least five Jodi Picoult novels as market research.

I don't think this book would've sold as well in a post-George Floyd America. I really see this novel as being a product of its time, especially with its gratuitous, relentless use of the n-word. Turk's POV is especially egregious, but even Kennedy (the female Atticus Finch) uses it freely in recounting a story from childhood.Ruth goes from being a highly principled, incredibly restrained person, in complete control of herself, and transforms into an Angry Black Woman stereotype (less than a third of the way into the book), a transformation that was completely unbelievable. Ruth's immature and nasty behavior, which was written to put her in stark contrast to the Atticus Finch vibes from Kennedy, was incredibly grating to me. It burns us.Ruth gets abandoned by her union representative at the first sign of trouble at the hospital. She's just fed to the sharks by her union, who hang up the phone on her and go no-contact. That is not realistic at all. The more ignorant the reader is about the actual legal system, unions, and the Black labor involved in understanding racism as a tool of oppression, the more rewarding this book is to read. The content of this novel was nails on a chalkboard to me. Fun fact: the actual legal case this novel was based on did not involve a dead baby, and did not involve a White Savior lawyer. Four Black nurses sued their hospital in Flint, Michigan (a few years before this book was published) after the head nurse wrote on a Post It note, which was placed in a baby's file: ""No African American to touch this child"" (or something like that; it's on record online; Picoult used the same text in this novel), and the hospital settled out of court with all four of those women, under charges of racism (for obeying the wishes of a white supremacist patient who didn't want Black people touching his baby). The women were each awarded around $65,000.00.Another fun fact: Ruth is not awarded ANY money in this novel, and the hospital is never found guilty of racial misconduct at all. Instead, White Savior Kennedy (the white woman lawyer who is totes awesome) gets to have her own Awakening to Racism, and then teach Ruth all about what Black people need. Also, Turk (the violent white supremacist neo-Nazi) gets entirely forgiven! And redeemed with a whole new wife, a whole new baby to love! Even Ruth forgives Turk everything! Yay for White people!Turk beats a homeless man to death in this novel, and never faces legal consequences for that crime, or for any of the horrible violence he commits in this book. Yay for White people!In case it's not clear, the 'yay' statements are meant as sarcasm. I was not a fan. I did not enjoy this book, and would not recommend it. I think novels like this are what I would be forced to read in Hell.Three stars because I know I am not the audience for this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 02, 2024","Jan 13, 2024","Jan 02, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41021501-small-great-things

The text of this book is a lot darker, and made for much more difficult reading. It took me almost six months to finish reading this book. While I did find ""Healing the Shame That Binds You"" an educational and rewarding book to read, the content was so difficult and triggering for me that I'd recommend it only with caution. I had to put this book down for weeks at a time. It was very slow going, and I found myself dreading the content whenever I would pick it back up.I think Bradshaw's book might be better read while a person is in therapy, especially if they are engaged in group therapy for CPTSD. Just reading this book on my own felt super painful and was not a great experience for me. I could tell that if I'd had someone informed about this subject to process the book with, it would've been a very different experience. I just don't have access to any CPTSD-trained therapy or group therapy at this time, and from what I understand, given what people have shared online in the past few months, it's really difficult to find any therapists who are trained in CPTSD. Just slapping the words 'trauma-informed' on a website is not sufficient. Thanks to YouTubers like Patrick Teahan, Daniel Mackler, Anna Runkle, and Heidi Priebe, I feel a lot more aware of just how very difficult it is to get professional help treating CPTSD. I certainly do not regret reading Bradshaw's book, and I'm glad I own an e-copy of it, and can go back and reread it whenever I like. I just want to be clear that I found the content to be so heavy and difficult that it often caused physical and mental pain to read it. Recommended, with the above caveat.

I think this novel is meant to be emotionally moving and tragic. I found it completely lacking the insightful content and lyricism I expect from a literary novel. The unnamed protagonist frequently refers to herself as still being a ""child,"" and is actively longing for the level of care a toddler receives from her mother, a mother who is her best (and seemingly only) friend.The socially isolated protagonist also wants to be sexually ""touched"" by a man, and when Jude appears in her life (the 42-year-old man), he is initially attracted to her because he sees her in a swimsuit. The protagonist is framed as being the most conventional kind of woman, while also having significant 'not like other girls' vibes. Seriously not my cup of tea. After the opening, the beginning sections of this book read like an Elin Hilderbrand novel, but without any comedic relief or happiness. If you're looking for a ""tragic beach read,"" this might scratch that itch. For me, this book was unreadable. Especially when I skipped ahead to the final few pages, and saw how it ended.

Lyon draws on extensive research material to bring this historical narrative to life, and the result is a remarkable book about the triumphs and tragedies involved in this infamous period of 19th century industry. My favorite parts of the book included the detailed accounts of crossing Panama by land, and the horrors involved in getting to California by sea, with so many unscrupulous American businessmen taking people's money and leaving them to die. The sections of text that are set in California itself, and describe the daily grind of placer mining, highwaymen, gold bandits, bull and bear fighting, mountain travel, and the sheer numbers of people risking it all in the hope of striking it rich, made for spectacular reading. ""Fortune's Frenzy"" has a large cast of characters, and I struggled at times to keep all the names straight. In the opening chapters, I often felt impatient to just get to California, since I picked up the book solely focused on reading about the Gold Rush itself. But Lyon's intention was to help the reader understand what it took for so many working-class people to travel vast distances to engage in an activity that they knew nothing about, and I think she did that remarkably well. This is a profoundly educational book that I will not forget. Highly recommended for anyone interested in this period of history.

Her husband lived for ten more years, and died on January 1, 2006. During all of that time, Ms. Marriott was his primary at-home caregiver. I discovered this book one night in September, while I was looking at the SparkPress catalogue online. I frequently dream of having the money to pay for a book contract with this company, and I was looking at the titles they'd put out earlier this year.The pretty cover of this memoir snagged my attention, and I'm always down for reading about adult caregiving, so I decided to check this one out.If anyone is familiar with the trauma work of Gabor Maté, I want to point out that Ms. Marriott doesn't appear to be familiar with Maté's trauma research around MS at all. If you pick up this book expecting it to be informed about possible causes of Ms. Marriott's husband's MS, you will be severely disappointed. I also want to note that this book is focused on Ms. Marriott's personal journey (the journey of an able-bodied person), and as such, the word ""ableism"" never appears in the text. ""Watching for Dragonflies"" is an interesting book, and Ms. Marriott includes a number of important details about the work of caring for MS that are illuminating. I enjoyed learning more about the many details of full-time caregiving for an adult with this condition. Ms. Marriott also had a high financial resource level to draw from, so there are details about traveling with a disabled person, such as locking a wheelchair into the driver's seat of their personal vehicle, and flying across California to go on a vacation with a power chair, that are truly amazing to think about: having money like that, and being able to do so many trips and activities with -- not only a manual chair, but a power chair as well.A lot of the book felt like the movie ""Groundhog Day,"" very repetitive with no forward motion. The first half of the book was especially unpleasant; just a lot of difficult content with a ""Groundhog Day"" vibe. I'm sure that this is true to Ms. Marriott's lived experience, but it made for dull reading. The prose is good, and Ms. Marriott is a very skilled writer, but the content often felt more like reading the journal of a challenging time, rather than something more potent. The book lacked the over-arching scope of a narrative voice with something life-shaping to say. I kept pushing past my natural DNF points because I wanted to see if Ms. Marriott would ever touch on the things I was most interested in, such as: her husband's understanding of ableism; her husband grappling with his own internalized ableism; whether or not she or her husband ever had any understanding of how his own personal trauma from childhood and carried through his adulthood manifested in his body's MS; what Ms. Marriott thinks about the trauma research surfacing in the years since her husband's death around the subject of MS. For instance, very early in the book, Ms. Marriott describes how her husband (Michael) had completed an extreme diet in the months before she met him, had lost a *lot* of weight, and how she was initially so attracted to him because of his slim physique. Well, isn't that noteworthy somewhere later in the book, in helping to process the difficulties of ""fitting in"" and ""being loved"" as a man, not only as an able-bodied man, but as a disabled man -- and the question of whether Ms. Marriott would've ever married Michael if he'd been his previous weight when they met? And how destructive is dieting like that on the physical body to begin with -- pointing toward all kinds of control issues and perfectionism struggles that probably weren't doing Michael's health any favors. None of that ever comes up in the book, and I am sure that even questioning these things could easily be labeled as me being ""way too hard on this book,"" because this memoir wasn't meant to be about grand ideas, like overlooked causes of disability, Michael's possible perfectionism struggles, and the impacts of societal ableism; this book was meant to be the story of one woman's life, and the book performs that job well enough.""Watching for Dragonflies"" is a competent memoir, one that I am sure many other caregivers for adults with MS can draw solace from.So much of my ability to finish the book relied on me being able to read between the lines of what was excluded: all of the things I found missing and wished had found their way onto the page.3.5 stars rounded up to four....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 21, 2023","Oct 25, 2023","Oct 21, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/80344503-watching-for-dragonflies

An uncle loaned me this book in October 2023, and I admit: I’d never heard of Peter Elbow before then. While reading this book, I did some research on composition studies, and it turns out that Elbow is a major figure in the evolving field of composition and rhetoric.I think “Writing with Power” is a good read, and I think much of what Elbow introduced in his work has been taken up by so many writing instructors across the U.S. that his ideas now pass as “the norm.” I’ve unknowingly become highly familiar with Elbow’s ideas ever since I started reading craft books in the mid-2000s. I think this book would’ve been a lot more useful to read when I was just starting out. Some of the chapters, on Audience and Feedback, in particular, are extremely relevant and necessary for writers today. A lot of writing instructors pay little to no attention to those topics, and Elbow writes with insight and clarity on the subject.Other parts of the book, I was very much less impressed with, and definitely bored by, being overly familiar with the subject matter. Had I read this book earlier in my life, I would have certainly found it more interesting.For me, “Writing with Power” was a 2-star read. I’m glad I had a chance to take a look at it, and to reflect on the evolution of how writing is taught in the United States. But this book wasn’t a good fit for me at this stage in my life.

With a rave- endorsement from Ms. Weiner, I was intrigued and eager to read ""Mom Rage."" I can truly see the value of a book like this for so many women I know, though I have to be honest and admit that many of these potential readers would be highly put off by the hyper-trans-inclusive language used by the text. The author also makes frequent use of bell hooks' chosen term: the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, without really establishing the origin of this term or defining it for the reader. Ms. Dubin instead simply takes the term as a known quantity: a given and accepted phrase that all of her readers are on board with, when I know that for many readers, this isn't the case, including the readers within the chosen market demographic for this book.I also want to point out that the author, even at the end of the book, is fixated on expressing compassion for raging mothers, including herself, but she has absolutely no understanding of Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or what is often called Childhood Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), and it makes for painful reading. When a caregiver expresses explosive, violent rage toward a child in their care -- [and I'll give two examples that are described in this book: a raging mother leaning over a crib and screaming repeatedly into an infant's face to 'shut up'; a raging mother shoving a confused and overwhelmed toddler hard enough for them to fall over and strike the back of their head on a sidewalk] -- the correct term for this behavior is 'abuse.' But Minna Dubin is completely opposed to this terminology, and does not label her raging behavior as abuse or abusive. Nor does she label any other mother or birthing person she interviewed for this book as exhibiting abusive behavior. In an interview for this book that I watched on YouTube, Ms. Dubin stated that anyone who would call her behavior 'abusive' simply ""doesn't know what they are talking about.""I do know what I am talking about, though. And this book is so massively faulty, for that very reason. Having compassion for people needs to extend both ways: to the overwhelmed adult caregivers [mothers, birthing persons, etc.] and to the underage dependents who are subjected to their caregivers' adult wrath: the violent rage that is the unprocessed shame and unprocessed trauma of an adult being inflicted upon an innocent child. Using the word ""abuse"" does not make people ""bad"" or ""immoral."" It's an important term to use so that people can heal their trauma, especially their childhood trauma. I found the book ""Mom Rage"" to be hyper-fixated on inclusive trans language and systemic structures of power, but completely lacking in any understanding of trauma, shame, and C-PTSD.Ms. Dubin also had access to a socioeconomic resource level that none of the moms and birthing persons I know in my own life could ever relate to. This is a book examining the motherhood struggles of the upper-middle class and upper class, and while that is important and valuable, it also made the book a struggle to keep reading at times.There are definitely readers who will love and champion this book, Ms. Weiner among them. I'm sad to say that this book really wasn't for me. I knew within the first twenty pages that it was going to end up solely as a market research read, and leave me contemplating things that were not at all in the text: primarily, the shortcomings of the prose, and all I found missing and needed.One star for me personally.

Rowling] is the second book in the Cormoran Strike murder-mystery series. The final third of this novel really went off the rails, and the book descended into negative-stars territory for me. I finished the novel, hoping things would turn around before I got to the end, but the trainwreck just kept on wrecking. It dealt a fatal blow for this whole series for me. I cannot force myself to read anymore of these books. What I truly loved about ""The Silkworm"" were the excerpts from 'Bombyx Mori,' the novel written by one of the characters in this story. Everything about 'Bombyx Mori' felt like the most savage skewering of Norman Mailer's work, and I was so there for it. I was ready to give ""The Silkworm"" five stars simply based on how satisfying it felt to have Mailer's novels eviscerated on this level. But the excerpts from 'Bombyx Mori' are such a tiny, tiny part of ""The Silkworm,"" and after the halfway point of the book, there are no more of them. My sole enjoyment factor ended, and what happened next was not good for me. Not at all.""The Cuckoo's Calling"" was not a fun read for me. But ""The Silkworm"" was so much worse. At least ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" followed the plot beats of a mystery novel. ""The Silkworm"" runs on contrivance, convenience, clunky authorial withholding for fake suspense, plot-pulls that felt laughable, and plot-shenanigan ridiculousness that was probably intended to be dramatic and/or exciting, but just left me rolling my eyes and shaking my head in disgust. By the time Robin showed up driving a taxi cab, this book had become all the yikes on all the bikes, and I just can't with it. This level of silliness in what is supposed to be a novel for adults is just not for me. When the WTF meter hits infinity, I am done. As far as my star-rating goes: Five stars for anything that takes Norman Mailer to task. Negative stars for 98.5% of this book. I am sick of reading about what Cormoran Strike is eating, and I am sick of his authorial pedestal, and I am sick of reading about Robin catering to his food and drink preferences to show what ""a good woman"" she is and how ""worthy"" she is of dating this man. I am clearly not the audience for this book and I am beyond turned off by this budding romantic relationship. 'Kill it with fire' stars for the choices the author made with the main villain at the end of this book. Wow, did I hate those story choices. Wow, was the exposition here something else. Wow, did it ever guarantee that I won't be reading anymore of these novels. Three stars overall.

Rowling. An adult murder-mystery, ""The Cuckoo's Calling"" is book one in the Cormoran Strike series. I was never interested in reading this book, mostly because I know murder-mysteries aren't really my thing, I always disliked the book's title, and I really disliked the cover.But a friend who loves this series convinced me to check it out, and for the sake of my market research reads, I'm glad I did. While this book certainly isn't for me, it's an excellent example of a work of commercial fiction that is perfectly attuned for the market. In short, if the prose of ""The Goldfinch,"" the love story of ""Pretty Woman,"" and the formulaic mystery plot of a Tony Hillerman novel got into bed together and had a child, the result would be ""The Cuckoo's Calling.""This novel is a spectacularly trope-laden work that hits its marks without missing a beat. The deft blend of rom-com with murder mystery is commercial fiction at its finest. There were parts of this book that certainly weren't for me, and one scene in particular took me straight into DNF territory. When Robin is caring for her drunken boss, having only been on the job for less than two weeks, I was personally so repulsed by the scene that I was ready to quit. No amount of explaining or excusing this material could ever make it salvageable for me. I was well and truly ejected from this text at that point. If I were new to a job and my boss were abusing substances on the clock and after hours, I am not going to repeat my childhood of caretaking alcoholics to cater to him. I wasn't even aware of what a massive trigger this kind of ""romantic behavior"" was for me until I found myself physically sickened by Cormoran and Robin's interaction in this scene. Being a codependent to a drunkard... oh hell no. Just hell the f*ck no.But I did understand how the scene was *supposed* to work for the reader: Robin is displaying her properly womanly duties to care for an honorable, deserving man who is in need of her compassionately feminine ministrations. And Robin performs her gendered task with aplomb. Cormoran also performs his role as ruggedly singular badass of virile masculinity with stoic good cheer. His substance abuse exposes his vulnerability, and provides a way for Robin to illustrate to Cormoran and the reader that she is an especially competent woman. Despite my personal DNF point, there are many things I genuinely liked about this book. Cormoran's backstory and his disability top the list. I loved the fashion designer Guy's short appearance. He was a brilliant character, and I was laughing aloud during his scene.  But a lot of the popular tropes in commercial fiction are just wasted on me. I feel neutral toward them at best, and actively hate them at worst. There were certain tropes and genre conventions that really turned me off in this book. The paint-by-numbers Hillerman-style plot with the high-action villain reveal had me shaking my head, reminding me exactly why I stay away from the mystery genre. Three stars as a market research read. This book wasn't for me, but I can certainly see the appeal. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 12, 2023","Aug 16, 2023","Aug 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16160797-the-cuckoo-s-calling

In 2023, a friend pressed her hardback copy into my hands and asked me to give it a read.Sadly, this just wasn't a good experience for me. I found the unchecked racism, classism, and ageism in this text hella problematic (by which I mean: I was bothered by the -ism's that were in the authorial/narrative content, *not* the historical content), and the spectacularly ageist conclusion of this novel left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. Everything about the ""river gypsies"" as they're described in this book: classist, ridiculous, and inspired nothing in me but rage.Everything about the black midwife being described as an incompetent blusterbuss and a total shithead: thanks for the racism, book. Everything about the ableist description of the one white male rapist having a stutter and hideous teeth ""like a beaver"" that sets him apart from all the good able-bodied white people: seriously, I just can't. F*ck all of this. Everything about the one black male character being described as ""big and scary"" and immediately inspiring rape fears in the twelve-year-old ""river gypsy"" who has already been sexually assaulted by a white man, but does not ever fear that other white men will rape her, only this one ""big and scary"" black man: honestly, f*ck off, book. Everything about a twelve-year-old ""river gypsy"" in 1939 thinking and acting like a hyper-classist version of a 40-something white woman via 2010s America imagining herself in the girl's place: no thank you. Being in Rill's POV was excruciating to me. The setup of the story itself was also loaded with plot holes and contrivances which did not appeal to me. I know the author had to deus-ex-machina her way into the schmaltzy Hallmark-channel-appropriate content in the last third of the book, but that doesn't mean the novel in any way gave me a taste for the saccharine. The narrative breaks with all reality made this book read more like fantasy to me, not historical fiction. The depiction of nursing homes and dementia are all pulled from Hallmark-generated visual media. Sanitized, cutesy, and completely inaccurate. Writing like this does not get my vote. Even the initial impulse that led to the protagonist (Avery) researching her grandmother's past was simply unrealistic as hell. While attending a political event for her father, taking place at a nursing home neither of them has ever visited before, a strange elderly woman tugs on Avery's arm, calls her ""Fern,"" and this brief interaction inspires Avery to begin questioning her grandmother's entire life. Despite the fact that her grandmother is not even housed in this nursing home, but in a 'Memory Care Unit' at an uber-posh mansion in another town. This kind of suspension of disbelief worked for a great many readers, and while I wish I could claim myself one of them, I hopped aboard the WTF train for this ride.For some spectacularly excellent ageism, I give you the final conclusions of what this text thinks about old people, as illuminated by both POV characters, Rill Foss/May Crandall and Avery Stafford.From May:""'To look at me now, you would think I'd never understood the secret [of the music of life]. This music of old age... it isn't made for dancing. It's so... lonely. You're a burden to everyone.'""That passage was shared in spoken dialogue to Avery on page 315.Avery immediately reflects on this information:""The music of old age is difficult to hear when it's playing for someone you love.""That passage represents the great wisdom of Avery's interior monologue on page 315.Look, if this kind of ageist content works for you, then power to you. For me, I hate it with a kill-it-with-fire level of rage. I also want to note Avery's unspoken narcissism right here: ""old age music"" isn't ""difficult to hear"" when it's playing for old people Avery *doen't* love, apparently, because for those old people, Avery simply does not give a damn. And you know: fair. This is the way a lot of people are. They are ageist on this level, and they honestly don't give a sh*t about anyone but the people who add value to their own lives, especially if those people are wealthy old ladies with a large inheritance to leave their granddaughters.But I'm not gonna get behind this kind of messaging and call it ""art."" This content is the hegemonic domain of the (ableist) white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, and I am not a fan.Negative stars for me personally.

I'm glad this book exists, and I hope Greg Marshall keeps publishing books. This author is a wonderful person. I wish him all the best with his life, and with his publishing career.**********Published in June 2023, ""Leg: The Story of a Limb and the Boy Who Grew from It,"" is the debut memoir of Greg Marshall. The book details Marshall's childhood, his burgeoning sexuality and adult sex life, and the lovingly chaotic, label-withholding atmosphere of his home life. That label-withholding atmosphere included keeping the words 'cerebral palsy' out of the Marshall home. The word 'autism,' it turns out, was also banned in his youth. Marshall and his younger sister were told they were 'normal' and 'just like everyone else,' and this attitude was strictly enforced and upheld by everyone in the family. While I appreciate that this book exists, and I am truly glad that Marshall had the courage and grit to pen his story, ""Leg"" was not a good read for me. I found this book to be overloaded with disparate information and analytically lacking to the point of feeling immature, and even juvenile. I believe ""Leg"" would've been better served as three different books, maybe more. The topics in this book needed more room to breathe, more room for reflection, more space for emotional depth. There was still so much unchecked, overt ableism on display in these pages that it made for very painful reading for me. Marshall was raised in an affluent home, a home that employed a ""cleaning lady"" and a family that regularly vacationed in Hawaii, etc. His family's ability to make sure Marshall 'passed' as 'able-bodied' for the first thirty years of his life was largely a function of how much money they had to facilitate their denial. None of which is put into words in this book; the reader is left to puzzle out the truth for themselves, putting that information into words that Marshall does not use. The majority of the page count of ""Leg"" is actually devoted to Marshall's life as a gay man, and the many challenges he has overcome in his search for romantic intimacy and connection. In penning this book, it seems that Marshall longed to shed his societal role as a polite, mannered man and allow his writer's voice to revel in sarcasm, dark comedy, and graphic, gratuitous details of gay sex, body ailments, and all manner of unsettling content that is often completely taboo in 'polite company.' While I am often okay with grimdark depictions of physical details, the sarcastic tone just didn't work for me here. I did not find this book funny. I rode various waves of horror and revulsion on every page of this memoir. Marshall grew up with an adopted Native American sister, and the issues of racism and Indigenous adoptions are as unexplored in this book as the issues of class, as well as the generational trauma that contributed to the mother's lifelong battle with cancer and the father's sudden death from ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). ""Leg"" read as a disjointed series of gratuitous spectacles, each one designed to be more shocking than the next. The book is not at all chronological, and pages and sections can be read completely out of order without losing any meaning. Personally, this memoir is a one or two-star DNF for me, because I would not have finished this had I not felt compelled to do so. The author will be visiting my local bookstore this month, and the bookstore staff asked me to help promote the event. I'm happy to give the bookstore a hand, and as far as this book goes, I think it's important that disabled people with different experiences are sharing their stories. I listened to an author Q&A on YouTube today, and it was clear that the majority of Marshall's audience were gay men. I do think ""Leg"" is a great read for gay men who share Marshall's experience of struggling to accept their sexuality, fear of AIDS, and coming out in their youth. Also, the graphic details that Marshall shares about gay sex must be a relief for certain people to read about, when society mostly shuns that level of honesty. Nothing about this book felt like it was written for me, and I just don't think I'm the right audience, in any way, for this memoir. But I will give it 3.5 stars and round up to 4. I'm glad it exists for the people who need it.

I would say a solid seventy percent of this book is about Jonathan's life, and the other thirty percent is Nick Flynn describing how miserable his childhood was. There is almost zero emotional insight in this novel. Unexplained details did not add up, leaving me baffled by the author's behavior and choices. Flynn emphasizes his extreme poverty as a child, and shows the reader flashes of his life with his mentally ill mother and brother in a grim, impoverished existence, and on the next page he's telling the reader he backpacked through Europe at age seventeen, attended a high-profile university, and later, he talks about traveling in Europe, even living in Paris with his girlfriend, in his twenties? How is this possible? I don't understand how Flynn made the jump between poverty, his own childhood addictions, motorcycle accidents, and crime, to suddenly being free to travel the globe as a teenager -- which takes a considerable amount of money and planning to do.Also, there is no closure at the end of the book. The memoir just bluntly ends. If a reader is looking for some heartfelt takeaways from Flynn's journey through life, this memoir will not deliver. This book was thoroughly not for me.I had hoped to enjoy this a lot more, since I, too, had a chronically homeless alcoholic father. But a paper grocery bag is capable of more self-reflection than this memoir is. Negative stars. I would not recommend this book to anyone.Three stars because I recognize that there's a fan base for this book, and other readers have seemed to enjoy Flynn's dude-bro depiction of his F-up-father-as-spectacle.

I discovered Ram Dass by listening to Jack Kornfield lectures, and then reading one of Kornfield's books (Kornfield quotes Ram Dass a lot). I also read a book by Mark Epstein, ""The Zen of Therapy,"" in which he describes visiting Ram Dass in Hawaii before Ram Dass died (in 2019). ""Be Here Now"" is the most famous of Ram Dass's books, so I took the plunge and checked this out. As Ram Dass himself would say: ""this book is quite a trip.""It's full of hippie/drug culture language of the sixties, and a large part of the book is handwritten text over a lot of wild drawings on what appears to be the heavy brown paper that brown paper grocery bags were once made with. I'd like to point out that there's a strong overlap between Ram Dass's advice in ""Be Here Now"" and Gabor Maté's advice for healing trauma in ""The Myth of Normal."" I've never heard Maté quote Ram Dass before, but he does quote Jack Kornfield in ""The Myth of Normal,"" which makes me assume Maté has probably read ""Be Here Now.""The similarities were fascinating. Ram Dass and Maté are sharing the same message, encouraging their readers to let go of their egos and identities so they can tap into the true being inside them, the being who can experience peace and joy in any circumstance. While ""Be Here Now"" wasn't my favorite read, I can certainly see how important it is, and why this book served as such a springboard and major entry point for a lot of Westerners seeking enlightenment.

I did enjoy Shapiro's essay. My favorites were the essays by Cheryl Strayed and Ayelet Waldman. I've read the work of at least half of these authors, and found myself discovering new books to read.There are so many people self-publishing memoirs these days, and I've read at least thirty or so in the past few years. When writers pay no attention to craft, and are simply publishing their journal or diary pages, or publishing text that sounds like the kind of unloading I assume people do in a therapist's office, it makes for very mind-numbingly boring, painful reading. I'm really glad that people can unload in their diaries, or unload to their therapists. Sadly, however, this kind of stuff is not riveting. Listening to it is literally a job -- a job that counselors receive monetary payment for doing -- and I want a book to entertain me, not force me to do unpaid labor. The memoirists in ""Why We Write About Ourselves"" clearly understand that. So much of their advice consistently stresses paying attention to storytelling: that a successful memoir is a work of successful storytelling. Over and over, these authors state that journal or diary pages alone do not make a memoir. Hearing these published authors consistently stress this concept healed the battered part of my mind that has slogged through so many badly written self-published memoirs in the past few years. Reading a stranger's diary pages is like taking a mental beating. It also makes you appreciate crafted memoirs all the more.I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone who is actually seeking advice on writing memoir. I also know that people who believe their diary pages are worth millions of dollars will never touch a book like this.

Although I had the sixth book in my hand, I could not force myself to read it. I skipped it, and skipped number seven, too, and tried giving number eight a shot. It was the last novella in this series that my library owned. I read the first third of this book, the pages of which follow the main character (Antsy) up through the moment she finally passes through her magical door. I've been so unimpressed with the magical worlds in these books that I already knew Antsy's world would either be: 1. bizarre and depressing as hell, or 2. exist merely to set up worldbuilding stuff for future books in the series. Either answer was not enough to make me keep reading. I just couldn't do it to myself.So I skipped to the end, and read the last two chapters, which describe Antsy's return to the human world on earth. The ending of this book was so unsatisfying, unrealistic, anti-climactic, and just straight-up not good that I'm really glad I DNF'd when I did.""Lost in the Moment and Found"" marks the end of my journey reading the Wayward Children novellas. While I do think the time I spent reading these books as market research was productive, I did not personally enjoy my time on this sojourn and I'm glad that it's over.There is a relentless misery and despair that runs through these books. The relationships among the characters all feel so emotionless, and that was especially true in books five and eight. Book one featured so much violence and horror, all of these novellas feature a string of horrible and triggering things (body mutilation, murder, gratuitous corpse mutilation and corpse disposal, etc.), but it isn't until book eight that the reader is given a content/trigger warning, because an adult in this book unbuttons the top button of Antsy's nightgown. I personally found the long description of Antsy's father dying in front of her, and her traumatic experience of being alone with his corpse, far more difficult to read about than the stepfather unbuttoning the top button of her nightgown. And the callous disposal of the corpses of classmates in book one was definitely more horrific than anything in book eight, unpleasant as book eight definitely was. We live in a world in which students are regularly forced to survive the brutal murder of their classmates in front of them at school. Why that is treated as non-triggering in book one, but the mere threat of child grooming gets a content warning in book eight, is impossible for me to justify. I want to say 'make it make sense' but I know the ""sense"" I am looking for here is just ""domination culture"" and ""hush, now, this is patriarchy"" reasoning that aggravates me to no end.I really wanted to read other books by McGuire, but at this point, I just don't think I can. Her authorial worldview -- which is made quite explicit by the presence of an omniscient narrative voice in all of these Wayward Children novellas -- is simply intolerable to me. McGuire might be one of those authors who consistently dazzle me when it comes to their personal statements and nonfiction work, but I cannot get on board with their fiction. I truly love McGuire's openness and honesty in all the interviews I have listened to her give on YouTube (a few, more than once). She's one of my favorite people.But these Wayward Children books can all take a long walk off a short pier. They are most definitely not for me.Three stars....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 20, 2023","May 22, 2023","May 20, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/60784912-lost-in-the-moment-and-found

Not only am I reading the backstory of an a-hole, but she is a dead a-hole in the thru-story, too. Double ugh. But I persevered and read this. Lundy's magical world is called the Goblin Market, and in this hellhole, it's as if Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" of the market were applied to all human relationships, rendering all emotions and human connection as market transactions ruled by market forces. I was pressed and disgusted but willing to keep reading because McGuire's commitment to this trashfire was legit. Even more horrific to me: in the Goblin Market, no one can opt out of this system. Everything is transactional in the Goblin Market, including love. I was straight-up appalled by this world and could not wait to get the F out of this place. As anyone who has ever raised a child or struggle-bussed their way through a marriage can attest, there is no such thing as ""fair value"" in human relationships, and the fact that this magical world imposed bizarre market transactions on caring and love was totally sickening. I think Lundy made the right choice to peace out of this world. Her earth-bound human family did not operate in this kind of transactional manner, and it was easy to see why regaining her human relationships felt so much more rewarding to her than this effed up Adam Smith wet dream.I definitely did not enjoy this book, but I didn't despise it, either. Recommended for anyone who loves ""The Wealth of Nations,"" neoliberalism, and longs to infuse capitalism into every intimate detail of their personal lives. The Goblin Market is here for you.

I really didn't like that Chapter Two stars a naked girl named Rini, and there is talk of her genitals. My issue is not with naked young women per se, but simply that YA books traffic in putting naked young women in scene, exposing their nude bodies to the reader for no other reason than to have their bodies exposed. The trope asserted itself here, and I recognized it for what it was, and things went downhill from there.Later, it's made clear that in Rini's world, clothing and armor made of sugar is equivalent to clothing and armor made of other substances. So why Rini's dress immediately melted off truly felt like an ass-pull plot device just to get Rini naked. Which, I get it: readers want to see naked girls. And talk about naked girls. And fixate on naked girls. This is how power operates. This stuff just doesn't work for me.Solid three stars.****spoilers below****I was hoping to see a badass fat mermaid doing badass things, but Cora occupies her human body for the entire duration of this novel. There are no mermaid action scenes in this book.And even though Cora saved lives and did a bunch of warrior stuff as a mermaid in the Trenches (which the reader does not get to see), that experience didn't fundamentally change who she is as a human, because even with ""her scales under her skin,"" and with her bright mermaid hair, Cora's thinking is completely fixated on her weight and on her human appearance as a fat young woman. She's also continuously making assumptions about everyone constantly judging her for her weight, when the only character who actually does judge her this way is the supreme villain of the story, who doesn't appear until near the very end of the book.I didn't feel emotionally invested in any of these characters, and since they were all on a quest to help a stranger (Rini), and save another teenage girl who Cora did not know or care about whatsoever (Sumi), the emotional stakes felt very lacking in this novel. Cora didn't even feel pain or grief after Nadya (who is supposedly her only friend) sacrifices herself to help with the quest. Cora might as well have watched someone toss a stone into the water, for all the sense of ""loss"" that existed when Nadya left the group. There was a very long passage of text, right after the villain has been vanquished and the main story action has ended, that really dragged for me, since the characters do nothing but have a long conversation, and perform a lot of authorial worldbuilding in dialogue. I wasn't a fan, and I knew it was just in there so McGuire could flesh out her story metaphysics a bit more. It made me really glad that I was late to the party with this series, and I can read these books close together, without long delays in between each story.My favorite part about this book was the illustration of Layla the baker on page 152. That is such a gorgeous piece of art! I enjoyed the descriptions of Layla preparing a body made of baked goods for Sumi, before sliding her into the oven to cook. I also really enjoy my own personal idea of how much more exciting this novel could have been, the possibilities that were there, rather than the reality of what I read.This book read pretty fast, aside from that long conversation about story metaphysics. That chapter made me want to DNF. But I'm glad I kept reading, and got to Layla. She was my favorite character in this novel.I really disliked the final chapter, in which Nadya receives a magical hand/lower arm before returning to her magical world. Cora wasn't given a ""slender/appropriately thin"" body before going to the Trenches, and other characters don't have their own ""lacks"" filled before they go to their worlds. So why is Nadya's missing limb any different? Which I only pose as a rhetorical question. I think we all know the answer, and it starts with an ""a.""The entire tone of this book is so much lighter than the first two novels that ""Beneath the Sugar Sky"" read much more like middle grade to me, rather than YA. Since the first book had such a horrifically high level of gore, I was relieved that the third book had none of it. It brightened my reading experience a lot.I've already started book four.

Thanks to the AIDS Published in 1984, ""You Can Heal Your Life,"" by Louise Hay, is the seminal work that put New Age spirituality into the mainstream. Thanks to the AIDS epidemic and an appearance on Oprah, Hay's book found a huge audience. According to Hay, each person on earth manifests (brings into existence) everything that exists in their life, good or bad. Having a mindset of abundance will bring good things into your life. Having a lot of anger and resentment will bring you awful things, including diseases and death. While this is an important, life-changing message of empowerment for many people, it also puts the fault of every pain and torment onto each individual as well. This blame-the-victim ethos can either feel entirely empowering or incredibly harmful, even toxic, depending upon who the listener is.I personally find the doctrine of complete manifestation to be highly poisonous, and reading this book was very painful for me. I do understand that this spiritual belief system gives each of us a powerful message of control, letting us believe that we have chosen everything in our own lives, that all agency lies within us for every single thing we experience. Hay (who died in 2017) has admitted in interviews that she does believe people who are violently murdered have chosen their own deaths, and that the victims who died in the Holocaust chose to be killed by the Nazis. I honestly just... can't with this. To put it mildly. I believe there is no stronger message for maintaining the status quo than to say to everyone, as a spiritual doctrine: ""We all of us wanted life to be exactly this way, so there is no problem here, not anywhere, just mind your own business and manifest your own life, the power is solely in your hands, so if you die from industrial waste, police violence, or a serial killer, that was your choice, so there is no need to get angry about it or complain.""I think that it is possible to talk about the impact of our emotional and mental health on our physical bodies without resorting to victim-blaming on this level. Yes, we each need to take responsibility for our own thoughts and actions. The thoughts we think about ourselves have a direct and immediate impact upon our physical bodies. But to claim that I have the power to control other people's thoughts and actions is false. If a company poisons my drinking water with chemical waste tonight, they are making that choice because there was a financial incentive for them to dump their industrial waste illegally, not because I manifested suffering a future death from cancer and they granted my spiritual request. I would never, ever request such a thing. No one would. Human beings are complicated, because all of us have complicated, idiosyncratic reactions to trauma. We carry our trauma narratives with us, all our lives, and either we heal or do not heal, either we change our narratives or we don't. But unlike Hay, I do not see the benefit of blaming people for the harm they have suffered. To see so many babies and children harmed so cruelly, and to know that all of our traumas leave permanent impacts within us, following us all into our adulthoods, is to know -- for me personally -- that people are innocent, in the purest sense of that word. So Hay and I dramatically part ways. She implores her reader to repeat positive affirmations hundreds of times per day, drowning out whatever their self-talk might be with positive mantras. Doing this will manifest good things in your life. In contrast to Hay, I believe that when we feel pain, we must pause and examine it, give it time to communicate what it is trying to tell us, whatever it is, not just drown it out with chants of positivity. But we're all different, when it comes to what works or does not work for us, what is helpful and what is not. ""You Can Heal Your Life"" is not my jam, and New Age spirituality just isn't for me. But I know people who love this book, people who have told me this book has helped save their lives, and I am grateful for that. One star read for me personally. It astounds me that I was even able to finish this book. Three stars because I am certainly not the intended audience. Recommended as a seminal work of New Age spirituality. This book really is the OG, the big kahuna of modern New Thought. That this spirituality was created by white people, and dovetails so nicely with manifest destiny, is not a coincidence. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 29, 2023","Apr 30, 2023","Apr 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/907306.You_Can_Heal_Your_Life

The cover immediately snaggPublished in April 2022, ""Nowhere for Very Long,"" by Brianna Madia, is a book with one heck of an effective sales package. The cover immediately snagged my attention at the bookstore, as did the title and the book's promised content: the memoir of a woman living a life of adventure. I bought a copy that day, and started reading that night.Sadly, I feel very led astray. This book is a collection of slightly modified Instagram posts from Brianna Madia, a #VanLife influencer with a huge number of followers. Which was not how this book was advertised on the back jacket copy. If I had known this was an Insta-book, I would not have bought it, read it, or had anything to do with it. I think Insta-books are best when the images that made the Insta-influencer famous are a part of the publication. And in the case of ""Nowhere for Very Long,"" the text stands alone (apart from that gorgeous cover). I would have DNF'd this book after about twenty pages, because this memoir is outstandingly not for me. But I ended up treating this text like a market research read, and I also looked up more information about Madia online. I quickly discovered that this woman is one super controversial figure.Between the publication of this book and the time in which I read it (late April 2023, one year later), a lot of stuff has occurred with Madia. She has decided to ""go after her haters"" on Reddit, people who got pissed off at her after they found out she omitted to tell people that she and her husband ran over their own dog in 2018, and Madia was forced to come clean with the truth in 2020. (Two years later.) This was all well after the GoFundMe for the dog's care raised over one hundred thousand dollars.Madia ended up with a Reddit hive of haters, and she also ended up divorced. Madia hired a personal detective to uncover the real-life identities of the Reddit commenters, and she's recently started posting their names and locations online (on her Instagram page, and on a YouTube channel she started). She is also selling merch to celebrate this occasion, so fans can buy her ""Fuck Around Find Out"" memorabilia online. The YouTuber KeyasWorld posted a four-hour video about how messed up this all is. Other YouTubers fully support Madia's choices. Anyone aware of the issue has probably already picked a side. Regardless of whether you're a fan of Madia, a hater on Reddit, or someone who isn't even on Instagram (like me), this whole situation is some grade-A drama, and buying this book signed me up for a show that is absolutely bananas. Personally, I think there is an entire story here that wasn't in this memoir at all. A story about Madia learning to use substances to soothe herself as a child, a story about Madia turning to social media to soothe herself as an adult and losing her marriage over it, a story about blaming the accident with her dog for the end of her marriage. I felt like the more I studied Brianna and Keith Madia online (including reading Keith's public statement on Reddit), the more I could put the secrets and hidden information and the darker truths together for myself. Deconstructing this story was so much more work than I ever imagined it would be. As to the memoir itself, I found it shallow and dull. Told in vignettes that are not in chronological order, it was a disjointed, needlessly confusing read. The text definitely assumes that the reader is already aware of Madia as an Instagrammer, and readers who have never seen her gorgeous photography are going to be at a loss.On its own, this book was a slog for me, and I personally would not recommend it. But as an experience of Instagram drama (by which I mean: drama amongst the very online), Madia's story is a crash course in the perils of fame. Once a person has begun to make money by selling themselves as an image, by making themselves into a brand and marketing themselves as a brand to complete strangers, all freaking hell can break loose. And the total hell of a capitalism nightmare has broken loose on Brianna Madia's life. I would not want this life for anything. I think that spending all of our time on social media can really damage the quality of our relationships in real life. I think Madia's success on Instagram came at a very steep cost, a cost I would never, ever want to pay. Nothing about this kind of Insta life looks appealing to me whatsoever.I also really hope that Madia gets the mental health assistance she needs. From everything I have observed in what she has posted online, she remains deeply troubled, struggling with thoughts of self-harm, and I truly hope she gets to a better headspace as soon as possible.As far as my  rating is concerned: Madia's personal life is a five-star cautionary tale. Her memoir, however, was a one-star/kept-wanting-to-DNF reading experience.

Since I read that first book earlier this year, this  will contain spoilers for book one in the series. Please do not read this  if you do not want to be spoiled for book one, thanks.**************************Jack and Jill are white upper-middle class twin girls, and while they were not especially likeable characters in book one, I didn't actively hate them until about halfway through the book, when the murders of their fellow students begin. Jack behaved extremely callously toward the dead, and right after she does a kind act, and makes hot chocolate for all of her friends, Jill interrupts the little party in the attic, and it's a clear signal to the reader that Jill is, in fact, the serial killer. I actively hated Jill, at that point, and condemned her completely by the end of the novel. Jill's actions are entirely heinous, and any sense of justice in the story is completely lacking. Reading ""Down Among the Sticks and Bones"" is all about the backstory of a serial killer, and that is super not my favorite, to say the least. ""Down Among the Sticks and Bones"" is entirely sympathetic toward Jack and Jill, and paints them as being completely the victims of their parents' emotional abuse. In no way is the reader meant to understand that Jack and Jill both made choices to conform to their parents' expectations. The very idea that Jack and Jill had any agency in their conformity is completely erased in order to further the message that they are pure victims, and therefore, their horrible actions are sympathetic, understandable, and the reader can continue to root for them. If other readers want to buy into that messaging: fair. That's the kind of subjective request a novel is allowed to make of its reader, and we either do or do not grant that request. I'm definitely in the minority camp of ""I do not grant this request"" and I definitely have a mindset that Jack and Jill still had agency over their lives, even as children. While I am sympathetic toward them as children, and sympathetic toward the horrors of conformity, the emotional abuse they suffered does not excuse or justify Jill's behavior, or Jack's protection and maintenance of Jill's behavior. The provided backstory of parental emotional abuse doesn't even explain why Jill becomes a murderer. Jill has a massive level of entitlement, and honestly, so does Jack. Both girls place their own lives well above the lives of the villagers they encounter in book two, and it was really sickening to me. Of course, Jack is meant to be viewed as the sympathetic hero of book two, much as she was in book one. The idea that Jack has any role to play in the deaths of fellow students in book one is kindly brushed under the rug. But the truth is, Jack and Jill were raised in an upper-middle class household, and they view themselves as special, as superior, to the people beneath them in class. Jack can feel pain when Jill murders someone Jack loves, but Jack feels no pain when random villagers are murdered, or when Jill murders their classmates at school. Reading this book demands that I operate with the same level of callousness as the protagonists do, and I just cannot exist in that worldview. It's like being told to guzzle acid that melts my soft tissue as I drink it. I love the song ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" but that song never tries to erase the devil's essential devilness: that the evil being done is, in fact, evil. You sing along wanting to see him defeated, not condoned. But ""Down Among the Sticks and Bones"" operates with a different mentality: it truly does want you to have sympathy for the devil, and that sympathy comes at the cost of dehumanizing other characters in the story. My criticisms aside, I thought book two was much, much better than the first book. If I told myself to stop thinking about the plot developments of book one, this was an easier read altogether. I did not enjoy book two, but I didn't actively hate it, either. I didn't have to keep forcing myself not to DNF, the way I did with book one. I thought it was fascinating that the huge hook in book one was the central main character (Nancy, I think was her name) returning to her future husband, the Lord of the Dead. And book two features two young women who also want to return to the men who own and control them: the Master (a vampire) and a ""doctor"" who is more like a wizard, and practices raising the dead/restoring life to the dead much like Jesus did in The New Testament. All three of these women are owned, controlled, and submitting themselves to powerful men. Men who have a powerful amount of control over life and death. The Lord of the Dead and the Master are both written as royalty. The doctor who owns Jack was supposedly chosen by her by choice, but since her choice was to be owned by either a vampire or this doctor character, that is simply a choice between the two powerful male owners.On the meta-level, these novels certainly have a lot to say about patriarchy and the total lack of female agency on the level that matters: the ability to be free of male domination. The story wants to have me believe that these young women are boldly controlling their own fates, and yet, by the story's own logic, that conclusion is false on every level. The fantasy worlds of this novel are even more embedded in patriarchy than the contemporary U.S. world is. Which is another interesting choice, on behalf of the author, and is most definitely the reason why these books are so popular. As to some of the harmful tropes in book two: since Jack is a lesbian, and the hero of this story who not only survives to the end, but is also the hero of her future story (in book one), I don't think ""Down Among the Sticks and Bones"" qualifies for the Kill Your Gays trope, but it certainly qualifies for the Kill Your Fatties trope, as the murdered character is the only named ""fat"" person in the story. I definitely was not a fan. I also know that Seanan McGuire herself has dealt with a horrible amount of fat-shaming as an author, and so writing a fat love interest who dies did not come from a place of harmful representation, but from trying to have representation without fully understanding the consequences of having a single character from that marginalized or oppressed group in the story. For fans of this novel, ""Down Among the Sticks and Bones"" is an exploration of feminine gender roles, and the brutal consequences of parental expectations and parental emotional abuse. My own takeaways are idiosyncratic, arbitrary, and very much informed by the work of class theory, feminist theory, and other such icky stuff, and while I want very much to love the work of Seanan McGuire, I am massively disappointed by these books. They are beautifully written, on a sentence level. On a storytelling level, they make me long for death. One star, for me personally.Three stars because I know I am not the right audience for this book, and never will be....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Apr 21, 2023","Apr 22, 2023","Apr 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31450908-down-among-the-sticks-and-bones

But it most definitely is not. There were good parts in this book. But on balance, there was a lot more that soured me on this book than the good stuff.I'm glad I pushed myself to finish, because Epstein's visit with Ram Dass in Hawai'i was interesting. The world of contemporary U.S. Zen Buddhism is definitely a small one, and while I'm not part of that world, I did enjoy having an insider's view of Ram Dass. Sounds like the guy had quite the ego and was very much an asshole for a large chunk of his life. As to the therapy Dr. Epstein offered his patients: I would *not* want this kind of therapy, because it's clear Epstein went into fix-it mode with his clients, sometimes raising his voice and yelling at them to do things. In my experience, this is exactly how overwhelmed relatives and friends treat me; I would not pay money for this crap. The kind of therapy I would want is a safe place to have my own reality and choices witnessed and understood, not have a stranger's advice dictated to me with a raised voice and harsh condemnation. If I want that kind of shit, I'll just call a relative or a friend who doesn't have space for me in the midst of their own hardships. In modern America, there is no shortage of overwhelmed individuals going around. In 2023, I've had to go on my own personal journey of what it means to leave fix-it mode completely, and while I cannot say it's been a pleasant journey, I can say with certainty that I would never pay money to someone so they can shout unsolicited ""advice"" at me. Like, I cannot ""f*ck off"" enough with that shit. I ended this book feeling really, really glad that I've never been a patient of Epstein's. And also: if this is what ""good therapy"" looks like, then I never, ever want to get therapy. I'd fling myself off the side of the Grand Canyon before I ever paid money to be treated like this. Personally, I believe that the best choices that any of us can ever make already reside *within* us, and I think that if I paid for therapy, I would hope that someone would have the strength to help me find my own truth, not shout their own ""answers"" at me from across a desk. I would not pay for a therapist to ""fix my life"" for me, but to help me understand my own life -- and largely, Epstein was in fix-it mode, running his own ego-agenda with his patients, and while that might work for some people, it most certainly would not work for me.""The Zen of Therapy"" helped me see how drastically different the work of Jack Kornfield and Gabor Maté is from mainstream therapy, and that the difference has to do with their internal set-points for understanding their own lives. I'm really glad that more and more people are seeking counseling to better their lives, and I hope that Epstein's patients all see themselves as having benefited from their therapy. For me personally, I just distance myself from modern counseling even further. While I do think Epstein's book is far and away better than ""Maybe You Should Talk to Someone,"" I still wouldn't rank this book as life-changing or necessary. I also think it's strange that therapists are writing books about their client sessions, which are supposed to be confidential, in order to shine a light on what good counselors they are.

A large section of this book examines the modern meatpacking industry, the impacts of moving plants into areas without unions, making sure unions cannot form, and then hiring undocumented illiterate immigrants to work jobs that regularly maim and kill people, all without any government oversight and zero consequences.

This novel sold millions of copies, and remains an enduring commercial success. If you need receipts for these claims, please read the 2022 nonfiction book, ""Unmask Alice,"" by Rick Emerson. I first learned of this book in 2018 or so, when my younger sister mentioned the title to me as a book I should probably read for market research. I'm glad I read this novel, though I definitely hated the experience of reading ""Go Ask Alice"" with a ""kill it with fire"" level of loathing, and it overall depressed me that this book is still so popular with tweens and teens to this day. What Sparks does outstandingly well was to utilize the safety of that ""by anonymous"" author name and delve into the truth of how emotionally immature people think. The self-hatred, the black-and-white thinking, the constant borderline-type mental splits between happy highs and extremely low lows: all the cognitive distortions are here, beautifully recorded as fictional diary entries from a fictitious fifteen-year-old girl, a teenager who seems both drawn from the headlines and shaped by Sparks's own personal life. With a big dash of dystopian fantasy thrown in, just for kicks. This novel presents drug users as a bunch of treacherous criminals who craftily and secretly poison people with drugs at parties, as well as in the privacy of their own homes, in their workplace, and wherever else they can drug someone's food and drink. According to this book, drug users engage in this behavior for no other reason than to turn us all into addicts, just like them. The narrator is first given LSD in a soft drink at a party. This initial experience quickly sends the narrator looking for more and more drugs. As a result of her spiraling addiction, she runs away from home twice, and both times, her loving family retrieves her and cares for her and helps her get back to her normal life. During the times when the narrator is away from home, she is brutally raped and prostitutes herself for more drugs. While at home, she sells drugs for a boyfriend on school grounds, and sells to children as young as nine and ten years old. After the second time the narrator is returned home, she has finally resolved to stay away from drugs for good, and her cravings are totally gone. But the other drug users will not leave her alone. They hound her, harass her, and make her life a living hell, until one day, they poison some chocolate-covered peanuts at a neighbor's house. When the narrator shows up to babysit her neighbor's infant, she eats the poisoned food, and the LSD she ingests makes her temporarily insane. The narrator screams uncontrollably for hours, shreds the skin on her hands and face, rips out some fingernails, pulls out her hair on her head in huge chunks, breaks her toes, and bashes her head into a wall repeatedly until she falls into a coma.The narrator wakes up days later, in a hospital. She is being given excellent medical care. But unfortunately, the drug users who poisoned her have all lied to the police, telling the cops that the narrator was selling drugs when she wasn't, and now the narrator is facing legal trouble. Then the narrator is placed in a mental ward for a long period of time, until her family can convince the courts that the narrator is innocent and that someone slipped her the LSD, that she wasn't selling drugs and she didn't seek out the LSD on her own.The narrator is eventually released back home, and she returns to her regular life for a long period of time, being a Good Girl, a good daughter with a college guy who loves her and a bright future ahead of her as a mother and wife.Then the novel abruptly ends, and the reader is told, in an Epilogue, that the narrator was found dead in her home three weeks later, maybe from suicide, no one knows. As an example of the prose in this book, here is a passage from pages 77-78, during the period of time in which the narrator has run away from home for the first time, and is living in San Francisco with her friend Chris:""Last night was the worst night of my shitty, rotten, stinky, dreary fucked-up life. There were only four of us, and Shelia and Rod, her current 'boyfriend,' introduced us to heroin. At first we were a little afraid, but they convinced us that the horror stories were just so many American myths -- ha! But I guess I was pretty excited and the truth is I really couldn't wait when I was watching them set up. Smack is a great sensation, different from anything I'd ever had before. I felt gentle and drowsy and wonderfully soft like I was floating above reality and the mundane things were lost forever in space. But just before I was too out of it to notice what was going on, I saw Shelia and that cocksucker she goes with lighting up and setting out Speed. I remember wondering why they were getting high when they had just set us out on this wonderful low, and it wasn't until later that I realized that the dirty sonofabitches had taken turns raping us and treating us sadistically and brutally. That had been their planned strategy all along, the low-class shit eaters.When Chris and I finally came down, we crippled our way back to the apartment and talked for a long time. We've had it! The garbage that goes with drugs makes the price too goddamned high for anyone to pay. This time we are really going to watch out for each other and help each other. I had condemned Richie for being a frigging homo, but maybe I should have given even that mother a break. With the shit he was on everyday, it's no wonder he was out of control."" This book does an excellent job of linking drug use with homosexuality, showing the reader that drug use causes queer sex, and that queer sex is perverted and wrong. The homophobia in this book is on point, as is the ageism, classism, and the fat-shaming. If you crave a book that expresses a lot of unchecked hatred toward queer people, old people, poor people, and fat people, this novel will definitely fulfill your desires. There is also plenty of ableism in this book, heaps and heaps of it. ""Go Ask Alice"" does an excellent job demonizing people who have low I.Q.s as well as anyone who needs institutional help. I do think this book excels at giving the reader a narrator who is expressing the thoughts that most people are too polite to say aloud, or even admit to themselves that they are having. The narrator is a white upper-middle class Good Girl with a bright future ahead of her; she longs to be married, have babies, and cook for her future husband one day. But those deranged drug criminals, unfortunately, steel her life from her, turning her into a horrible person who does all manner of awful things. Here is a passage of text from pages 113-114, which describes what the narrator is doing during the second time she runs away from home (this time she is completely alone, and lives as a homeless, drug-addicted prostitute for some time, until a kind priest contacts her parents for her):""I don't know what the hell hour or day or even year it is, or even what town. I guess I've had a blackout or they've been passing some bad pills. The girl on the grass beside me is white-faced and Mona Lisa like and she's preggers. I asked her what she's going to do with the baby and she just said, 'It will belong to everybody. We'll all share her.'I wanted to go and find somebody who's holding, but the baby thing really bugged me. So I asked her for an upper and she just shook her head like a stupid, blank, and I realized that she's completely burned out. Behind that beautiful stoned face is a big dried-up bunch of ashes and she's lying there like a stupid dumb shit who can't do anything.Well, at least I'm not burned out and I'm not preg. Or maybe I am. I couldn't take the goddamn pill even if I had it. No doper can take the pill because they don't know what the hell day it is. So maybe I am pregnant. So what. There's a pre-med drop out wandering around somewhere who will take care of it. Or maybe some goddamn prick would stomp on me during a freak out and I'd lose it anyway. Or maybe the son-of-a-bitch bomb will go off tomorrow. Who knows?""When the narrator isn't having a complete personality disorder as a result of her drug use, she is busy being a ""Goody Goody"" -- a perfect daughter who wants nothing more than to please her future husband one day and have a family of her own. After the second time the narrator is brought home, she decides she wants to be a social worker, and help other teens who've become addicted to drugs, the way people have helped her.But those darn drug criminals secretly poison her at her neighbor's house, while she's babysitting an infant, and she ends up with a complete psychotic breakdown instead. This book's content was ""shocking"" to readers when it was first published, and I think the content remains shocking to a lot of white middle-class readers, hence the novel's enduring appeal. Beatrice Sparks definitely took her millions of dollars straight to the bank, and lived high on the hog for the rest of her life.This novel disgusts me. If this weren't a market research read, I would've DNF'd by page two. The fact that so many readers were engaged by such a super dull opening truly amazes me. Drug users will certainly do a lot of horrible things in order to access more drugs, I am not denying that. But the narrator's poisoning, complete psychosis from a single dose of LSD, hospitalization, and institutionalization, as presented in this book, is the stuff of pure fantasy.One star read for me personally. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.Three stars because I recognize that this book is a modern classic, and what it reveals about the way many readers think is both horrible and invaluable....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 18, 2023","Apr 18, 2023","Apr 18, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46799.Go_Ask_Alice

(pg 131)Pam Painter is a writer's writer, that's for sure.I recently caught an interview with her on YouTube, in which she reads aloud ""the bridge"" from this work. My favorite piece in this book is the final story, ""the second night of a one night stand,"" which ends with these lines, as Ben [the husband] is being imagined by Margo [the wife] as she contemplates returning home to her cheating husband, after having spent a summer 'getting back' at him with her own affair, and she imagines her children telling him about the beach stones they have painted, one of which was perfectly shaped like a heart:""'The heart,' Polly will say, sifting frantically through the paper, telling him about the perfect heart. She'll describe finding it on the beach and giving it to Margo. Sam will point to his scarlet fire engine to show Ben the exact color that Margo chose for it.Still hoping, Ben will pile the last of the crumpled newspapers on the table. He will look for the heart in the bottom of the box and then he will turn to her. Sam and Polly will both cry, 'Mom, where is the heart?' Finally, Ben will understand, he'll know she didn't bring it home."" Simply gorgeous, and it packs such a punch.Some of these stories get pretty dark. One story, ""twins,"" is so grim that I had to put the book down for a while.

The basic information that you can gain from this book: that trust takes time to build, that service businesses are all built on relationships, that brand names are important, that advertising is important -- this all reads like common sense marketing to me, not like a revelation. The constant, enforced intimacy with modern marketing principles is a consequence of social media, the rise of TED talks, and how swiftly relevant information can spread in the era of the internet.

I had the opportunity to read selected pages from this work before the manuscript was published, and I'm really glad I had the chance to read the published book in 2023. I think the cover is beautiful, and the book comes with a full works-cited list and index that make rereading for further detail a breeze. As to Stange's overall takeaways, and the spiritual teachings she adopted to alleviate her own suffering, I can't say I agree. Stange adopted a heavily punishment-based version of karma from the Hindu belief system, and nothing about that belief system works for me. It would actually increase my own suffering to adopt that kind of model. A further note on those takeaways: it took me a long time to become aware of this, but I also believe that Stange presents all of the religious information in this book from a New Thought/New Age perspective. That mindset is very foreign to me, since I've never read any New Age works. But Stange quotes from quite a few New Age books in the text (especially Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra), and once I realized that there was an unspoken New Age lens on this entire book, things made a lot more sense.To me, the best parts of this book were the sections of memoir material. Those passages were interesting and shed light on the stressful work of being a large-animal doctor in a rural environment. For me, the nonfiction pedagogical passages (Stange's condensed summaries of religious teachings and history, all presented through a New Age lens) were a real struggle to read. For those who are unfamiliar with world religions, and who also have a New Age belief system, I can see this material working very well. But it was a real miss for me. I got to the point that I had to start skimming over pages in order to keep my interest. It is clear to me that Stange is an exceptionally excellent vet. Her passion for animals, and her expert skills at caring for them, are masterful. My favorite parts of this book were the memoir passages near the very end, when Stange shares information about learning ""the energetic pulse technique from [...] a Norwegian veterinarian, Are Thoresen"" (pg 233). That section of the book was truly fascinating. And I also loved Stange's tributes to her two beloved horses, Pecos and Sporty, and her white mule, May. May actually belonged to a man named Jean-Luc, but in the text, Stange and Jean-Luc became a couple, and it is clear that Stange spent many years caring for May.The memoir material at the end of the book was scant but deeply compelling. It felt like a very good payoff for having read through so many pages of pedagogical material that I did not enjoy and could not use to help myself spiritually, other than to reflect on all of the ways that Stange's punishment-model and manifestation belief system did not work for me.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the work of rural veterinarians, and the emotional and physical toll the job can take on a person. I'd especially recommend this book to anyone who has a New Age belief system, and has enjoyed the works of Eckhart Tolle, Deepak Chopra, Louise Hay, and Rhonda Byrne's ""The Secret."" I've never read any of those popular New Age works, and I frequently find myself opposed to manifestation beliefs. While I have always been aware that life has consequences, and that we all face various consequences in life, I do not personally believe that suffering is a punishment, either for sins in our current life or our past lives. I don't personally believe that we manifest our own pain, or that we cannot be born into a better life until we have been thoroughly punished for all of our sins. Contrary to Stange's views (pg 217-218), I also believe that many animals do have egos, and that animals can be traumatized and deeply changed, sometimes not for the better. Stange does not present any information in this book about the impact of trauma on animals, but I've been around highly traumatized animals, and I do not believe that the animals manifested the pain of their trauma, either by sinning in a past life or by non-verbally requesting maltreatment from humans.I do think Stange's book provided an opportunity to deeply reflect on what my own values are, in order to put into words why the spiritual concepts that alleviated Stange's own suffering would simply increase my own. It was a privilege to read this book, both in its unpublished and published formats.

I thought this was a great market research read. I've read more bestsellers in 2021 than I ever have in my life, and ""The Guest List"" was point-perfect on all the traits I can list that compose a modern, female-focused bestseller.""The Guest List"" was certainly not a book I would naturally want to read, but it wasn't horrible, either. This was a solid 3 stars.Because I know I will forget *everything* in this book if I don't write it down, I'm going to include some spoilers below. Stop reading here if you don't want the book spoiled. Thanks. :)(This is definitely the kind of book that you probably don't want to bother to read if anyone has spoiled the plot twists, so please don't keep reading if you plan to pick this book up. Thanks.) **********Spoiler thoughts:I liked the author's choice of villain in this book. The macro-plot definitely read a lot like ""Big Little Lies,"" in which the name of the murderer and the murder victim are both completely withheld from the reader until almost the very end of the book.""Big Little Lies"" had far more likeable characters, though. While I didn't hate any of the characters in ""The Guest List,"" I didn't like any of them, either. I just felt indifferent toward them. So I wasn't invested at all in finding out who would die or who the killer would be. I just continued the book because the sentences were crisp, and the writing itself was lovely. It was the writing itself that kept me engaged with this book, not the characters or the plot. (Spoilers for ""Big Little Lies"") --Like ""Big Little Lies,"" the murder victim of ""The Guest List"" is a rich male narcissist, although Foley's narcissist is revealed to be a killer (he murdered a classmate when he was a teenager) rather than a domestic abuser and rapist (as in ""Big Little Lies""). Both narcissistic men are compulsive liars, and might also be psychopaths, but that term itself is not used in either book. Foley's narcissist murder victim is named Will, and just like the abusive husband in ""Big Little Lies,"" he is killed by one of the women in the story who the reader least suspects. Both murders are explicitly ""justified"" in the text, and the women who kill them are meant to be extremely sympathetic. In the moral context of the story, killing these men is seen as a good thing. The (righteous) female murderer in ""The Guest List,"" however, is a POV character, unlike the killer in ""Big Little Lies,"" who only briefly appears in the book and is certainly not a POV character. Like a lot of modern thrillers, the ""surprise"" in the killer reveal in ""The Guest List"" is pulled off by withholding information from the reader. In this case, every time the wedding planner is interacting with Will, you know (in hindsight, after you finish the book) that this woman's mind was *full* of thoughts about who this man is in relation to her and the death of her brother (another important bit of information revealed at the end). But the author just withholds all of those thoughts from the reader in each active scene, giving a completely different version of what the character is thinking about than what the character is actually thinking about, so the ending can come as a complete surprise. This type of ""plot twist"" feels really cheap to me. I'm not a fan of this writing style whatsoever. But a lot of readers love it. The wedding planner falls under the category of an ""unreliable narrator"" -- and that is simply based on how the author completely withholds everything this woman would *actually* be thinking every time she interacts with Will throughout the story, long before the big ending. Having a righteous female character murder a devious/evil/narcissistic/psychopathic male is a hallmark of bestselling female-audience fiction right now. ""Big Little Lies"" certainly isn't the only bestselling novel that does this. I can name so many books that do this. (But I'll refrain from adding to the spoiler list.)I enjoyed how fucked up Olivia's character is (Olivia is the bride's sister/the bridesmaid). Many other ers expressed how much they hated this girl, but I thought she was deliciously fragile, weak, and fucked up. Her strident admissions of her own cowardice were one of the best parts of the book for me.Other readers certainly hated the bride, Jules. But the bride was actually my favorite character. She was just so amorally ruthless, so selfish and mean without intentionally being selfish and mean. I loved this myopic character. She really made the book for me. She felt the most realistic of everyone, and I thought she really carried the book. Hannah, the plus one, was a good person, and while Hannah kind of bored me, her confrontation with her husband at the end of this book was SPECTACULAR. Hannah got *mean* all of a sudden, and I was so there for it. Seeing Hannah take her husband to task was fricking awesome, and I'm assuming that she ends up divorcing him. (The book ends before the reader finds out. But all signs pointed toward that big confrontation being the end of their marriage.)And I also want to say: Hannah's husband's behavior -- how he starts attacking her just for smiling at Will, all the while knowing that he had an affair with Jules after Hannah gave birth to their first child -- ohhhhhhh, did I suddenly hate this guy. (!!!) My heart started pounding so hard, when I found out the truth of what he had done, right with Hannah. As a reader, it was a little disorienting, honestly, how worked up I suddenly felt; I felt more worked up over this situation than I did for anything else in the book. I actually hated Hannah's cheating, crying husband, a minor side character, *more* than I ever disliked Will (a main character and the primary antagonist). Maybe that's because Hannah was an obvious good person, someone I was genuinely sympathetic toward, so seeing her wronged (by her husband) provoked an intense indignation that seeing Jules and Olivia wronged (by Will) could never provoke. I know the greatest pleasure I can have from reading *anything* is to have my passions run high -- and oh my goodness, did that big conflict scene with Hannah and her asshole husband get my passions running high. Granted, it was such a brief scene, and I know that I'll have completely forgotten about it in two months -- that's why I'm making a note of it here, so I can remember that my emotions were at their highest engagement level during this scene. The lack of closure with Hannah and her husband is certainly why so many other readers thought the ending of this book was too abrupt. While I agree that a little more closure would have been nice, I honestly wasn't invested enough in any of these characters to give a damn, so I thought the quick, abrupt ending was fine. A word on Johnno, the best man: I strongly disliked this guy in the first half of the book, and even though he grew to be more sympathetic as the story continued, the strong distaste I had for him never really faded. I assume Foley wanted him to read that way, since he gets blamed for a murder he didn't commit, and I definitely get the sense that you're not meant to feel very sorry for him. By the very end, I did feel sorry for him, though, and it dampened my enjoyment quite a bit. This book seems to run on the theme that ""life is shit,"" and Johnno's (unresolved) false murder charge is certainly in that vein.Thankfully, I haven't seen ers calling this book ""feminist"" because the murderer is female, but this kind of ""feminism"" has been celebrated/rewarded in the book market quite a lot. ""The Guest List,"" as a market read, has what I would call a ""twist feminist ending,"" whereby ""feminism"" is solely interpreted to mean: ""women are equal to men when they are as depraved as men."" This definition of feminism is very popular on Goodreads and among other ers. I loved listening to this on audiobook. The narrators were all excellent. So well done! I loved the fucked-up group of men from the private school. I loved seeing some of them cry in the story. Seeing these men break down was some of the best stuff in this book.Excellent atmosphere. This book, and the two books I've read by Ruth Ware so far -- ""The Woman in Cabin 10"" and ""The Turn of the Key"" -- have excellent, creep-tastic atmosphere. In each of these three books, the characters are trapped in an inhospitable, dangerous place, a place where luxury is draped in creepiness. It's very well done. I'll say again that the prose of ""The Guest List"" was exceptionally good. Foley's writing is stronger and more engaging to me than Ruth Ware's. I know that's because the POVs Foley is writing from are much more intelligent, interesting, and mature than the two single first-person POVs in the two Ware books I've read. It made Foley's book a lot more engaging. I'd recommend ""The Guest List"" to any reader looking for a female-focused psychological thriller, the kind of mystery that doesn't require you to think too much, just enjoy the ride and the big plot twists/sudden reveals at the end.

As a reader, I was alternately bored and disgusted by this story and all of these characters. As a market analyzer, I can absolutely see why this book is so popular, regardless of how much it did not work for me. ""Every Heart a Doorway"" is exceptionally good at allegory trauma: specifically, the type of trauma most prevalent among this book's market demographic. Sometimes, the book is overt and heavy-handed, not at all allegorical. I would say those passages make the overall allegory even more glaring and off-putting for me. There is a specific set of power-fantasy and wish-fulfillment tropes that this book utilizes exceptionally well. None of those tropes worked for me, not as they were executed here, at least. Though I know that I do fall under the sway of those tropes, in other stories. Just not in this book.McGuire is a good writer. These sentences are all well-crafted, and I can recognize the storytelling skills on display. This book just wasn't my jam.Negative stars, for me personally. Reading this book is my personal definition of hell.Three stars in recognition that I am not the market for this. I am not the target reader for this book, and never will be. I do plan to read a few more books in this series. I do not think any of the sequels have sold as well as the first book has.

I loved all of the different narrators on the audiobook. The audiobook is very well done.

And this book shows just how seriously Dr. Canessa took that unspoken oath.Five stars.

The author has grown up in a very privileged background, with family members who are well-educated, affluent, have nutritious diets (and have never suffered from food insecurity), and stay active well after age sixty-five. Not all of us are so lucky to be around so many healthy older adults. I read this book right after spending many months caring full-time for ageing loved ones who had become disabled from multiple chronic diseases, diseases that were preventable and curable from a change in diet and lifestyle. None of these adults were willing to make those changes permanent, though. So while my full-time care could completely reverse their disabilities, the changes were not sustainable for them. Ultra-processed food addiction and stress addiction are very real, and incredibly disabling for older adults. None of which is touched upon in ""Breaking the Age Code."" This book reads like a big dose of syrupy sweetness, focusing exclusively on the positive sides of aging. I hardly ever think of things as being Pollyanna-ish, but that's exactly how this book read, as if Becca Levy had morphed into Pollyanna.The author definitely made a conscious choice to exclude the harsh realities many Americans are facing right now, as they struggle mightily to care for ageing loved ones. And there is certainly no mention of the horrible emotional and verbal abuse that ageing loved ones often unleash on their caregivers. The author just brushes all of the ugliness of elder care under the rug of ""stereotypes created by media"" and moves on to happier topics: namely: to the rich, satisfying lives all of us are capable of living into our oldest years, if only we all had the affluence and the right mindset to benefit from ageing, rather than seeing it as a horror. I admit that I am docking a full star from this book just because I am jealous: jealous that this author has never had to face the hopelessness and abuse that elder relatives and loved ones can unleash on their caregivers, projecting their self-hatred and self-loathing onto the easiest target: the people laboring in their homes after they've become bedridden and unable to care for themselves.And anyone reading this , who believes I am being cruel toward the elderly, all I can say is: I'm glad that you don't know what I'm talking about, because you've never experienced it yourself. I wish I could say the same.""Breaking the Age Code"" is an excellent book, and I recommend it to everyone. It's important for all of us to know that ageism is a choice, structural ageism is a choice, and the consequences of ageism make life worse for us all.I am sorry that my own bitterness makes me dock a star from this book. I wish I didn't have so much resentment toward the ""life is all sunshine and roses"" folks who have lived very charmed lives, like this author. The consequences of ageism are on full display in older folks who have never questioned their own conditioning, and that indoctrinated self-hatred makes these folks extremely miserable to be around. Especially when those folks make it clear that they do not want to change, and caregivers have to make the even more difficult choice to leave them to their disabilities, inadequate care in the system, and untimely deaths. Scientific research does show that the brain is malleable and that all of us can change who we are, right up until death. But not all people are willing to change their identity narratives, regardless of if they are thirty or ninety years old. The author makes no attempt to broach that subject at all. Instead, this book is a clarion call to those who already *want* to better their lives. And this book excels at that task, outstandingly.Four stars for me personally.Sorry I can't give it a full five....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 13, 2023","Apr 16, 2023","Mar 13, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58586409-breaking-the-age-code

Real makes it clear that he does not take on clients who are physically abusive at all. Which means that there are a lot of hard limits on how helpful this book may or may not be for any reader.As a therapist, Real has never been one to turn his back on the cold facts of societal oppression: he understands that not every client who comes to his office is facing the same set of traumas or hardships in life, and that many of our traumas are completely out of our control. That awareness is front and center throughout the pages of ""Us."" Since so many psychiatrists and counselors seem, at best, to be completely oblivious to overt forms of oppression, it's a relief to read the work of a therapist who takes oppression seriously, and incorporates feminism, anti-racism, anti-ableism, and other such worldviews into his practice. ""Us"" is not a book that delves a whole lot into inner healing and inner wholeness. There is some of that here, but the bulk of this book is focused on the daily actions people need to take -- especially couples -- to stop treating each other like garbage and have a loving relationship. None of those changes need to take years to make. Real shows that these vital changes can happen within the space of a few minutes, and be permanent, given a change in mindset. That change in mindset can come with the assistance of a trained therapist. Or, as in the hope of this book: people might change their own mindsets, based on the wisdom shared in this text. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with shitty relationships. The book is going to be most directly applicable to anyone struggling with their marriage, especially those who are on the verge of divorce.

I think McCurdy still has a whole lot of healing and learning to do, and the final few chapters of this memoir are a detailed account of her first steps in healing her life. Maybe she won't go any further than this, and if so, that's fine. McCurdy might live in this particular stage for the rest of her life, or she might pursue an even deeper understanding of herself, her past, and her path. I can't say.I'm glad this book exists, and that the people who need to read this memoir are reading it, and gaining strength from it. Power to them. <32.5-rounded up to 3 stars for me personally. Four stars in recognition that I am not the right audience for this book, and that if you are in the target demographic for this memoir, it's a powerful read.Recommended for fans of McCurdy, as well as anyone interested in learning about the dark realities of celebrity culture, childhood fame, and Hollywood's exploitation of child actors. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 24, 2023","Mar 13, 2023","Feb 24, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59364173-i-m-glad-my-mom-died

As Krakauer notes in the text, this book is an expansion of Krakauer's 9,000-word article about McCandless, titled ""Death of an Innocent,"" which appeared in the January 1993 issue of ""Outside"" magazine.In 2007, I watched Sean Penn's film adaptation of this book in theaters. My husband left the theater spitting nails, one of the many people who have no admiration for McCandless's life goals, or for his untimely death. To say the story of Chris McCandless is ""polarizing"" feels like too mild a term for the extreme reactions people tend to have toward his life story. ""Into the Wild"" is an excellent Rorschach test for modern Americans. Whether McCandless is admirable or foolish depends on what internal narratives this tale triggers in the reader or audience. I felt neutral toward the film, finding it honestly befuddling. I had no interest in reading the book until I chanced across a YouTube video that misquoted the book's contents, painting McCandless as someone who had suffered capital-t Trauma in his home life, which had then inspired his trek to Alaska. I immediately wanted to read the book, since capital-t Trauma had certainly not been a part of the movie. I thought that if the movie had left out pivotal information that would better explain McCandless's motivations, maybe I would not feel so befuddled. To my absolute dismay, this book was a trainwreck for me. And I did discover that the YouTuber was wrong: McCandless did not suffer any capital-t Trauma in his life. He certainly had small-t trauma in his life, and that is perhaps why this book and the movie resonated so well with so many people: all of the people who view McCandless favorably, as a noble and tragic figure, as Krakauer himself most obviously does. I do view McCandless as both noble and tragic, but not for the same reasons that Krakauer does. I can certainly recognize that Krakauer penned a beautiful book, as all of Krakauer's work is stunningly beautiful. But ""Into the Wild"" was my first encounter with the extent to which Krakauer can openly lie in his work to get to the answer he wants, to forward the opinion he wants, and encountering the particular lies in this book was devastating to me. I ended up hating ""Into the Wild,"" not because I hate Chris McCandless or his choices, but because I hate being lied to, and I hate things that are shallow. And this book, it turns out, is exquisitely shallow.To Krakauer's great credit, he gave me enough information in this text to come to my own conclusions, and he did so by including enough autobiographical information to show his own hand. Krakauer did this with full intention: to show the reader exactly how much McCandless's own drives have been Krakauer's own drives. But I'm going to put some words into Krakauer's mouth right now, and say that those drives are the following:1. The drive to prove oneself as being superior to one's own father; to overcome the small-t traumas that one's own father has inflicted upon you by proving yourself superior to him2. The drive to prove oneself as being superior over nature; to overcome the capital-t Traumas that life in the wilderness can and does serve up on the regular, thereby gaining superiority over nature3. In the process of proving oneself superior to one's own father and to nature, the drive to prove to yourself and others that you are A Real Man: worthy of distinction amongst your fellow men*************And why are these such important goals? Because in modern America, we're fed a steady supply of this narrative: that patriarchy is the best; and patriarchy, of course, is founded upon the glorification of individualism. According to patriarchy, it is this individualism, predicated on the severance of all relationships: this is the ultimate truth, the ultimate goal, the ultimate achievement of life. Free of all connection, having displayed your superiority over all other men (and most especially, your own father) by proving your superiority over the nature that made you, you can finally prove that you are: A Real Man. And for females or nonbinary folx, this same accomplishment will make you: A Real Person. There are certainly people who venture into the wilderness ""to see what they're made of."" But Krakauer makes it clear that he himself wanted distinction. And Krakauer's hardships with his father framed and drove all of his efforts. The same is shown to be true of McCandless. Both men faced plenty of small-t trauma. And small-t trauma is devastating. Emotional neglect and a lack of connection is devastating. It makes perfect sense that so many people hit ""fuck-it mode"" and strike out to burn it all down: sever all ties, strike out on one's own, and prove that they don't ""need"" any connections to survive; that they can do it all on their own.In Adlerian psychology, what these people would be said to be proving is: that it is ""okay"" to be here. By showing their superiority over nature, they are proving their worth to their own selves, and trying to attain permission that ""it is okay to be here.""None of which is in ""Into the Wild."" I am arriving at conclusions that are not at *all* in this book.The takeaways Krakauer wants the reader to have are the following: that McCandless was swayed by false gods. That McCandless put his faith in shoddy literature that glorifies life in the wilderness, penned by people who had no idea what life in the wilderness actually entailed. And the false god that Krakauer goes after with a vengeance is Jack London.To take down Jack London, Krakauer must lie about London. Krakauer must lie openly and unabasedly and denigrate a man who neither deserved this treatment or has the ability to fend off these attacks. So it falls to people like me, who end up doing the research to expose the lies for what they are. Here is the truth about Jack London:He was born into extreme poverty, and his mother was so massively destitute and depressed that she shot herself late in her pregnancy with Jack, trying to kill both herself and her baby. Jack's mother survived, and so did Jack. His mother then married a disabled Civil War veteran, and Jack grew up in such extreme poverty that he barely attended school, and dropped out at a young age, working dangerous blue-collar jobs that maimed and killed other children in order to help his family survive. As an adolescent, Jack borrowed money from a black woman who had helped care for him as a child, bought a boat with her savings, and taught himself how to sail. These skills enabled him to get higher-paying blue-collar jobs working on ships. As a teenager and adult, Jack supported his family all his life, including the black woman who helped him, who was supported by his writing income until the day she died.Jack's experiences with poverty and class oppression made him a socialist all his life. Jack's socialist values imbued the fiction he wrote, and often caused problems for his work getting published. Capitalist publishers were definitely not keen to espouse socialist views.It was Jack's mother who encouraged him to write stories, and encouraged him to enter the short story contest that first made it possible for him to pursue a writing career. The great beauty of this fact is that Jack's mother, who had once tried to kill him, is the same person who gave Jack's work to all of us to enjoy, as Jack London, the man whose work is still known and read, over a hundred years after his death.Jack's personal life was astonishing, even by today's standards. The amount of travel this man did, once he had the money to travel, was simply outstanding. He called his second wife his ""equal,"" and they traveled the world together. The information available about Jack's life is awe-inspiring, from the great home he built that was destroyed in a fire, to the photographs and memorabilia that are still on display in the mansion his second wife built after his death.Jack worked every day of his life, right up to his death. As a survivor of capital-t Trauma, it should come as no surprise to anyone that he treated his psychic wounds with alcohol all of his life, and that he contracted a number of sicknesses during his travels. Jack's illnesses, combined with the drugs he was using to treat them, all formed a toxic mix in his body, and he died very young, at age 40, still in the prime of life. There is a photograph of him taken just days before he died, standing with his second wife and their dog; you would never know, from appearance alone, that he was just hours from death. Jack was the rare kind of person who is larger than life, tall and muscular, soulful and radiant. A man who was so wounded by massive amounts of trauma as a child and as a young man (including before he was even born) that he used whatever treatments were available to him, the same way many people do today.Because of Jack's espoused socialism, history was not kind to him. Other people like Jack have been just as slandered by their political enemies, people like Ulysses S. Grant, for instance. If you are a white man in a position of power, and you use your position to advocate for the oppressed, history is often not kind to you. The slander against your good person is as relentless as it is intense. And so it has gone with Jack London. The real Jack, of objective fact, is still with us, preserved for us the same way the real Ulysses S. Grant is preserved. But the damning, reputation-killing narratives tend to be the most popular ones: the narratives that destroy these men as people, because they didn't side with power, but with the oppressed. Jon Krakauer repeats the absolute lies about the life of Jack London in ""Into the Wild."" And Krakauer repeats these lies because they serve his own narrative: that Chris McCandless idolized a man who led him to his doom. It's repulsive. ""Into the Wild"" repulses me. Jack London did not create patriarchy. He did not create the glorification of individualism. Jack London also did not communicate the message that heading off into the Alaska wilderness without adequate provisions, adequate clothing, or a map was the best way to prove one's manhood. If anyone is capable of having absolute compassion for a young man who believes such steps are necessary in life, it would be London himself, because London knew well enough from experience just how dangerous and unforgiving surviving alone in the wilderness is. Jack London was McCandless's hero, and for the sake of McCandless himself, he deserves better than this. McCandless didn't put his faith in a false god. Jack London isn't the demon here, promising manhood to an unsuspecting youth who followed a Pied Piper to death. McCandless was working out his own trauma, his own emotional neglect and difficulties forging relationships and connections with people he initially cut himself off from. Small-t trauma is just as ruthless as the capital-t Trauma Jack London experienced. McCandless set himself adrift, and what seems clear to me is that, by the last days of his life, McCandless did understand that he needed people. Not just to save his life, but to live his life. To me, that is the real beauty of Krakauer's book: to present enough information so I can truly believe that, had McCandless lived, he would have regained his relationships and connections to everyone he had cut out of his life. There is a divine grace in the life and death of Chris McCandless, and I can take the objective data in this book to draw my own conclusions. But they are not the conclusions Krakauer wanted me to have, and I know this because Krakauer deliberately lies about the life of Jack London to achieve his aims. As evidence, here are the flagrant lies about the personal life of Jack London that Krakauer reproduces in his text: [Quoted from somewhere on disc 2 in the audiobook]: “London was his favorite. […] McCandless had been infatuated with London since childhood. London’s fervent condemnation of capitalist society, his glorification of the primordial world, his championing of the great unwashed, all of it mirrored McCandless’s passions. Mesmerized by London’s turgid portrayal of life in Alaska and the Yukon, McCandless read and reread The Call of the Wild, White Fang, To Build a Fire, An Odyssey of the North, The Wit of Porportuk. He was so enthralled by these tales, however, that he seemed to forget they were works of fiction, constructions of the imagination that had more to do with London’s romantic sensibilities than with the actualities of life in the subarctic wilderness. McCandless conveniently overlooked the fact that London himself had spent just a single winter in the north, and that he died by his own hand on his California estate at the age of forty: a fatuous drunk, obese, and pathetic, maintaining a sedentary existence that bore scant resemblance to the ideals he espoused in print.”**************************^^To glorify the primordial world is not the same as advocating supremacy over it. Jack London was many things in his life, but fatuous wasn't one of them. Nor was he obese, pathetic, or living a sedentary life. Jack London *did* live the ideals he espoused in print. He traveled, he loved people, he loved being alive. He did not die of suicide, but from his many illnesses. In today's medical literature, his diagnosis would be death from stroke. His second wife was with him when he died, very suddenly. Jack London worked every day, up until his death. This need to provide, and to never rest, took an insurmountable toll on his body.The best thing, for me, about ""Into the Wild,"" is that Krakauer's flagrant lies led me to the truth, and the truth of Jack London is so much better than anything in this book. McCandless did not choose a false god. His love of Jack London stands. McCandless's favorite author remains worthy of every bit of his adoration. I would say that patriarchy did not serve McCandless very well. If he had valued all of that ""feminine relationship stuff,"" he would probably still be alive today. ""Into the Wild"" is a good book, and it's also a fatally flawed book. It's a book by and for the patriarchy. Reader beware.Negative stars for me personally. Fuck this book.Three stars because I still love Jon Krakauer. Even after this trashfire. I love Krakauer's work. But I definitely do not love this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 30, 2023","Jan 31, 2023","Jan 30, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1845.Into_the_Wild

Very thankful that this book exists. **********First published in October 2019, the nonfiction/self-help book, ""Fair Play: A Game-Changing Solution for When You Have Too Much to Do (And More Life to Live),"" by Eve Rodsky, is a book that promises hard-working moms with live-in partners a solution to dividing up the household labor in a more equitable way.While there is definitely some useful advice in ""Fair Play,"" this book is a slog to get through, and I thought that the best advice in the text was buried at the very end. Overall, I found this book pretty irritating, boring, and DNF-worthy. Rodsky's strict solution to the problem of gender disparity in the home: to follow a very time-consuming card game that requires a constantly updated command board in order to ""re-deal"" household tasks with your partner, is really not something I would ever implement in my own home. But as Rodsky herself makes clear in the text, I already live in a home with a drastically fair and equitable division of household labor, so I'm definitely not the target audience for this card game.Rodsky presents the ongoing issues of patriarchy that women face in their homes as a failure of ""the women's movement"" to even name this problem, much less solve it, and... yeah, that irritated the sh*t out of me, to be honest. Either Rodsky has learned about feminism from The Howard Stern Show or she simply doesn't want to alienate the female patriarch book buyers who are all #OverMeToo, but this level of ignorance was a bit much. Rodsky also makes sure to never call out capitalism and/or capitalist values as having anything to do with the problems women face in any unfair division of household labor, so if you're at all worried that this book might take issue with capitalism: fear not. Capitalist values are never even named in this book, much less questioned, and most of the ""solutions"" Rodsky touts in the book are predicated upon being firmly within the reach of the upper-middle class; high-income homes headed by two working adults are ideal in this text. This was a market research read for me, and while I did find value in this book, it was not in the card game that Rodsky presented. But if I did fit the book's target demographic: an upper-middle class woman with two or more young children and married to ""an adult toddler husband"" who never did sh*t to help out at home, then I could definitely see how Rodsky's card game would be a life-saver for me. I think that Rodsky's focus on ""unicorn space"" is an excellent contribution to personal empowerment, and it's a message that people of all genders can benefit from, but this is the information that is buried at the very end of the book. I'm really glad that this book exists, and that so many women have benefited from Rodsky's card game. Her suggestions to have couples discuss their values around household tasks is a crucial communication step, and her acknowledgement that self-evaluation is the first step in seeking sustainable change is super important. But this book just really wasn't for me and I couldn't wait to get it out of my life and return it to the library. I have never been more grateful to have never known the utter hell of being married to ""an adult toddler husband."" It's one thing to see men portrayed as useless buffoons on TV. Quite another to face the hellscape of being married to one. I'd recommend this book to any woman who feels like an inhuman servant and longs to stop feeling dead inside.

For me, reading this audiobook was like eating a giant slab of vomit-flavored Jell-O packed with chunks of fried Spam, cat litter, and still-wriggling sea lice. Each sentence found me closing my eyes and just trying to swallow another bite without thinking about it too much.One of the storylines in this novel centers on the idea of upper-class interracial dating in 1969, but comes loaded with all of the realities of 2010s social justice and takes some outstanding spins into fantasy to accomplish its goal. I can practically hear the author playing a song titled ""My all-white family is not racist"" while penning this complicity-annihilating tribute to her own birth and birth year of 1969. The fact that the book cover features a bunch of white people frolicking in the surf speaks volumes. I did appreciate that Hilderbrand featured the Inkwell, on Martha's Vineyard, in this novel. But the existence of this Black-centered beach was presented in the book as a way to smooth over racial tensions, rather than explore them. The stakes in this book are outstandingly non-existent. A necklace is lost and then found. An affluent wife leaves her husband over a misunderstanding, and then is swiftly reunited with him. A son in Vietnam sends home emotional, heartfelt letters full of feminine awareness of relationship matters and 2010s political statements. Affluent college students flirt with each other. And a caustic old matriarch who clings to money like it's Jesus Christ incarnate reveals that she actually has no problem whatsoever with her pretty white granddaughter dating a Black college student, because while this grandmother takes infinite pride in being profoundly classist and sexist, she is no racist.Even typing a summary of this book is inspiring my gag reflex to kick in. I'm just not a fan of eating still-wriggling sea lice in Jell-O. This was my third market research read of Elin Hilderbrand's work, and I'm pretty sure I won't have to suffer through any more of her canon. These books are definitely not for me.Negative stars for me personally.

In another Goodreads , I read that this author had to be called out by anti-racists in 2020 for pretty much being a tool. I would say that call-out definitely had an impact, because LePera makes a few nods to structural oppression in ""How to Do the Work.""Those mentions feel tacked-on, however. Nothing about structural oppression felt organic to the work; the topic was simply crammed into the text in a few places.I read this book in January of 2023, and the thing that had the biggest impact on me is LePera's emphasis on ""being a self-healer,"" and how that actually felt a bit jarring to me. So much of my own healing has to do with how much support I have in my life. Namely: all of my really good friends. All of the people who can hold space for me and love me for who I am.Healing is internal work, but it also requires connection and belonging to others.

Maxwell, is a dark erotic fantasy starring a 169-year-old fae king and a human woman in her mid-twenties from Wisconsin. The fae king, Caiden, runs a string of brothels and strip clubs in Las Vegas. He's rich AF and proudly proclaims himself ""the king"" pretty much nonstop throughout the book. At the start of the novel, the out-of-work human woman, Bryn, is in Vegas on a weekend getaway. Bryn and Caiden end up married within hours after first meeting each other. For the rest of the book, they are a married couple. Caiden makes it very clear to the reader that it is not okay to call exotic dancers or sex workers ""whores"" at all, and he starts out the book by beating the crap out of a floor manager who calls one of Caiden's strippers who performs sex work ""a whore."" But a few pages later, after Caiden and Bryn are married, Caiden begins calling his wife a ""whore,"" except now the word is used as orgasm material. Throughout the rest of the book, the king calls Bryn ""a whore"" and ""a slut"" during every sex scene they have, and Caiden tells the reader that he loves ""degrading"" his wife with these words. I'm not sure what the point of this is, and I mean that honestly. The book is telling me that it isn't okay to call sex workers ""whores,"" but also telling me that the word ""whore"" is an excellent term for a man's wife. If the word ""whore"" is a great term to use for your loved one, and you call your wife a ""whore"" and a ""slut"" every chance you get, then why can't you use it for a literal sex worker? Why does the king need to beat the shit out of one man for using the word, but then openly uses the word himself throughout the rest of the book? Is the book telling me that the word ""whore"" is a great word to use for a woman so long as she isn't a literal sex worker? Or is the book simply saying that it is okay for a fae king to call women whores, but not human men who work the lowly job of floor manager at a strip club? I don't know. It was baffling. The erotic details in this book read more like werewolf sex than fae sex. If you are used to the tropes of werewolf mating, with its emphasis on scent details and specific types of animal descriptors, then the so-called BDSM fae sex in ""The Dark King"" will be very familiar. To me, the sex scenes in this book read like wish-fulfillment pornography, in which the human woman, Bryn, is treated like a porn star in a modern gonzo-porn film: she is verbally and physically attacked by her male partner, without any prior discussion of what actions will be taken by her male partner during sex, and then delightfully discovers that she is a natural-born masochist: feeling every moment of severe degradation and pain as blissful pleasure. The more cruelly the king treats her, the more Bryn enjoys her orgasms. Their final sex scene involves straight-up torture, in which the king is performing all manner of cruelty against Bryn for the purpose of a criminal investigation. To put it mildly: I'm not a fan of torture-sex, and this final sex scene was definitely harshing my mellow. During the couple's second BDSM sex scene in the book (about halfway into the novel), the king gives a very detailed description of inserting a butt plug into Bryn's anus. I thought this was a very brave choice, since there most often isn't anything realistic about anal sex in erotica novels, but the description of this lubricated butt plug insertion was fairly realistically written. Caiden inserts the butt plug after first slapping Bryn's butt cheeks until they are ""cherry-red"" (pg 155). Then Caiden tells Bryn: ""Now that your punishment is over, it's time for your reward. [...] Show your king how you worship his fucking cock"" (pg 155).Bryn proceeds to begin giving Caiden a blow job, and Caiden tells the reader:""Bryn sucks my cock like she's one step away from porn-star level. [....] 'Fuck yes, that's it. I'll have to teach you how to take my cock all the way to the back of your throat like a good little --'""""Instead of finishing her upstroke, she reverses her direction as she moves her hand away and continues past the midpoint [taking him deeper into her mouth]. I can't even hide my shock when the head of my dick pushes past the opening of her throat and slides in until her lips are stretched around the root of my [very long, and very thick] cock. She holds the position as she looks up at me, her eyes watering from the effort, but there's no sense of panic or discomfort in her energy"" (pg 157-158).While Caiden enjoys being able to fully throat-fuck Bryn, he is angry about her highly advanced oral sex skills. He immediately pulls Bryn off of him, glaring at her, and demands to know how she already knows how to take a dick all the way down her throat like that. ""[A]t the thought of her porn-star-blowing for some other guy,"" Caiden tells the reader, he must immediately ask Bryn, 'What the fuck was that, Beauty?' in ""accusation."" (pg 158)Bryn immediately has to reassure Caiden that she is ""part of the 25 percent of the female population with no gag reflex,"" and that she has ""only done it with a dildo before"" (pg 158). This answer satisfies Caiden's libido, and the sex scene resumes with ""animalistic growl[s]"" and ""filthy mouth-fucking,"" which is how Caiden describes ""kissing"" Bryn on the mouth (pg 158).Caiden's fixation on Bryn's perceived sexual inexperience reinforces a lot of sexist thinking that men should prefer virgins, and complements his interior monologue of calling Bryn a ""whore"" and a ""slut"" to ""degrade her."" Nothing about this book worked for me, and I would personally give it negative stars. The BDSM that is portrayed in this book reminded me of the sex scenes in the novel ""Kushiel's Dart."" The female main characters in both books are natural-born masochists, and the so-called ""BDSM"" in both books is written about in the same way. In both novels, the characters do not have conversations or agreements about what they expect in a sexual encounter with a new partner; it is always assumed that whatever horrible abuse the man chooses to engage in will be all the more satisfactory to the woman the more brutal it is, with no communication necessary. I read ""The Dark King"" as a market research read, and I fully recognize that I am not the target audience for this book.Three stars as a research read. This book was definitely not for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 14, 2023","Jan 23, 2023","Jan 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60316870-the-dark-king

By the end of the book, it was clear that readers were meant to sympathize and empathize with the main characters. But the author introduces them all with such comedic superficiality and unrelenting vapidness that I thought I was supposed to despise these people. And I did. Only to be informed, at the end of the book, that I was meant to be rooting for these inane, hypocritical shitheads all along. This novel is one big long jaunt through affluent pettiness and the existential angst of first world problems, all of it told through the lens of a murder victim (who is still alive as a spirit in a go-between place between heaven and earth) who feels no anger or bitterness toward her murderer, and doesn't even push for answers as to why she was murdered. This novel is silly, offensive, barf-inducing, and clueless. All in equal turns. I felt sickened by the time I finished this novel, and to say ""I just didn't get it"" is too mild a term for the jarring tonal rift I felt at the end of the book. Hilderbrand has a formulaic precision for crafting her scenes: patriarchy vibes + white affluence + food writing + worship of consumer goods + women being bitches nonstop + more food writing + ass-pull plot twist every 55 pages. Rinse and repeat. Pages and pages go by in which nothing happens, there's no forward plot progression, but those Hilderbrand literary vibes infuse every scene.

Robbins follows the lives of three school teachers over the course of one school year (none of whom quit the profession, despite undergoing horrific amounts of abuse, which is described in detail). I could not force myself to read any of that material carefully, or for more than a minute or two at a time, and the only way I could finish this book was to start skipping all of those sections entirely. (And I think those sections make up a majority of this book.)Of the general nonfiction information that Robbins presents, I thought it was fine, but I didn't learn anything new. While I am glad that someone who hasn't spent years of her life in this profession could come to the conclusions that Robbins puts forth, this book was not a revelation to me. In the past few years, I've listened to a number of YouTube videos of school teachers explaining their horrible situations and reasons for quitting, and have found a lot of solace and comfort in those videos. I did not find any comfort in this book, other than an understanding that Robbins truly does empathize with teachers quite a lot. Funnily enough, I came to realize that what this book *really* needed (in order for me to enjoy it) was an analysis of why so many Americans loathe and despise teachers so much. I think a lot of good can come from what is really driving that hatred. A hatred that is not only targeted at teachers, but at the idea of education itself. When I taught in a public school in my twenties (2006-2011), I was constantly dealing with traumatic memories from childhood and young adulthood that kept surfacing, memories of teachers being cruel, abusive, openly bullying me, and just all kinds of horrible situations that I was never able to process as a child or as a young adult. I think what made it all so jarring was the contrast of how very different my own teaching was, how very much my students loved me (rather than despising me, as I had despised my own teachers), and how much daily abuse from parents and administrators I still received on the job, regardless of my performance.Being a pubic school teacher left me with a severe case of PTSD, and as I've gone on my own healing journey, I've come to understand that the job was simply a massively abusive situation that was constantly triggering the CPTSD I had yet to resolve. And when I reflect upon all of the angry/entitled/violent parents, horrible school administrators, and overwhelming amounts of bullshit that plague modern teaching, I suddenly realize how not-alone I am in all of this: in all of that unresolved CPTSD. None of which is touched upon in this book. I think the ideal audience for this book is someone who is worried about the state of U.S. education, is seeking to understand why schools are struggling so much to keep teachers on staff, and has never worked full-time as a school teacher themselves.Personally, I would rate ""The Teachers"" two stars, and I just wish I had DNF'd. I definitely would not recommend anyone buy this book for ""a teacher friend"" as any kind of act of love or appreciation for ""the job they do."" If anyone thinks that's a good plan, I would recommend reading this book yourself first, and then asking your friend if they would like a free copy. Because this book is kind of a lot, and I'm just unconvinced that pushing a lot of other teachers' unprocessed trauma on folx who are still working in this profession is actually a good thing.Since I do not believe I am, in any way, the right audience for this book, I am going to rate it 3.5 stars and round it up to four. This book was just really not my thing, but I do recognize that there is probably a lot of value in these pages for the right audience.My own emotions while reading ""The Teachers"" bounced between boredom and revulsion, revulsion and boredom.

For me, the information in this book is all stuff I got very familiar with after listening to a lot of Tony Robbins videos on YouTube between 2011 and 2012. But it's nice that this book is striving to make more pains to be #woke. Beck is an affluent white woman with multiple degrees from Harvard. She's clearly read the books about racism and white supremacy that have rocketed up the bestseller lists in the last ten years, because she makes nods to the oppressive systems of racism and homophobia that put people's lives in danger.These were small gestures, but they were nice. Self-help is a genre that most often completely ignores oppression, and while Beck has some glaring holes in her work regarding oppressive systems, the small gestures she does make were good. This isn't a book I would reread, and I don't think it was for me. But for what it is, and for its intended audience, I think this book would be powerful.I'm not sure if I'll read any other books by this author. I can tell that she isn't for me, so I have no personal desire to read more of her.

Reading the book, I kept seeing her as seven or eight. How much you enjoy this book depends upon how much you connect with Coraline, particularly how relatable you find her level of suffering. Specifically: her parents are very good parents, they provide very well for her and offer her things to do; but she is sometimes bored at home, and her mother doesn't listen to her closely at times or reward her enough for being their exquisitely special only-child. The mother also doesn't properly perform femininity: she isn't interested in making sure Coraline has unique, stylish clothes at school and she doesn't cook Coraline tasty meals at home; Coraline makes it clear that her mother's cooking isn't very good. If this level of childhood neglect and suffering knocks it out of the park for you, and rings all your trauma bells, you will most likely bond with Coraline really well. In addition, if you also find the particular horrors of the ""other world"" in this novel absolutely terrifying (I definitely did not), then this will all be a very compelling read.I think the horrors of the other world (eternal life that comes with a loss of one's inner self) complement Coraline's stated traumas (boredom while playing in the house, occasional emotional neglect while her parents both work full-time jobs from home) really well. Coraline's given trauma, coupled with the beldam's threat in this book (the beldam is the demon in charge of the other world), match each other perfectly. For me, I never cared about anything, and nothing ever scared me or even creeped me out. I had an overwhelming lack of investment in every word of this book. I was bored out of my gourd.The very last chapter, in which Coraline faces the beldam's disembodied hand, was rather interesting. But honestly, I was just ready for the story to be over by then. It already felt like I'd read an Epilogue chapter, right before that. Returning to the action for a second high-action climax made the book feel extra long. But if I'd been invested in Coraline and this tale, I can see how I would have felt otherwise, and loved that additional climactic chapter a lot.I read this book twenty years after it was published as a market research read. This book is so incredibly popular, I had to make sure to read it. But for me personally, I'd give ""Coraline"" a hard pass. I liked it a little more than ""The Graveyard Book,"" so at least there is that. A lot of people on Goodreads have said that the film adaptation is far superior to the book. If I can ever get my hands on the DVD, I'll have to check it out, and see for myself. One star for me personally.

MoPublished in November 2019, ""The Witches Are Coming,"" by Lindy West, is a topical collection of feminist essays about various pop culture subjects. Most of the book is primarily concerned with the years 2011-2018.Even reading this in 2022, ""The Witches Are Coming"" already felt a bit dated. Mileage is definitely going to vary with a book like this. Whether any information in this book strikes you as a revelation or not depends upon how avidly you're attuned to the ephemera of pop culture.Something I wasn't aware of, since I don't watch the TV show: the creators of ""South Park"" are proud lifetime members of the Republican Party. These two men are pro-everything-conservative and diehard fans of the GOP. I guess they lied to their fans for years, and painted themselves as ""neutral"" politically, so the truth comes as a bombshell to folx who thought they were like, ""good people"" making ""lighthearted funny"" on TV. Turns out: not so much. I've always thought the vast majority of popular comedy has a heavy-handed conservative bent, since so much of comedy is about ""punching down"" on the oppressed and the marginalized, and then saying, ""It's just a joke!"" to defend racism, misogyny, transphobia, and all the other institutionalized hatreds that frame American pop culture.Lindy West grew up revering ""South Park,"" Howard Stern, Adam Sandler, and a whole host of other white male comedians who earn their bread and butter by mocking women and promoting conservative contempt for anyone who isn't mainlining the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy.The fact that West came out of such a misogynistic media world, a world she wanted to emulate in all ways, and ended up becoming a feminist instead, is a tribute to how far she has come, and a shining reminder that anyone can wake up to the truth, no matter how much you've been programmed to fit in with the crowd. There were parts of this book that dragged for me, since West and I don't share the same interests. I don't spend hours watching cat videos on YouTube, and I had no idea that Grumpy Cat's real name was ""Tard,"" given to her because the owners knew she was mentally disabled. West spends a lot of time in the book studying this situation. I thought she could have gotten the job done in half the words. I felt that way about several of the essays in this collection. But I still enjoyed this book a lot more than ""Shrill."" And West does a great job narrating the audiobook. If you're looking for some easy feminist listening for your commute, this would be a good pick. There's nothing that will rock anyone's world in this book. I didn't find it to be anything groundbreaking. And now that Donald J. Trump is no longer President, a lot of this book felt really dated.But it's not a bad book. It definitely has its good parts. I appreciated West's comedy about the things that deeply matter to her. She is a good writer, and I love her passion and heart.3.5 stars rounded up to 4 ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 14, 2022","Jul 20, 2022","Jul 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38362811-the-witches-are-coming

The novel is structured as a women's domestic thriller+romance starring a teenage girl named...Hmm. I just finished this book and I can't remember the main character's name. One moment, let me check the book jacket --Ah, yes: Audrey Rose Wadsworth. It's important that her surname is 'Wadsworth' because the male love interest is a Sherlock Holmes character who calls her by her surname a lot. It's basically like he's saying, ""Elementary, my dear Watson,"" all the time.I found this book really silly and aggravating at times. If I hadn't read this as a market research read, I would have DNF'd. Even fifty pages of this was more than enough.I know I'm going to forget the ending of this book in the next twenty minutes or so, and for that reason, I'm going to record how the book ends below. Just so I can come back to this  and have my memory jogged, should I be asked about this one. One star for me personally. But I know I'm not the audience for domestic thrillers, and I'm *definitely* not the audience for a YA domestic thriller. So I'll give this one three stars and just run away.**************************spoilers****stop reading here if you don't want the book spoiled, thanks**This book was not set up in a way that the reader was given any subtle clues or hints about who the murderer was. When I read certain thriller authors (like Tony Hillerman or Gillian Flynn), I can see how the killer is immediately presented and given signals that they are, in fact, the killer.Not so here. While Audrey's brother *is* depicted right away in the novel (as per thriller conventions), there is absolutely *nothing* on the page that would hint he's the killer. Instead, the reader is just presented with a scene in which Nathaniel has gone from sweet, caring brother to full-on-monster at the very end of the book. It's supposed to be a huge plot twist and giant 'ah-ha!' moment. To me, it just felt really cheap.Audrey's father is addicted to drugs, and she suspects he's the killer for a long time. He's forced out of the city at one point, to deal with his drug problem; then he shows up again later and goes back to treating Audrey like crap and threatens to disown her if she keeps studying forensic science. Audrey's uncle is falsely accused and arrested for being Jack the Ripper, and put in Bedlam for a time, where he is gruesomely drugged out of his mind. Then he's released, and it's like it never happened. Honestly, this book is just weird AF and I think my refrigerator is more historically accurate to 1888 London than anything in any of these 318 pages.""Stalking Jack the Ripper"" does not include any of the class problems that were brought to light in the Jack the Ripper case. The murders as a whole just serve as a vehicle to establish that Audrey Rose is Not Like Other Girls: she's actually interested in serial killers and gory stuff, like dead bodies. (If you haven't seen the Saturday Night Live ""Murder Show"" skit, with that great catchy song, this would be a great time to do that. It was pretty much all I could think about as I struggle-bus'd my way through this très-silly book.)I've developed this thing I generically call 'Schema' in fiction, and this book is definitely a Schema book. For commercial fiction for women readers, this book definitely hits all the marks. Audrey Rose spends the bulk of the book worrying about her clothes, her nails and hair, and flirting with Thomas (the Sherlock Holmes guy), and then ""solves"" the case because her own brother is the murderer and he's got a freaky steampunk-death-lord mad-scientist cave built into their house. Which Audrey just kind of conveniently stumbles into at the very end of the book.That final climactic scene is *very* long. I thought it dragged, but if I'd been into this book, I can see how the freaky-steampunk-death-cave scene would have been a huge hit. I especially loved that Audrey dresses up as a prostitute and goes out with Thomas (basically as her pimp) one night in the hope of solving the case. This whole book is just laughable, but that scene was truly peak silly. It was a great Schema scene and hats off to Maniscalco for hitting all of these melodramatic notes so hard. This entire book is off-key, but by god, it's so loud, it wins by sheer ear-splitting force. If anyone out there is trying to write a YA bestseller, I would say, definitely read this one for research. It channels that SNL ""Murder Show"" vibe, it's got some ""Pretty Woman"" thrown in, and it read like what I imagine sixth-grader Harlequin romance should read like. And there's some truly great ableism in this book. Audrey Rose witnesses the horrific death of a man with leprosy, a scene that is just thrown in for some ableist gore. The atrocities at Bedlam are never called out in the text. The father's drug problem was all handled badly. I'd say the book is ""sloppy,"" but that's really a great selling point in commercial fiction. The sloppiness of it all is to the book's benefit. This story isn't here to analyze classism, ableism, or patriarchy. It's here to show that these systems all work for Audrey Rose. She just has to let them.And at the very end of the book, when she fully submits to her father's tyrannical reign, she is rewarded by being given everything her heart desires: which is a future that was completely planned out by her love interest without her input or consent. Which doesn't matter to Audrey Rose, though. She's over the moon with happiness. Thomas has decided they'll both go to college in Romania, and her father will be paying for it, and yay for true love.There was definitely content in this book that I found super offensive. There are many lines I could quote as examples, but I'll settle on one brief passage:""My brother's Autumn of Terror might end up being used for good one day after all. It was Thomas's hope he'd be able to perform a successful transplant on a living person during his lifetime. I didn't doubt it."" (page 314)I must state for the record: the murders of Jack the Ripper had absolutely nothing to do with the advancement of organ transplant science. It honestly pisses me off that these sentences appear in this book. But I'm not the intended reader, so I'll just register my complaint with 1-800-no-one-gives-a-damn.I'm so glad I didn't spend any money on this book. I can't wait to get it back to the library, and then my memory will kindly dump this book straight out of my brain. I would definitely not recommend this novel to anyone. But this book was a massive market success, so I'm in the minority opinion there....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 08, 2022","Aug 02, 2022","Jul 08, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40727470-stalking-jack-the-ripper

Ewalt, is a great introduction to the history of the tabletop game, D&D, as well as other activities that have been influenced by, and created from it, such as video games and Live Action Role-Playing/LARPing.I enjoyed reading about the history of tabletop gaming so much that I'm giving the book five stars, though ""Of Dice and Men"" did have its drawbacks for me. I found myself really bored by the author's long sections of fictional narrative describing his own D&D campaigns, which are interspersed throughout the whole book. At first, I enjoyed seeing an example of the fun Ewalt has playing D&D. But by the halfway point of the book, I was over these passages, and they just kept appearing in the text, relentlessly, and it got really tiresome. By the last third of the book, I gave myself permission to just skip those passages entirely, I was just so sick of them and found them so boring.It was another reminder to me that any Role Playing Game/RPG is so absorbing to the players that they lose the ability to comprehend the stark fact that unless you are playing the game yourself or are extremely keen to follow that specific type of game-play, listening to the game narration quickly becomes outstandingly boring. Even the author of this book wasn't immune to the force of that reality-blocking enthusiasm for gaming.I also felt a bit confused as to why Gary Gygax stayed on such a high pedestal of adoration. I mean, sure, I understand that Ewalt reveres D&D. But Gygax did a lot of questionable and outright shitty things in his life. My takeaway from the creation of D&D is overwhelmingly this one: Gygax and Arneson were both really greedy people with a ruthless addiction to money and status, both were happy to sue people and hurt people to benefit their own pockets. I wish Ewalt had touched on how those personality traits might have influenced gaming design in some way. But the information is just presented flatly, and then Ewalt shifts back into ""I worship Gygax"" mode. I didn't mind the wonkiness, though. Ewalt consistently claims his status as a white male grognard aspiring to lifelong Dungeon Master status, and I think certain types of analysis were clearly beyond the ken of this book.This was a good gaming research read. I'd recommend this book to anyone curious to learn more about D&D.Five stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Jul 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15803047-of-dice-and-men

Pink, is a short, concise overview oFirst published in 2009, the nonfiction book, ""Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,"" by Daniel H. Pink, is a short, concise overview of intrinsic motivation, what we currently know about it, and how management styles either enhance or crush it.I really enjoyed this! I listened to it on audiobook during a long car ride in 2022, and I thought the book holds up well. The content is as relevant today as it was in 2009. The author does not touch on the term ""burnout"" in this book, but it's clear that over-controlling managers, a lack of company purpose, and an overall lack of worker autonomy are major contributors to staff burnout. For a lot of brutally awful low-wage jobs, external rewards still work very well. I think the author is a bit out of touch with the overwhelming reality that a lot of people still work physically demanding jobs that pay very little and have an extremely low (or nonexistent) level of creativity in them. Pink's focus in the book is definitely on the upper-middle class, and it certainly shows.But even working-class positions would be *greatly* enhanced if those workers were managed in a way that contributes to intrinsic motivation. As to one of the hardest jobs of all, parenting, ""Drive"" does not touch on the issues of ""managing a household"" in any way. In this book, the topic of children is mentioned in the realm of formal education, but not in the realm of parenting. The truth is, parents are on the front lines of what it means to ""manage"" someone other than yourself, and parents consistently (and relentlessly) face the consequences of those daily choices. My heart just goes out to how difficult and challenging it all is, since we (in America) live in a society that punishes failure/lacks a social safety net to cushion those who end up failing in the system in any way. When the stakes are that high, ""failure"" puts an overwhelming pressure on everyone, especially parents. My heart just goes out to everyone dealing with it all. I highly recommend ""Drive,"" especially as an audiobook. This was a lot of fun, and put me in a good mood.

This one did not work for me.First published in May 2021, the contemporary romance, ""Happy Endings,"" by Thien-Kim Lam, stars a Vietnamese-American woman who is drawn into a second-chance romance with a Black man from New Orleans. There is a ton of cultural diversity in this book, and the heroine sells sex toys as well.Unfortunately, the male love interest, Andre, was a big bag of toxicity: emotionally unavailable, a bad communicator, openly angry, unsupportive, and insecure. I felt like he wasn't forced to learn any hard lessons or change his behavior at all. Which was highly problematic, since one of his harshest traits is to be really angry about the idea of women in their seventies enjoying sex. His self-inflicted core character problems are all solved by a giant deus ex machina plot-pull at the very end of the book. It was so out-of-nowhere that it gave me reader-whiplash.Sadly, the one time Andre and Trixie ever use a sex toy in bed, she has to use it on him, as a vibrating cock ring. I really wish Andre had taken more initiative, and put some effort into giving Trixie an orgasm. But Trixie has to get herself off in bed, using her hand, rather than the sex toy. Suffice it to say, I did not enjoy Andre as a male love interest at all. I think Trixie deserved a lot better. I didn't find the sex scenes in this book sexy at all, but tastes certainly differ on that.I personally would not recommend this book.But I commend the author for writing a romance starring characters who are so very different from the typical mold.

I know that people often mean well when they promote something they love, but statements like, ""Everyone should meditate!!"" or ""Everyone should be in therapy!!""

That is entirely accurate.I've enjoyed my share of Jane Austen, and while I do like novels that focus on manners and social mores, the characters in this book didn't move me. While Nina and Hector grew on me a little toward the end, and I did think the very last chapter was good, it wasn't enough for me to say I enjoyed this book. It was a solid, but fairly emotionless read. I love Moreno-Garcia's prose, and her fiction radiates with the force of her intelligence. On the strength of her prose alone, she is an engaging author to read.But characters, stakes, and a compelling plot catapult good writing into a gripping story, and this story, sadly, just didn't grip me. ""The Beautiful Ones"" is certainly a more realistic romance than what is featured in most romance novels. It's a story about people who are easily made small in life: through rejection, fear, awkwardness, and materialism. It's also an excellent examination of how some people need others to validate their own bad decisions by copying those same bad decisions, a plot aspect I really liked.The protagonists in this novel are not the strident, passionate, opinionated people who typically star in books. These people are the meek, mousy folks who don't usually get to play the lead roles. Cowardly, quiet, reticent, bumbling, and sometimes cruel: these are the leading traits in this book.This isn't a bad book. It just never stirred my passions or made me want to turn the page. I read every word. My lack of emotional investment probably means I will forget the details of this book very quickly, which makes me sad, because I hate wasted effort.But I love this author's work, and I think her books are worth reading, even if some of them aren't to my taste. I did not care for ""Mexican Gothic"" at all, but holy moly, do I love ""Gods of Jade and Shadow."" That book is a personal trip to reader-heaven for me. ""The Beautiful Ones"" just wasn't for me. While I'm glad to see so many insecure protagonists starring in a novel, especially deeply insecure leading men, these stories just don't light me up. I don't enjoy reading about a pack of pushovers, and this book stars a trio of them, plus some pushover side characters who just add to the pile-on. It got really tiresome.I'm glad I got a chance to read another book by Silvia Moreno-Garcia. Thank you to my friend Ronni for sharing this one with me.

My two brothers were as captivated by the tale as I was. It helped with the driving so much that my co-pilot brother is now an enthusiastic supporter of audiobooks, and has been listening to audiobooks during all of the long drives he's taken for work since we got back from the funeral.First published in 2011, and turned into a feature film in 2018, ""Ready Player One"" tells the story of Wade Watts, and his attempt to search for an Easter egg in an online, worldwide virtual reality world called the Oasis. I don't play video games, I don't identify as a gamer, and I did follow Gamergate in 2014-2015. None of that spoiled the pleasure I took in this novel. I think this story is bigger than a tale of ""nerd gatekeeping"" and toxic masculinity; I didn't see this book as gatekeeping or toxic at all. ""Ready Player One"" is like 'Willy Wonka meets '80s video games plus power fantasy and a good dose of wish fulfillment.' The novel is a gamer fetch quest with a traditional Luke Skywalker-esque protagonist. The tropes are standard fare, and a lot of fun. To reduce the character-building and plot of this book to saying the entire novel is merely a list of dated pop culture references and nerd-isms is inaccurate. ""Ready Player One"" takes traditional narrative and video game narrative and blends them together, to amazing effect. Since all of my brothers are gamers, they loved this book in ways that only a dedicated gamer can, and I was glad of it. But I readily loved this book, too, and I'll listen to the audiobook again one day. It was simply that fun and rewarding, and left me on that much of a high. Seeing Wade's transformation was so enjoyable. The plot of this book got so very dark at times, and that made the book's ending so good.I can understand why many readers are condemning this book, especially those who read it when it was first published, and reread it after Gamergate. But to me, Gamergate and this novel are two separate things. This book is just a basic power fantasy about an insecure teenage boy who ends up saving the world via 1980s video game skills. Yes, the story is centered on an able-bodied, young white man's journey. Many stories in America follow this script. In ""Ready Player One,"" prejudice and bias in many different forms are addressed in the novel. I didn't find this book to be some kind ""mindless, don't-look-too-close"" fun. There's a real beating heart in this book; it's a story about male insecurity and what it means to care about other people. I can understand why that seems like a Gamergate-supporting narrative to some readers. But to me, the narrative messaging in this book never felt toxic, but the opposite. I'll always remember listening to ""Ready Player One"" with my brothers, on a long hellish car ride, a trip that this book helped tremendously to make so much more bearable. A big thanks to Ernest Cline for putting some sunshine in a very dark time in my life.I'd recommend this novel to anyone.

These books follow the life and adventures of a young courtesan named Phèdre nó Delaunay, as she travels about in a fantasy country that's a lot like 1700s France.I picked up this book after the YouTube channel Unresolved Textual Tension did a book  for it. I have recently had to do some erotica research, and when I learned this book has ""a lot of BDSM and erotica in it,"" I thought it might add to my research.It didn't facilitate my research at all, and I have to say, I'm amazed that so many people in the BDSM community love this book, and sing its praises so much.In the novel, Phèdre is presented as a natural-born/God-made masochist (someone who feels pain and pleasure as one); at birth, she is marked by a god named Kushiel as a natural-born masochist with a ""red mote"" in one eye.By the time Phèdre is four years old, she is sold into sexual slavery, and her owners know she will be best suited to ""the BDSM house"" of the ""sacred brothels"" when she comes of age. (The terms in quotes are paraphrases for the flowery language the book uses.)In the worldbuilding of this book, prostitution is a sacred art, and yet the word ""whore"" is still an insult, and the johns who want to exercise sadism with the women they f*ck still do so in secret. The names of masochist female prostitutes are all public information; the names of sadist johns are kept secret. In all of the different kinds of sacred brothels in this story, small children are raised and groomed to be prostitutes.By the time Phèdre is ten, she is bought by a super-rich spymaster-pimp named Delauney, and he tells her he is going to train her to be a master spy as well as an expert whore, and he plans to arrange for his own personal enemies to be her johns, so he can use her to spy on them. When a lot of people are asked about ""female spies,"" the first thing that comes to many people's minds is women ""using their bodies/using sex"" to get information from men, and ""Kushiel's Dart"" leans into this stereotype in all ways. Phèdre uses sex to spy on people and fuel the wheels of political intrigue at court. Then she soon starts using prostitution to oversee a war and win battles, saving the fantasy country at the heart of this narrative. She saves the world with her expert f*cking and expert masochism. I can see why many readers like the wish fulfillment narrative of ""BDSM submissive sex slave saves the world,"" but this book really left a bad taste in my mouth. The author's prose style is quite lovely, and I don't mind reading about ""sacred prostitution,"" but the distant narrative voice and the plot content of this book just turned me right off.Phèdre is repeatedly whipped, scourged, flayed, burned, beaten, spit on, covered in semen, publicly shamed, and undergoes any number of brutal tortures and ""sex scenes"" that are closer to rape than anything I would associate with consenting BDSM. Phèdre's johns almost kill her more than once, and yet, her body always fully recovers, and recovers perfectly, every time. She never gets scars or permanent damage from any of this activity; she certainly never gets STIs or vaginal or anal infections. She definitely never gets throat infections from all of the brutally painful blow jobs she gives to complete strangers. She has a superpowered healing ability like Wolverine from the X-Men, a fact that goes unremarked upon in the text. As to birth control: the worldbuilding explains why sacred prostitutes do not have to worry about pregnancy: basically, Phèdre is always infertile unless she prays to God to have a baby, in which case, it is always her choice to conceive or not. No birth control needed.When I think of non-harmful, fully consensual BDSM, I think of people who are: communicating ahead of time about what they do and don't want; people who understand that all behavior from a dom or a sadist is consented to ahead of time by the masochist or the submissive, or that behavior *just doesn't happen,* because BDSM is supposed to be consensual and controlled, not just wild, unbridled violence.But Phèdre never has a conversation about what she does or doesn't want with any of her johns. The sex scenes read more like pornography than BDSM. Phèdre is pimped out to a john, and that john does *whatever* he wants to her, with no prior communication at all. The more the john flays and beats her, the more violent and completely abusive he is, the more Phèdre enjoys it. Or so the reader is told, or is forced to infer. Even when Phèdre almost dies, she is supremely proud of herself and glowing with pleasure the next morning. And the johns always give her much bigger tips after they've treated her so badly and gotten so out of control. Phèdre's complete and silent submission is always rewarded in the text. As a sex slave, Phèdre has to work long enough as a whore to be able to pay back her debt price, and she receives a giant tattoo (from a master tattooist) that covers her back to display the fact that she has paid off her ""marque."" Much is made in the text of how beautiful this back-covering tattoo is. And each time Phèdre was whipped after her tattoo was completed -- each time a john tore her back open and left her unconscious and bleeding, in desperate need of a surgeon -- all I could think was, ""that tattoo is fifty times ruined."" But of course, that's applying way too much logic into this book. Phèdre is a super-healing super-masochist, and she loves every minute of it. Her tattoo is exquisite and perfect, and as superpowered as the rest of her. I wouldn't call Phèdre's indoctrination since childhood to be ""a masochist prostitute"" to be the same as BDSM at all. I would hope that no one in the BDSM community would be okay with telling four-year-old children that they are God-made masochists. But maybe the ""born this way"" narrative in this novel is what gives so many BDSM practitioners solace: they feel born this way, and so reading about a main character who was also ""born this way"" makes them feel seen and heard.Readers who praise ""Kushiel's Dart"" often throw ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" under the bus, and say that Phèdre has sexual agency, while Anastasia Steele does not. But from where I stand, I'd say that's a false conclusion. Phèdre is told, over and over as a child, that she is a masochist; she is groomed to be a masochist; she is sold into sex slavery at age four; she is trained to be a prostitute; she is pimped out to her first john by age sixteen. In ""Fifty Shade of Grey,"" Anastasia is a twenty-two-year-old woman who has never been groomed to be a masochist, a prostitute, or a slave. In college, she meets a man who is a dom in secret, and she struggles with how to meet her own needs for a relationship with this guy without being his submissive. I'm not gonna stand here and say either book is better than the other, but I will say that I think Anastasia has far more sexual agency than Phèdre does.I didn't care for any of the characters in ""Kushiel's Dart."" If they all died in a fire, I'd be fine with it. I think these people are repulsive. I found the ""sacred prostitution"" being practiced in this book really repulsive. But tastes differ wildly on that, and this book certainly has its fans.I think this book is a super trope fest. There's a prostitute female spy, using sex and masochistic sexual submission to gain information and oversee a war. There's also a love story with a warrior priest sworn to celibacy: it's like ""The Thorn Birds"" meets Achilles, and the love story reminded me a lot of ""Serpent & Dove."" You've also got a depiction of BDSM that never shows the most important parts of fully consenting BDSM: the open communication, the verbal consent long before anyone picks up a whip, the trust and connection that happens before any violence begins.The BDSM in this book is just pornography with a superpowered prostitute who, much like the female porn actors on a porn set, moan and writhe with pleasure on command. I did not like this book, and I'd rather eat rotten shark meat soaked in urine than try to finish it.I wouldn't recommend ""Kushiel's Dart"" to anyone. But this book has a lot of diehard fans, and a lot of support in the BDSM community. I don't participate in BDSM, so I'm not a good authority on these points. But I genuinely didn't feel like this book showed the communication and prior consent that ought to be taking place in safe and fully consenting BDSM. One star for me personally.

I'm really glad I did, because I ended up loving this one.I'm not familiar with Jay Shetty at all. I've never listened to his podcast before. I had just seen this book popping up here on Goodreads, and decided to check it out.Shetty comes from a very privileged background, and this book is certainly framed for people of privilege: able-bodied, middle class or upper-middle class, neurotypical, educated, etc.But most books are entirely framed this way. Self-help books for this demographic are all about helping people clear up their own cognitive distortions that wreak havoc in their lives. ""Think Like a Monk"" certainly puts a heavy focus on self-sabotage, but it's also much more than just a book for helping privileged people get out of their own heads. For that reason, this book was so much more rewarding for me than many other self-help titles I've recently read, from ""Maybe You Should Talk to Someone"" to ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck."" Shetty's book spoke to me in a way those other (highly privileged) authors addressing first-world problems ever could.Shetty narrates his own audiobook, and he does a fine job. There were entire discs of this book that I listened to twice, just because it put me in such a good headspace. I felt soothed, calmed, empowered. Like life is just a much easier place to be in, altogether. It was the raw simplicity of it all that I enjoyed so much. Maybe for other readers, the concepts in this book are a revelation. Or maybe some readers might find the concepts so juvenile that the lack of new information is a problem. But I didn't find that to be the case. For me, it was the way Shetty distilled Buddhist concepts into such an easy, chatty style that made for great listening. This was definitely one of the best self-help books I've ever read. On late nights when I'm tired, and have a huge pile of dishes to wash and a house to clean up, this is exactly the kind of audiobook that helps me to have on in the background: a friendly voice reminding me that life is really simple, and gratitude is simple as well.Five stars.

After our trip, I still had three CDs left to go, which I listened to on my own. To my delight, my husband checked in on how it was going. ""What is happening in that stupid book now?"" he would ask each time I traded out a CD. And of course, he asked me how it ended. The truth of how this novel ends is astoundingly juvenile. But then, the entire book is juvenile, so it truly ends as it read.""Red Queen"" is fundamentally a plot of petty high school drama written as ""allegory dystopian world with X-Men superpowered-rulers and wannabe-Hunger-Games vibes."" But really, you're just reading about backstabbing teens enrolled at the same high school together, dressed up as warfare and military coups and stuff. It's brain-meltingly silly stuff. Other critical readers of ""Red Queen"" have stated that they found no one to root for in this book, from the protagonist, Mare Barrow, to any of her friends, family, and allies. The only person I liked was Mare's sister, who gets her hand smashed in the first 20 pages or so and gets dropped like a hot potato right out of the book. Mare never sends a healer to her family's house to mend her sister's smashed hand. Mare is a real piece of work, I tell you. I'd say she has the brain of an amoeba but that is disrespectful of amoebas.The ""epic action-packed ending"" that suddenly halts mid-action scene, jumps ahead in time, and picks up with the characters all safely out of harm's way sometime later -- this was the most mind-numbing ass-pull of a book ending that I have read in some time. I'm glad I wasn't invested in any of this, because this book is just defiantly thoughtless.If you enjoy counting plot holes as you read, then I highly recommend this novel. This book turns in an Olympic Gold-Medal-winning plot hole performance. *chef's kiss*Three stars as a research read. One star for me personally.

I realized that the publicly crafted story I had always heard Michelle Obama deliver did not match the life she had actually grown up with, or what kind of person she was. I had mistakenly thought she'd had a difficult upbringing in the South Side of Chicago, and that she was an intellectual who was solidarity-oriented, like her husband. But these things are not true. Michelle Obama actually had a very stable middle class upbringing in a very loving home. She is certainly not an intellectual, though she did graduate from Harvard Law. And she only became solidarity-oriented after meeting and falling in love with Barack in her first job after law school.Michelle Obama never cared for politics, and she states in the book that she never saw the point of politics, either; not until Barack came into her life, and she was ""dragged""/forced to enter into a politically minded life. What is astoundingly clear in ""Becoming"" is that Michelle Obama grew up in the profound safety of the American status quo, and the status quo worked for her just fine. She started out middle class and moved into the upper-middle class via higher education. She wasn't oriented toward any idea of lifting others up, not until Barack came along: the catalyst who made her question her values and what she wanted in life, as regards her career.By the end of ""Becoming,"" Michelle tells the reader that she has no interest in ever running for political office, a statement that every previous page of this book has already made obvious. Michelle Obama is a good, decent person, and she makes it abundantly clear that she never paid attention to politics, or cared much at all about the outcomes of politics. Even once she became the First Lady, her aversion to politics remained strong. I could never understand why the Right hated Michelle Obama so much. But as I listened to her read aloud her own memoir in this audiobook, I gained a lot of clarity on why she was so resented and despised by so many Americans. There's a certain level of myopia and privilege, cluelessness and entitlement that is really hard to take in this book; the Michelle Obama who is revealed in this book is super off-putting. It was jarring to realize I had been so mistaken about her. For me, this memoir was such a boring and lackluster read that it was a struggle to get through the whole thing. The first third of the book was especially brutal, since Michelle focuses so much of the first half of the book on her early childhood. It was immediately clear that her idea of ""the struggle"" is a matter of perspective, and my perspective on ""a difficult childhood in the South Side"" in no way matches hers. Michelle Obama has led a life full of profound good fortune. It made my jaw fall open in shock, several times, to realize just how much privilege and good fortune that Michelle had grown up with. And as I reflected on how self-centered Michelle had always been (before falling in love with Barack, when her worldview started to open up a bit more), I came away from this book realizing that Barack would have never gotten elected, if not for Michelle. Her life and her self-centered worldview gave Barack's personal narrative a wholesome, relatable self-interest that so many American voters could identify with and relate to. Especially affluent white voters, and especially affluent white women.My takeaways from ""Becoming"" are in no way the intended takeaways of the author. Michelle Obama is touting a message of hard work and achievement, a narrative of middle-class self-interest that has brief moments of solidarity because she ended up being married to a man who was all about solidarity. I can understand why so many readers on Goodreads loved this book, and gave it a gushing 5 stars.For me, this memoir was a slog, and I'm truly amazed that I was able to listen to the whole thing. This book taught me that Michelle Obama was not the person I had always thought she was. And I can understand, so much better now, why so many people on the Right resent her so much.Which is not to say that I feel that resentment is deserved. It's certainly not, and neither are the many lies the Right has spread about Michelle. This book just made me reflect on how all of us have privileges we often aren't aware that we have. Michelle Obama grew up with a *lot* of privilege, and had a far more privileged life than many of the rural, impoverished people I grew up with, regardless of what color their skin was.  I have a couple of friends who have DNF'd ""Becoming"" because the first third of this book is so brutally boring. But on Goodreads as a whole, this book just took off in popularity, and has been much beloved.This memoir ended up being a market research read, and not a book I personally enjoyed in any way. I wouldn't recommend it, but I feel like I'm definitely in the minority opinion on this one.Three stars....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 18, 2022","Jun 07, 2022","May 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38746485-becoming

It was great to hear how scholarship has advanced, concerning so many pivotal historical facts: the writing of the canonical gospels (Mark stayed the same, but Matthew, Luke, and John's dates have all been updated), the Q source material, Paul's trip to Rome; the list is extensive. This book does an excellent job trying to bridge the gap between historical scholarship and common perceptions of religious history. It can be such a dense, scary undertaking for non-academics to wade into waters like this, especially if this is a person's first introduction to academic biblical studies. I think Aslan does it as well as anyone possibly can.""Zealot"" is so good that I listened to the entire audiobook twice. Aslan narrates his own text, and the audiobook is superb. Five million stars.

I *really* loved the first 90-ish pages of this novel. Kinew's prose and worldbuilding initially just blew me away. I loved the characters, the virtual reality game world, the antagonists, the Indigenous cultural details, and how the story flips so seamlessly between the real world, VR, and AR (augmented reality).The opening of this book absolutely thrilled and delighted me. And then on page 95, things began to go off the rails for me. My enjoyment dipped, dipped again, and eventually plummeted into a freefall. The train of this book just kept on wrecking itself, with increasingly spectacular collisions, right up until the very end. I didn't think the book's many heavy themes were handled well at all. The second half of this novel is a giant rando spiral of increasingly traumatic events that led to the most non-ending ending, a final scene that left me feeling a mix of despair, revulsion, and rage. In the beginning of the book, the author portrays his characters and plot realistically. By the end, the reader is so far away from anything remotely resembling reality that it just left my head spinning. The fact that this book ends with the main character running off to ""kill people"" (kill enemy avatars) in the game world instead of finding the strength to get back to the hospital and be with her family and dying brother was just WTF level enraging. There are so many good things in this book, so many components I loved. Feng's character arc, especially his final Spirit World-type revelation, was powerful. I hated Feng as a character, and I deeply hated the ""love story"" in this book, but the presence of a complicated, nuanced antagonist was certainly one of the things I loved in this book. But the good parts didn't save the horrible stuff. And oh my, was there a lot of horrible stuff. A lot of unresolved, rando-trainwreck horrible stuff. This was a great research read for gamer elements in fiction. But as a novel to be read outside of my own personal research interests, this book is a hard pass. I'd personally give this book negative stars. But I know this one just isn't for me.

This book is down with the patriarchy, ladies, and it knows it. There is never a missed opportunity to portray men, boys, and teenage dudes in a good light and all women as nasty vipers on every page of this book. If you vibe with internalized misogyny, I know this book is absolutely delightful, and I can totally see why books like this have made Elin Hilderbrand ""the queen of the beach-reads.""The three female ""best friends"" in this book are petty, selfish, underhanded, and deviant, except for the ""mother + housewife"" character (Kayla), who is just vapid and clueless before she becomes underhanded and deviant. All three women destroy their lives by keeping secrets and then stabbing each other in the back when those corrosive secrets come to light. The book ends with the women having learned nothing, just bizarrely making a pact to keep more corrosive secrets from the people they love, and set up another generation of children to deal with more trauma and senseless f*ckery.Why would Kayla promise Antoinette that she would keep her pregnancy a secret, and deprive her own son of knowing his daughter?? This made absolutely no f*cking sense and I resent this book mightily for pushing this illogical crap on me.

She must immediately gather a team of warriors together to confront a number of monsters and Dark Wizards threatening her home and all she holds dear. I am such a noob when it comes to all forms of modern gaming (tabletop Dungeons & Dragons as well as all of the many video games, Role-Playing Games/RPGs, and Massively Multiplayer Online Games/MMOs that are either based on or inspired by D&D) that I had no idea how to make sense of this book. I read the first 40% and was increasingly overwhelmed by my level of ignorance. I immediately solicited help from YouTube and a number of friends. I had to learn that there is such a thing as Character Class/Character Category, and certain standard things that go into those character archetypes, such as Clerics, Rogues, Dragonkin, etc. In the games, these Character Classes are grouped together into diverse teams who then work together in various forms of battle and combat. This novel assumes that the reader possesses a basic working knowledge of these character and plot conventions, and my friends who game certainly had no trouble reading this book. Two of my friends who play tabletop D&D said the opening chapters of this book sounded like a D&D game. Two of my friends who are obsessed with video games and read litRPGs said this book read like regular high fantasy to them, not like Gamer Lit. The reader's individual experience of gaming plays a role in how this book feels to read. For me, being able to understand the book meant I needed to do some serious gaming research, and not be such a noob, because basic gaming terminology is not defined in the book. Reading this novel without knowing anything about gaming seemed more difficult to me than reading C.S. Lewis without any understanding of Christianity. I think the majority of readers who enjoy science fiction and fantasy novels also enjoy gaming, and this novel was a great opportunity for me to learn a lot more about the gaming and video game industries as a whole. Once I was fluent in the book's terminology, there were a few things in the story that made me uncomfortable. In the second half of the book, Akita oversees the torture and execution of two prisoners. While Akita herself doesn't perform the torture or execute the two prisoners herself, she is glad to see it done. Some of my friends who play video games said they don't play any RPGs that feature a positive view of torture and capital punishment, but in my online research, I saw that there are some video games that promote this. I never enjoy seeing a story's heroes (the morally-righteous protagonists) promote a positive view of torture and capital punishment. I would rather see a story's villains promoting torture and capital punishment. It makes me deeply uncomfortable when a story's heroes engage in and promote such things. I'd rather see the heroes sentence enemies to lifelong imprisonment than execution; but I do understand that many popular fantasy novels promote execution. (Ned Stark, for instance, in the novel ""A Game of Thrones."")Akita also served food and drink to the audience right before this execution, treating the prisoners' torture and death like a party, and that didn't sit very well with me, either. I'm sure there are probably MMOs that feature events like this (large groups of people enjoying refreshments before the hero team kills the condemned), and if I understood those aspects of gaming better, this scene might have felt more commonplace to me.I can also see a lot of readers having no problem with Akita and her team's behavior, because the book makes it clear that the people they are executing were traitors. Once Akita and her friends face their first Leviathan, the action in this book keeps increasing. The monsters get more and more powerful, and require more and more resources to fight. There are a lot of creative and creepy details in this book. I especially enjoyed the appearance of a Basilisk, a goblin army, and the eerie ""pods"" discovered later in the story. The dragons and other flying creatures in this book were also a treat. There is a large cast of characters in the novel, and new characters are introduced throughout the book, right up until the end. It's clear that the authors are building up a large and extensive world to fill multiple books in this series. The character names are all really creative, and there is a huge amount of diversity in all the different character types used in the story. I would guess that fans of World of Warcraft and other MMOs would definitely enjoy this novel. I would recommend ""Pact of the Keeps: Blackwing Keep"" to anyone who enjoys high fantasy. Especially if you are familiar with the gaming conventions used in this narrative, I'm sure you'll find the battles, flying dragons, and monsters that much more fun to read about.And if you're a noob like me, this book is a great opportunity to learn more about D&D and video games. I know I sure learned a *lot* from reading this book. (I also suspect that a certain fighter mentioned at the end of the book will appear in Book 2... I have a hunch we haven't seen the last of her.)There's a great cliffhanger at the end of this novel. It's an excellent way to propel the reader right into the next book in this series. I am sure Akita and her friends will have many more trials and dangers ahead. The humor and camaraderie of her team is really delightful, and the adventures they face are nonstop.

I first read this book a few years after it was published, either while I was still in college or shortly after.

Parts of this book haven't aged well, but on the whole, it remains a spectacular read. Overall, I remembered the contents well enough that I skimmed and skipped a few parts. I also found Angier's prose style really distracting sometimes. I think that prompted so much of the skimming and skipping this time. But Angier's zany, inventive word choice does provoke laughter at times. Her prose is also quite moving in places. This book still has the power to make me tear up and feel all the feels. This isn't a book I would recommend to myself now; as a work of nonfiction, I've moved beyond this book. But I remain utterly grateful that this book exists, and that I read it when I did.

Part bildungsroman, part romcom, part autism-esque slice-of-life caper, this book has a huge fan base, and this novel is much beloved.I definitely wasn't the right audience for this one. Honeyman's debut novel was the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard to me, or a cat being thrown in an icy bath tub.I can certainly see the appeal. ""Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine"" is a book that celebrates the joys and playful absurdities of modern middle class life, and touts the message that many people do better in life when they have pets to love, authentic friendships, romantic love, supportive family members, meaningful work, and seek counseling if they become suicidal. I definitely support all of that. But the book still felt really damaging to me, regardless of how much I support its messaging. The character of Eleanor is written as a trauma victim who is in a deep state of denial, and she is also written as if she has autism. Neither the words ""denial"" nor ""autism"" are ever mentioned in the text. But the prose presents these things pretty straightforwardly. I have adult friends who are both autistic and survivors of severe childhood trauma, trauma that is every bit as severe as the trauma Eleanor has survived. None of those people are as clueless, selfish, openly judgmental, or ridiculous as Eleanor Oliphant is. All of them are profoundly more empathetic than many other people I know, and would rush to help an old man who had fallen in the street. All of them know what a fast food restaurant is. None of them would seek to make over their life by bumbling into a waxing salon. My autistic friends also need a lot more financial and personal household support than Eleanor Oliphant does. And my friends with facial deformities and facial scarring face a lot of horrific ableism in life, ableism that Eleanor is blissfully free of.The details in this book just didn't add up to me. Eleanor didn't realistically read as autistic or as a trauma victim (a survivor of severe childhood trauma), but as an infantilized caricature of a childhood trauma survivor who might also have autism. This book was deeply insulting to me. I honestly just felt disgusted. I think this novel is great for people who can see Eleanor as a purely fictional character, and enjoy her as such. I kept thinking of my own adult friends and loved ones who have Eleanor's background and traits, and nothing about Eleanor matched up with them. They also face so many systemic barriers and hardships in life that were nowhere addressed or even mentioned in this book.I'm glad that so many readers find this book heartwarming and enjoyable to read. I just wasn't the right audience for it at all. One star for me personally.

I always picture the main character as Emily Blunt. Lo (in ""Cabin 10""), Rowan (in ""Key""), and Liz (in ""One By One"") all sound the same: women with lots of emotional problems struggling in low-wage jobs and awash in reactivity and mediocrity. ""One By One"" actually has two narrators, Liz and Erin, and even posh, educated Erin was still 'Emily Blunt' in my head. That's because Blunt played the main character in the film adaptation of Paula Hawkins' ""The Girl on the Train,"" and all of these psychological thrillers just blend together in my head. But I love Emily Blunt, so this is fine by me. I like seeing her play the starring role in all of these books, because she's lovely to look at and it helps me get through these research reads.""One By One"" was definitely my favorite book by Ruth Ware so far. I laughed out loud several times. None of the other books had humor in them, but this one had quite a bit, and it made the book so much more fun to read. ""The Turn of the Key"" and ""One By One"" both featured a narrative plot device that I really don't like. I've learned my lesson, having been burned as a reader by ""Turn of the Key,"" and I spoiled the plot of this book before reading it, just so Ware's favored 'writer trick' didn't make me end up hating the book. I know I'm not a fan of this plot device; I actively hate it. It feels so cheap to me that I blow a gasket.But I could enjoy ""One By One"" because I knew what the narrative ass-pull would be, and that meant I could nod along with the narrative ass-pulling as it was happening, rather than feel frustrated and cheated by ""the big twist/plot reveal"" late in the story. It still amazes me that so many readers like that writing device. I despise it. Erin's POV is what helped me genuinely enjoy this book. I felt like Ware finally gave me a narrator who didn't make me long to drink cyanide or jump off a bridge. The trope of the ""secret sociopath"" in ""One By One"" was certainly problematic AF in this book. And not just because I don't like Ware's plot devices. The killer in this book is already the type of person people generally bully and despise in real life. When an author writes a story villain with characteristics that are already loathed in real life, I think the book is just perpetuating more damage: furthering the social stigmas and harm (especially ostracism) that these people face in real life. Relatedly, none of these popular psychological thriller authors are ever writing realistic psychopaths or sociopaths into their novels, because reading a realistic portrayal of these people is almost unbearable. Outside of a medical or nonfiction context, a realistic depiction of the inner thoughts of psychopaths and sociopaths is so repulsive as to be nearly impossible to stomach. So instead of reality, fiction readers get ""sociopaths"" like the murderer in ""One By One."" Fantasy mental illness really annoys me. But many psychological thrillers annoy me, so this book is hardly special in that. The beginning of ""One By One"" was pretty boring, but then it picked up, and by the time the murders began, the book was engaging and easy to read. I greatly appreciated how often this book made me laugh. Ware really flexed her craft with some satire and wit in this novel, and I was so here for it.Sure, this book is problematic; Ware's choice of villain in this book is not my favorite. But this antagonist still made for a really great villain. Stereotypes and social stigmas are powerful stuff, and Ware got that machinery all a-rollin' to make the reader hate the villain in this book even more.I think this is her best book yet. Some authors grow better with age, and their writing improves with each book. I think Ware is one of those writers.I'd recommend ""One By One"" to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers. I'd especially recommend this one to fans of Ruth Ware. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 14, 2022","Feb 20, 2022","Feb 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892433-one-by-one

The act of reading it is almost asI first read Franz Kafka's ""The Trial"" in 2011, and it's one of the most haunting, disturbing tales I've ever read. The act of reading it is almost as excruciating as the content. The story of Josef K.'s nonsensical arrest, trial, and execution is a maximum torture ride. *Very* effective. But not a ride I was keen to repeat.It took me eleven more years to finally crack this book open again and read ""The Metamorphosis."" And oh my gosh, is this story *quite* different from ""The Trial."" ""The Metamorphosis"" is every bit as tragic as the story of Josef K., but Gregor's overnight transformation into a 3-foot beetle is also infused with humor and warmth. And it's such a very short story, too. Only 49 pages long (in this edition). The heartbreaking, short life of Franz Kafka (1883-1924) is just a whole mood on its own. Like Charlotte Brontë, and Jane Austen, and so many other brilliant writers who died way too soon, every time I think of Kafka dying so young, I just want to wring my hands and sob. I'm 41 now, and by the time I turn 42 I will have outlived Franz Kafka (and Jane Austen). (I've already outlived Charlotte Brontë, who died at age 38.) ""The Metamorphosis"" was first published in 1915. ""The Trial"" was published posthumously, in 1925. I think these are both outstanding works. They make for incredibly painful reading. But if a reader has the stamina for it, I highly recommend these novellas. My biggest 'ask' of any piece of creative writing is to show me something real. Well, Kafka knows how to do exactly that. His prose is a mirror held up to humanity. Look if you like. It's beautiful, it's horrible, it's the byzantine mess of bureaucracy, it's the betrayal of family, it's the petty and the mundane infused with the divine.These stories are the torturous music of literature.

I did not enjoy ""Normal People,"" but I found it more engaging than ""Beautiful World, Where Are You."" From the outset, this story bored me a lot more; I found myself skipping and skimming a lot, especially at the beginning. Rooney is at her best when her prose revels in the banal, and this novel is an overabundance of ordinary middle class and upper-middle class life. One protagonist (a twenty-something named Alice) has achieved fame and wealth as an author, but still hates herself. The other protagonist (a twenty-something named Eileen) lives on less than twenty thousand dollars a year working at a small literary magazine, has no societal accolades to speak of, and also hates herself. The plot centers on the fact that these two women, who email each other a lot and proclaim to love each other, are actually full of self-loathing. As a result of all of their self-hatred, these women are actually not very good at communicating with themselves or with each other. Compounding matters is the fact that Alice's fame and fortune only exacerbate the extent that she hates herself (rather than alleviating her self-loathing in any way, as both women would have expected). Fortunately for both women, there are a pair of twenty-something men who are willing and able to examine these women's unexamined psyches, identify the women's unconscious self-hatred and unconscious unmet expectations, and show these women that love is possible. With tender, openhearted conversation, Felix and Simon are each able to walk their sexual partner through her own cognitive distortions, and then convince her that he loves her (Felix loves Alice, and Simon loves Eileen). If these men had each been trained psychologists or therapists, I might have gone with this. But Felix is an emotionally abusive blue-collar f*ckboy who uses drugs and watches ""rough anal"" porn, and Simon is an emotionally unavailable politician's assistant who regularly attends Church; neither man is written in any way as to find his eleventh-hour brilliance in the counseling of an emotionally self-destructive sexual partner believable or realistic at all.But for those readers who are into the Man Will Save You vibe this book is rockin':Once the women have the love of these amazingly astute men, after both men are able to speak to these women the way a trained therapist would (pages 331-334 for Alice, and pages 334-340 for Eileen), these women can finally break through their own psychological barriers and be kinder toward their male sexual partners as well as toward their female best friend, and the women heal their latest fight with a tearful hug (Alice and Eileen share a long-awaited bestie-hug on pages 340-341, right after their men have psychologically healed them).With the amazing love and support of these inexplicably therapist-esque male partners, both women receive a romantic HEA, and Eileen gets a baby to boot. Marriage and mamahood for the win!Since I didn't enjoy ""Normal People,"" I had an awareness that I would probably not enjoy Rooney's follow-up novel, and that was definitely the case. While I can understand the appeal of all this prose expounding upon the ennui and modern weariness of the white middle/upper-middle class, it's just not for me. I do think it is brave of Rooney to write books starring people who are not self-reflective and severely lack any passion in life, I just prefer the way other authors do it, like Susan Minot in ""Evening.""I picked this book up because I was curious to know how Rooney handled the topic of porn. It's a taboo word in most contemporary fiction, and more taboo still for a literary novel. The word ""porn"" is only used twice in the book (page 125 and page 127), and leads to a very brief discussion about porn on page 128. After Alice shares that she doesn't watch porn, Felix is emotionally abusive, and tries to put Alice down because his watching porn makes him feel inferior to her, so he accuses Alice of trying to be ""superior"" to him (though Alice never said a word about it, and what is actually happening is Felix cognitively distorting the whole situation on his own). Felix tears her down by saying some rude things to her. (He does this many more times in the novel, up until the very end of the book, when he is suddenly speaking like a trained therapist.) But back to the porn stuff:On the next page (pg 129), Felix tells Alice he has ""honestly done a lot worse"" than watching porn, and he tells Alice about having sex with an underage girl (age 16 or 17), and that he also coerced a girl in high school into having unprotected sex with him, got her pregnant, and never spoke to her again, leaving her to deal with getting an abortion all alone (page 130). None of Felix's remarks are delivered with much emotional sensitivity; he is simply a man unloading, dumping his negative memories and emotions on Alice in that fucked-up way a lot of people do, when people are just suddenly spewing a lot of horrible shit on someone all at once, unbidden. Since Felix and Alice barely know each other, and only recently met on Tinder, this behavior did not endear me to Felix at all. So when Felix later reveals 'Cosmic Therapist Powers' near the end of the novel, I was mentally reciting the words, 'F*ck off, book' over and over again. But hey, if readers want to believe that an emotionally puerile and verbally abusive man like Felix can suddenly intuit a woman's unconscious cognitive distortions and heal her self-hating psyche, power to 'em, you know? Power to 'em.Anyway, porn never comes up again in the book, and neither does anal sex. These characters never have anal sex or discuss having anal sex at all. The sex they *do* have is incredibly dull and passionless, and I am completely unconvinced that either Alice or Eileen ever had an orgasm. I think both women are lying about having orgasms with either one of these men. The robotic, forced sex they were having was just... not good, to put it lightly.I wouldn't personally recommend this book to anyone, but I'm not a Rooney fan, so my opinion on the matter should be largely ignored. For many fans of Rooney's work, this book was just as good or even better than ""Normal People."" I would just say that the two leading men in this novel (Felix and Simon) are not as handsome or as desirable as Connell (the male love interest in ""Normal People""), and Connell never turned into Marianne's eleventh-hour, untrained personal therapist, either. Marianne also had this ""sexy edge"" to her self-destructive impulses, engaging in really abusive BDSM and asking Connell to hit her in the face while they're having sex. Neither Alice nor Eileen engage in any kind of behavior like that. The sex in ""Beautiful World, Where Are You"" is very pedestrian and mundane. (Awkward, passionless, and dull.) But both women get the HEAs that Marianne didn't, so at least there is that. One-star read for me personally.But I know I'm not at all the right audience for this book, so three stars....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 08, 2022","Feb 11, 2022","Feb 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56597885-beautiful-world-where-are-you

I had no idea Adlerian psychology even existed, much less what it was.This book is *phenomenal.* Written in the same form as Plato's dialogues, the book takes the reader through a long conversation (over multiple days) between an unnamed young man and an older philosopher. The philosopher teaches the boy about Adlerian psychology in the course of their long conversation.I spotted this audiobook at my library in January 2022, and listened to it twice in one month. I know it's only a matter of time before I borrow the book and listen to it again. So much of how I am in the world, the person I am, was here in this book, and I'd never heard it articulated in so many words before. I think that's because Adlerian psychology has been absorbed in so many other places that it's possible to already know the essence of this book without ever having the foundational principles laid out so clearly. And for as close as I already am to thinking like an Adlerian, there was still plenty of helpful information here for me, things to help me improve my quality of life so much more. For as much as I loved this book, I do know that the majority of people think and operate in an anti-Adlerian way, completely opposite of the psychology laid out in this book. While the book does not reverse-engineer itself for the reader, if you do reverse-engineer the book for yourself, you might find it helpful in working with others better; you might gain a greater understanding of what they are thinking, and why. I know this was certainly the case for me: I was able to see into others so much more clearly, to understand their (non-Adlerian) psychology a lot better.Highly recommended.

Somerset Maugham, has twice been adapted to film: in 1946 and in 1984. The 1984 film adaptation stars Bill Murray, and is one of my favorite movies of all time.In February 2022, I finally committed myself to reading the novel. I picked this book up a few years ago from a free box, a paperback copy in mint condition. Well, this copy is a little scuffed from moving with me in 2021, but it's going back to the free box now. I've read it, and I wasn't impressed.I felt like reading this book just made me suffer. The novel is loaded with so much misogyny and casual sexism, that even the heroic Larry Darrell makes outrageously sexist comments at the end of the book. He's nothing like the character Bill Murray plays.Larry in the book reads like a modern-day minimalist hipster (an able-bodied single white guy) spouting highly romanticized 'Western hot takes' about Hinduism. The penultimate chapter, in which Larry sits down with the narrator (Maugham himself as a character in the story) and spends an entire night waxing on about how much better Hinduism is than Christianity (because it helps people more, and leads to greater spiritualism, a spiritualism that is free of hypocrisy), and talking about how 'Orientals' have the belief in reincarnation 'in their blood,' and other such fun reductionist, racist stuff -- I was ready to about have a stroke. I hated the experience of reading this book. Sometimes reading a book is just forcing yourself to choke down a rotten meal, and that's what this novel was to me. I hated it. To be fair: Maugham wrote the book before Second Wave feminism entered public consciousness, something the filmmakers benefited from -- because holy hell, did the 1984 film drain the intense misogyny right out of this story. The movie also got rid of the relentless fat-shaming and female body-shaming that is an incessant feature of this novel. By wiping out Maugham as a character, and giving the narrator's 'heroic' deeds at the end of the book to Larry instead (his kindness toward Elliott Templeton getting a much-longed-for party invitation, burying Sophie Macdonald, and confronting Isabel Maturin over her role in Sophie's death), the movie not only wipes out the incessant narrative fat-shaming and overt misogyny, but also elevates Larry's character into someone far more noble than what he is in the book. Hats off to the screenwriters, in every way. My very favorite line from the movie: when Larry tells Isabel, ""There is no reward"" -- this line (this entire sentiment!) does not even *exist* in the book. Neither does many of Larry's other great lines from the film, such as his open grappling with Piedmont's death (in WWI), or the way that he frames the question of ""Why did I live, and Piedmont died?"" as a guiding question that compels him to shun societal expectations of worshipping status and money, and to quest for personal truth instead. And most crucially: the way the movie frames Larry's high human worth as his contribution to others: this was not in the novel. Movie Larry is nonjudgmental and deeply compassionate, a man full of kind actions toward others, but when people are openly cruel (the way Isabel is openly cruel toward Sophie), Larry also calls that out (in the film). He does no such thing in the book. Book Larry is detached (framing his enlightenment as his ability to be completely detached from others), and he ends the story by going off to New York to drive a taxi, in the dark days (unmentioned in the novel except for one line on the second-to-last page) of the rise of the Third Reich. (The novel says that war broke out; the reader knows the narrator is referring to WWII.)One of my favorite lines from the novel, when the narrator is speaking of Christianity as a whole: ""And when he remembers that it has laid upon mankind the bitter burden of the sense of sin that has darkened the beauty of the starry night and cast a baleful shadow on the passing pleasures of a world to be enjoyed, he must chuckle as he murmurs: give the devil his due."" (pages 208-209) --Well, my enjoyment of that line gets completely wiped out when all of the romanticized Hinduism stuff appears later. Hindus *certainly* believe in sin: that wrongdoing carries a spiritual cost paid by one's soul. And this belief in sin has definitely been a ""bitter burden"" to Hindus. The cruelties of caste are not named in the novel (caste is unmentioned in the novel: because you can't romanticize Hinduism without ignoring caste), but I'll say this to the author: you can't throw stones at Christianity without throwing them right at Hinduism, too. But the book doesn't do that; it doesn't level with Hinduism. The novel just shows Larry, having achieved enlightenment/possible union with the Absolute, heading off alone to work a low-wage job in New York, for no other reason than because he wants to. Affluent white people have long used 'the Orient' as a place to 'expand their spiritualism' while ignoring the societal problems (and endemic injustices) in 'the Orient.' Places like India, especially, have been great playgrounds for self-gratifying white intellectualism, and that is abundantly clear in this novel; that is how India is treated in this book. Book Larry ignores the Third Reich altogether, and leaves Europe right before WWII breaks out. Movie Larry would never have done such a thing. Movie Larry would have stayed in France, because movie Larry wasn't detached from the world, but deeply entwined with the fates of his fellow human beings. And movie Larry certainly would have been aware of the rise of the Nazis. Hell, even book Larry spends multiple years in Germany in the mid-1930s: watching the Nazis in action!! But book Larry has not one f*cking word to say about Nazism. He's just on a spiritual journey, one that is completely separate from the rest of life, even when he's in Germany for multiple years.The movie is just so much *smarter* than this book. The film takes all of the long, dry narrative summary of the novel and puts it into active scene. And the conclusions of the movie are so much richer and deeper than the conclusions of the book. Reading the novel gave me a much deeper appreciation for the brilliance of the film. The screenwriters removed all the really shitty stuff from the story, and enhanced this book in all ways. I remain shocked and disappointed that my favorite lines of dialogue from the film just don't even exist in this book. Maugham never wrote it. The screenwriters did. I'm so glad that Bill Murray went on a personal odyssey to get the 1984 film made. It's a gift to the world, and I love it.I'd recommend the book to anyone who enjoys stories about single white men telling capitalism to f*ck off and finding their bliss as single white men: doing whatever they like, as they like it. This novel is a huge dose of wish fulfillment, misogyny, and a lot of Orientalist romanticizing. I want to give the book a single star, because I disliked it that much.

But other tropes (such as: my roommate is bi and f*cks everything constantly, my boyfriend has such a giant dick it will hardly fit inside of me, my female friend has to be the catalyst for every romantic thing I do) are not my favorite. A lot of the popular tropes in this book are ones I feel neutral toward; some of them I feel openly hostile toward.I also kept getting squicked out by the student/teacher vibes between Olive and Adam. Granted, he isn't *her* teacher, but Olive came off sounding *so* young in this book, she just kept reading like a high school girl falling in love with a college professor to me. I think this is probably why I lost my way (as a reader) and gave up on the book after 150 pages. I skim-read the sex scene near the end of the book, and some of the chapters after that. But I just wasn't feelin' it; this romance didn't sweep me away. My favorite parts of the book were all of the silly food discussions, even though one was super gross to me (Olive has a 'beer and s'mores' night with her friend Anh... ew). But the unicorn frappuccinos, pumpkin spice lattes, all the joking and banter about salt 'n vinegar chips, Twix chocolate bars: I was here for it. Having this stuff on the page is what lightens the book into super high fluff land. Sometimes it's just nice to get a dose of saccharine this large straight into your bloodstream. Hazelwood's prose is also *really* good. Content aside, this book is very well written. On a sentence level, this is some of the strongest romance writing I've ever read. Her word choice, syntax and grammar, sentence variety, scene description, dialogue: this stuff was on point. I'd recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys romantic comedies and nonstop silliness. If you're looking for romantic banter, research scientists acting like teenagers, and a dash of smut, you should definitely pick this book up....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Feb 05, 2022","Feb 06, 2022","Feb 05, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56732449-the-love-hypothesis

The book interweaves Sasaki's personal narrative with sections of how-to tips for adopting minimalism yourself.I listened to this audiobook over a couple of days in January 2022, and it was thoughtful and enjoyable. I've done many deep-dives into minimalism already, but I always appreciate hearing the same concepts again. It's a good mindfulness practice for me.Sasaki is a single, middle-class, able-bodied man, and this book is overwhelmingly aimed at that audience: single, able-bodied, middle-class men. I don't fit the target audience for this book, and I've found the minimalists who are intimately connected to other people much more interesting to listen to, because I'm not someone who is single or comes from a family in which everyone is financially independent and self-sustaining. I have a much higher degree of interdependence and communal connection to others in my daily life, whereas Sasaki is extremely cut off from familial obligations as well as an immediate family to care for. I'm glad this book exists and that I had a chance to listen to it on audiobook. I always love reflecting on minimalism. I find it encouraging to listen to tips on how to pare down my belongings. I think my life would be a lot easier if I owned a house with a garage that I could store lots of things in, but I'm continuously faced with much harder choices due to my limited space, and books like ""Goodbye, Things"" bolster me to see the benefit of living with less, even though I find enforced minimalism really challenging at times.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in minimalism, or anyone going through a sudden, unexpected downsize.

The story features the kind of grim and depressing ending that critics with MFAs and downtown studio lofts often call ""transcendent."" I wasn't a fan of Obreht's 2011 debut, ""The Tiger's Wife,"" but I ended up reading it twice in order to carefully align all of the various tangents and plotlines together. I'd hoped that by making concrete sense of the story I could somehow determine why the book was so lauded with praise and awards.Even after all of the hours I spent devoted to that task, my conclusion was: bafflement mixed with frustration. The book did not grip me or move me in any way. Even after a second read, it just left me feeling cold. ""Inland"" reads a *lot* like ""The Tiger's Wife"" does. Both novels feature dual narratives that frequently spin off into tangents. Obreht is a huge fan of Faulknerian timelines and horrific violence delivered in a casual tone. I guess because vibes.I know I am going to forget everything I just read in about 24 hours, because the same thing happened to me after reading ""The Tiger's Wife."" My brain says, 'No thank you' and dumps the entire book into some kind of mental trash bin that erases stuff faster than my computer deletes files.For that reason, I have to share some spoiler stuff below, or I will forget I ever had any thoughts at all about this book. This one definitely wasn't for me.I'm still really glad my friend Blair sent me this book, so I could check out Obreht's sophomore novel for myself. I had been really curious about this one. Reflecting on this book has been interesting.Three stars.************spoilers****do not continue reading if you don't want the book spoiled**Nora, the protagonist who accidentally killed her own infant daughter and spends the entire book speaking to her daughter's ghost, shoots the camel Burke at the very end. Burke is quite old by this point, has gone blind or half-blind, and is still carrying the completely desiccated body of Lurie, who also spent the entire novel speaking to ghosts and narrating his life story to Burke (the camel he rides all over the West) before dying. (Or maybe Lurie was a ghost the whole time, and was already riding Burke as a corpse when the story begins in the Prologue/opening section, which is titled 'The Missouri.' I am not rereading this book to find out if that's the case or not. Just pointing it out here as a strong possibility.)Apparently, the ""shocker plot twist"" of this ending is something based on real life. An escaped camel from the U.S. Camel Corps came upon two women around a campfire (or something) in Arizona in 1893 and I guess one of the women grabbed her gun and shot it? And that was the whole inspiration for this book?In an interview, Obreht talks about listening to this ""campfire"" story during some kind of podcast about 'forgotten tales of U.S. history' while she was on a treadmill at her local gym, and she pretty much fell over in shock, thinking something like, 'OMG THIS WILL BE MY NEXT BOOK!'Obreht does not include an Author's Note or anything describing the podcast that first introduced her to the U.S. Camel Corps. But there are about 3.2 million interviews and laudatory s for this novel that spell it all out. I did *not* like the book's ending. I know it's a ""twist"" to see a ""badass female character"" in a reimagined Western take on the role of John Wayne or whatever and kill the Big Bad menacing the ranch. But all I could think was, ""This poor f*cking camel"" and ""This sh*t is seriously so f*cked up"" and ""That animal deserved a lot better than this.""Nora is supposedly aware of Burke's ""cosmic need"" to end his life, or some crap like that. I thought the justification for this righteous killing was supremely silly and depressing as hell.At least the tiger's death in ""The Tiger's Wife"" didn't read quite like this. The tiger's death was tragic and senseless without being a John Wayne moment for any female protagonist. But the contrast between these two animal's deaths is a big element that draws out the similarities between the two books. Nora is a lot like the titular character of Obreht's first novel; both are impoverished women with missing husbands who have fallen in love with someone else. (In ""Inland,"" Nora is in love with the Sheriff or something. I think his name is Harlan. Lord, I can already feel my brain deep-sixing this book.)I didn't like any of the characters in this book. Not Nora or anyone in her family, not her mean-hearted friend Desma, the camel cavaliers were just run-of-the-mill dicks and never-do-wells, Josie was a tool and Nora's youngest son annoyed me.Unlikeable characters are seriously all the rage in fiction right now, but I'll admit that it's really hard for me to read an entire novel when I don't give a f*ck about anyone in the story. That was definitely the case here.The most likeable characters in this book were the camels, especially Burke, and when Nora shoots him at the end I was just, WTF, no. The only time when I finally felt something as a reader was in the destructive, f*cked-up way this book ended.I love grim, depressing Westerns, but the grim and depressing in ""Inland"" didn't move me or satisfy me at all. There are definitely fans of this book. I just wasn't the right audience for this. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 31, 2022",Feb 2022,"Jan 31, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43064559-inland

In fact, this is one of the most faithful book-to-film adaptations I've ever seen.The novel's prose is exquisite. The story is tragic and hilarious in turns, and often at the same time.I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys exquisite writing and darkly realistic tales. Just a small content warning that this novel is inundated with remorseless misogyny. It's present to a lesser extent in the movie. In the book, it's even more incessant and unavoidable. For instance, here is how Matt King (played by George Clooney in the film), convinces the 8 or 9-year-old son of one of his friends to stop insisting that people call him Spider-Man, instead of using his own name (pg 101-102):**********""Luke,"" I said again. His parents and Joanie [Matt's wife] were chatting near the bar. They had just smoked a joint, the three of them, and they were being loud and stupid. I knelt next to Luke. ""Let me tell you something,"" I said. ""Spider-Man has a vagina.""Luke looked at me and then at the figurine in his hand. ""Look,"" I said, pointing to Spider-Man's crotch. ""No bulge. Nothing there, see?""He ran his hand along the plastic crotch.""Spider-Man is a loser. The other superheroes call him a douche bag. They say, 'Get out of here, you sticky red douche bag.'"" I didn't know why I was telling him this, but then I heard his parents' stoned, exclusive laughter, and I knew why.Luke looked at his doll.""Do you still want me to call you Spider-Man?""He shook his head.**********Reactions to material like that are certainly mixed. For many people, this kind of misogyny is ""super awesome"" and ""super hilarious"" and they will ""vibe with it.""For me personally, reading this book is like walking into a beautiful house that has a noxious smell in the air. I can be amazed by the architecture and interior decor without enjoying the pungent odor whatsoever. This isn't a book I'll ever feel the need to read again, but I definitely enjoyed my time reading it. Misogyny and other problematic material aside (some casual racism, fat-shaming, ableism, classism, etc.), the prose is outstanding, and the story is gripping. I was very much invested in these characters and their situation. I read every word. I had read two other books by this author before picking up ""The Descendants,"" and I'm so glad I didn't let my intense dislike of those two other novels put me off reading this one. ""The Descendants"" is absolutely Kaui Hart Hemmings' best work. She captured lightning in a bottle when she penned this.The two other books I have read by this author (""Testimony from Your Perfect Girl"" [2019] and ""The Possibilities"" [2014]) were both terrible, so bad that I was forced to skim-read and/or DNF. Those books were both set in Colorado, where the author herself attended college, and it's clear to me that Kaui Hart Hemmings is brilliant when she is describing the setting where she grew up (Hawaii), but not places she encountered as a young adult or adult (such as Colorado). And maybe the phenomenal success of her first novel spoiled her craft, to some degree, because those two later books also read like they were trying too hard to be movies first, and novels second. Structurally, those books are just a mess. Whatever the reason, those later books were so bad that I have no desire to pick up any newer work by this author. I almost couldn't bear to open up her debut, when my copy finally came in at the library.I'm so glad I persevered and cracked this one open. The writing just sings in this book.Five stars.

The book examines what call-out culture is, the belief system that fuels it, and why it became so prevalent on college campuses. The authors also examine why this behavior is becoming so entrenched, and details several steps to break out of it.I've been a fan of Jonathan Haidt's work for many years, and I watched several of his presentations on YouTube when this book first debuted. I thought I understood the book's concepts without needing to read it. Then in December of 2021, the popular film critic, video essayist, and bestselling author, Lindsay Ellis, announced that she was quitting YouTube, due to the physical and mental stress she had undergone after being ""cancelled"" over a Tweet in March 2021.The news hit me hard, and when a transgender YouTuber (a supporter of Lindsay Ellis) read aloud the private letter Ellis posted to explain why she was quitting YouTube, it hit harder still. It inspired me to do a lot of reflection on cancel culture and the current zeitgeist of Twitter. I really don't like this place we are in, in which progressive liberals stop giving anyone the benefit of the doubt, interpret offhand remarks from other progressive liberals in the worst way imaginable, and then go after these people in mob-attacks that are all about ruining someone's reputation in the name of ""standing up for the marginalized."" The liberal Left has convinced itself that going after people on their own side politically, also known as ""shooting your own dissidents,"" is the path of justice, and it really sickens me. When any group shoots its own dissidents, they are in line with the Nazis, Stalin, and Mao. This isn't about justice; it's about power.And for the record, the Nazis, Stalin, and Mao committed mass atrocities. These people are not the ""voices of justice.""So ran my thoughts as I took in the heartbreaking news that Lindsay Ellis had left YouTube. She received a groundswell of support from conservative, Right-leaning and Right-voting YouTubers, who encouraged her to ""heal and come back,"" to ""not let the haters win,"" and other such supportive comments. It did my heart good to see so many popular YouTubers condemn the mob-attack that had caused Ellis so much personal pain.A number of those conservative YouTubers cited this book, ""The Coddling of the American Mind,"" as being one that Lindsay Ellis should read and draw strength from. I immediately got my hands on a copy, and read it as well. Those conservative YouTubers were right: this is exactly the book to help anyone caught up in the hell of cancel culture, call-out culture, and the Maoist shame-circle tactics of progressive liberals hell-bent on McCarthy-esque witch hunts. Successfully driving Lindsay Ellis off of YouTube and Twitter over a Tweet is not fighting oppression. This is not helping to lift anyone out of poverty, improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged youth, increase wages for low-wage workers, provide housing for the homeless, increase aid services for the disabled, guarantee safe drinking water for impoverished communities, or any of the other numerous tasks that improve health outcomes and quality of life for everyone in society. But the more these witch hunts take innocent people down, the more progressive liberals are telling themselves they are ""standing up for the marginalized"" and ""fighting oppression."" As if shooting your own dissidents ever helped anyone. I'm so very glad Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt wrote this book. It definitely makes sense of the senseless. Five million stars.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Jan 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44665065-the-coddling-of-the-american-mind

My sisters-in-law are both good friends with the author, Heather MacDougall, who is the writer behind the pen name Jesse Bond. (This is also stated on the back cover of the book.) I was able to borrow a copy of the book from my family, who received the book from the author. ""The White River Pack"" is told from multiple points of view. There is Alex, the main heroine, and her journey of traveling from New York into the hinterlands to meet Killian, the Alpha wolf/Alpha werewolf of the eponymous White River Pack. I pictured them living somewhere in Montana, although the novel never names that state in particular. The author herself lives in Colorado, but I didn't come across that state in the book, either. (Although I could have missed it.)The characters briefly travel to Las Vegas at one point -- they board a private plane to get there. But I didn't come across any mention of which state they were traveling from. (I could have missed it.)Killian and Alex are both first-person POV characters. Their combined POVs occupy over half of the book, maybe 55-60% of the novel. Killian's younger sister, Elane (who is twenty-two), and a Beta wolf/Beta werewolf named Aaron (who is probably in his late twenties) are also POV characters, and their combined POVs occupy around 35-40% of the novel. There is also an unnamed villain POV in the story, a voice that shows up infrequently. I was surprised by how much of this book ends up being Elane's story. Elane has a whole character arc that read a lot stronger to me than Alex's arc. Both women have love lives that center their POVs, but Elane also has a career/calling within the White River Pack that is far more active (and seems far more useful) than the position Alex ends up acquiring. Alex's Pack position seems more of a figurehead role with no actual life-saving/life-changing duties (as is the case with Elane's job). I think that life in a werewolf society as depicted here would be a horrible existence for me. The way that these people have to mate with each other like animals in heat is just not enjoyable for me to think about. These werewolves also believe that their mates are determined by a deity called the Moon Goddess, and that this deity marks a single individual with a particular scent that an adult wolf will instantly recognize and then ""claim"" that person as their lifelong mate (by completing sexual intercourse and possibly biting that person in wolf form). While reading this book, I tried to put myself in a headspace in which ""smelling my mate"" and instantly having intercourse with a total stranger based on nothing but smell would be enjoyable, but I simply can't get there. Being a female in estrus isn't a fun fantasy for me, though I can mentally understand that this fantasy is a very popular one, especially in the werewolf paranormal romance genre.I can understand why Alex's overall arc is compelling, though. She meets Killian, instantly bonds with him, and then they continue to deepen their bond throughout the course of the story. As the book jacket makes clear, the White River Pack faces different dangers and threats, and as Alex becomes involved with Killian, she becomes more involved with the Pack.There are a lot of typos in the print edition I read. But the typos didn't hinder my ability to read the novel at all. On the copyright page, the book is marked for readers ages eighteen and up, and there is some explicit sexual content. The sex scenes are all pretty brief, and almost all of them are in the first half of the book.I think a lot of readers will most enjoy the banter between Alex and Killian. Killian tries to be overprotective and controlling of Alex, and Alex consistently argues with him about what she will or won't tolerate. I'm sure a lot of readers can relate to that. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Paranormal Romance Novels, especially PRNs with werewolves. ""The White River Pack"" seems to me to have all the elements of what is most popular in this genre.

According to the note my friend sent, he rose to prominence as an actor on a show called ""Supernatural."" Online, Wikipedia says this show aired from 2008-2020.Wikipedia also tells me this man is 47 years old. The book jacket states that he's involved in a number of humanitarian causes to make the world a better place. Huge thanks to him for all of that.I read this poetry book in January 2022, and happened to walk through a Target and saw this book for sale on the nonfiction shelf. Obviously, this actor, poet, and humanitarian crusader of the good has a huge social media following and a loyal fan base. I had to force myself to read the book, since I didn't find the poems in the first 95% of this book to be anything moving or good, just mediocre modern free-verse poetry that doesn't grip my emotions in any way. Then I read the last two poems, in the section of the book titled ""the kids"" -- and these final two poems were SO. DARN. GOOD.They made the *whole book* a five-star read.The poems are titled ""PRESENT. TENSE."" and ""THE LAST POEM.""I'd highly recommend this book to anyone, just for these final two poems. In the Acknowledgments at the end, I had to laugh when Collins shares this: ""Thank you to my agents, Byrd Leavell and Meredith Miller, who worked hard to find this book the best publishing team even though books of poems have made no agent any dollars, ever.""LOL!! Like, what? I guess Collins has never heard of Rupi Kaur before. Or any of the big Insta-Poets. Hell, Billy Collins is a *big* name in poetry, a man whose poetry books *definitely* make money for his agent(s) -- and he shares a surname with Misha Collins, for heaven's sake. I mean, kudos to Misha Collins for being so clueless about poetry books that he believes they never make any money, ever. But objective reality states otherwise. In case anyone cares about reality, for the record. Or maybe Misha Collins just wants to believe that *his* poetry book will be the first book of poems ever to be sold at Target and make lots of money. I don't know. Why do people say ignorant things? Because they can. His two poems about being a parent are very good, though. Even if the rest of these poems just didn't work for me. Five stars.

As much as I love Lahiri's beautiful fiction, this memoir was aggressively dull. It has none of the personality and personal life that I look forward to in memoir, and I also wasn't learning anything new about the passion and difficulties of learning a new language. I found myself wanting to pass out and just be unconscious rather than have to listen to this book anymore.There are six discs in the audiobook.

Ford, shot to the bestseller list and stayed there. Oprah praised this book and released it as ""An Oprah Book"" when it debuted, it's received media accolades and a sea of positive s. I've been making a much more focused effort lately to read bestsellers, and I went into this book cold. I had no idea who Ashley C. Ford was. I've since learned that she is a very popular journalist, podcaster, and a writer known for her humor and wit.I've watched a few interviews Ford has given on YouTube, and I think she's an amazing woman. Her journey to lift herself out of poverty is outstanding and inspiring. Her message of self-love and finding a home in oneself is vital information to share with the world, and I support her and her message wholeheartedly. But this book just did not work for me. Memoirs about surviving childhood poverty often resonate with me, but not this one. The chapters read like Ford's journal pages, and most are narrated from her point of view as a very young child. I know that the content is gripping, but the narrative style just made this book agonizing to read. The story is incredibly slow and painful, and felt punishing to read. I didn't feel like the punishment enriched me, or rewarded me at all. I was not gaining any new insights or revelations about suffering or the meaning of life. I was just suffering, reading this.I know that Ford is a very young author. She graduated college in 2011 and found popular success in her twenties. In 2017, Forbes named her one of their ""30 Under 30 in Media."" She began writing this memoir in her twenties, and perhaps if she had written it later in life, the story would have been more rewarding for me.I am so glad that other readers have found this book rewarding and enriching. Reading a book is such a subjective experience, and this one was just a miss for me in all ways. I'm glad I didn't pick the book up from reading the book jacket, because the marketing for this book does not match its contents. The bulk of this memoir is about Ford's tumultuous relationship with her volatile, emotionally and physically abusive mother. Ford's maternal grandmother also plays a much more significant role in this book than Ford's incarcerated father does. But the book jacket leads a reader to believe the memoir centers around Ford's relationship with her father. And that is definitely not the case. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Ashley C. Ford. For people who already have a connection to the author's other media work, I can see how this memoir would be a lot more rewarding.I'd also recommend this book to anyone looking for an authentic account of growing up as a young impoverished Black woman in modern America. Ford's story is important and needed: the story of growing up in poverty, and the impact of a father's incarceration on a working-class family with a single mother as head of household. I'm so glad this memoir was published, and that Ford has shared her journey with the world. I'm also tremendously glad that Ford has received commercial success and increased popularity. She's an amazing human being with a life-saving message to share. This particular book was just not for me.Three stars....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 25, 2022","Jan 28, 2022","Dec 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54860610-somebody-s-daughter

It has a lot in common with ""The Woman in Cabin 10,"" the only other book by Ware I've read at this point.This novel has great atmosphere. Sadly, I didn't care about any of the characters, though -- not the protagonist (a live-in nanny), not the family she is working for, and not any of the other workers at the house (including the handyman, Jack). My entire mood while listening to this book was: ""I just do not care,"" followed by ""wow, this is boring.""I know I'm going to forget everything about this novel within the next few months. So much of the book is already draining out of my brain that I need to include some spoiler information below, just so I don't forget the big plot points in this novel.In non-spoiler sum: I wasn't a fan of this one. The book relies on a writing gimmick that I personally despise in order to make the plot twist ""a shocker,"" and I just thought it was cheap. But I did find the last two pages, a letter from a child's point of view, pretty moving. This was a market research read. I've certainly read a lot better; I've certainly read a lot worse. Three stars. Not for me.************spoilers below****please stop reading here if you don't want the book spoiled, thanks**In the *very last* part of the book (close to the very last page), the protagonist reveals that she has been withholding information from the reader the whole time. And it isn't minor information, either. It's a bombshell so huge that it throws into question the entire epistolary structure of the whole book. If the protagonist (Rowan) was so desperate for a lawyer, why didn't she start the letter by explaining right up front why she lied about her identity as the half-sister of the girl she's accused of murdering?By the time ""the big reveal"" is revealed, the entire structure of her letter (desperately appealing to a lawyer for counsel) just makes no sense. It's no wonder she never sent it, and it was found years later at the prison (or wherever it was; I was so done caring about the details at that point). This is the kind of book that annoys me so much because ""the unreliable narrator"" trick just feels so damn cheap. Rowan is penning a letter supposedly in all honesty, but that's not true at all. And if it were already all over the news that she had lied about her identity to get a job nannying for her half-sisters in order to kill one of them, then there is *no reason* to structure her letter the way that she did. She should have begun with explaining herself to the lawyer, and sharing all of the information she reveals at the *very end* of the book right up front. That's the information that would be pertinent to counsel, not all of that other crap (i.e. the rest of the book). But the entire ""thrill"" of this novel is to be ""totally shocked"" by the ""big twist"" at the end. And wow did it feel cheap.I would have rather been in Rowan's *honest* POV throughout the whole book, especially while she interacts with each of her sisters for the first time, and especially while her father was hitting on her as the nanny. I would have *much* rather seen the reality of what Rowan was thinking and feeling right then. It's all the more disappointing once the big reveal arrives; there is so much I was cheated out of, as the reader. And my disappointment turns to frustration when I know that the lawyer Rowan is penning her letter to would have known the truth already. Anyone reading that letter would have already known that Rowan was interacting with her biological father and sisters the whole time.While I find the unreliable narrator gimmick unbelievably cheap, I have an even bigger problem with Rowan herself as a character. I just find Ware's protagonists (Rowan in this book, Lo in the other) to be unthinking, incurious, reactive messes of women. It's the POVs of these women that makes the reading so dull for me. In ""The Woman in Cabin 10,"" the POV sounded just like Rowan to me. While listening to this audiobook, I kept getting flashbacks to ""The Woman in Cabin 10,"" and mistakenly thinking I was listening to that book again. The pacing is just sooooooo very slow. These women read like incurious adolescents to me, reacting wildly and thoughtlessly to any small slight, including how Rowan reacts to the erratic behavior of children. If you are a person who takes all of the angry words of teenagers and small children personally, I can definitely see how much life is going to suck for you. Doing this sure made Rowan's life suck. She often sounded like more of a child than the actual children she was caring for did. ""The Turn of the Key"" did make me realize that a lot of women must think and operate the same way that Rowan does in this book, and it's no wonder that raising children is such a miserable experience for people like this. If you can't regulate your own emotions, you are definitely going to struggle a lot around children, and there is certainly plenty of that going on in this book.For a mystery/thriller, I hated that ""the killer"" in this book turns out to be a little girl. It was a disappointing reveal, and read like an ass-pull to me. I just couldn't believe that the younger of the two middle girls would push her older sister like that. An accidental death, I would have believed. But the fierceness of the push, written as an open murder like that -- it just didn't fit with her character. I did like her letter, though. I remember that the dead girl's name is Maddie, and she's the mean little girl that I didn't feel any sympathy toward. The other little girl (the killer) is a much sweeter child. She's the one who ends up being the murderer and writing a very moving letter to Rowan while she's in prison (the letter at the very end of the book).I really wish the teenage daughter had been responsible for something horrible at the end. That was disappointing. Instead, the teenager's nasty behavior was all focused on one of the previous nannies. This is one of those books in which everyone in the novel, except for one attractive young man and an innocent baby, is a garbage human. Despite how helpful and kind the attractive young man is, Rowan spends most of the book suspecting that he's the bad guy -- Jack, who never does anything even remotely cruel in this story: Rowan aims her suspicion at him. Lo did the same thing in ""The Woman in Cabin 10."" It's one of the primary reasons why I just can't with these women. I just want to shake them so hard and yell, ""Can you please grow some brain cells???"" It's like they just don't know how to *think* -- and it gets so f*cking tiresome. I'm glad I read this book.

Stop reading here if you don't want the book spoiled. Thanks. :)(This is definitely the kind of book that you probably don't want to bother to read if anyone has spoiled the plot twists, so please don't keep reading if you plan to pick this book up. Thanks.) **********Spoiler thoughts:I liked the author's choice of villain in this book. The macro-plot definitely read a lot like ""Big Little Lies,"" in which the name of the murderer and the murder victim are both completely withheld from the reader until almost the very end of the book.""Big Little Lies"" had far more likeable characters, though. While I didn't hate any of the characters in ""The Guest List,"" I didn't like any of them, either. I just felt indifferent toward them. So I wasn't invested at all in finding out who would die or who the killer would be. I just continued the book because the sentences were crisp, and the writing itself was lovely. It was the writing itself that kept me engaged with this book, not the characters or the plot. (Spoilers for ""Big Little Lies"") --Like ""Big Little Lies,"" the murder victim of ""The Guest List"" is a rich male narcissist, although Foley's narcissist is revealed to be a killer (he murdered a classmate when he was a teenager) rather than a domestic abuser and rapist (as in ""Big Little Lies""). Both narcissistic men are compulsive liars, and might also be psychopaths, but that term itself is not used in either book. Foley's narcissist murder victim is named Will, and just like the abusive husband in ""Big Little Lies,"" he is killed by one of the women in the story who the reader least suspects. Both murders are explicitly ""justified"" in the text, and the women who kill them are meant to be extremely sympathetic. In the moral context of the story, killing these men is seen as a good thing. The (righteous) female murderer in ""The Guest List,"" however, is a POV character, unlike the killer in ""Big Little Lies,"" who only briefly appears in the book and is certainly not a POV character. Like a lot of modern thrillers, the ""surprise"" in the killer reveal in ""The Guest List"" is pulled off by withholding information from the reader. In this case, every time the wedding planner is interacting with Will, you know (in hindsight, after you finish the book) that this woman's mind was *full* of thoughts about who this man is in relation to her and the death of her brother (another important bit of information revealed at the end). But the author just withholds all of those thoughts from the reader in each active scene, giving a completely different version of what the character is thinking about than what the character is actually thinking about, so the ending can come as a complete surprise. This type of ""plot twist"" feels really cheap to me. I'm not a fan of this writing style whatsoever. But a lot of readers love it. The wedding planner falls under the category of an ""unreliable narrator"" -- and that is simply based on how the author completely withholds everything this woman would *actually* be thinking every time she interacts with Will throughout the story, long before the big ending. Having a righteous female character murder a devious/evil/narcissistic/psychopathic male is a hallmark of bestselling female-audience fiction right now. ""Big Little Lies"" certainly isn't the only bestselling novel that does this. I can name so many books that do this. (But I'll refrain from adding to the spoiler list.)I enjoyed how fucked up Olivia's character is (Olivia is the bride's sister/the bridesmaid). Many other ers expressed how much they hated this girl, but I thought she was deliciously fragile, weak, and fucked up. Her strident admissions of her own cowardice were one of the best parts of the book for me.Other readers certainly hated the bride, Jules. But the bride was actually my favorite character. She was just so amorally ruthless, so selfish and mean without intentionally being selfish and mean. I loved this myopic character. She really made the book for me. She felt the most realistic of everyone, and I thought she really carried the book. Hannah, the plus one, was a good person, and while Hannah kind of bored me, her confrontation with her husband at the end of this book was SPECTACULAR. Hannah got *mean* all of a sudden, and I was so there for it. Seeing Hannah take her husband to task was fricking awesome, and I'm assuming that she ends up divorcing him. (The book ends before the reader finds out. But all signs pointed toward that big confrontation being the end of their marriage.)And I also want to say: Hannah's husband's behavior -- how he starts attacking her just for smiling at Will, all the while knowing that he had an affair with Jules after Hannah gave birth to their first child -- ohhhhhhh, did I suddenly hate this guy. (!!!) My heart started pounding so hard, when I found out the truth of what he had done, right with Hannah. As a reader, it was a little disorienting, honestly, how worked up I suddenly felt; I felt more worked up over this situation than I did for anything else in the book. I actually hated Hannah's cheating, crying husband, a minor side character, *more* than I ever disliked Will (a main character and the primary antagonist). Maybe that's because Hannah was an obvious good person, someone I was genuinely sympathetic toward, so seeing her wronged (by her husband) provoked an intense indignation that seeing Jules and Olivia wronged (by Will) could never provoke. I know the greatest pleasure I can have from reading *anything* is to have my passions run high -- and oh my goodness, did that big conflict scene with Hannah and her asshole husband get my passions running high. Granted, it was such a brief scene, and I know that I'll have completely forgotten about it in two months -- that's why I'm making a note of it here, so I can remember that my emotions were at their highest engagement level during this scene. The lack of closure with Hannah and her husband is certainly why so many other readers thought the ending of this book was too abrupt. While I agree that a little more closure would have been nice, I honestly wasn't invested enough in any of these characters to give a damn, so I thought the quick, abrupt ending was fine. A word on Johnno, the best man: I strongly disliked this guy in the first half of the book, and even though he grew to be more sympathetic as the story continued, the strong distaste I had for him never really faded. I assume Foley wanted him to read that way, since he gets blamed for a murder he didn't commit, and I definitely get the sense that you're not meant to feel very sorry for him. By the very end, I did feel sorry for him, though, and it dampened my enjoyment quite a bit. This book seems to run on the theme that ""life is shit,"" and Johnno's (unresolved) false murder charge is certainly in that vein.Thankfully, I haven't seen ers calling this book ""feminist"" because the murderer is female, but this kind of ""feminism"" has been celebrated/rewarded in the book market quite a lot. ""The Guest List,"" as a market read, has what I would call a ""twist feminist ending,"" whereby ""feminism"" is solely interpreted to mean: ""women are equal to men when they are as depraved as men."" This definition of feminism is very popular on Goodreads and among other ers. I loved listening to this on audiobook. The narrators were all excellent. So well done! I loved the fucked-up group of men from the private school. I loved seeing some of them cry in the story. Seeing these men break down was some of the best stuff in this book.Excellent atmosphere. This book, and the two books I've read by Ruth Ware so far -- ""The Woman in Cabin 10"" and ""The Turn of the Key"" -- have excellent, creep-tastic atmosphere. In each of these three books, the characters are trapped in an inhospitable, dangerous place, a place where luxury is draped in creepiness. It's very well done. I'll say again that the prose of ""The Guest List"" was exceptionally good. Foley's writing is stronger and more engaging to me than Ruth Ware's. I know that's because the POVs Foley is writing from are much more intelligent, interesting, and mature than the two single first-person POVs in the two Ware books I've read. It made Foley's book a lot more engaging. I'd recommend ""The Guest List"" to any reader looking for a female-focused psychological thriller, the kind of mystery that doesn't require you to think too much, just enjoy the ride and the big plot twists/sudden reveals at the end.

I admit I was pretty shocked when the book pinned/identified/blamed the creation and rise of hookup culture on homosexual practices in the 1970s: ""'The hookup culture is a gift from the gays to the straights,' laughed a senior at Georgetown. She may be right. If the young people living it up in cities in the 1920s are the hookup generations' ideological grandparents, the gay men of the 1970s might be their two dads. Gay men arguably invented the lifestyle; we may be seeing it in colleges today because young students on residential campuses are situated similarly to those who fled to gay enclaves during the height of gay liberation."" (pg 115)The book goes on and on in this vein. There's a lot of historical information in the beginning of this book, but *no* discussion of prostitution, and there's only a fleeting mention of pornography (limited to a single short paragraph on page 153). But sure, let's tell ourselves that the sexual practices of gay men in the 1970s were unanimously, and almost instantaneously adopted by every single college campus across the country... this makes total sense.

If it were simply an examination of what hookup culture is, and how people operate within it, I would give this book five stars.But the historical information had me bored and also rolling my eyes.

I could not stay engaged. Every single main character in this book is so severely unlikeable, and then the story relies upon a couple of huge plot twists that feel like something out of a soap opera, or a low-budget Hollywood film, giving the reader a (supposedly) propulsive second-act twist, and the story just became unbearable. I couldn't continue. I DNF'd on page 190 (of 264 pages total). I did read the Epilogue, and the ending of this book is so massively lackluster, ridiculous, and unrewarding, that I just feel angry I wasted even a minute of my life reading this novel. One star DNF. I despised this book.*************spoilers*Annie Tripp is one of the most myopic, clueless, and dull teenage protagonists I've ever read. The author gives Annie a lot of clever dialogue, which is completely at odds with how dense this character is. Domestic cattle are more intelligent than this girl. This novel reads like ""Clueless"" meets ""Sideways,"" with none of Cher's sweetness, kindness, or redemption arc, and I wasn't a fan. Annie never uses her phone to look up articles about her father, her father's business, interviews, court updates -- nothing. Instead, she goes to her best friend Cee's house -- and Cee *tackles her* like something right out of a Ben Stiller movie -- God, this plot point was aggravating. The tone of this prose is dark literary fiction, and then this kind of slapstick crap is happening, and I just wanted to scream. I hated Cee, and I hated her attitude. If anyone should have understood how clueless and dense Annie was, it should have been *this* girl, her former best friend -- and yet Cee is using her 'karate skills' to beat the crap out of Annie and her brother in her own home, in front of her father -- it was f*cking ridiculous.I skimmed to the part when Annie figures out (through authorial magical ass-pull) that Nicole (Annie's aunt) is really her mother -- magically figuring out (via the author's magical powers of ass-pull reasoning) that Nicole donated her eggs to her sister so she could have Annie and Jay -- and my intense dislike of the book turned into active hatred.I *never* liked Nicole, as a character. Annie's first-person POV is so mean and harsh to begin with, Nicole is initially described as a highly unlikeable person, but Nicole also does the shittiest stuff in this novel. I just hated this woman, so the magical reveal that Nicole is actually Annie's mom just made me want to spit nails.Thanks, I hated it.The author states in the Acknowledgments: ""Jim Burke, producer and friend extraordinaire: thank you for encouraging me to write a screenplay. I tried, stopped, and then turned it into this book.""It was the last thing I read in this book, and it sure explained a *lot.*This novel is an absolute clusterf*ck. The mood of the story is dark and grim, starring a clueless young woman on a complete downward trajectory, and then the story veers sharply into the humor and plot shenanigans of ""Dumb & Dumber."" Like I'm supposed to find all of this very funny.F*ck off, book. I'm not even sure I can bear to pick up ""The Descendants"" now, after trying to read two of the author's follow-up books (""The Descendants"" was her debut novel). ""Testimony from Your Perfect Girl"" required so much suspension of disbelief to begin with (Annie Tripp, more spoiled and clueless than Cher in ""Clueless,"" starts working *in the kitchen* of her uncle's restaurant -- the whole situation was so what-the-f*ck-ever, I should have realized nothing good would come from this severe break with reality, that the story would just go downhill from there... but I wanted to trust this author, trust her literary prose to reward me for dealing with all of the ugly darkness she writes about -- but this book just screwed me; there was nothing here; nothing.)(Just like there was nothing in ""The Possibilities,"" either -- nothing to be gained from reading that book.)I just hate feeling like an author has screwed me over like this. Maybe ""The Descendants"" worked a lot better because Matt King (played by George Clooney) was given some likeable traits *because* he is a male character, and not a woman. This author makes all of her male characters so much more likeable and endearing than the female ones. Matt King's daughters were vicious, but they were also loyal to their dad; there were so many more redeeming traits for those female characters than anything I've seen in ""The Possibilities"" or ""Testimony from Your Perfect Girl."" If you want every main character in a book to die in a fire, that's a problem. I've only seen the film adaptation of ""The Descendants,"" but I genuinely like all of those main characters -- especially Matt King and his two daughters. I root for them, and I'm always happy when I see them cuddled up on the couch together at the very end.I don't get *any* feelings like that in the two books I've read by this author. I've had ""The Descendants"" on hold at my library for a while now, waiting for it to come in, but at this point, I don't know if I can even check it out. My revulsion for this author's work is running so strong right now. I would not recommend ""Testimony from Your Perfect Girl"" to anyone. It saddens me that this garbage even got published. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 13, 2021","Dec 15, 2021","Dec 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50193235-testimony-from-your-perfect-girl

Over a few long days in Sarah's life, she comes to grip with her loss, and makes some sense of her grief. Reading the book is like watching a really zany, 'comedic' indie film that is full of harsh, ugly things and jokes that punch down.

Such is the case with the 2012 juggernaut bestseller ""Me Before You,"" by Jojo Moyes.This book is repulsively ableist, and yet, many readers authentically believe they learned about quadriplegia by reading this book. Which is much like picking up a novel starring a suicidal Magical Negro and having the author tell readers that they did a lot of research about racism and Black people to write the book, and then having the gall to proclaim that their novel is ""helping the Black community"" by presenting such a ""heartfelt"" love story starring a suicidal Magical Negro.The disability community came out in force against this book and its 2016 film adaptation, and I don't want to repeat any of their excellent analysis on why this book is such an ableist clusterf*ck.What I do want to focus on is the specific stuff that struck me as I read this book, data points that other s I've encountered haven't pinpointed as Problematic AF:1. In actual point of fact (in total contrast to what is depicted in this novel): Will Traynor, the male love interest with quadriplegia, can definitely still get an erection, have vaginal intercourse with a woman, and climax. The author's insistence that Will can no longer ""have sex"" (by which it's assumed to mean: ""vaginal intercourse"") with women (including with Louisa Clark, the female love interest), is actually an authorial insistence that Will cannot control the penetration of Clark's vagina. This book is enforcing a specific idea of what ""sex"" is (namely: that men are the ones who ""fuck women,"" that if a man cannot ""control the fuck,"" then it isn't ""sex""). This book is certainly not presenting an accurate depiction of ""sex"" in general (with or without quadriplegia). Both the narrative presentation (the story Moyes has crafted) and Will Traynor as a main character (Will's supposedly ""authentic voice"" as a disabled person with spoken dialogue) are reinforcing a pornified view of sex that many people (especially very ableist people) can and do believe.2. The actual 23-year-old rugby player [Daniel James] whose suicide inspired Moyes to pen this novel was, in actual fact: home from the hospital for less than one year after the accident [the accident that made him quadriplegic] before he went to Dignitas (the facility in Switzerland that enabled his suicide, which is also depicted in the novel). Moyes changed that detail in a significant way: in the novel, the man's name has been changed, and it is stated [in the book] that he lived at home for three full years before going to Dignitas. Moyes altered reality *significantly* so that this real-life suicide would support and mirror Will's suicide. In the novel, Will is committing suicide three years after becoming a quadriplegic, like the fictionalized rugby player named in this novel. 3. The real-life rugby player was not massively wealthy, the way Will Traynor is. His parents did not have the money to pay multiple aides and caregivers to spend time with him, either. And, again: the man in real life [Daniel James] was home from hospital for less than a year before he convinced his parents to take him to Dignitas. Nothing about that man's real-life experience is reflected in this novel. This novel is THE ABLEIST FANTASY VERSION of that man's death in real life.4. No one would ever read a novel based on that man's real life, because the ableism would be unmistakable, and therefore, horrifying to read about. ""Me Before You"" works because it is fantasy, as much a fantasy as a Magical Negro story; this is a Magical Crip story: it exists to reinforce and support ableist beliefs, not to counter them.5. Every character in this novel belittles and criticizes people who do paid work as caregivers and at-home aides. The book relentlessly mocks anyone who ""wipes people's asses"" for a living, either in nursing homes or during paid visits to people with disabilities. (Daycare workers were never named in this novel, but one can only assume that they'd be included in the list of low-wage jobs that involve ""touching other people's shit"" and should therefore be belittled and mocked.) There is an astoundingly high level of classism throughout this whole novel, and it pained me and sickened me tremendously. Aides and carers do often work for low pay, but that does not make these people any less intelligent or ""lazy"" than other people, and it certainly doesn't make them worthy of ridicule. The book's constant devaluation of at-home paid carers and aides is deeply intertwined with the spectacularly offensive ableist narrative of the book as a whole. As an able-bodied person who has done *much* unpaid caregiving in my life, the classism on display in this book was insulting and offensive. 6. I just want to state, in a positive way, that people with quadriplegia can and do have incredibly pleasurable, enjoyable sex, including vaginal intercourse. ""Me Before You"" had a lot of problematic and erroneous information in it, but the problematic and erroneous information it contained concerning Will Traynor's nonexistent/impossible sex life was THE ABSOLUTE WORST, in my honest opinion.**********As a market research read, I can definitely see why this book is so appealing. It certainly rewards a reader for holding ableist beliefs, because the novel reinforces societal lies, stereotypes, and stigmas about people with disabilities. And the novel does so by giving readers a very likeable, lovable heroine: Louisa Clark. Louisa is an excellent character. She really carries this book in all ways. And Will Traynor plays his role as a Magical Rich Paralyzed White Man exceedingly well. He's all gentility and good breeding, coupled with Life Coach mantras designed to overcome societal sexism and the false beliefs of gender roles that have limited Louisa's prospects in life. It's heady stuff, and it definitely pulls the unwitting reader right under its spell.That said, there was one other huge issue that struck me as I read this book, and it was this:7. Moyes wrote a romance novel in which disability is simply the plot device to keep the lovers apart. Will's quadriplegia is incidental to the story; Will's disability is simply the window dressing on this house. ""Me Before You"" is a coming-of-age story blended with romance, and the story delivers the most popular story tropes and plot beats with almost mechanical precision. Will's quadriplegia could be anything; the fact that Will's quadriplegia is Fantasy Ableism Plot Device is just icing on the Implicit Bias Cake of bestselling fiction. The real cake here are the story tropes and plot beats of a traditional romance (tragedy romance). No more, no less.**********I read this novel for market research. I can mentally understand why this book is so beloved. For aspiring authors, this is a great research read. But other than that, I wouldn't recommend this ableist trashfire to anyone.

I'm really proud of myself for listening to this entire audiobook. ""The Four Winds"" read to me like ""The Grapes of Wrath for Girls."" The beginning of the book, especially, read like a Young Adult novel. I kept having flashbacks to Tara Westover's 2018 memoir, ""Educated,"" a book I did not enjoy, and had to keep fighting the urge to turn off the audiobook. Forcing myself to keep listening overwhelmed me with negative feelings. But I persisted because I wanted to see what was in this book for myself. For readers with little to no understanding of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, I can understand why the After School Special-style history lessons in this book would be appealing. The novel also features characters with a modern-day white middle-class mindset and feminist worldview, but puts them into the 1930s, surviving a litany of hardships, each one carefully crafted (ignoring the historical record as needed) to serve a melodramatic plot full of Female Warrior Spirit, championing motherhood in all ways. I finished this book a month ago, and it took me a long minute to remember that the main character's name is Elsa. Her teenage daughter's name is Loreda. The author certainly does an excellent job exploring modern-day mother-daughter bonds through these characters. Finishing this book felt a lot like eating a plateful of sand. I immediately wanted to spit it all out and pretend like that never happened. I'm not the right audience for historical fiction that uses history as a plot device to explore modern female relationships. But I can mentally understand why this storytelling style is so appealing. Earlier this month (December 2021), I recommended that my book club read ""The Four Winds"" in 2022, because I know the women in my group love books like this. The prose style is easy to follow, and the story is focused on women's experiences and emotions; the middle-school-level history lessons also infuse the book with a sense that the reader is constantly learning, and obviously, many readers do come away from this book learning a lot. I'm really glad that this novel worked so well for so many readers. But it really wasn't for me. Hannah is known for writing tearjerker novels. But my heart was unmoved by this book.Three stars.

Ratajkowski is a very good writer, and her prose is excellent.But the book never went anywhere. It just kept circling the drain of the author's internalized misogyny (but only one essay ever even names it as such), and detailing all of the choices the author made to make money in life, no matter what the consequences.This book is no more insightful than watching the music video of Fergie's pop music hit, ""Fergalicious."" In fact, I'd recommend watching that music video over reading this book. Both women are saying the same exact thing. Ratajkowski is simply adding a note about how profitable it all is. One thing that consistently aggravates me about Ratajkowski's writing and spoken interviews is how she conflates ""sexuality"" with ""sexualization."" These are two *very* different things. Ratajkowski never uses the term ""sexualization."" In her interviews and in her essays, Ratajkowski always states that she is making money ""off her sexuality,"" when that isn't the case. She's making money from the objectified, sexualized image of her body. There's a big difference.But the fact that Ratajkowski clearly doesn't understand that difference is one of the foundational flaws that runs through each of her essays. I'm glad that there are readers who are thinking about societal misogyny in new ways, thanks to this book.But holy moly, was this book not for me. ""My Body"" is some serious White Feminisim Girl Power, about as deep as a single-ply piece of toilet paper. I DNF'd by page 182 (of 237 pages total). I skimmed sections of the remaining essays. I thought the last essay was the strongest, overall, but also the most problematic for me personally. A lot of women never learn how to appreciate their bodies *as* bodies until they have children, and Ratajkowski is no different: her last essay showcases how giving birth to her son opened her up to a new understanding and appreciation for her female body. I'm really glad for her. But I'm not gonna lie and say that I in any way needed this message. Because nope. I certainly didn't. I think society has hammered the ""Womanhood is Motherhood"" mantra into my head enough times that I've already gotten that memo, thanks.I'm so disappointed that this book didn't go anywhere. It really had the potential to be excellent. But for all of the sharp, beautiful prose, Ratajkowski has no deep reflections to share. Just more confusion and painful personal anecdotes about the harm done to herself, both in her personal life and in the modeling industry. Ratajkowski never uses the word ""exploitation"" in this book, or in the interviews I've heard her give. Like the word ""sexualization,"" I wonder if the word even exists in her lexicon. I seriously doubt it. The word ""solidarity"" definitely doesn't appear in this book. And forget the idea of intersectional feminism; folx, this ain't it.

This book follows so many different characters, in a completely jumbled timeline (flashing between the past and present at will), that it's possible I would have forgiven Nina and her siblings for being so shitty and petty, had I known more about Nina's ex. But as it was, the siblings were initially presented as mocking a man for no other reason than having a bald spot, and it soured me on all of these people.June's inability to make a phone call to get child support for her children was so unbelievably ridiculous. There are so many deadbeat dads who don't or *can't* pay their child support, but in this case, Reid puts the blame on the mother for being ""too proud"" to make a phone call, and access the funds her ex-husband not only has, but should legally be paying her through court order. Like, what? The woman has four kids to raise on her own, and she can't make a phone call? Or tell her LAWYER to make the phone call? And I'm supposed to pity this person? As if the ""poverty"" the family is suffering from is unavoidable, when it isn't?Life is just too short for this nonsense. I never got the sense that Reid was writing from lived experience at all. Especially after Nina finds her mother's dead body in the bathtub. That would be an extremely traumatic experience for Nina. But the actual trauma of the experience is completely ignored in the flashback summaries that follow the event, which continue until Nina finally turns eighteen and becomes the legal guardian of her younger siblings. All of the traumatic weight Nina carries is in parenting her siblings, not in what she herself went through in being the one to find their mother's corpse. Nina lacks trauma, as well as rage -- even suppressed, the rage would still be there. But Reid writes Nina as if all of her authentic emotions just don't exist. It felt as fake as June's inability to get her rightful child support out of her ex. Nina was a stock character. It felt like Reid researched this novel by watching a few episodes of ""Shameless"" and called it good. I think this book is incredibly boring. Unrealistic. And totally lacking a plot. Glad this book has its fans.

Forcing myself to finish this put me into a reading slump. Wilkerson has no disability studies informing this text, and the lack is so glaring, it made the whole book's analysis suffer mightily. Wilkerson never mentions disability as it ties into/informs/gives rise to: India's caste system; the Nazi's initial implementation of the Final Solution (in which death camp tactics were initially all used against the disabled... mentioned NOWHERE in this book); American eugenics research (tied so heavily to the elimination of the ""worthless"" disabled, first and foremost... again, mentioned NOWHERE in this book); she briefly mentions old age being a ""caste"" near the very end of the book, but never includes the disabled population *at all* as a caste, probably because the disabled just don't *exist* in this book; Wilkerson never mentions that many racists justify racial oppression by stating that ableist oppression is ""natural""; she never cites any statistics about the ongoing murders of disabled people in the U.S., or the ongoing -- and perfectly legal -- wage discrimination against the disabled, or the ongoing issues with ADA violations and accessibility issues barring people from accessing public spaces; etc., etc.As a racism 101 primer, I can see the value in ""Caste."" But I found Wilkerson's historical research and overall analysis severely lacking in depth, due to a major oversight on her part not to include disability studies. The oversight is so severe, that even when she lists the different groups targeted by the Nazis, she never includes the disabled. Not one mention -- anywhere -- in this book. And if she'd only allowed disability studies to inform her analysis, this book might have been so much more powerful, insightful, and compelling to me. But as it was, I found this book, for me personally, to be superficial and massively disappointing. I've had the great privilege of traveling to India -- twice -- for two five-week trips, once on a college abroad program (2001) and once on a solo backpacking trip (2008). I've devoured many works by Indian authors, watched my share of Bollywood films, read a lot of nonfiction detailing the evils of caste, as well as Indian history.I'm glad that ""Caste"" is effectively teaching so many readers basic information about India's caste system; but what is here in this book is even more of a 101 primer than the information about racism. I think about the nonfiction I've read by Indian authors damning the caste system to hell... and Wilkerson's book just doesn't capture the extreme horror of India's caste system. She is at her best when she's presenting the horrors of American slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, Civil Rights, Donald Trump; or when she turns her lens to the horrors of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. The extent of the depravity of caste in India is just missing in this book, and I don't know why; I assumed she was worried someone would call her racist for expressing stronger moral outrage against the completely f*cking evil shitshow that is India's caste system. Pretty much every anecdote Wilkerson shares from American slavery and Jim Crow: THAT IS STILL GOING ON TODAY in India, due to their caste system. But Wilkerson doesn't point that out. Again: why not? Because it's taboo in modern academia to ""look down on"" subaltern/non-Western cultures? Who loses, here, when we do this? The Dalits do. Wilkerson wants us to break the silence about racism, to speak up and get real. Well, I want to get real about India's caste system: it's f*cking evil, and I'll repeat: every anecdote Wilkerson shares concerning historical cruelty against Black people in the U.S. during slavery and Jim Crow is going on, right now, in India, due to its caste system.That's not me being ""racist"" against the Indian subcontinent; that's me reading the words of the Indian people, and speaking the truth. A truth I found sorely missing from ""Caste.""I would recommend this book to anyone new to understanding U.S. racism, historical oppression, Nazi Germany, and India's caste system.For me personally, I just wish I'd DNF'd this one.This isn't a bad book.

But at least I'm fully aware of the book's content now. That's definitely a plus.As I write this  in November 2021, Hollis has had a few months to recover from her disastrous ""clean my toilets"" TikTok video that marked a turning point in her fan base. Time will tell what becomes of her life-coaching career. She didn't share any original tips in this book; but she did put a purely feminine spin on every single piece of advice in this book. After the first one hundred pages, ""Girl, Wash Your Face"" became increasingly painful to read. In order to keep going and not DNF, I kept reminding myself to stay open to ""what worked"" here for so many millions of readers.And I think it's this:1. Hollis consistently shared unflattering stories from her own life. Even when those stories display an extreme lack of self-awareness and critical reflection, her self-absorption adds to her authenticity. 2. After Hollis demonstrated real vulnerability, she gave the female reader gender-focused advice about how to better her own life.**********This book was the direct product of a Tony Robbins event: in 2016/2017, Rachel Hollis and her then-husband, Dave Hollis, attended a multi-day Tony Robbins conference, which inspired Rachel Hollis to pen this book. Hollis frequently calls herself ""Tony Robbins for women."" I personally find that insulting to both Tony Robbins and to women, but it's the HoCo (Hollis Company) brand, so I can't argue with that.Now that I've read this book, just looking at the cover makes me feel physically ill. I hated this book more and more with each page I turned. I know that this book spoke to millions of women. For fans of Rachel Hollis, this book was a game-changer in the very best way: inspiring them to take control of their lives, follow their dreams, and better themselves in some way.And I'm truly glad for that. I'm glad that for all of those people who can't engage with Tony Robbins and other self-improvement coaches, that someone like Rachel Hollis can put a gender filter on Robbins' self-help message and reach an underserved market of women.But this book honestly turned my stomach. Each time I picked it up, I fought the urge to fling it away from me like a rattlesnake. While I do feel sympathy for Rachel Hollis, it's the sympathy of knowing that ""power corrupts,"" because I definitely think the meteoric success of this book has had a detrimental effect on her life. Some people are saying that Hollis was *always* a narcissist. But the Rachel Hollis I read in these pages is not a narcissist. She was just a typical affluent white woman with a big house in the suburbs dreaming of joining the upper class. Girl, Get Your G6. Or something. I can't blame her for worshipping wealth; it's the American way. Rachel Hollis believes she's a good person, a good person who is motivated to ""love her babies"" and make lots and *lots* of money. Vulnerability is profitable, and Rachel Hollis isn't the first motivational speaker to grasp that truth. There was real humility in these stories. Regardless of how much these stories *weren't* for me, I can't deny that, for Hollis, I'm sure she was digging deep to write every word.

I first picked up this book in 2015, when my book club selected it as one of our monthly reads. A friend gave me her copy after the meeting, and I set about trying to read this memoir for the next eight years.I knew this book was an excellent piece of ethnography, and would be a great research read for the novels I was working on at that time. But by 2016, I completely changed what kind of fiction I was writing, and finishing ""Married to a Bedouin"" fell by the wayside, though I continued to cart the book around with me everywhere I went, including on numerous cross-country road trips. Well, I broke the curse of the unfinished memoir this weekend, and finally finished reading the last one hundred pages: April 23, 2023. I am super relieved to have gotten to the end. This is a beautiful book, full of historical information about the lives of the Bedouin in the 1970s and early 1980s, before the Jordanian government had them moved into concrete housing some distance away from the caves around Petra. I remember learning about that removal in college, and while van Geldermalsen only touches upon that change near the very end of her book, I would imagine she could fill an entire second memoir about what her life was like in the 1990s, living in that government-made settlement area. I know that I'll keep my copy of this book, for future reference in writing fiction, should I ever have the opportunity to return to the sci-fi/fantasy stories I hope to write.The pages of ""Married to a Bedouin"" can be a little challenging at times, since the book is told as a series of vignettes with only a loose chronological order (where there is order at all). It feels more like reading a collection of short stories, and there were many times in which I longed for a more immersive experience, with a central thru-narrative and a stronger storytelling approach that wasn't as much work to read.But for what this book is, it's pretty extraordinary, and I enjoyed myself nonetheless.

And forcing myself to read a distorted fictional version of real life just kept reminding me that I would much rather listen to a documentary about Fleetwood Mac rather than read this trés basic book. I wanted the real thing, not this watered down fiction. Daisy and Billy both struggle with drug and alcohol addiction throughout this book.

But that's not at all what this book is. ""Women and Other Monsters"" is about 90% memoir material, blended with contemporary social critique of the patriarchy. Most of these essays were previously published online. In no chronological order, Zimmerman details bad relationships, a divorce, her neutral stance toward ever having children, her disordered eating, and many other personal topics that are only loosely -- fleetingly -- structured around different female monsters from Greek mythology, which are all given brief and very basic descriptions.While reading this book, what really came across to me was how much shame and self-loathing Zimmerman is still grappling with. Many of these essays were depressing to read, because Zimmerman's continuing lack of self-love radiated through the pages. She describes a relationship with a professor that was incredibly toxic. Much later in the book, she describes a relationship with ""a boyfriend"" when she was twenty and twenty-one (it's unspecified in the text, but I believe this man might in fact be the professor, reappearing in a different essay), a man who kept in contact with all of his ex-girlfriends and an ex-wife in order to pit the women against each other, and hide his verbal abuse toward his current partner by blaming his behavior on his exes. This asshole definitely read like someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Based on Zimmerman's descriptions, he read like a man in constant need of narcissistic supply, a man who lost his temper over any random, nonsensical ""slight"" to his ego, a man who was constantly suffering narcissistic injury and narcissistic rage. Zimmerman never calls him a Narcissist. It could be that she doesn't understand this particular mental illness at all. But it was plain as day to me. I definitely think that other readers might enjoy this book far more than I did. It's very topical, and it's clear that Zimmerman excels at interacting on social media, especially Twitter.Zimmerman also strives, as much as she can, to keep her social commentary intersectional. She also acknowledges her positions of privilege in the first essay of the book. Each essay is preceded by an illustration of the Greek female monster being discussed. The artwork is beautiful, but I was sad to see that not a single monster had black skin or a plus-size body. Every expertly drawn ""monster"" that illustrates this book is white, thin, and conventionally pretty. It was certainly possible to have created artwork with black bodies and plus-size bodies. But the white male gaze still dominates these illustrations, even in a book that is striving to be intersectional. The lack of diversity in the monster illustrations made me sad. ""Women and Other Monsters"" ends with a call to all women to imagine different stories one day, stories in which we let ""the monsters"" be ""the heroes.""While I do understand *why* that is a rallying cry, I just kept waiting for Zimmerman to state that she was simply retelling popular Greek myths that *teach* the patriarchy, so in all actuality, how TF can tales that *teach* the patriarchy ever be feminist? F*ck these Greek myths, already; I'm just over this bullshit. I'd rather write women-loving feminist stories that have *nothing* to do with this ""women are monsters"" crap.

I confess that I found this book dark AF. Reading about Lorde's cancer, in particular, was a long, hard trek through the grim. The essays about her personal encounters with overt racism added to the visceral truth of the unfairness and brutality that surrounded Lorde's life. The essays deservedly come down hard on mainstream white feminism. As I write this  in 2021, it feels like mainstream feminism might have finally gotten the memo about internalized racism. Lorde remains worth reading because Lorde remains ahead of her time, and ahead of our current time (2021). This is such a heart-wrenching book. It's chock-full of so many horrible things that make me despair, but they're always coupled with Lorde's burning passion for change and unwavering hope for a better tomorrow. I don't feel smart enough to read Lorde's poetry. I just don't have the intellectual bandwidth to make sense of it, or to get anything out of it. Five stars for the essays.

Therapy for people who donPublished in 2020, to enormous success, ""The Midnight Library,"" by Matt Haig, is a journey of modern therapy in novel form. Therapy for people who don't do therapy, basically.It's also therapy geared for a specific kind of person. But more on that in a moment. Sadly, nothing about this book worked for me. Before I finished this novel, I happened to read Lori Gottlieb's nonfiction book, ""Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, Her Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed,"" and I was amazed at how similar these two books felt to read. The eponymous ""midnight library"" is basically a therapist's office, and the ""multiverse librarian"" is the protagonist's therapist. Gottlieb published an article in ""The Atlantic"" in 2011 titled, ""How to Land Your Kid in Therapy,"" subtitled, ""Why the obsession with our kids’ happiness may be dooming them to unhappy adulthoods."" If that subtitle vibes with you, so will ""The Midnight Library.""I read this book as a market read, and while I tried to stay open to it, and stay focused on why this book works so well for other readers, by page 232 (of 288 pages total), I was actively hating this book. I had to put it down and take a long break, in order to get enough distance from it so I could force myself to finish it.I recognize that there are a great many people who have benefited from reading this book. Especially readers who share the same socioeconomic status of the protagonist, Nora Seed: able-bodied, white, upper-middle class, neurotypical, cis-het individuals who struggle with the freedom of abundance/having limitless choices in life, dealing with discomfort, finding a purpose, and reining in their narcissism. All of the struggles Gottlieb discusses in her 2011 article. But if you don't happen to share the protagonist's specific socioeconomic background and mindset, you might struggle with this novel. I certainly did.It also was not lost on me that Nora did not feel ""love"" in the story until almost the very end of the book, when she visited a life in which she had given birth to a daughter. (She also had a huge fancy house in a posh neighborhood.) Nora stayed in that life the longest, and wanted that life more than any other. It was Nora's feeling of being loved by her child that led to her understanding that she could make a difference in the lives of other people. Like... okay. This end-of-book revelation is the very definition of that oft-repeated (and much-hated-by-me) mantra: ""You'll never know love until you have a child."" I know a lot of people believe that no one can truly feel love without having a child. This novel certainly promotes this belief. By feeling the unconditional love of her young daughter, Nora finally feels love, and then realizes that she can do things that help other people, such as an elderly neighbor, an aging librarian in a nursing home, and a teenage boy living with an economically disadvantaged single mom.When Nora realizes she can help other people in life (rather than solely focusing on her own happiness), she suddenly finds the desire to live. The presence of Nora's daughter is what puts the ""It's a Wonderful Life"" twist into this ""Groundhog Day in a therapist's office"" fantasy. I'd rather watch ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And ""Groundhog Day."" This book was not for me. A one-star DNF read for me personally.

I won't be tuning in for the movie version, sadly. This was a market research read for me; I definitely would have DNF'd this one, otherwise. ""The Last Thing He Told Me"" reads like a Hallmark movie with a dash of mystery. The mystery surrounds the sudden disappearance of the protagonist's husband, Owen Michaels. Everyone in this book has a bland, forgettable name. The protagonist refers to herself as Hannah Hall throughout the book; she never took her husband's surname. Most of the book details Hannah's interaction with her sixteen-year-old stepdaughter, Bailey. For a lot of readers, these interactions depict the struggles of how women learn to ""mother"" adolescent children. For me, these scenes read like Hannah was back in high school, longing for the pretty girl/the popular girl to notice her, and be her friend. The thoughts and emotions Hannah displayed toward Bailey had so much childish longing and angst, I often forgot that Hannah was supposed to be an adult woman who is around forty years old, because she constantly reads like Bailey's high school peer.For a mystery, the book starts off pretty boring. I was worried I'd have to DNF before the plot kicked off. And then Owen Michaels finally disappears, and I found the whole mysterious situation very compelling. For a good while, I felt hooked.My favorite parts of this novel were all in the first half of the book, and my enjoyment peaked in a scene in which Hannah visits a couple's house in her search for legal representation, and ends up having a very tense (and darkly humorous) confrontation with the couple during their child's birthday party. I loved all of that stuff. Then Hannah takes Bailey from Sausalito, California, to Austin, Texas, and the book dissolves into a miasma of ignorance and farce that became increasingly grating to read. It took an extreme force of willpower for me to finish this thing.I would not recommend this novel to anyone. I hated this book by the time I finished it. I just wanted to scrub the whole thing from my brain; I wished I'd never picked it up.But as a market research read, I can definitely see the appeal. This story focuses on women, and women's relationships with other women, and -- however bizarrely it felt to me -- family dynamics. When it comes to non-relationship topics, such as how the Witness Protection Program works, how the modern mafia operates, and other such ""crime"" and ""law enforcement"" stuff, the book veers into Nonsense Land and stays there. So, this novel is a lot like other popular media that require a massive suspension of disbelief to enjoy. This kind of thing is definitely not my cup of tea.If you enjoy Hallmark movies, I would definitely recommend this one.One star for me personally. If it's possible for a book to start out decently and still give you the equivalent of a bad case of food poisoning, that's how I feel about ""The Last Thing He Told Me.""Three stars as a research read. This book is a great illustration of what works so well in the women's fiction/book club fiction market. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 04, 2021","Sep 17, 2021","Sep 04, 2021",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/55713039-the-last-thing-he-told-me

I've never seen the ""Little House on the Prairie"" TV show. I have no personal investment in this work from my childhood.A few days ago, I finished reading Caroline Fraser's award-winning 2017 biography, ""Prairie Fires: The American Dreams of Laura Ingalls Wilder,"" and was inspired to pick up the first novel in Wilder's ""Little House"" series.I'm so glad I did. Reading this novel was so poignant and rewarding after reading about Wilder's real life.Yes, this children's book has highly problematic material. It presents the Ingalls family living in a wilderness that is completely empty of people before Whites arrive (pg 1-2). There is also a song about a dead ""darkey"" named Uncle Ned, who has ""gone where the good darkeys go"" (pg 99-100). The use of corporal punishment, and birthday spankings, (the scenes of Pa whipping and spanking little Laura), were also not my favorite.But after reading ""Prairie Fires,"" I found this novel so moving. Yes, it's problematic, but it's still a beautiful book.My favorite scene: seeing Laura's Grandma out-jig all the men at the square dance, all while she was cooking up a huge vat of maple syrup, and serving everyone dessert; it just brought tears to my eyes. I loved this dance scene so much.

The story focuses on the Hollywood acting career of Cuban-American, bisexual Evelyn Hugo, an impoverished Latina born Evelyn Herrera in Hell's Kitchen in the 1940s. She is a natural-born Second Wave feminist Girl Boss who has no shame about her female body or her sexual desires, and is ready to f*ck as many men as she needs to as a white-passing blonde Hollywood actress and rise to the top.Throughout the course of the novel, Evelyn Hugo explicitly needs the collective struggle of the LGBTQ community in order to understand her identity as a bisexual woman facing oppression, and by the 1970s, she begins funding the political liberation movements of that community. But women's liberation/the feminist movement is all just assumed and a given; there is no mention of the collective movements of women in this novel, and the word ""feminism"" never appears in the book. Near the very end of the novel (on almost the very last page), Evelyn's list of charities includes ""battered women's shelters"" (pg 385), but there is certainly no mention of those shelters elsewhere in the novel, and no mention of how those shelters came into existence.(I guess they just sprung up on their own, fully formed, without any collective struggle from political feminists, people marching, organizing, spreading liberation ideology that benefited all of society, whether those people identified as feminist or not; much like Evelyn Hugo sprouted up already knowing modern feminist liberation theory, basically a Fourth Wave feminist born in the 1940s. Evelyn Hugo don't need no feminism!! #GirlBoss #WhiteWomanEmpire #EvelynHugoIsGoals)There is no subtlety or nuance in this prose. The book wears its LGBTQ pedagogy with pride. If you are a reader who wants thorough, nonfiction ""teaching moments"" about what bisexuality is and isn't, definitely pick this one up.Reid took many of the biggest moments of Old Hollywood history -- most especially, the career of Elizabeth Taylor (her eight marriages, including her highly emotional, ticket-selling marriage to Richard Burton during the filming of ""Cleopatra,"" her many scandalous divorces, her second marriage to Richard Burton, the emphasis on the size of her ""tits"" and her great beauty as the only reason she had an acting career, etc. etc.) -- and repackaged those popular stories of Elizabeth Taylor as moments in the life of Girl Boss Evelyn Hugo, a natural-born feminist skillfully playing the system to Get Hers. The more I knew of the real Hollywood history this book was repurposing, the more reading this book felt like eating stale bread. Maybe I would have been fine with all of Reid's plot and character choices, had I just found myself liking Evelyn Hugo at all. But Hugo's Fourth Wave feminism awareness as an impoverished 1950s Latina high school dropout was just too unrealistic and grating to me. This book is some extreme fantasy coupled with extremely didactic LGBTQ chapters.I'm glad this worked for so many other readers. For me personally, this book would have been a one-star DNF.

The target audience are readers who are currently parenting children ages five and under.As I read this book, I kept thinking that the parents who seem to have the hardest time with all of the self-shaming and shaming of others are the people who are not familiar with babies and young children before they become parents. The more responsibility you've had care-taking babies and young children before starting a family, the less acute stress and drama you probably have as a parent.Good parenting is really hard work, and if your own parents weren't good ones, parenting is just that much more stressful. And, as with any skill, no matter how good you are at performing it, there will always be more to learn. So much of my adult life has been spent performing childcare, and this book has a lot of great tips to help people get real about all the inherited ""parenting advice"" that was created with an agenda, especially corporate and/or religious agendas that people might or might not agree with.

It was so weirdly anti-climactic that I even listened to the Prologue again after I finished the book, wondering if I had ""read into it"" or something, and done the novel a disservice.

The mother-daughter duo are diabolical in this book. Wow, did I hate them. The protagonist's husband in this book is the stuff of my nightmares. Their marriage made my skin crawl.

I can understand why this book won the Prix Goncourt literary prize. It was the second time acclaimed author Romain Gary won the award, due to the fact that he published this book under the pseudonym Émile Ajar.The story is set in France in the early 1970s. The tale is narrated by an Arab boy named Muhammad, or little Momo, age ten or fourteen, who lives with an aging former prostitute named Madame Rosa.

As he tries to help Madame Rosa die a natural death, the book tackles themes of hospice care, hospital care, and euthanasia.""The Life Before Us"" is a short, moving book. This novel is much beloved by generations of fans. But I would only recommend this novel with caution. The prose is laden with fat shaming, body shaming, misogyny, contempt for sex workers, ageism, ableism, almost nonstop racial slurs and racist language, homophobia, and other forms of hate speech against ethnic and religious minorities.Some of the racist and homophobic remarks are meant to be humorous, and while I can understand that the intention is comedic, that doesn't make this material any less horrifying to read. ""Whores"" are particularly loathed in this book, despite the fact that Madame Rosa is a former prostitute, a fact that is repeated numerous times throughout the novel.""The Life Before Us"" has been adapted for film and TV many times. On November 13, 2020, Netflix released the newest adaptation of this novel, ""The Life Ahead,"" starring Sophia Loren as Madame Rosa.A friend gave me this book, I can't remember who or why.

""If You Find Me"" deploys that most popular media trope of portraying drug addicts as absolutely depraved monsters. In reality: meth use does not make you Evil Incarnate. Neither does having bipolar disorder. But this YA novel capitalizes on the idea that drug addiction and bipolar disorder transform people into Satan.One star for me personally. I found this novel revolting.But I can see the appeal of these beloved story tropes. I understand why they work so well in ""Where the Crawdads Sing,"" and why they work so well in ""If You Find Me."" I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy poverty, and survival stories with big happy endings.

Schwab, hit the bestseller lists and stayed there. This book quickly developed a large and loyal fan base.I can certainly understand the appeal, but this book really wasn't for me. There were moments here and there that I enjoyed, but overall, I thought this book was slow, dull, and too long. It read like contemporary YA romance to me. In 1714, rural France, a 23-year-old woman makes a magical deal with a powerful being, and then does all she can to escape her bad deal. Addie LaRue was much like Belle in ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the popular Disney film that is much beloved. This novel read like a darker retelling of that movie.Most of the story takes place in New York City in 2014, with intermittent flashbacks into Addie's distant past. There is some important bisexual representation with both Addie and the other POV protagonist, Henry. I thought their bisexuality was great.Henry is Jewish, and while I like to see Jewish characters in novels, a few things felt off to me about Henry. The narrative presented Henry as some kind of an oddity because he doesn't believe in God, (as if a Jew not believing in God is unusual or shocking), and some of the details concerning the celebration of Jewish holidays sounded wrong to me. I listened to this novel on audiobook, and I didn't take the time to replay the CDs to cite the lines, but there were definitely things that sounded off.The term ""secular Jew"" doesn't appear in the book, but Henry would certainly be familiar with this term, and not think it was odd in any way that he is Jewish and doesn't believe in God. He would know the term for what he is; it's a common one.I also thought it was clear that Henry needed to be in therapy of some kind, to work on his belief system that he wasn't enough. Despite how the book ended, I thought he needed counseling. For other readers, love and magic were obviously believable ""cures"" for Henry's thoughts and beliefs (the ones that drove him toward suicide). But for me, he came across as a man who should definitely work with a therapist. Addie's magical deal makes her immortal, and 300 years pass before she meets Henry. This novel is not in any way about the large forces of history, like the rise of nationalism, colonialism, slavery, abolition, liberation movements, postcolonialism, globalization, economics, climate change, or what have you.This book is focused on Addie and Henry and their personal emotional journeys. There is a lot of whining and whingeing as they find their own paths to triumph. This is an uplifting emo tale. I read this book for market research, and wish I could say I would have enjoyed this as an emo teen, but I know I would have DNF'd this. I'm an uber-emo adult, and this book still didn't work for me. I just need more from a story than what this was.I would definitely recommend ""The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue"" to anyone who enjoys Beauty and the Beast retellings, or a Hades and Persephone retelling. My favorite parts of this novel were the strong Hades and Persephone vibes. I love Lord of Death tales, and I really loved Luc in this book. He was absolutely my favorite.Three stars....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 03, 2021","Aug 09, 2021","Aug 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50623864-the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue

BennPublished in 2020, the literary/upmarket women's fiction novel, ""The Vanishing Half,"" by Brit Bennett, hit the bestseller lists and stayed there. Bennett's first novel, ""The Mothers,"" was also a critical and commercial success. But the juggernaut sales and acclaim for ""The Vanishing Half"" is something else altogether.I didn't have a chance to read this book until August 2021. Sadly, ""The Vanishing Half"" wasn't an enjoyable read for me. The novel is most frequently described as ""a character-driven"" story, but I found the interior emotional space of all of the characters in this book to be unsatisfying, undeveloped, or outright missing. I definitely think this is a plot-driven book told in a literary style, by which I mean: the prose incessantly goes on long tangents sharing irrelevant detail. The book reads like a collection of award-winning MFA short stories.For many readers, this works fine. The literary novel, ""The Tiger's Wife,"" was told in an identical style, following a multitude of different characters, skipping wildly back and forth in time, with paragraphs chock-full of irrelevant detail. This narrative style certainly works for some people.With me, it just leaves me feeling like the characters all lack soul, lack real heart. It feels like I'm locked out of going on any kind of emotional journey with any character in the book. It feels like I'm reading plot puppets, not real people.I've watched a couple of interviews with Brit Bennett, and I've never heard her mention Nella Larsen's 1929 novel, ""Passing,"" or Wallace Thurman's 1929 novel, ""The Blacker the Berry: A Novel of Negro Life,"" but if feels to me like both of these books strongly shaped ""The Vanishing Half."" And since few modern readers are familiar with ""Passing"" or ""The Blacker the Berry,"" then it makes me glad that Bennett could write an updated novel about racial passing and colorism that allowed many readers to learn about these things. According to Goodreads s, many readers had never even heard of these terms before. This book was an education in white privilege for them. I'm glad for that, and glad that other readers felt such a strong connection to this novel. For me, I did not like or care about any of the main characters in this book: Stella, Desiree, Jude, or Kennedy. I could understand that each one of them was driven by a desire to survive, but their choices and thoughts did not endear me to any of them. The way each one of these women could just turn her back on her family and walk out on their mothers, starting with Stella and Desiree at sixteen (their abandonment of their impoverished mother for all of those years was shockingly cruel, it's over ten years before Desiree comes home in desperation, and her mother takes her back in) -- these people were just not sympathetic to me. I disliked them intensely. I liked Desiree's love interest, Early. I loved the sweet cinnamon roll that was Reese. But these two male characters are not main characters at all. Their appearance on the page would temporarily liven the prose with some sweetness and love, but the bulk of this book is about how the four protagonist females were all completely shattered by racism and trauma, and only the two women who have emotionally intimate male love interests (Desiree with Early, and Jude with Reese) find love and self-acceptance. The women who do not have emotionally intimate male love interests (Stella and Kennedy) remain broken wrecks all their lives, unable to accept who they are, unable to accept their Blackness, unable to have emotional intimacy with anyone (not even themselves).Stella and Desiree's mother, Adele, raised her twin girls to hate and despise Black skin. When the twins are young, Adele warns her daughters never to be with a dark-skinned Black man, because all dark-skinned Black men are bad.The darkest Black man in this book is the only man who beats his wife. (Sam.) He is the only character to ever hurt a woman in this story, or engage in any domestic violence. For a book that wants to call out colorism, this narrative choice did NOT sit well with me.Desiree never reflects on her mother's warning about dark Black men, what happened to her with Sam, and her mother never even has an ""I told you so"" moment. All of this build-up in the story is just dropped. Adele said dark-skinned Black men are bad, and that statement is proven true in the story: the dark-skinned Black man in the book is the only colored man who is abusive and violent. His violence is explained in the text as a resentment toward lighter-skinned women, that he beats women because of internalized racism.The text NEVER points out that much domestic violence is tied to the construct of masculinity. This is a book that understands, very well, that race is a construct. ""The Vanishing Half"" is extremely didactic about teaching this lesson. And if any reader misses it the first few times it's hammered out in the story, just keep reading, and the lesson will cycle back, again and again. In addition to the lesson that race is a construct, the character of Reese (a transgender man) makes it clear that gender is also a construct (an invention; something people create that is then very real). But ""masculinity"" itself as a construct? No. Jude blames the domestic violence her mother suffered on her mother herself, that her mother (Desiree) did things to make Sam angry, which is why he beat her (page 88). Desiree herself calls these beatings the ""brutal education in love"" (page 308). That's as far into ""explaining"" domestic violence as this novel goes.Honestly, both ideas are seriously f*cked up, and add to that sense that this book lacks heart and soul. Domestic violence is a choice. Women don't ""make"" men angry. Men make themselves angry. Men choose to beat women instead of communicating, instead of calming themselves down, instead of deciding that they don't need to control a woman in order to be a man. Whether the choice is made consciously or unconsciously, it is still a choice, and the choice always belongs to the abuser, not the victim. But none of this is in the book. No, this book just has Jude blame the victim (her mother), and has Desiree describe domestic violence as part of ""love.""Thanks, I hate it.Relatedly, the novel never reveals if Jude went looking for her father or not. For a story that wants to focus on the trauma of familial disconnection, and frames Jude as consistently seeking out her long-lost cousin, not a word is spared on her adult relationship with her father. She could have easily looked him up, and gone to see him, after she turned eighteen and left home. But this information is nowhere in the book, and all I can think is: because these characters just weren't real. I was reading plot puppets, not real people at all. As to the two main characters, the twins: Desiree and Stella never reflect on how much their mother told them directly to hate Black skin. They never have moments of reflection in which they resent their mother for bringing them up in Mallard. Neither did Jude.The only character that feels any adulthood resentment toward her mother is Kennedy, and she is written as a selfish, rather vapid, half-rate actress who also has *zero* gratitude toward her mother, and I just really can't with her. That so much of the second half of this book was dedicated to following Kennedy's erratic career was intensely boring to me. Within two weeks, I know I will have forgotten all of the characters in this novel. I will not be able to remember a single name from this story. I will remember this novel as a pedagogic tale designed to teach me that race is a construct and white skin is a privilege, a novel full of characters that have suffered generational and lived trauma, but the only female characters who can overcome trauma do so because of the love of a man.I have survived plenty of my own traumas in life, and I just want to say: my self-acceptance comes from within. Accepting myself and loving myself is hard work, it's relentless, it's work I do on myself. It didn't come from a man. And for me personally, figuring out that my husband has been struggling to accept himself as a man, and figuring out that there are ways I can help him on that journey, is what saved our marriage. So promoting this idea that men are the reason women learn self-acceptance and self-love? Sorry, book. I'm not buying it. I know why this message sells. We don't call it ""patriarchy"" for nothing. But I don't need to buy it.I knew very quickly that ""The Vanishing Half"" wasn't working for me. I wanted to DNF after the first fifty pages. The desire to DNF steadily increased until I finally finished the very last page.I picked this book up for market research, and I read the whole novel for that reason. I definitely wasn't the audience for this book.But I'm glad ""The Vanishing Half"" has so many fans, and that so many readers connected with this story. I'm grateful to Brit Bennett for writing a novel that dealt with so many topics that readers wanted -- and needed -- to explore right now.Three stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 02, 2021","Aug 07, 2021","Aug 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51791252-the-vanishing-half

He just didn't think it was that good.I thought the book did a wonderful job of sharing brief, heartfelt stories from the author's life, along with kindness and compassion for anyone who is facing the challenges of purging belongings for any reason in life, whether those belongings are one's own or belonged to a loved one who has recently died.I thought this book was charming and beautiful. I've had to death clean for loved ones before, and it would have been so nice to have this book earlier in my life, when I went through all of those dark, sad, and sometimes scary times. (Being an executor/personal representative of an estate is a frightening business; not topics the author discusses here though, since the book is overall positive and upbeat.)My husband has never had to death clean for anyone. I love that the author acknowledges that death cleaning more often falls on women to do than on men, that death cleaning is often considered ""women's work."" That has definitely been the case with my husband and me. We recently had to downsize our own belongings after a sudden move out of the townhouse we had rented for ten years. It was painful and emotionally wrenching to part with so many cherished belongings. I'm still processing and coming to terms with this recent move. It was, without a doubt, my hardest move yet.

I'm glad I finally read thisPublished in 2017, I was really late to the reading party for Celeste Ng's contemporary novel, ""Little Fires Everywhere."" I'm glad I finally read this book; it's excellent.Set in the 1990s in a suburb outside of Cleveland, Ohio, the plot follows the lives of three different families connected by history and circumstance. One mother is extremely conventional and has everything society and media have told her she should have (Elena Richardson). One mother has been unable to have a child and has adopted a baby abandoned at the fire station (Linda McCullough). One mother is an unconventional artist with a long list of secrets concerning the origin of her teenage daughter (Mia Warren/Wright).The story is narrated in third omniscient, and it is the female characters in this book that the narrative most closely follows. There are a few brief mentions of what teenage boys and adult men might be thinking, but they are negligible. This is a book about mothers and daughters.The thematic focus on motherhood and pregnancy -- and the life-changing decision of whether to terminate a pregnancy or not -- is the driving force of this novel. The impact that anti-Asian racism has on parents and children is also a dominant theme of the book, and relates to the storyline of the adoptive mother. The first 120-ish pages were a slog for me. I had to force myself to stay interested and keep reading.But by page 122, the plot had arrived, and the book became better and better. Ng's prose is quite beautiful and deeply moving in places. The ending is gorgeous. I cried multiple times in the story, and I cried at the end.I'm so glad I didn't DNF. The rest of the book was worth it.I definitely want to check out the Hulu adaptation of this novel. I'm interested in seeing how the show creators turned Mia's character into a Black woman, played by Kerry Washington. I can understand how that choice would add so much more racial depth to a story that really wasn't focused on race, since the two main characters -- Elena Richardson and Mia Warren/Wright -- were both white in the novel.

I hated it.I hated how unrealistic the depiction of poverty is. I hated the way the author wrote southern dialect. I hated that the author seemed to have done zero research about North Carolina, even though the entire book is set there. ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" reads like YA fantasy, a Young Adult retelling of a fairy tale (specifically, a retelling of Snow White). Snow White, taken into the forest to die, befriended by the wild animals and the Magical Negroes. The wicked witch becomes the wicked would-be rapist, in 1969 Outer Banks North Carolina.The idea that anything in this book is ""realistic"" is an insult to the authors who write realistic childhood poverty on the page, in books such as ""Winter's Bone"" and ""Salvage the Bones."" The protagonist in ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" has the mindset and behaviors of an upper-middle class child/young adult in all ways. Kya's coming-of-age journey is an allegorical one, suited to a fairy tale.If you enjoy YA fantasy posing as realistic historical fiction, you will definitely enjoy this novel.One star for me personally. I despised this book. And the ""big reveal"" of that ending? Yeah, no. A person can't be kind and compassionate, sad to watch even fish die, and then have zero trauma over committing a murder. The human psyche just doesn't work that way. The ""reveal"" in this book is just one more completely unrealistic thing in a novel built on unreality.

I think this character was a kind of avatar insertion for Walter himself, and was also the author's favorite character. I DNF'd this book right after the reader discovers what becomes of Alvis (how his story ends). ""Beautiful Ruins"" put me into an increasingly heavy depressive state, draining me of my desire to live. This is a heavily patriarchal story, full of women having horrible sex with horrible men, ruining their lives (losing their careers, self-respect, etc.), and otherwise living in ""the beautiful ruins"" of unfulfilled dreams and quiet despair. The sections of the book set in the past are historical fiction. The sections of the book set in the present are given equal (or greater) page length, making this novel both a contemporary work as well as historical fiction.I DNF'd on page 271 (of 337 pages total), but I skimmed the last chapter enough to know that the men in this book all get happy endings, no matter how shitty they are: they get uplifting marriages, financial success, peace and quiet, fulfillment, big happy families, etc.The women just all mostly die, either by suicide, cancer, or they stay with their porn-addicted boyfriends and keep living their best 'beautiful ruin' life. Rock on, sistas, rock on. I'm appalled that literary critics compared this novel to ""The English Patient."" Other than Walter's use of an elliptical timeline, there is nothing similar between these characters and plot and those in ""The English Patient."" Ondaatje's female characters (Hana, Katherine) blaze with an agency and independence that Walter's female characters totally lack. Hana and Katherine don't need drunken male novelists to tell them how to understand their own lives. But Dee Moray/Debra Bender, a married woman and mother in her thirties, sure does. Ondaatje's novel also deals with the realities and impacts of war to a much greater extent than ""Beautiful Ruins"" does. Both books discuss World War II, but that war plays a much greater role in ""The English Patient"" than it does in ""Beautiful Ruins."" Both books are also partially set in Italy, but much more of ""The English Patient"" takes place in Italy than ""Beautiful Ruins."" There was also a strong similarity in two scenes in which a male character shows a female character hidden pieces of artwork. It was the specific scene in the gun turret in ""Beautiful Ruins"" that most reminded me of ""The English Patient"" (when Kip takes Hana to see the artwork, which he has to light up for her, the same way Pasquale has to light up the art for Dee Moray to see in ""Beautiful Ruins""). Walter's story shines the brightest when he satirizes Hollywood culture, especially Hollywood pitch culture, and while I could see the appeal of why this was funny, it just didn't make me laugh. Probably because I know that the book publishing world operates the same way now, and it just makes me feel low. (My despair over the state of book pitching is stronger than Walter's satire, sadly.) There were certainly lines of dialogue in this book that made me giggle, but they were so few and far between. My personal favorite section of the book were the final pages with Alvis in them, right before I DNF'd.""Beautiful Ruins"" is a very realistic book: the women in this novel are certainly realistic. This is just not anything I want to read about in a story. This level of misery is just not for me. The ""lesson"" of this novel -- that even amidst sadness and tragedy, there is joy -- is not one that I want characters like this to teach me. The writing is very good in this book. Walter has a great prose style. The content of this novel was just not for me.One star for my personal taste.

I read ""Such a Fun Age"" for market research, which is why I didn't abandon it after the first forty pages. I'm truly amazed that this was longlisted for The Booker Prize. Sometimes life just doesn't make sense.**unmarked spoilers ahead**There are no likeable characters in this book, which is fine, I don't need likeable characters to enjoy a book. The writing is good; Reid definitely has a way with words. It was the content of this book that didn't work for me.The vast bulk of the novel is about a white upper-middle class 33-year-old woman named Alix, a wife and mother of two who is dealing with the struggles of that identity: losing her baby weight, finding reliable childcare, being a Girl Boss at her own social media-fueled business, staying involved in progressive politics, etc.Alix grew up with money, and she has a traumatic backstory from high school. She had to learn the hard way that modern American society values the lives of male athletes, of any race, over the lives of young women, of any race, regardless of how much money those young women have. None of this material is featured in ""Such a Fun Age,"" but the realities of Alix's high school traumas are highlighted best in the excellent 2015 documentary, ""The Hunting Ground,"" which I highly recommend. Alix wasn't raped by a male athlete, but her privacy and her home were definitely violated by a male athlete, and the public excoriation all fell on her shoulders. (Coincidentally, ""Such a Fun Age"" is set during 2015, between September and December of that year.)Anyway, when Alix was a senior in high school, she wrote a love letter to her then-boyfriend, Kelley, a white guy a year younger than her. Alix sealed the letter, and slipped it into his locker. The letter fell through the back of the locker, and dropped into Robbie's locker, which was right underneath Kelley's. Robbie was a very popular black athlete at the high school who had already received a full ride at university to play sports.Robbie opened the letter addressed to Kelley. He read the letter, a love letter that is not only inviting Kelley to have sex with Alix that weekend, even asks Kelley to check Yes or No to RSVP, but also provides the driveway code to get to Alix's house (pg 104).Robbie, who has never spoken to Alix before, but is fully aware that she is dating Kelley, a guy he is not even friends with, then goes up to Alix and tells her: ""I heard your parents will be out of town this weekend. We want to come party at your mansion"" (pg 104). The ""we"" Robbie is referring to does not include Kelley at all, just friends from his own social circle. Because Robbie is so much more popular than Alix and Kelley, when Robbie tells Alix that he wants to come party at her mansion, Alix ""remembered saying no in a more polite way than she should have"" (pg 104). Robbie never returns the letter, either to Alix or to Kelley. He just keeps it and never admits to anyone that he opened it, read it, and kept it.That weekend, Alix and Kelley have sex for the first time at Alix's house, and then, late at night (after 10:30 p.m.), Robbie uses the driveway code to show up at Alix's house with a bunch of drunk and rowdy friends. Freaked out, Alix tells Kelley that she doesn't know what to do. She and her little sister are at the house with their caretaker, a Black woman named Claudette, and the drunken party people are blasting music and ""demanding"" that someone turn on the hot tub jets (page 106).Claudette asks Alix if she should call the police (pg 107). Alix says yes. Kelley thinks this is the wrong move. He thinks that Alix should: ""Just let them [Robbie and all his drunken friends] hang out."" (page 107)Claudette, the only adult present at the house, calls the police (pg 107). When the officers arrive, Robbie tries to run away with the others, but he ends up getting caught by the cops, and he has a small bag of cocaine on him. Instead of anyone giving a shit that Robbie took a piece of mail that wasn't his, or that he trespassed on private property, even after he was explicitly told he could not ""party"" at a house he wasn't invited to, or that it was actually a Black woman who called the police: none of this matters one bit. ""The combination of a popular black student athlete arrested on property that had plantation columns standing out front did not pan out well for [Alix] Alex Murphy."" (pg 108)Kelley immediately breaks up with Alix, and Alix becomes a pariah at school. The bullying she went through was incredibly vicious. Because why? Because a popular male athlete violated the rights of a woman, and the social system at school values athletes, not women.Fans of ""Such a Fun Age"" overwhelmingly demonize Alix for choosing to believe that Kelley ""chose"" to give her love letter to Robbie, rather than it being an accident (that the letter actually slipped through the back of Kelley's locker, and fell into Robbie's locker without Kelley being aware).I just think: who gives a f*ck? The result was the same, either way: Kelley chose Robbie over Alix. Robbie did something criminal: he trespassed on private property. The guy was an asshole who got arrested for breaking the law, and yet, Kelley was all, ""Go, Robbie! I love you, bro!""Kelley honestly wins the award for Shittiest Boyfriend Ever. He takes his girlfriend's virginity, and then when drunken assholes show up at his girlfriend's house uninvited, instead of being a man and trying to help her get the drunks off her property, which is what she wants to see happen, he tells her to just let them hang out. Like, what?? Alix was no picnic to read about, but Kelley was far, far worse. The people in this book were all highly un-self-aware, and the fallout of this high school episode with Robbie just hammered the nail on the coffin that reads: ""How Much I Dislike This Book.""Alix's history with Kelley is what drives the whole plot of this book. Soon after the novel begins, at age 33, Alix hires a 25-year-old Black woman named Emira to babysit her two-year-old daughter, Briar, who turns three near the beginning of the book.While babysitting Briar, Emira becomes the victim of racial profiling and racist accusations at a high-end grocery store in Philadelphia. Kelley videos the racist incident, and then the two of them begin dating. Two months later, Alix invites Emira to Thanksgiving dinner, and Emira shows up on her doorstep with Kelley, who Alix hasn't seen since high school.Alix and Kelley have both become fixated with ""getting"" Emira for themselves. Kelley wants her as a Cool Black girlfriend, because Emira is skinny and Black and has a weave, and she's that perfect blend of sassy and clueless. Alix wants Emira because having a Cool Black girl around will help her brand: it will give Alix that image of being hip and with it and, most importantly, super woke, and as a Girl Boss on social media, Emira is exactly the kind of pretty and clueless that is extra marketable for wokeness points on social media, especially on Instagram. Alix puts herself into a pissing match with Kelley to ""win"" Emira to ""her side"" (in which success for Alix means ending their relationship and keeping Emira as her employee). And then Alix's scheming behavior suddenly backfires, and the result is a lot of melodrama and cringe.The novel begins with a quote from Rachel Sherman's 2017 nonfiction book, ""Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence,"" and since I've already read that book, I knew when Reid had lifted lines and material straight out of that book and planted them in her novel. Reid gets a lot of praise for her ""class commentary"" in this novel, and because I knew when certain material came straight from Sherman, it just left me shaking my head, and feeling tired. I know that novelists can't cite their sources in the text itself, but man, in a novel like ""Such a Fun Age,"" I would have appreciated the direct quotation marks and footnotes, you know?Reid's literary agent pitched this book as: ""a Curtis Sittenfeld novel told through the voice of HBO's Insecure."" I haven't seen ""Insecure,"" but I do agree that ""Such a Fun Age"" reads like a mashup of Curtis Sittenfeld and Liane Moriarty (especially Moriarty's ""Big Little Lies""), with a heavy dose of ""The Nanny Diaries"" thrown in for good measure.I loved ""The Nanny Diaries"" (the novel; I never saw the movie), and I also loved Sittenfeld's ""Prep,"" but I definitely did NOT enjoy ""Such a Fun Age.""The central plot question that drives this book is: ""What if a Karen suddenly found out that her Black babysitter was dating her old high school boyfriend?"" If this is the kind of question that thrills you, then I definitely recommend ""Such a Fun Age.""Counter-thoughts to other opinions readers have shared on this book:1. I don't think Alix is a villain. I think she's just a f*cked-up woman who is out for herself, like a lot of people I know in real life. Alix is a Girl Boss white feminist with a social media platform, trying to stay relevant and keep her coin coming in. She's not an activist, she's just someone who sees the capitalist value in activism; that doesn't make her evil, just someone with an eye on personal ambition and profit. 2. I think Robbie deserved what he got (getting arrested, and losing his sports scholarship) but the fallout Alix faced because of Robbie's godlike athlete status in high school was super shitty. 3. I think Kelley is gross (the idea of dating a man who would treat me the way Kelley treated Alix in high school makes me want to be ill). 4. I think Emira had plenty of character development. (Some people just don't have any career focus or ambition, and that is perfectly fine.)5. I think Tamra was jaw-droppingly horrible (her behavior at the Thanksgiving dinner was just next-level f*cked up. Alix stealing Emira's video was worse than anything Tamra did, but Tamra was still terrible). 6. I think Emira's dialogue and interactions with her POC friends leaned hard into stereotypes and often made me uncomfortable, but since the whole book leaned hard into stereotypes, I think that was the point. ""Such a Fun Age"" features a lot of ""OMG Drama!"" -- especially of the high school variety -- and I'm definitely not the audience for this book. By page 100, this novel had become painful to read, but I was determined to see what everyone was raving about, especially since the book is still riding the bestseller lists.This was a market research read, and because I still learned things about how the market rewards certain content, I'm giving the book three stars.But for me personally, this would have been a one-star DNF. I'm glad I read the whole thing, but I never want to touch it again....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jul 20, 2021","Jul 21, 2021","Jul 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43923951-such-a-fun-age

Vasilisa Petrovna. Vasya Petrovna. Reader, you shan't forget it.According to Russian own voices ers, the fairy tale Katherine Arden begins the book with is a Scottish retelling of a Russian folk tale, as told by Robert Burns, penned sometime in the 1700s.That fact speaks a LOT to this book's strange mash-up of modern Catholic elements and overtly misogynistic tone, despite being set within the Russian Orthodox sphere of Christianity in rural, remote northern Russia. But, according to other Goodreads s, plenty of ers don't know anything about Russian Orthodox Christianity, the Rus', the Golden Horde, or pretty much anything related to the book's setting, and so no matter how much Arden butchers history and Russian folklore to serve her purposes, she still includes so much more authentic information about the time period than many other authors do. Thus, learning occurs, which I'm all for, even though I found ""the history"" presented in this book laughable. I didn't laugh aloud, though. Nothing in this book made me laugh. The entire novel grated on me. I would have DNF'd by page 30, but I read this book as research, took copious notes, and arrived at the bitter, bitter end, also known as the HEA for the fairy tale heroine.The story begins with an old nurse and house servant named Dunya reciting a (supposedly ""Russian"") fairy tale in which two young women are offered up to the demon frost king as sacrifices. When the demon frost king arrives to kill them, he questions each girl as to whether or not she is cold. The first girl lies, and says no, she is not cold, she is comfortable and doing just fine. Her lie is interpreted as courage, and the demon frost king not only spares her life, but sends her home with a sled full of riches, which will make a fine dowry.The first girl's evil stepmother is angry to see the first girl still alive, but is certain that the second girl, her own biological daughter, will come home with greater riches than her loathsome stepdaughter.But when the demon frost king questions the second girl, asking whether or not she is cold, that girl tells the truth, that she is freezing to death. The demon frost king immediately kills her for her honesty.Reader, the ""moral lesson"" on display in this fairy tale is incredibly sexist, and yet, it still informs this whole book. Lesson #1 to all females: never let them see you sweat. Got it? Good, let's get on with the novel.Arden uses that fairy tale to frame her virtuous protagonist, Vasya, against the failings of her ""evil stepmother,"" Anna. Both women possess second sight, the ability to see the spirits that inhabit the homes and environs of ""the land of the Rus'"". Anna is terrified of these spirit creatures, some of whom are absolutely malevolent and dedicated to the destruction of all life.Vasya, however, is curious and friendly, and even when the evil Bear, Medved, tries to kill her as a small child, the patriarchy rears up to protect righteous Vasya, and a handsome, incredibly powerful and affluent man, who is also her immortal OTP, is right there to save her in the nick of time. Thus, Vasya grows up to be kind toward the spirits of the land, and is therefore deserving of the love of her OTP, the demon frost king himself. Vasya is the daughter of a boyar, and even though boyars are incredibly wealthy, this lord of the Rus' never has enough food for his children to eat. Much is made in the book about how hungry Vasya is, how starved she is, how her ribs poke out of her skin, etc. etc. All of which is the most ridiculous nonsense, and constantly made me want to put the book down faster than any other hogwash I read in this novel, but I do realize that this ""I am so starved for adequate nourishment"" detail is an excellent allegory for modern young women who develop disordered eating and eating disorders in order to stay thin and ""beautiful."" This book does an excellent job speaking to women in modern America, for sure. So of course, the text of this novel also heaps on the fat-shaming. Overweight women do not fare well in this book. They lack curves, and are often depicted as shapeless humps. You know the drill. ""Matrons"" are psychotic and killed (Anna), become vampires and die horrible deaths (Dunya), or they are simply content with their ""cages"" (marriage and children), much like cows. Get it, cows? Like the most popular slur against ""fat women,"" cows? Gosh, this book is just great. Vasya, however, is thin and beautiful, and does not want to be ""caged."" Other women contentedly or resignedly succumb to their fates in cages, like Vasya's older sister, Olga, who is happy to be married to a man she's never met before, and immediately becomes ""fat"" after having children. This is also the fate of Vasya's stepmother, Anna. As a young teenager, Anna initially longs for a convent, but is forced by her brother into marriage instead, a marriage she is depicted as resignedly accepting, wherein she is repeatedly raped and bears her husband (Vasya's father) a child. After Anna becomes ""fat"" and shapeless, her husband loses interest, and stops raping her.Vasya, full of moxie, intelligence, and all of that ""boyish"" physical strength and adolescent beauty, refuses arranged marriage and refuses a convent. As her reward, Vasya is not raped in this book, and even earns a kiss from her OTP. A kiss she doesn't think about whatsoever, since she lacks an interior space and has no ambition. Vasya only ever reacts to the plot in this book, she does not drive the story's plot, because Vasya's agency consists of ""not wanting"" what is ""the lot of women"" in life: to either marry and have children, or be locked up in a convent. Like a small child, Vasya has the power to say no and make attempts to refuse what the adults around her want to force her to do; she does not have the agency to shape events on her own. There is a lot of domestic violence in this novel, and while beating children and women is certainly true to life, the way the beatings were handled in this book had strong BDSM overtones, and left a bad taste in my mouth. In one beating, Vasya is being whipped by her twenty-four-year-old stepmother, Anna, all while Vasya locks eyes with the pedophile priest lusting after her then-fourteen-year-old body as she's being whipped: ""Vasya met his eyes and refused to look away"" (page 117).There are so many beatings and face-slaps in this book, I don't care to list them all in this . Suffice it to say, women and children are beaten and slapped a lot in this book. Vasya endures the vast bulk of beatings and slaps. She is also described as being ""like a child"" about 64 million times in this novel. Vasya ""eats"" like a child, she ""walks"" like a child, she ""sleeps"" like a child, she looks at things curiously ""as a child,"" etc. etc.Being a like a child = good = maidenly.Being an adult woman = *matron* = fat = contented cow = disgusting and worthy of death.Got it? Good, let's continue.The book features a lot of ""fat"" women who are either killed in horrible ways, happily die to give birth (Marina), or stop existing in the story after they are married, mothers, and contentedly resigned to their cages (Olga).Then there is the brave Vasya, who must repeatedly proclaim that she does not want to live in a cage, and is ""not afraid."" The third person omniscient narrative voice relentlessly objectifies Vasya's body, makes much of her physical appearance, and is the very definition of ""the male gaze."" And you know what, I can't fault the book for doing this, because this is how women truly experience life: through the male gaze. Not only the male gaze of society and modern media, but through an internalized male gaze that becomes a relentless, internal voice of constant self-hatred and self-loathing. ""The Bear and the Nightingale"" captures the essence of male gaze brutality, and does it exceedingly well. The only evil male character in this book is also the definition of an ableist trope: the use of physical deformity and facial scarring as a sign of evil. Medved is missing an eye, possesses facial scars, and walks with a clubfoot. The sound of his dragging foot is one of the signals that Pure Evil is near. Medved is the only character in the novel who possesses facial scarring and any physical disability. Look, this kind of ableist shit is as repulsive to me as all of the fat-shaming in this book. Missing an eye is not a mark of the beast. Facial scarring is not a mark of the beast. And for f*ck sake, having a clubfoot is not a sign of evil, either.The ableism in this novel is just out of f*cking control. It's sickening, truly. But then again, this whole novel sickened me, so there's that.While the beatings in this novel leap out of the pornographic imaginary, so too do the deaths of the women. A young servant girl dies, becomes a vampire, is unearthed from her grave, and Vasya and her brother must kill her prone body by driving a stake through her mouth, until the stake blows out the back of her skull (page 220-221). The teenage girl opens her eyes before she dies, and fresh blood pools around her head. There was just no reason for the girl to be staked through the mouth like that. It was sick and completely unnecessary.Sexual lust and physical violence are repeatedly linked together through the point of view of the 30-year-old pedophile priest, who lusts after Vasya's teen body while also wanting to beat her. See page 166, for one such example: the priest hits her (strikes her across the face), followed by this: ""His hand was raised to strike her again [...] He wanted to seize her, kiss her, hurt her, he did not know what."" As mentioned earlier, the priest locks eyes with Vasya while she is whipped by her stepmother, and Vasya continues to meet his eyes throughout the whipping. There's so much BDSM stuff in this book, it just made me recoil. But for readers who are turned on by this content, I'm sure the reaction was a lot different.I can't think of one single thing I enjoyed about this book. I'm proud of myself for reading this novel for mass market research. That's the only positive thing I can say. As a reward of my research, I feel like I learned a lot more about how to effectively write the male gaze into an omniscient narrative voice. But I can't really list that as a positive. It's a dark truth in life though, which is why I'm giving this book three stars instead of one.I wouldn't ever personally recommend the incredibly misogynistic, patriarchal novel, ""The Bear and the Nightingale,"" to anyone. Even the book's title refers to two male characters: the evil ""bear"" Medved, and Vasya's magical stallion companion, Solovey (whose name means ""nightingale""). There is a particular brand of patriarchal wish fulfillment going on in this story, which I definitely took notes on, even if this brand of wish fulfillment did not work for me. I can definitely understand this book's appeal, even though it repulses me.Three stars....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 09, 2021","Jul 12, 2021","Jul 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34069813-the-bear-and-the-nightingale

I especially enjoyed the first three stories, which are linked together by characters and content: ""Alphinland,"" ""Revenant,"" and ""Dark Lady."" These stories were darkly humorous, sharply written, and binge-worthy.(I did skim-read the first part of ""Alphinland,"" but once the protagonist started discussing her fictional story world, I was hooked.)The titular story, ""Stone Mattress,"" was also a great read, and my personal favorite of this collection.The other stories in this collection didn't work as well for me. I thought ""Lusus Naturae"" was okay, but I could not get into the last story, ""Torching the Dusties,"" and DNF'd it. I also abandoned ""I Dream of Zenia with the Bright Red Teeth"" and ""The Dead Hand Loves You."" I thought ""The Freeze-Dried Groom"" was a letdown. There was so much delicious tension building up throughout the story, and then it went nowhere.Reading this book, it really struck me how much Margaret Atwood writes about sex, lust, and death in her work. This content is on every page. (Especially sex and lust.) She has very restrictive, pop culture-infused views about women and men, sex and gender, and she writes characters that adhere to those restrictions in all ways.On the one hand, this binary *does* infuse culture, and it makes sense to write stories solely about the sex/gender binary. On the other hand, it gets really tiresome, and it definitely turns me off from some of her work. This happened to me when I read her novel, ""The Heart Goes Last,"" and it happened to me with some of the stories in this collection.I would highly recommend this collection for the first three stories and for ""Stone Mattress.""Four stars....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 15, 2021","Jul 06, 2021","Jun 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22642472-stone-mattress

(pg 251)Published in 2006, Gillian Flynn's ""Sharp Objects"" began a major trend re-set in bestselling fiction. This book was turned into an HBO series, which I don't plan to watch. Reading this book was more than enough.The word ""patriarchy"" never appears in this novel, but the ""poison"" in this book, I would argue, is patriarchy. Women, of course, get blamed instead.The mother is poisonous. The little sister is poisonous. All the gossipy, bitchy women in town are poisonous. The dead little girls were both poisonous (before they were murdered by poisonous women). Etc. etc. Basically, if it has a vagina in this book, it's bad news.And you know, I have to recognize that there is something deeply cathartic about this book for a lot of readers. I think it has to do with expectations. A lot of people *expect* women to be ""nurturers,"" and then when *all* women don't conform to that expectation, their behavior feels like ""betrayal."" A betrayal that men never get accused of, since men aren't ""expected"" to be kind.(And nothing in life stings like the sting of betrayal. Betrayal makes abuse so much more personal, makes the cut that much deeper.)Of course, the only people who have any inkling of what feminism is in this novel are all men. Specifically, the two men the protagonist sleeps with in the course of the story, and her male boss. Yeah, I'm dead serious. This novel just makes me so tired.Flynn's prose is excellent. On a sentence level, this book is a fireworks show. But the plot of this book is ludicrous. Especially the ending. I'd argue this book reads more like sci-fi than mystery or thriller. But then again, the whole book does read like a fairy tale, so there's that.One star for me personally. Three stars because I recognize that whenever a story can serve up a whole bunch of evil women, and blame women for all of the evil in the world, that book is going to sell really well. This one sure did. ""Sharp Objects"" revels in the vile. For anyone living a life of stifling boredom in the suburbs, this story is a carnival trip through the haunted house, and the ending is like walking through the room of mirrors, where everything is so grossly distorted, it's (supposedly) thrilling. The room of mirrors at the haunted house never thrilled me personally, but tastes vary.I would not recommend this. But if you want a book that revels in the vile, this is definitely it.**********Original , June 2021:I was hoping to finish this, but my life is hectic right now, and I need to return this to the library. Temporary DNF on page 52. Hoping to finish this another time.""Sharp Objects"" definitely has that dark fairy tale vibe. This book plays hard into that ""women are evil"" trope of dark fairy tales.

It's a wonderful read.I didn't expect so much of the book to be about Lynch's childhood, however. The first half of this memoir became too triggering for me, unfortunately, and I had to skip a section detailing Lynch's teenage years. Our mothers are so very similar, it was just too overwhelming for me to read about her mother's behavior, especially when Lynch never uses the word ""abuse."" That was exactly my problem growing up, too: I never understood what ""abuse"" was, because abuse was so normalized and constant. But I've learned how to use that word, and it pained me that Lynch wasn't using that word in her memoir. She just didn't seem far enough along on her journey, perhaps; it took me forty years to get to that word, and I don't know how old Lynch was when she penned this memoir. Near the very end of the book, Lynch acknowledges that her mother has ""narcissism."" I would like to expand on that, since my own experiences in life have forced me to contemplate my own mother's abusive behavior to a much greater degree than Lynch does here in this book.The only diagnosis given for Lynch's mother in the text comes from a ship's doctor in either the late 1960s or early 1970s, and he diagnoses Lynch's mother as having ""manic depression with overtones of paranoid schizophrenia."" This is very similar to what I thought my own mother had when I was a teenager, in the late 1990s. But in the years since, I've done much more research, and I have something different to share concerning this diagnosis.Lynch's mother was incredibly abusive and vicious: emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive. That behavior doesn't arise from paranoid schizophrenia, or from manic depression.It is often present in people who have Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), and I think Lynch's mother had NPD. This is much more than just saying someone has ""narcissism."" Many people can have narcissistic traits or ""narcissism"" without having the full-blown disorder.I believe Lynch's mother also had Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and that this disorder existed alongside her NPD. Prolonged psychotic episodes can occur in untreated BPD, and Lynch's mother had many of these episodes, as did my own mother (who is still alive, and still has them). It is the untreated BPD that presents as/gives the surface appearance of paranoid schizophrenia, as well as manic depression. While many people with BPD and NPD do have depression, it's a result of their disorders, not the underlying problem.The NPD makes it almost impossible for people with this disorder to ever admit that they have a problem; and unless you can admit you have a problem, you never seek treatment. It's why having comorbid NPD and BPD is so incredibly dangerous, especially for the children born to people who have these comorbid disorders. If I had a way to contact Lynch, I would share that information with her. I simply wanted to share it here in this , for anyone else who wants a better understanding of what made Lynch's mother the way she is. I just wanted people to know that when Lynch finally realizes, at the end of the book, that her mother is a ""bottomless pit,"" that this is a 100% accurate description of someone who has NPD. But people with manic depression and schizophrenia are not ""bottomless pits."" When it comes to mental illness, these labels *do* matter. There is treatment for people with depression and schizophrenia. When it comes to someone with NPD, my best advice is exactly the advice that Lynch gives at the end of this book: cut the cord, and protect yourself. Expect nothing from them, because nothing is all you will get. And beware how much damage they can cause. The damage Lynch's mother caused to Lynch was just endless.I would read an entire memoir solely about Lynch's time on the police force. The second half of this book is about her time as an adult in the police academy and becoming a rookie police officer. It was fascinating, horrifying, and uplifting. I loved it.Five shiny gold police officer stars. A fantastic read. Lynch is an amazing human being.

When I saw this book aPublished in May 2020, the genre-blending rom-com/women's fiction novel, ""Beach Read,"" by Emily Henry, was a smash hit of 2020. When I saw this book available at my local library one year later, I grabbed it, eager to see what all of the fuss was about.Sadly, this one just did not work for me.The first 100 pages were highly enjoyable. The writing is good, and often quite funny. I love the plot premise of this book, and I love all the tried-and-true tropes this story makes use of: the dark, brooding bad boy; the rivals to lovers setup of the will-they-won't-they love story; the career bet the two leads make with each other; the diminutive, sweet-hearted princess who wants to see the good in the bad boy. Etc., etc. The chosen trope selection in this book really worked for me. I dug it.Then the book just started to go off the rails. It started with the repeated use of the word ""vomit,"" ""gag,"" and ""bird shit."" Then the book kept forcing me to care about some extremely tertiary characters who had been traumatized years ago by a murderous cult. (Full admission: I never cared about these tertiary characters. Ever.) The heroine goes from being a girl with some moxie to a blubbering tearbag pretty fast. I lost count of the scenes in which January Andrews breaks down into tears, or begins sobbing uncontrollably, often in the arms of her love interest, Augustus Everette, who is always a complete gentlemen every time she breaks down.Gus, however, never cries. The more times I was forced to read January crying, even though Gus has a far more traumatic past (exponentially more traumatic than January's past), the more I just wanted to internally scream.The crying just got old. January cries a lot in this book. She also vomits, and wants to vomit, quite a lot in this story as well. Late in the novel, there's a scene at a book-signing party that was just my last straw for me with the word ""vomit."" It was too much.I was really glad that this book didn't portray abusive sex scenes as romantic and orgasmic. Gus never degrades January sexually. Gus also never humiliates her in order to get himself off. I see this a lot in romance novels, rom-coms, and women's fiction, and I was extremely glad not to see it in ""Beach Read."" That alone is worth a 5-star .But the blend of intense, trauma-heavy women's fiction and light, fluffy rom-com just didn't work for me in this book. Once I disconnected from the characters over all of the ""vomit"" and ""bird shit"" on the page, the repeated scenes of January crying and weeping eventually turned me off altogether.I also didn't like that she was living in the beach house she inherited from her father -- completely rent-free, and was selling off all the stuff in the house -- and she still didn't have any money. Gus had to pay for things/pick up the tab for her all the time, even though January is a 29-year-old bestselling author who doesn't even pay rent. While I can understand that this is an economic reality for people (especially for many women who are financially dependent upon men), the fact that January spends the bulk of the novel angry at her father, sobbing about how he's ruined her life (because she found out at age twenty-nine that he'd had an affair), all while living in the house he left her and selling off his stuff to pay her bills with -- it just left a bad taste in my mouth. I stopped feeling sympathy for January, and just started to resent her instead.True to rom-com fashion, January gets a big cheesy HEA after her summer of soul-searching and novel-writing. I wish I had cared. There were so many things the novel promised me, and never delivered: such as January's friend Shadi reconnecting with Gus at the beach house (never happened); the aftermath of the book sales each main character makes, in regards to the writing challenge that kicks off the main plot (I guess the author decided it no longer mattered); January appreciating anything Sonya put herself through on behalf of her father; January recognizing in any way that her father put Sonya through a lot of heartache and bullshit just to appease his own selfish desires (Sonya is simply demonized throughout the book, even though she keeps going out of her way to help January and January's late father). It was honestly bizarre to me that Sonya kept trying so hard to help January, especially given how January treated her. It definitely contributed to January feeling like the Disney princess that everyone, including all the wild animals in the forest, just can't wait to assist on her journey of empowerment, because reasons.I didn't find anything in the book problematic. The content is fine. The novel as a whole just didn't work for me. Three stars.

Because the little girl was injured, and -- according to the protagonist -- somehow ""infected"" by the very same ""evil"" that also infects the protagonist (the girl was ""infected"" by evil from the monster that attacked her, an ""evil"" that will gradually -- over a long period of time -- turn the girl into a ""monster""), the protagonist decides that she must murder this girl, and does so by brutally cutting her head off.It is clear that the girl could have lived, recovered, and had the same kind of life the protagonist currently has: holding the ""evil"" inside of herself in check. The protagonist states that she herself is also ""infected"" with evil, and has learned how to hold the evil inside of herself in check.But the story wanted to use gratuitous violence to further the ableist spectacle of murdering an injured twelve-year-old girl in the opening pages. So the protagonist just beheads her instead. The protagonist does not explain to the girl what she is about to do. The girl does not ask for -- or consent -- to being killed. The protagonist just murders her, brutally, by cutting her head off. There was absolutely *no* need for the protagonist to slaughter this girl like a monster, because the child was not a monster. She was a fully human child with a severe, nonfatal injury.Chapter Two codes heavily with the ""all disability is evil"" trope by explicitly linking a severe injury with ""being infected with evil."" The chapter also codes heavily with the ""it's not worth it to save injured people, just kill them off"" trope. Chapter Two fully promotes the message that disabled people and injured people can be openly murdered whenever an able-bodied person in power feels like it. And then that murder can be called a mercy kill, justified as ""the right thing to do,"" as this protagonist states of this action in Chapter Two.And you know what, I just can't with this.

I enjoyed the plot twists and turns, especially in the novel's long middle section. The final action scene did not thrill me, but I've never been a fan of villain monologues, either; tastes vary on that one.I loved how active this protagonist was. Although I didn't like Olivia Winters as a person at all, and never cared about her, I enjoyed her agency a great deal. It was fun watching her Nancy Drew antics at a private boarding school full of Mean Girls.""The Ivies"" is a smarter, more plot-driven version of ""Pretty Little Liars."" There is a lot of BIPOC and LGBTQ+ diversity in the story. The story is stridently political in places, wearing its identity politics proudly. High school students can murder each other, but racism and homophobia are beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, and ""The Ivies"" stands in that truth in all ways.The truth about murder, though, is that all kinds of -ism's play into who is targeted as a victim: sexism, racism, classism, etc. etc. ""The Ivies"" certainly didn't delve into the sexism that drove this whole plot. For all of the social commentary layered into this book, the novel was silent about the larger ramifications of the ending.But that's not really a criticism. I don't expect thrillers to give social commentary on their own endings. ""The Ivies"" just set itself up to read that way, adding social commentary on so many other topics throughout the story that the lack of any attention on sexism was glaring.The pacing in the final section felt off to me. Things slowed down a lot, and then seemed to continue too long.Overall, if you like cozy mysteries and Mean Girl stories, I would recommend ""The Ivies."" The book reads like a blend of ""One of Us Is Lying"" and ""Pretty Little Liars.""

I read this book in January 2021, long after Fuller went on to publish many more memoirs starring her family and their lives in Africa.""Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight"" was met with gushing critical praise when it was published, and this book has a large, loyal fan base. I tried, very hard, to stay open to the text while reading this book. I also listened to numerous interviews Fuller has given, interviews in which she condemns white supremacy and racism. I know the author's heart is in the right place. But this memoir is full of the author's internalized racism, and it's obvious why she focuses her memoir on her family members, rather than scrutinizing herself: there is a glaring lack of self-reflection in these pages. Throughout this book, and in every interview I've listened to, it's clear that Fuller still believes that she was born better than other people because she is white. That mindset is rooted deep in all of her current problems in life: her unending pain, her fragility, her oversized ego wreaking havoc on her life. In 2021, Fuller remains clear that SHE is the victim of white supremacy, that racism robbed her of a childhood, that she did not have a childhood, due to racism. But what she doesn't want to examine is all the ways that she became an oppressor -- not just as a child -- but as an adult. Her beliefs are brutally classist and racist, and they remain deeply unexamined. In an interview Fuller gave in the summer of 2020, she stated that she believes she is ""finally ready"" to stop writing about her family, and start writing about herself. Will she ever be able to admit the extent of her own racism -- and how deep it really goes? Or will she continue to see herself as the victim, and pen another book full of White People Tears? From everything I have read and listened to, I strongly believe that Fuller is only capable of crying more White People Tears. Since there are plenty of white people who also need to cry their White People Tears, I'm sure her next book will be critically acclaimed and economically successful. I certainly won't be picking up any more of Fuller's books. I found her first memoir horrifying and loathsome. I hate how much Fuller frames racism as something her parents have, without ever acknowledging how much racism she still carries as an adult. I hate how much Fuller believes she has ""escaped"" being as racist as her parents, when it's abundantly clear that her racism as an adult runs deep in her bones. I particularly hate that Fuller repeatedly states that she ""grew up in poverty,"" when her family had multiple Black household servants, owned horses, cattle, and farmland, always owned a vehicle, always owned multiple dogs and cats, and sent their children to private school. For the record: THIS ISN'T POVERTY.But Fuller, to this day, states that she ""grew up in poverty.""There are a lot of readers who devoured and loved the 2009 novel, ""The Help,"" and that book sold especially well among affluent white women who had benefited from Black women working as household servants, white women who had dehumanized their Black household help, and wanted absolution from their complicity in racist oppression without actually having to do anything to atone for that sh*t. ""Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight"" is more of the same. If you're a white person who has personally benefited from low-wage Black labor, a person who has inflicted racist, hateful behavior upon Black people, a person who has actively dehumanized Black people as a child and as an adult, and you still want to whine and cry about how much YOU are the victim of white supremacy, then this memoir is absolutely for you.I have never seen a single Black audience member at any of Fuller's book signings and presentations online. Her audience is upper-middle class white people who need to cry a lot of White People Tears.To correct the relentless classism on display in this book, and in Fuller's interviews: the dehumanized Black people in this memoir are the ones living in poverty. Not Fuller. I would highly recommend this book to fans of ""The Help"" and all the white readers in the U.S. who need to cry their buckets of White People Tears, especially all the white people who make ""only"" $200,000.00 a year and need to sob about how they aren't billionaires, and therefore, ""live in poverty."" Fuller sees your pain, and she is here for you. She will assist you in weeping about how difficult and fraught your life is, and how you are the ""real"" victims of this cruel world in all ways. I would never, ever suggest any person of color read this memoir. I think it would be damaging to your mental health.I would also not recommend this book to anyone who actually grew up in poverty. The level of classism in this book is astounding and sickening.Two stars. One star for the book. One star of pity for myself that I didn't DNF on page one. I should have. I'm so glad I didn't spend any money on this book. I picked it up from my library's free box in the lobby. And back to the free box this book will go.

Carreyrou's articles in ""The Wall Street Journal"" literally saved lives, and this book is the compelling result of more than forty articles that Carreyrou published about Elizabeth Holmes and her startup company, Theranos. The first of Carreyrou's articles appeared in October 2015, and by September 2018, Theranos had gone bankrupt and dissolved.I tore through this book in a couple of days. In the Epilogue, Carreyrou states: ""A sociopath is often described as someone with little or no conscience. I'll leave it to the psychologists to decide whether Holmes fits the clinical profile, but there's no question that her moral compass was badly askew.""Since I know that one of the traits separating psychopaths from sociopaths is their level of finesse (among those psychiatrists who distinguish between the two), I would personally label Holmes a psychopath. As detailed in this book, her extreme narcissism, felicity with lying, overwhelming personal charm, and relentless acts of vengeance and rage when questioned or called to account for her actions, align with everything I have learned about traits of psychopathy more than traits of sociopathy.Carreyrou gives just enough information about the science of drawing and testing blood to keep the reader fully informed of how unscientific and absurd the work at Theranos truly was, and how little Holmes knew about bioengineering and chemistry. ""Bad Blood"" is a fascinating book. The events that unfold in the story of Elizabeth Holmes and her company are shocking, galling, and enraging.I read this book in January 2021, and as I write this , Holmes is due to begin her criminal trial on July 13, 2021. Her trial was originally scheduled for July 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the date back at least a full year.There are a number of excellent profile pieces, based on the work of this book, available on YouTube, showcasing the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. I enjoyed watching those videos, which enabled me to have a full visual of Holmes and hear her striking, affected, ""deep baritone voice"" for myself. I have never watched her TED talk before, and have no desire to. Reading this book, it was impossible for me not to recognize how much ""being tapped for success"" in business has to do with personal branding capability, looks, and the excitement a person can generate with ""a single idea."" Holmes was able to court venture capitalists on the strength of her personal charm, her narrative, her looks, and her single, compelling idea. The same is true in other industries. It's certainly true in the pop music industry. It's abundantly true in the current publishing industry. Music stars and authors are chosen and anointed with hype and marketing plans based on the same things. Of course, a person's looks, personal narrative, and a single idea can only get them so far. It's in the execution of that single idea where things fall apart. And so it goes with Elizabeth Holmes. She had all the external look of success, and all of the charisma to convince people to invest in her business. But she had none of the knowledge and skill to execute her idea, and resorted to breaking the law in order to achieve her lifelong dream of becoming a billionaire.""Bad Blood"" is an excellent book about ambition and greed. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys reading nonfiction.

I picked this book up knowing nothing about it, read eleven pages, and put it down. It's just not for me.The chapters of the book aren't really diary pages. The protagonist, Misty Wilmot, is actually writing a novel, with date headings for each chapter, but her novel doesn't read like journal pages at all, and actually employs a second-person point of view, one that spirals into third omniscient at times. Whether this narrative structure strikes you as gimmicky or ingenious will determine if you enjoy this book or not.For me personally, the answer is no. After putting the book down, I went online and read the plot summary on Wikipedia. Amazingly, the book begins at a nadir of the absurd, and then plunges further south, burrowing into the earth's core. I think the gushing blurb from ""Vanity Fair"" on this book jacket says it all: ""Palahniuk is a bracingly toxic purveyor of dread and mounting horror.

This book has a very polarized set of s here on Goodreads, with many readers either one-starring the book for its inane plot and worldbuilding, or five-starring the book with gushing praise. Personally, I could not finish reading this book, and abandoned it about halfway through. I'm going to give the book three stars. While I fully recognize that the story fails as a literal dystopian work, I believe it exceeds tremendously as allegory. First, to define allegory: 1.) a story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one, and 2.) a symbol.I think all of the setting and plot details in this book are metaphors, or symbolic constructs, for problems and issues facing modern suburban teenagers, especially teenage girls. The protagonist, Juliette, begins the book imprisoned in an abusive asylum cell, in which she is starved of both food and physical touch.For many young women (and people of all genders) in modern America, patriarchal beauty expectations lead them to starve their own bodies in order to ""have worth,"" win the approval of their parents and communities, and ""be loved."" Many modern teenagers grow up in homes that are ""touch deprivation chambers"" similar to Juliette's prison cell, in which adults do not express physical affection at all, and shun emotional intimacy. These teens feel a profound lack of care, feel deeply unloved, and therefore wonder if they are ""monsters,"" the same way Juliette does.In ""Shatter Me,"" Juliette has been born with a paranormal superpower. Like the X-Men comic book character, Rogue, if Juliette's skin comes in contact with the skin of another person, she will drain away the person's energy, and possibly their life force. Juliette's body is ""dangerous,"" so dangerous that she can literally kill.For many modern young women, the onset of puberty remains a tragic, brutal moment in their lives, a moment in which their ""lovable"" child's body becomes ""dangerous"" due to the development of breasts, hips, and menstruation. Many modern young women still experience adolescence as a time when adults ""pull away"" from them emotionally as well as physically, especially their parents (and their fathers in particular). In patriarchy, the expression ""if looks could kill"" is one of many common statements revealing the sad, pathetic truth that ""men"" are apparently supposed to be slaves to their lust, and incessantly look at women as sex objects because men ""need"" to have sex. A woman's mature body is constantly objectified, and when you are considered an object, you are not a human being. And when you aren't considered a human being, life gets real f*cking scary, real f*cking fast. Despite such rampant mistreatment, Juliette still feels compassion for the people around her, and this is a very similar feeling that many modern young women have: despite having been rendered a dehumanized object by the patriarchy, their own subjectivity still recognizes their intrinsic humanity, and acts accordingly. This object/subject contradiction makes the act of living in the world confusing as f*ck.The ""dangerous power"" inside of Juliette and modern teen girls is their own sexuality. I am not referring to their sexualized bodies, which have been Othered by the patriarchy, but their own personal, unique desires and needs. Their personal, subjective sex drive. In short, substitute ""having an X-Men superpower"" for ""having a clitoris"" in this book, and you can comprehend the allegory in ""Shatter Me"" pretty quickly. For all of these reasons and more, the setting of ""Shatter Me"" reads as symbolic metaphor, as allegory, for a teenager's love-starved home in the modern world, and not at all as a literal murderous mental asylum in a dystopian future. If you take the text's stated setting seriously, the story is full of plot holes and contradictions; it's nonsensical. But if you read the book as allegory, everything makes perfect sense.Here is a list I made of the things Juliette feels and experiences within the first half of this novel --1. She feels ""worthless,"" like ""a freak,"" ""a monster,"" ""a psycho.""2. She is imprisoned in a world in which she is cut off from physical touch and emotional intimacy.3. She still feels compassion in a cruel world that forces people to be unkind to survive.4. She has a deep terror of her supernatural power. (Her innate sexuality.)5. She wants to be touched and be loved more than anything else.6. She lives at the whim of powerful men.7. She is convinced that her parents do not love her. (Because they abandoned her to the asylum.)8. She is used to starvation. She is used to always feeling hungry. (Like so many teenagers with eating disorders and disordered eating.)9. Men want her for her body. Men tell her she is pretty. 10. She has no female friends.11. She is the only female in the book.12. She is outwardly stoic: emotionally and verbally restrained, often completely silent and unreactive. Inwardly, she is a complete emo mess. Her internal thoughts and emotions are wildly hyperbolic and often painful.**********As in so many popular stories, Juliette is not only not like other girls, she's the only girl in the book.In 2009, the writing teacher Pamela Painter told me in a writing workshop: ""You must give the reader to the reader."" Meaning, the golden rule of writing is to reproduce the reader's own psychological reality on the page. ""Shatter Me"" sells extraordinarily well among suburban teenage readers, and adult women who grew up in suburban homes. Tahereh Mafi ""gave the reader to the reader"" with this book. And she did so superbly, because this book still speaks to people. It continues to be purchased and find new fans.For as much as I can mentally recognize this fact, I really don't enjoy reading allegory. The suspension of disbelief is simply too high. Once Juliette realizes she has the power to smash through concrete walls as easily and naturally as taking a breath (page 165), she ought to be able to free herself from her own prison cell. It's as easy as putting her hands on the wall at night and blasting the wall open, getting in a truck, and driving away. But that's not how the story operates. Instead, Juliette remains utterly helpless, a victim imprisoned by powerful men who want her sexually, and she must wait for the love interest, the man who will righteously give her worth, to free her and help her escape.While on the one hand, this is still excellent allegory, promoting the idea that women need men to bring them to orgasm, that women should not take pleasure in their bodies unless they are pleasuring a man -- I know this is absolutely the reality of rape culture in modern America. But on the other hand, the story isn't, in fact, allegory. The story is literally Juliette in a prison cell, with a superhuman power to knock down concrete, and it was causing me too much mental exertion to continue the allegory charade, at that point.This is where I DNF'd.Bravo to Tahereh Mafi for using a dystopian fantasy to illuminate the reality of modern America's dystopian present. This book is not at all my cup of tea. But I admire the unflinching dedication to allegory in this text.Three stars....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Jan 2021,"Jan 05, 2021","Jan 01, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13455782-shatter-me

A hugely popular film starring Matt Damon, which was based on this novel and produced in part by the author, debuted in 2002, kicking off an updated, alternate version of this story.Because the Matt Damon film and the novel are so drastically different, a lot of fans of the book truly hated the Bourne films. I'm someone who enjoys both. I watched the first three Damon films in the theater, thought they were okay, and enjoyed them a lot more when I rewatched them in 2020.

There is a strong current of racism in the text that is brutally common in action/adventure stories like this one. The Damon movie is incredibly racist as well, but in a different way than the book. What author bell hooks labels ""the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy"" is fully on display in this thriller, but the book also has powerful counter-narratives that work against that messaging, too. Yes, there is a lot of material in the book and the movie that is problematic. But there is also a huge amount of feminist messaging and feminist narrative structure in the novel. The character of Marie, Bourne's love interest, is drastically different in the book than how she was portrayed in the Damon film. Marie is a powerhouse in the novel, every bit as much Bourne's equal, and her role in the story is part of what makes the book so explosively good. I liked the way the novel ended, but I enjoy the Damon movie's ending a lot more. The climactic action scene was one place where the movie returns to its literary source material, and utilizes a lot of thematic and stylistic elements that make the final confrontation so rewarding in both stories. The romance in the novel is so much stronger and more enjoyable in the book than the movie, but I like the final romantic scene in the Damon movie much more than the final scene in the book.If all thrillers were as good as ""The Bourne Identity,"" I would read a lot more of them. This is definitely an absorbing piece of fiction. Highly enjoyable, mysterious, and full of compelling characters.Five stars.

I hoped the talks would stimulate the listener to think about a social and literary matter in a way that would be naggingly helpful."" (pg xvi)These essays were not naggingly helpful to me.

I couldn't find anything appealing.I love reading craft books about writing, and if these essays had contained actual writing advice, I would have been much more engaged.

This book is a retelling of mythology, and an examination of why Odysseus, upon his return to Ithaca, chose to kill twelve maids of his court. As Atwood explains in her introduction: ""I've chosen to give the telling of the story to Penelope and to the twelve hanged maids. The maids form a changing and singing Chorus which focuses on two questions that must pose themselves after any close reading of 'The Odyssey': what led to the hanging of the maids, and what was Penelope really up to? The story as told in 'The Odyssey' doesn't hold water: there are too many inconsistencies. I've always been haunted by the hanged maids; and, in 'The Penelopiad,' so is Penelope herself."" (pg xv)That sums up this book in its entirety: Penelope, in the afterlife, remains haunted (literally and figuratively) by the deaths of her maids. She also remains in love with her husband, Odysseus, and still has no answers as to why those twelve young women were hanged.If you're looking for a deeper understanding of Ancient Greek patriarchy, and/or an examination of the patriarchal ""necessity"" of murdering ""vile whores,"" I would suggest you read nonfiction by Andrea Dworkin, and not seek answers here. Atwood provides none. But Andrea Dworkin sure does.Penelope's voice in this book is self-deprecating and wry. Many lines are quite humorous. The Greek chorus of the maids is both irreverent and tragic. This book is a light, easy read. The story certainly condemns the immorality of killing innocent rape victims. But it offers no logical underpinnings, no specific reasoning, as to why societies from Ancient Greece to present day continue to murder rape victims, especially female rape victims. At least this book condemns the action as immoral. But, as in so many outwardly feminist retellings of ""The Odyssey,"" Odysseus remains the most interesting character in this book, and it's clear that Penelope would enjoy her afterlife a lot more if the group of dead maids (who travel like a gang in the underworld) would not swarm around her husband so much, scaring him and causing him to keep seeking to be reborn on earth rather than stay in the afterlife with his wife.I thought this book was a far more feminist work than Madeline Miller's 2018 novel, ""Circe.""

This storyFirst published in 2007, ""Flight,"" a contemporary time-travel novel by Sherman Alexie, is a darkly comedic, horrifying, and uplifting book. This story celebrates the absurdity and hilarity of being alive. The main character is an adolescent boy in foster care. He identifies as half Native American and half white. His face is covered in zits, and he calls himself ""Zits."" Zits is incredibly angry and emotionally unstable. His entire life has been profoundly traumatic, and his foster homes have been highly abusive. As his rage and violent behavior spiral out of control, he reaches a psychological crisis moment in which he starts to travel through time. His mind and spirit travel into different bodies at different moments in history. Zits also travels into an adult body in the present day of the story. This time-traveling experience opens his heart and mind to a larger understanding of life. After all of these moments of radical, time-traveling empathy, Zits returns to his own body. Then, much like Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol,"" Zits realizes he can now make a choice: continue on as before, or be a better person.I really enjoyed this book, and I loved the ending. But I can see how this book might not be for everyone. While the novel is honest about the colonial genocide of Native Americans, white people still get to be the heroes in this book. There is also the fact that Zits relentlessly objectifies women. Teenage boys are certainly taught to do that, and Zits is no different. There's a thick current of sexism that runs unchecked throughout the whole story. Personally, I think this adds to the book's realism, but I can see how other readers might feel sickened.""Flight"" reads a lot like a YA novel, and I would definitely recommend this book to teen boys. I think a lot of teen boys would feel a real connection with Zits and his plight. Zits is a rape victim, a victim of physical violence, a victim of familial abandonment. His voice is authentic. His trauma is more than skin-deep. Were I a teenage boy right now, in modern America, this is exactly the kind of novel I would most need to read.Five stars. I thought this was excellent.

I wanted to read a lot more about Zola than what I could find online. Since my public library is not allowing Inter-Library Loans during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nelson's book was the only work on Zola I could afford to purchase online.I'm so glad I was able to get my hands on this book. I enjoyed every page. This is a slim, dense volume, and I read the book twice. I read the section about the Dreyfus Affair, and Zola's probable murder by the far-right Ligue des Patriotes (League of Patriots), three times. Nelson does a remarkable job of explaining all of this material in succinct, accessible prose. In 1908, Zola's remains were transferred to the Panthéon monument in Paris. ""He was only the fourth French writer to be buried in the Panthéon, following Voltaire (1791), Rousseau (1794), and Victor Hugo (1885)."" (pg 122) After reading that, I looked up pictures of Zola's tomb online.Zola is a phenomenal writer. Nelson's prose about Zola's work is terse and restrained, and while he certainly praises Zola, he doesn't gush.

Unfortunately, it languished on my bookshelf until December 2020, when I finally picked it up to read.Many sci-fi/fantasy stories feature hyper-masculine men completing heroic, ultra-manly deeds. Saving damsels, killing Big Bads, and saving the world. This collection is the extreme opposite of that type of storytelling.More than anything, I thought these stories were about middle-aged men who struggle to live up to masculinity norms, men who feel a lack of purpose in their lives, and men who deeply fear women: women's bodies and women's sexual rejection.It's honestly kind of refreshing to come across such a subversive collection of sci-fi/fantasy stories. It makes me reflect a lot on gender norms and storytelling, and how much adhering to gender norms drives most storytelling. Authors do not often spell out their intentions in books, and this collection does not contain any kind of author's note in which Van Pelt states his intentions for publishing this collection. I cannot know whether my takeaways are anything close to what the author intended for this book.But I definitely came away from this collection thinking that a lot of ""living up to masculinity"" is the projection of confidence, either true confidence or faked, and what the protagonists of these stories all greatly lack is confidence. It was the cumulative effect of reading so many stories about timid people who struggle (and often fail) to find meaning and purpose in their lives that led me to stop reading this book on page 230 (of 303 pages total).One story in particular, ""Rock House,"" seemed to be a direct retelling of Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" but lacked all of the shocking/thrilling excitement of Poe's tale. The protagonist of ""Rock House"" doesn't react with any amount of horror or despair to the plot twist. The only emotion I could detect in the story was ""resigned weariness."" Honestly, that was the primary emotion I felt from all of the protagonists in this book: resigned weariness. Not a weariness brought on from old age, but from middle-aged diffidence and fatigue.The cover art for this book, which features an analogue clock popping out of a woman's womb, signifying the anxiety of a woman's ""ticking biological clock"" running down amidst a chaotic world of sexual malaise and ennui, is an excellent (if overdetermined) metaphor for the content of ""Flying in the Heart of the Lafayette Escadrille."" The stories in this book are much more realistic than typical sci-fi/fantasy wish-fulfillment tales of hyper-masculine men surviving great feats of derring-do. Rather than celebrating brinkmanship, this collection is honest about the loneliness, alienation, and diffidence of suburban Americans, people disconnected from their communities and the land they live on. But that honesty comes at a price, and these stories don't make for easy reading. A lot of readers turn to sci-fi/fantasy for thrilling adventures and escapism. But these tales are heavily rooted in sadness and pyrrhic victories, and illustrate the fact that boredom is often the reward for ""doing the right thing."" I'm glad I bought this book, and I'm glad I read it. It's useful to know that I can read and appreciate stories about timid, diffident people starring in sci-fi/fantasy tales. I just have a hard time reading one right after another. Recommended for readers interested in sci-fi/fantasy stories that focus on loneliness, alienation, and the fear of women.

I carefully read the first 24 pages, but was soon overwhelmed by boredom. I was a Religious Studies major in college, and this slim volume is a highly problematic 101 primer on the most basic theories of human history and global mythology. It's also primarily -- almost entirely -- focused on the West.After giving up on page 24, I skim-read the rest of the book, looking for material that might be new to me, or at least more interesting to read about. Sadly, I didn't find anything of value. This book is very dry, frequently misleading or flat-out incorrect, and intolerably boring. If I hadn't taken so many college history courses, I might have found ""A Short History of Myth"" more interesting. But the whole book is truly the most basic 101 primer, and I think the intended audience would be a reader who knows little to nothing about human history. There is not one word in this book about religion and mythology in pre-Columbian North and South America. The religion and mythology of Africa is limited to Egypt. I have major problems with how Armstrong presents her opinions as facts, and spreads the most bizarre interpretations of history, entirely divorced from the lived realities of societal forces. For instance, take this passage on pages 128-129:""Paradoxically, however, the Age of Reason witnessed an irruption of irrationality. The great Witch Craze of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which raged through many of the Catholic and Protestant countries of Europe, showed that scientific rationalism could not always hold the darker forces of the mind at bay. The Witch Craze was a collective demonic fantasy that led to the execution and torture of thousands of men and women.""^^Passages like that one just really piss me off. The overwhelming majority of people persecuted and killed in the Witch Craze were women, and it had more to do with upholding the patriarchy than it did ""irrationality."" But Armstrong would have the reader believe that men and women suffered equally, and the word ""patriarchy"" is never mentioned anywhere in this book. Armstrong talks about the modern, industrialized world as a place that lacks myth, and states on page 137:""We need myths that help us to venerate the earth as sacred once again, instead of merely using it as a 'resource.'""^^The truth is, understanding the earth as a ""resource"" is also a myth: a modern enactment of ancient mythology. In this case, the belief that the earth is to be used as a resource is straight from the Bible. The Book of Genesis, to be more precise. I won't cite any more examples, but I sure could have. I'm definitely not the audience for this book.Three stars. I wouldn't recommend this book, but if you need a really generic, patriarchal, and problematic overview of human history and mythology, just for a highlight reel of notable Western developments, this book might be helpful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 12, 2020","Dec 12, 2020","Dec 12, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27311.A_Short_History_of_Myth

When I realized it was exactly like reading ""Ulysses,"" and that Whittman was deeply bigoted and sexist, a (supposedly) lovable-doofus-type who has an endless awareness of pop culture, loves books, art, and theater, and is on a journey of growing his own self-awareness, I just couldn't keep reading.

I'm sorry, but nothing about this book is pulling me in. Everything is actively throwing me OUT of this novel, and I have to stop reading.Reading twelve pages of this novel felt like suffering. I read a number of 5-star s on Goodreads, trying to convince myself to keep reading. It didn't work. Next, I read the story synopsis on Wikipedia, trying again to convince myself to overcome my revulsion and keep going.

I especially do not enjoy what I've read of Whittman's interior monologue. I strongly dislike this character, and I have no desire to be in this man's head.

A3.5 starsPublished in 2016, the YA contemporary novel, ""Love & Gelato,"" by Jenna Evans Welch, was so popular that it kicked off the ""Love &"" series. After ""Love & Olives"" (set in Greece) hit the NYT bestseller list in 2020, I decided to check out the first book in the series, which is set in Italy.This story is cute, and overall, pretty fun. There's a lot of unrealistic plot contrivance involved to get the protagonist, Lina, to Florence, Italy, for a summer. The prose is so simplistic -- and the story details so unrealistic -- that it reads more like middle grade fiction than YA. I read the first 100 pages, and then had to start skimming.The most compelling part of the book was reading about Lina's deceased mother's life, through her mother's journal. I frequently found myself absorbed by those sections, and would start actively reading again. Lina's thru-story in Florence was disappointing; it was super cheesy, and takes place in less than one week. I skipped entire pages of Lina's internal middle-grade angst over Lorenzo, the love interest, and missed nothing. Suffice it to say, Lina has sufficient emo drama for a YA romance heroine, and I'm sure that's a big part of why this book sold so well.Overall, a very sweet story. Recommended for fans of YA contemporary and anyone who is looking for a cute, happy read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 10, 2020","Jan 05, 2021","Dec 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25756328-love-gelato

I truly lovPublished in 2018, ""Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,"" by Anand Giridharadas, is an excellent work of nonfiction. I truly loved it.This book doesn't use taboo words like ""classism,"" or ""class conflict,"" ""class struggle,"" or -- God forbid -- ""proletariat, bourgeois, owners, capital"" or the like. Giridharadas is far too savvy to make such foolish mistakes. He knows the largely Democratic, largely liberal, progressive book-buying public would drop his book like a used diaper if he included those evil, disgusting terms in his narrative. But in all truth, this book is about class conflict and class oppression. Giridharadas is careful not to phrase it that way. He's pointing out hypocrisy, greed, racism, classism, and cruelty, especially within the educated, Democratic-voting bloc of ""liberal elites,"" the same liberal elites that the Trump voters took such vicious aim against in 2016, and are still taking aim against as I write this  in December 2020.Giridharadas doesn't use such a Republican, filthy term as I'm using in this  -- ""the liberal elites"" -- but if you're at all familiar with Fox News, Republican-funded journalism, and conservative, red-pill media, you know this is the slanderous term they use for their enemies: the Hillary voters, the Biden supporters. Etc. Giridharadas is saying, as concisely -- and overall, as gently -- as he can in this book, that the liberal elites are not innocent. They have done massive socioeconomic damage, and continue to perpetuate massive socioeconomic harm -- within the United States. And maybe, just maybe, if progressive Democrats actually believe in justice, fairness, and equality, they should start thinking about people as human beings, rather than objects to be exploited. Especially poor people. Giridharadas makes it abundantly clear that Democrats, progressives, and the ""liberal elites"" have no problem looking at the working poor in America as objects to be exploited. He does so in the most civil, gentle way that he can. But the truth is still the truth, and he doesn't shy away from the truth.I really loved this book.

I picked this book up knowing nothing about it, and found myPublished in 1885, Émile Zola's historical novel, ""Germinal,"" is a triumph of literature. I picked this book up knowing nothing about it, and found myself enthralled. At 499 pages, it's a bit of a commitment to read. But the prose is accessible, the story immediately engaging, and the pages flew by.For as much as I love this book, I know it's deeply flawed. The main character, Étienne Lantier, is intensely misogynistic, and so is the third person omniscient narrative voice. This book is saturated in rape culture, a rape culture that is imbued throughout Zola's prose. The beginning of this novel, especially, was pretty triggering for me. Between the oppression of women and the oppression of the poor, I frequently put the book down, due to how much it was spiking my own bad memories of growing up in poverty and the intense misogyny and abuse in my own childhood. Zola's writing is incredibly realistic, and drawn from careful observation. It's horrifying to reflect on how very little difference exists between growing up in poverty in 1880s France, and growing up in poverty in 1980s America. Zola's realism makes this book excellent, but also a very difficult read.Needless to say, Étienne Lantier was most certainly *not* my favorite character. The melodramatic love story between Lantier, 15-year-old Catherine, and the wife-beating asshole, Chaval, made me feel profound distaste. Narratively, this plot-line frames the whole book, even more than the details about unionizing workers and fighting class oppression. I can understand why Zola structured the entire novel around this love story, but for me personally, it was the most obnoxious part of the book. Zola made it clear to the reader that if Lantier (an impoverished man in his twenties), had only had the courage to rape Catherine first, before Chaval did, then Catherine would have been Lantier's woman: she would have belonged to Lantier instead of the uber-brute, Chaval, and everyone would have been better off. It's pretty repulsive. But is it realistic? Yes, it is. Rape culture is the air we breathe, whether we're examining 2020 America or class conflict in 1880s France.My favorite character in this book is Bonnemort, which is the nickname of old man Maheu. Bonnemort is the first person Étienne meets and talks to at the Le Voreux coal mine, a fictional coal mine modeled after the many real coal mines in northern France.This book is a long way from the lives of workers'-rights, union-organizing/union-promoting women like Crystal Lee Sutton (who the 1979 film ""Norma Rae"" is based on), Dolores Huerta, Helen Keller, Eleanor Roosevelt, or fighters of big business like Erin Brockovich. While female characters play an enormous role in this novel, the story is absolutely patriarchal, at its core. But it's still a great book. The real beating heart of ""Germinal"" is centered on class conflict, and depicts the difficulties of organizing unions, the brutal realities of strikes, and the horrors of worker oppression. The characters are so very real and compelling. I was invested in this story from page one.I loved this book far more than John Steinbeck's 1936 novel, ""In Dubious Battle."" Zola's ""Germinal"" is far superior to every other fictional work I've ever read about unions, strikes, and class conflict. Zola did something truly incredible in this book: he made his bourgeois readers (in France in 1885) contemplate their own ignorance and complicity. Not because Zola went out of his way to skewer them, but because he deliberately coddled them in the narrative. Zola's gentleness and compassion for the bourgeoisie characters in ""Germinal"" has the delightful effect of leaving it up to the reader to condemn them, a condemnation that feels inescapable as well as inevitable. It's such a powerful rush, as a reader, to feel that level of self-driven moral righteousness explode in a text. It's the literary version of orgasm. There were moments, reading this book, when I was suddenly so overwhelmed with pleasure that I ran around in my house, holding this book up above my head and shouting at my husband, ""This book is f*cking awesome!!""It's a rare novel that makes me jump up and run around in my house yelling about how awesome it is. I'm really glad Zola is buried in the Panthéon, in the same room with Victor Hugo. He definitely deserves an honor like that. As to the misogyny in this book: I think it's like the racism level in a novel like ""Heart of Darkness."" Sometimes books are saturated in something incredibly shitty, but they still shine a light on something else that is incredibly shitty. Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" condemns colonialism and imperial brutality. ""Germinal"" condemns worker oppression. Not because Zola wrote propaganda. Oh no, absolutely not. It's because the narrative *isn't* propaganda at all. It's realism, and French naturalism, shaped into story. It's what makes the book so damn good.My favorite paragraph in the book describes the anarchist, Souvarine, near the end of the novel:""At that moment Souvarine rose to his feet on the shaken slag-heap. He had recognized Maheude and Zacharie sobbing together in the presence of this total collapse which must be pressing with its stupendous weight on the heads of those poor wretches dying down below. He threw away his last cigarette and walked off into the darkness without so much as a glance behind. His shadowy form dwindled and merged into the night. He was bound for the unknown, over yonder, calmly going to deal violent destruction wherever dynamite could be found to blow up cities and men. Doubtless, on that day when the last expiring bourgeois hear the very stones of the streets exploding under their feet, he will be there."" (pg 453)Zola tapped the fears of the bourgeoisie as fuel for this book. Oppression makes anarchy appealing to the oppressed, and anarchy makes order unstable. It's profoundly unsettling, and leads to violence, destruction, death.In studying Zola's life and his own writing about ""Germinal,"" it's clear that he felt profound pity for the oppressed. But he resolved to depict them on the page in a straightforward manner, without moralizing. I think he achieved his mission remarkably well.This is such an incredibly good book. Deeply flawed, yes, because in the years since this was published, modern feminism rose up and pointed the way to a new understanding of women, of the Other, as full human beings. But in 1885, Zola didn't have access to 20th century feminist thought. Then again, in rural Illinois in the 1980s, I grew up with just as much rape culture as what is depicted in this novel. I cannot fault Zola for keepin' it real. This book is absolutely real.Ten million stars. ""Germinal"" is a masterwork of fiction. I love it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 29, 2020","Jan 03, 2021","Nov 29, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/437141.Germinal

He's won a Pulitzer Prize for his plays, Tony nominations, and many other awards and acclaim. ""Three Uses of the Knife"" is not a how-to book about craft. It's a summary of Mamet's thoughts about why plays exist -- why theater exists -- and what the audience gets out of it.This book is entertaining as hell. It's extremely dark and grim. From what I know of Mamet's work, this is much to be expected. Here are some quotes that stood out to me that I thought I would share, and comment on:""Myth, religion, and tragedy approach our insecurity somewhat differently. They awaken awe. They do not deny our powerlessness, but through its avowal they free us of the burden of its repression."" (pg 15)^^This is not true for everyone, but I can easily understand how it is true for some.""We step onto the car dealer's lot to play out a drama. It is our infrequent opportunity to be made much of, to be courted. We don't want to hear about the design of the engine, we want to hear how smart we are."" (pg 23)^^This is not true for me, but I know for many people this is exactly the case. ""The purpose of art is to delight us: certain men and women (no smarter than you or I) whose art can delight us have been given dispensation from going out and fetching water and carrying wood. It's no more elaborate than that."" (pg 26)^^I would say this is the purpose of entertainment, not art. But Mamet and I drastically differ that way.""We all have a myth and we all live by a myth. That's what we live for. Part of the hero journey is that the hero (artist/protagonist) has to change her understanding completely, whether through the force of circumstance (which happens more often in drama) or through the force of will (which happens more often in tragedy). The hero must revamp her thinking about the world. And this revamping can lead to great art."" (pg 38)^^Yes, I completely agree.""For much of our lives we are mired in an inability to frankly regard the middle term, to admit we have made a wrong turning [sic], to return (so we might think) to the beginning of our struggle for knowledge. We tend to elect, rather, to continue in error."" (pg 42)^^Very true, and delightfully put.""Our Defense Department exists neither to 'maintain our place in the world' nor to 'provide security against external threats.' It exists because we are willing to squander all -- wealth, youth, life, peace, honor, everything -- to defend ourselves against feelings of our own worthlessness, our own powerlessness."" (pg 44-45)^^I agree and disagree. Mamet moves into an entirely theoretical land regarding lived reality that I know is untrue. I can't ignore lived reality to the extent that he does. I know that he is certainly sharing truth with this statement, but it isn't the whole truth. The disagreement I have with him here is no small thing, since the statement quoted above gets at what he thinks the purpose of drama is: to free people from the burden of repressing their powerlessness and worthlessness. Being free from the burden of repression, to Mamet, is completely different from ""forgetting"" all knowledge of one's own worthlessness, since forgetting the truth, to Mamet, is simply another form of repression --""Art, which exists to bring [the audience member internal, personal] peace, becomes entertainment, which exists to divert, and is becoming totalitarianism, which exists to censor and control. The desire to express becomes, absent the artist and in the face of the terrifying, the need to repress. The 'information age' is the creation, by the body politic, through the collective unconscious, of a mechanism of repression, a mechanism that offers us a diversion from our knowledge of our own worthlessness."" (pg 53)^^How much you agree or disagree with Mamet's conclusion here might determine how much you enjoy reading this book. Personally, I don't agree that this is always true, or always true for all people, but I find him highly entertaining to read, nonetheless.""But a play is not about nice things happening to nice people. A play is about rather terrible things happening to people who are as nice or not nice as we ourselves are."" (pg 67-68)^^Heck yes. There are plenty of statements in this book that I 100% agree with. Especially the final lines of this book, which are brilliant:""At the End of the Play, when we had, it seemed, exhausted all possible avenues of investigation, when we were without recourse or resource (or so it seemed), when we were all but powerless, all was made whole. It was made whole when the truth came out.At that point, then, in the well-wrought play (and perhaps in the honestly examined life), we will understand that what seemed accidental was essential, we will perceive the pattern wrought by our character, we will be free to sigh or mourn. And then we can go home."" (pg 79-80)^^Yes, yes. Amen.Overall, this is an engaging book to read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading about drama, and to anyone who is a writer, no matter what kind of writing you do.Five stars.

I bought this book just before the COVID-19 pandemic began, and read it in March or April 2020.This book is okay. It's not very deep or insightful, but it's readable, and Lewis Howes shares some interesting personal information that I enjoyed learning about.Howes states that the journey of exploring his own masculinity was inspired by Joe Ehrmann's 2013 TEDx Baltimore talk: ""Be a Man,"" and the 2015 documentary, ""The Mask You Live In."" Howes ends the book, on pg 221, with a section titled, ""Now Pay It Forward,"" which begins this way:""We talked a lot about masculinity in this book, but I have deliberately steered away from the tricky waters of biology and gender. I know nothing about these topics, although I do know about the basic propagation of our species.""I nearly fell on the floor laughing when I read that. Howes states, at the very end of his book, that he knows nothing about ""gender,"" but he wrote an entire book ABOUT gender. Masculinity *is* a gender. I'll also mention that the word ""patriarchy"" does not appear in this book. Neither do the words ""gender roles."" Page 221 is the one and only time the word ""gender"" ever appears in this book.The fact that masculinity is a cultural invention is never mentioned in this book. If you are in the mood to read a book with actual depth, this really isn't the best choice. If you are someone who has NEVER questioned what ""masculinity"" is, or its effects on boys and men, and would prefer to examine these subjects in the most facile way, then this book is a great choice. Howes focuses on the nine most stereotypical types of modern masculinity, and the damage these mainstream forms of masculinity can have on men's psyches. This book is about helping men get in touch with their emotions, and then spreading the message that they can still be men by doing so. There are many more types of masculinity that are never examined or even mentioned in this book. The fact that many women and people assigned female at birth adopt the same stereotypical traits of masculinity that men do, as a function of surviving in the modern capitalist patriarchy, is never mentioned in this book. Transgender people are never mentioned in this book, either. Howes is just focused on ""typical""/stereotypical men (people assigned male at birth) being told they can embrace their emotions and still ""be men."" This is a good and useful message, and I fully support it.I appreciate Howes for his YouTube channel, and for the free content he makes available online. For those reasons, I'm glad that I bought and read this book.I would recommend this book for ""traditional men"" who are allergic to the word ""gender"" and believe the word ""patriarchy"" is a nonsense word invented by hysterical women who just need to have a baby and cook a casserole and calm the F down. That kind of ""traditional man"" is the perfect audience for this book, and I'd highly recommend it to them. I highly recommend the ""Be a Man"" TEDx talk and the documentary ""The Mask You Live In"" to EVERYONE. Both works are more insightful and impactful than this book was for me, but I appreciate this book nonetheless. A big thank you to Lewis Howes for helping to spread a good message to the people suffering from the mental and emotional trauma of stereotypical masculinity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Nov 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36568656-the-mask-of-masculinity

Anyone who is considering reading this book should be aware that the story sh*ts all over the #MeToo movement and demonizes women who help victims of domestic abuse escape their abusers. Depression is used as a plot device to forward an overall misogynistic agenda. This book is incredibly patriarchal, an extremely lackluster thriller, and an overall clusterf*ck.But I'm still going to give it three stars, for one simple reason: the prose is engaging and funny, and evokes a believable, authentic romance.The main plot of this book is the love story between Poppy and Drew, a younger woman who marries a much older and incredibly wealthy man. As a romance, ""The Truth Hurts"" works just fine as a story. The vast bulk of this novel is devoted to describing and developing Poppy and Drew's courtship, relationship, and marriage.The thriller components are extremely bizarre, and thrown in at the end, within the last few pages. The gothic, atmospheric elements in the middle of the story are all dropped before the final third of the book, and left unexplained and unremarked upon, solely existing as meaningless drama. For all that this novel is problematic silliness, it's still easy and fun to read, and the author never mistakes degradation for love. ""The Truth Hurts"" is a love story with great chemistry and high-society social commentary, with a ""plot twist"" ending of ""secret sociopaths"" thrown in near the very last page.The secret sociopaths plot twist ending is where all of the problematic material occurs. Fortunately, none of it diminishes the authentic love story between Poppy and Drew. It's such a relief to read a romance in which the male love interest does not name-call the heroine, physically hurt her, or contemplate killing her. Drew is not violent or a misogynist. He also doesn't want Poppy to change at all; he fully loves her just as she is, and that never changes, even after the plot twist. In modern storytelling terms, the male love interest in this book, and his relationship with the heroine, really is a breath of fresh air.The story's demonization of Gina, a woman trying to help a friend escape what she thinks is a violent relationship; the way a grown man's suicide is blamed on a teenage girl to the point that she is called his murderer; the way the story demonizes teen girls who come forward with admissions of sexual abuse: all of this material is so incredibly harmful and problematic that it really sickens me. ""The Truth Hurts"" definitely deserves a one-star  of disgust for all of this content, and more. But the core romance of this book is not misogynistic. And in a world in which I am increasingly given misogynistic romances to read and told I should somehow proclaim them as #feminist, ""The Truth Hurts"" is a rare breed of book that depicts authentic love on the page. The plot twist of secret sociopaths is ridiculous and unbelievable. The last-second, deus ex machina twist is what qualifies ""The Truth Hurts"" as a thriller, and I find it incredibly silly and honestly, contemptuous. I picked up this book after other ers compared it to ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Rebecca,"" which is laughable. This novel is not a gothic romance, and it is nothing like those works. It's more like a non-Pygmalion/non-sexist retelling of ""Pretty Woman"" with a heavy dose of ableism thrown in. Three stars.

The book is largely focused on female victims with male abusers, and the many cultural barriers that prevent these women from recognizing their situation and seeking help, as well as the fact that society largely leaves these women to fend for themselves, to often devastating results.The prose of this book is fairly dry and repetitive. The content was often very depressing to read.

After reading ""Not to People Like Us,"" I realized that ""Big Little Lies"" further perpetuated false information and myths about upscale abuse (domestic violence in affluent homes), myths and misunderstandings that ""Not to People Like Us"" stridently sets out to correct. The fact that the novel works AGAINST its own stated research made me dislike the novel ""Big Little Lies"" even more, to the point that thinking about ""Big Little Lies"" now disgusts me. Maybe novelist Liane Moriarty claimed that she read this nonfiction book in order to make her novel seem more authoritative and/or informative, when in truth, Moriarty was simply peddling the same damaging myths about domestic violence that this work of nonfiction seeks to correct. Here are some of my biggest personal takeaways from ""Not to People Like Us,"" which I read a couple of months ago (Sept./Oct. 2020), now that I have had plenty of time to reflect on what has stayed with me from this book.1. A lot of upscale abusers have Narcissistic Personality Disorder, or NPD. That means that these abusers lack the capacity for empathy, and will never change. Learning more about NPD is vital to helping women (and men, and people of any gender) who end up in relationships with people who have NPD. 2. People who have NPD (and all upscale abusers in general) do not have a ""honeymoon phase"" in their relationships. Upscale abusers are *very* different from abusers who live in poverty, the working class, and the lower-middle class. (""Big Little Lies"" depicted an upscale abuser who actually behaves in all ways like an abuser from an economically disadvantaged household, because this is the ""type of abuse"" most people are familiar with when we think of domestic abuse.) ""Not to People Like Us"" is a long examination of the many ways that upscale abuse (which is extraordinarily violent and completely horrifying) presents very differently than abuse in lower socioeconomic-class homes.3. For children, witnessing domestic abuse may be as traumatic and harmful as being physically abused themselves. (pg 170)4. Abusive men in economically disadvantaged homes are more likely to have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) than NPD (which is primarily seen in abusers who are upper-class and upper-middle-class). (pg 136-137)5. Children who grow up in homes with domestic violence may feel ""an exaggerated sense of guilt and responsibility for protecting their mothers and younger siblings. This is related to the syndrome of the 'parentified child,' in which the child, old beyond his years, feels that it is not acceptable or safe to feel, be, or behave like a child."" (pg 171)For me personally, I had never come across the terminology of a ""parentified child"" before, and it was a revelation. My own personal life falls under this terminology exactly.6. ""When we consider the particular trauma that children in violent households experience [...]: Trauma specialist Judith Herman states that trauma occurs when 'the victim is rendered helpless by overwhelming force' and when 'the ordinary systems of care that give people a sense of control, connection, and meaning' are overwhelmed."" (pg 171/172)7. ""Children from upscale abusive marriages experience much the same sense of danger (although certainly not material worries) that any less affluent child might."" (pg 172)**********I grew up in poverty, in a home with some domestic violence and a whole lot of child abuse. In August 2020, I started doing a lot of research into NPD and BPD, and I was amazed to pick up this book a month later, and discover that both disorders are so common, and known, among abusers. People with NPD are scary AF. I'm pretty certain that my own childhood abuser has NPD as well as BPD, or comorbid disorders, a personality disorder comorbidity which is also recognized by psychologists and psychiatrists who study BPD and NPD.Like the abusive men who have Borderline Personality Disorder discussed in ""Not to People Like Us,"" my childhood abuser has never been able to hold down a steady job (the longest she has ever been employed is a few weeks at a time), and has struggled mightily with money and finances her whole life. But it is her NPD which prohibits her from being able to seek help for herself, and keeps her trapped in daily episodes of Narcissistic Rage, which triggers her violent episodes. Even though ""Not to People Like Us"" didn't reflect my own socioeconomic circumstances growing up, it certainly shone a light on personality disorders and violence that I have directly suffered from my entire life. I'm incredibly grateful to Dr. Weitzman for her research, and for writing this book.If an updated version of ""Not to People Like Us"" were ever published, incorporating new psychological research and breakthroughs in psychiatry and domestic violence that have been made since 2000, I would certainly read it.Five stars. Highly recommended.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 09, 2020","Dec 10, 2020","Oct 09, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/343202.Not_To_People_Like_Us

Crane refuses to accept that she is a prostitute. Most of this book describes vile, degrading sexual activity in gruesome detail, only to have Crane reject the label of selling sexual activity as prostitution, and/or deny that she is selling sexual activity for money. She seems to believe that handjobs and being fingered at clubs do not constitute ""sex,"" and that only ""streetwalkers"" are truly ""prostitutes."" The level of cognitive dissonance Crane displays throughout this book is stark. If you want a memoir that contains emotional or psychological depth, this is not it. But if you want to be revolted, sickened, saddened, and horrified by the real-life work of stripping/exotic dancing, and have never encountered material like this before, then this book will be much more rewarding. Crane presents her sex work like a combat vet displaying their battle scars, only Crane insists that her self-degradation is self-empowerment. ""Spent"" wants the reader to know, without a doubt, that ""prostitution is a victimless crime,"" and that the sexual humiliation and sexual degradation of women is empowering. I can tolerate a lot of graphic content, but after 189 pages of Crane performing sex acts on people she loathed, and then wrote about in the most contemptuous way, I started skimming. I managed to make it to the last page (pg 274), but it was a trial. I put this book down feeling like I'd lost a piece of my soul and a whole lot of brain cells. Crane expresses contempt for her customers, and she is happy to steal from them. She is a woman whose heart is closed off from true intimacy, and her book was not written to explore her emotional interior at all. ""Spent"" is a disordered litany of Crane's extremely degrading work as a stripper and prostitute. The sentences are all written to punch the reader in the stomach, over and over. There's a mean-spirited edge in every well-crafted line. Crane is a proficient writer, hardhearted and clever. But she is certainly not wise, soulful, or insightful at all. For readers who are pro-porn and pro-stripping, rest assured that Crane also supports those views. No matter how worthless and empty sex work is for her, she is addicted to it, and she is deeply addicted to telling herself that this work is empowering. In the very last handjob she gives in the book, she walks out of the room to change, and listens to the man sob on the massage table. The chapter just ends right there. ""Spent"" is extremely depressing, and extremely real. Reading Crane's descriptions of sex work is like looking at a slab of rotten meat crawling with maggots. There is nothing wholesome or ennobling here. Sex work is societal rot, and Crane describes the putrid filth of it extremely well. But no matter how empty and pointless it all is, how hollow the work leaves her, or how violated she feels, Crane touts this work as empowering. If you are a hardcore sex work supporter who enjoys reading about vile, dehumanizing sex and promoting prostitution as a great career for women, then definitely read this memoir.Crane displays an alarming lack of understanding about power systems and patriarchy. She also takes a cheap shot at Andrea Dworkin. Honestly, I want to one-star the book for that. It was extremely uncalled for, and only proves how ignorant Crane is. After being arrested for prostitution, Crane is put into a jail cell with an 18-year-old girl who asks her, ""Why are you a prostitute?""From page 221:""That's a good question,"" I said. If she were Andrea Dworkin, she would accuse me of being a brainwashed drone of the patriarchy, succumbing to the violence against women. But I'd never thought of myself as a prostitute. *Until now.*"" [After this teenage girl called her one, she means.]*****^^I want to state a few things about how fucked up Crane's assessment of Dworkin and her life's work really is.1. Dworkin was a survivor of prostitution and domestic violence. She did NOT judge other women for being prostitutes or for being survivors of violence. Not EVER. She NEVER called prostitutes or sex workers ""brainwashed drones of the patriarchy."" I have read numerous Dworkin books. I promise you: what Crane is claiming here is a lie. Crane doesn't know what the fuck she is talking about when she brings up Andrea Dworkin, and it really pisses me off.2. Dworkin had more compassion and empathy for ALL people, of all genders and sexes, than Crane has ever had, or will ever have. Crane's mentality is a shining example of what bell hooks calls ""a female patriarch."" Dworkin was not a female patriarch. She fought for women's liberation, and she spoke truth to power. Dworkin is reviled and condemned by the patriarchy, and for good reason. Nothing is more damaging to power than telling the truth, and Dworkin was a radical truth-teller. 3. Dworkin unflinchingly examined her own soul, and the beating heart of power in all of society. It's why her work is so trenchant, and enduring. Crane wishes she were as intelligent and as thoughtful as Dworkin. Long after Crane is dead, people will still be reading Andrea Dworkin. But ""Spent: A Memoir"" will have no such lasting power. This book is simply one woman's nonsensical tirade that her self-destructive choices were actually true empowerment, and that Dworkin's condemnation of the patriarchy is the enemy. Sorry, but no; please try again. 4. Crane's memoir is entirely damning of sex work, despite her repeated claims otherwise. Nothing in this book portrays sex work in a positive, or even vaguely self-empowering light. Not even the two pages she devotes to the stripper union she helped create make me feel any shred of support for this industry. The sex in this book is some of the grossest material I've ever read, and since I read a LOT of nonfiction books about modern pornography, that's really saying something. *****Overall, I really hated this book. It's shallow. It's deeply patriarchal. It's gross. Crane takes a cheap shot at Dworkin. Like any good patriarch should.But in the end, this memoir portrays stripping as one of the most horrifically shitty, degrading jobs a person could ever do. This book makes working for minimum wage at Taco Bell look like being a CEO at Apple in comparison to being a stripper. Crane thinks she is spitting in Dworkin's eye with this book. I disagree. I think this book is 274 pages of resounding proof that Andrea Dworkin was absolutely right. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the real lives of strippers. But I would also recommend you read bell hooks, Gail Dines, Robert Jensen, Jackson Katz, Andrea Dworkin, Jean Killbourne, Audre Lorde, and other writers who do a better job examining the patriarchy for what it is. I think Crane's short-form work is much better than her memoir. The long-form narrative of this book was disjointed, choppy, and sometimes confusing. Her shorter pieces are much stronger, such as this Opinion piece in ""The New York Times"" --https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/op...^^""Stop Stealing from Strippers,"" published on August 13, 2015As to rating this memoir --Five stars for writing honestly about stripping. One star for shitting on Andrea Dworkin. One star for equating self-degradation with self-empowerment.Three stars overall....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 19, 2020",Oct 2020,"Sep 19, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30316151-spent

This is the second of Mura""A Wild Sheep Chase,"" the third published novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami, was first published in English in 1989. This is the second of Murakami's books I have read, after ""South of the Border, West of the Sun,"" a later work that was first published in English in 1999. I can officially say that Murakami does nothing for me. I don't enjoy his work, and I didn't enjoy anything about ""A Wild Sheep Chase."" But now that I've read two of his books, I feel like I'm better able to understand his appeal.According to the Wikipedia page about this book:""In 'A Wild Sheep Chase,' Murakami blends elements of American and English literature with Japanese contexts, exploring post-WWII Japanese cultural identity. The book is part mystery and part magical realism with a postmodern twist.""Technically, that is all true. But there is actually little to nothing about Japan or Japanese culture in any of Murakami's work. There is only the tiniest smidge of magical realism in this book. And only if you define postmodernism as ""absurdist ennui"" does this book qualify at all as postmodern.Murakami writes about the generic, suburban middle class: the people who fit in with the status quo, people who have enough money to live middle-class lives, and find themselves drowning in boredom, loneliness, and pointlessness. Murakami's work is especially popular among the middle class in the United States, and among middle-class readers in Japan and Germany: two nations profoundly impacted by U.S. rebuilding efforts after World War II. If you're familiar with the Marshall Plan and America's military and capitalist dominance of Japan after Hirohito's imperial surrender, you understand as much as I do how much America's popular culture and aspirational middle class messaging infiltrated Germany and Japan after the war. How much Murakami appeals to a reader depends upon how much you identify with the problems he writes about: middle-class boredom, loneliness, and pointlessness. Murakami's work does not deal with cultural forces of oppression. These are not stories that examine ableism, racism, classism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, or anything of the sort. ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" is a tale about an able-bodied, middle class man in his thirties who is struggling to find meaning in his solitary, profoundly boring, and abundantly average, mediocre life. In all ways, the unnamed protagonist is lauded for his mediocre existence. The novel's prose consistently carves out a space for the protagonist to be found worthy and heroic amidst his stunning levels of boredom and meaninglessness.Murakami does not set out to criticize American hegemony, either. His stories do not examine the U.S. military or its impact on Japan. There is nothing in his prose to make an American middle-class reader feel uncomfortable, or reflect on history, or learn anything about Japan. The great appeal in Murakami's work is its sameness: in illustrating how similar the Japanese middle class is to the American middle class and the German middle class. The reader is not invited to reflect on why this is so. Simply that it exists. That's part of how the status quo operates: the bubble of affluent safety is like a house of mirrors, always reflecting the sameness of what lies within. Therein lies the beauty and the appeal of Murakami's work. The ""mystery"" plot of ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" is this: an unnamed 30-year-old Japanese man, who is recently divorced, is slowly drowning in boredom and meaninglessness. He works in advertising. Very early in the book, he meets a woman who works as an ear model, and they have sex on and off, since the model also works as an escort and prostitute. One day, a mysterious man requests a meeting with the protagonist, and tells the protagonist that he has published a photograph in an insurance advertisement that is of great interest to the mysterious man's boss, a man called the Boss. The bucolic picture included a flock of sheep, and one curious sheep with a mark on its back: a star. This starred sheep, it turns out, is actually a powerful, controlling force of diabolical will, a will that has been asserting itself on the Boss. It has also given the unseen Boss a large growth in his brain that will kill him in a few weeks. The mysterious man tells the protagonist that he must go on a quest to find the starred sheep, or else. It is implied that the protagonist will have his life completely ruined and probably be murdered unless he finds the starred sheep in a set amount of time. I think the protagonist is originally given two months to find the sheep, and then the mysterious man shortens his time to one month.The protagonist, being a bored person with no meaning in his life, does not want to go on a quest, even if his life is about to be ruined and he will most likely be killed. His ear model lover is the one who convinces him to go on the quest, and she does this by packing her bags and going with him. At the halfway point of the novel, they leave the city where they live to begin the quest. They travel by train and meet a man who directs them to the field where the flock of sheep were photographed. The photograph was sent to the protagonist by an old friend of his called the Rat. The Rat's family owned a summer house on the mountainside where he photographed the sheep, a house the Rat still owns. The protagonist and his lover arrive at the old family house to find it empty, but fully stocked with provisions. The protagonist's lover abandons him at the house unexpectedly, and the protagonist spends a few weeks living in the house alone, cooking food for himself, drinking beer, and being incredibly bored. Sometimes, a man dressed up in a large, comical sheep's costume visits him at the house. They talk about mundane things, and then ""the Sheep Man,"" as he is called, always leaves again to go and live in the wilderness. Later, it is revealed that the Sheep Man is actually the Rat's ghost dressed up in this costume (pg 285).After weeks of solitary living and boredom, near the very end of the book, the protagonist wakes up in the dark to realize his old friend, the Rat, is dead, and has suddenly appeared in the house. The protagonist realizes he is talking to the Rat's ghost. The Rat explains that he killed himself in order to escape the diabolical will of the starred sheep, which had taken him over, just like it took over the Boss, and then killed the Boss with the growth in his brain. The Rat explains to the protagonist that the starred sheep targeted him because he had a fundamental weakness inside of him, and the starred sheep preys upon weakness:""'The bastard's got all sorts of feelers. It sticks them down your ears and nose like straws and sucks you dry. Gives me the creeps even now.''And for what in return?' [The protagonist asks.]'Things far too good for the likes of me. Not that the sheep got around to showing me anything in real form. All I ever saw was one tiny slice of the pie. And...'The Rat trailed off again.'And it was enough to draw me in. More than I'd care to confess. It's not something I can explain in words. It's like, well, like a blast furnace that smelts down everything it touches. A thing of such beauty, it drives you out of your mind. But it's hair-raising evil. Give your body over to it and everything goes. Consciousness, values, emotions, pain, everything. Gone. What it comes closest to is a dynamo manifesting the vital force at the root of all life in one solitary point of the universe.''Yet you were able to reject it.' [states the protagonist]'Yes. Everything was buried along with my body. There remains only one last thing to do in order to see it buried forever.''One last thing?''One last thing. And that I have to ask you to do. But let's not talk about it now.'We both took sips of beer. I was warming up.'The blood cyst works kind of like a whip, doesn't it?' I asked. 'For the sheep to manipulate the host.''Exactly. Once that forms, there's no escaping the sheep.''So what on earth was the Boss after, doing what he was doing?''He went mad. He probably couldn't take the heat of that blast furnace. The sheep used him to build up a supreme power base. That's why the sheep entered him. He was, in a word, disposable. The man was zero as a thinker, after all.''So when the Boss died, you were earmarked to take over that power base.''I'm afraid so.''And what lay ahead after that?''A realm of total conceptual anarchy. A scheme in which all opposites would be resolved into unity. With me and the sheep at the center.''So why did you reject it?'Time trailed off into death. And over this dead time, a silent snow was falling.'I guess I felt attached to my weakness. My pain and suffering too. Summer light, the smell of a breeze, the sound of cicadas -- if I like these things, why should I apologize. The same with having a beer with you..."" The Rat swallowed his words. 'I don't know why.'What could I say.'Somehow or other, we have created two completely different entities out of the same ingredients,' said the Rat. 'Do you believe the world is getting better?''Better or worse, who can tell?'The Rat laughed."" (pg 283-284)*****The essential truth of this novel is the idea that evil is an outside force that takes people over and forces them to do the will of evil. If you are a reader who believes in evil forces like Satan, and believes that natural destruction, like volcanoes exploding, or human-created destruction like war, occurs because a malevolent force of evil causes destruction, you will enjoy ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" a lot more than I could. I personally don't believe that Satan, or any external, timeless force of evil, causes natural disasters, war, anarchy, or other destructive things to occur. But I know plenty of people do believe this, and that's why it's hard to call this novel a work of magical realism. The protagonist's long conversation with the Rat's ghost and the revelations about the truth of the starred sheep are the two things that qualify this book as magical realism, but I don't see either literary device that way. Plenty of stories feature Satan and Satanic forces without being labeled magical realism, and ghost stories can be contemporary stories or paranormal stories, without qualifying as magical realism. After the Rat has revealed the truth about the starred sheep, he asks the protagonist to wind up the grandfather clock in the house at nine o'clock the next morning, connect a red and green cord behind the clock, and leave the house. The Rat tells the protagonist he has a meeting with the Boss's mysterious henchman the next day at noon. The protagonist follows the instructions, and he sees the mysterious man who sent him on the quest heading up to the house. The mysterious man gives the protagonist a check for a large sum of money, and the two part. The protagonist goes into town and gets on the train. As the train is leaving, he hears an explosion, and looks out the window to see a huge plume of smoke rising up on the mountainside. The reader is meant to understand that the protagonist set the bomb that blew up the Rat's house, the Rat's ghost, the mysterious henchman, and the evil force of will of the sheep. The protagonist has completed his hero's journey by annihilating the evil force of the sheep with the bomb blast. He finished the last step to destroy the supreme power base of the sheep, and save (what can only be assumed as) all of earth from becoming: ""A realm of total conceptual anarchy.""""A Wild Sheep Chase"" ends with the protagonist giving the check to a friend named J, so J can pay off his debts from opening up his restaurant. Then the protagonist goes and sits on a beach and cries. (pg 299)In order to save all earth from anarchy, and complete his hero's journey, the protagonist simply had to drink a lot of beer, wind up a grandfather clock, and plug in two cords to set a bomb. The destructive blast destroyed the force of evil that the Rat committed suicide in order to stop. I think the protagonist is crying over the loss of his friend at the end of the book, though I'm not entirely sure. He is probably also crying over the loss of his lover, since his lover left him because the Rat's ghost admittedly sent her away from the house, and thereby changed her forever (pg 285-286), leaving the protagonist all alone to complete the quest to stop the sheep/the force of diabolical will. ""A Wild Sheep Chase"" is a story fully grounded in modern, 1970s-era Japan, up until the end, when the protagonist talks to a ghost and learns that evil is a force of anarchy living in the body of a starred sheep.If absurdist ennui is your jam, then Murakami's work will be deeply appealing.For my part, I found absolutely nothing enjoyable about this book. It's technically a one-star/wanted-to-DNF read for me, but I finished the book so I could wrap my head around why Murakami is such a popular, award-winning, bestselling author. This  was my attempt to explain his appeal. I won't be reading anymore of his work, but I'm glad I have a better understanding as to why his books are so tremendously popular.3 stars.

I'm definitely not the audience for this book.I'm doing some research on modern psychological suspense, and for that reason, I've been picking up bestsellers in the genre of thriller and suspense. ""The Good Daughter"" is a perfect reminder of why I typically avoid this category.Before I continue, I want to warn readers of mild spoilers ahead. I won't give away the plot twists or the names of the ""real culprits"" in this story, but please DNF this  here if you plan to read this book, and prefer to go into it cold. Thanks.In interviews, Slaughter has stated that she was inspired to write this book out of love for her late 9th grade English teacher, who she recreated in fictional form in the character of Gamma, a very masculine, ingenious woman who once worked for NASA in the 1960s and '70s and quit her job to move to a small town in northern Georgia with her husband and raise their two daughters as a stay-at-home mom.When the story begins, Gamma's family home was recently burned to the ground (one week prior to page one), and she is currently living in a rundown, repulsive farmhouse in which the previous owner died. Gamma's house was burned down in an act of arson. Her husband, Rusty, is a lawyer who proudly defends rapists and murderers, gets their sentences reduced and/or keeps them out of jail, and after a young girl was gruesomely raped, sodomized, and committed suicide in town, only to have Rusty keep her rapist out of prison, some enterprising local -- or perhaps the police -- burned Rusty's house to the ground. Gamma and her daughters, Charlotte/Charlie (age 13) and Samantha/Sam (age 15), have lost everything but the clothes on their backs.Having dealt with a house fire myself, I well know how traumatizing it is. And the fire that took my family's home wasn't even caused by arson. That would have been even more traumatic for all of us to survive.But in Chapter One, there is no evidence that Gamma or her daughters are dealing with any trauma. The opening scene just reads like a typical day in their lives, in which they act petty, treat each other with casual cruelty, and cattily love each other as a sisterhood of women enduring life in a farmhouse because Rusty defends rapists and killers from prison.None of them express any anger or rage toward Rusty. None of them express any fear, either -- the fear that girls and women naturally have whenever a man who brutally rapes and sodomizes a young girl is set free. As a reader, I understand that I could have forgiven the emotional and psychological unreality on display in Chapter One if I had simply connected with any of these three characters: Gamma, Charlie, or Sam. But I honestly didn't like any of them. I kept waiting for one of them to think or say something that made some kind of actual sense, based on the situation they were in, and instead, there was no reality anywhere. All of them were just going about their small, petty lives, squabbling with each other as if their father's behavior weren't putting all of them into more and more danger. Rusty's lawyering choices were the white elephant in the room, and it stays that way throughout the entirety of the novel. I'm honestly baffled by this. A few pages into Chapter One, the latest impoverished, uneducated, criminal mastermind rapist/murderer that Rusty has kept out of prison shows up at the farmhouse to kill him and steal from him, having learned that Rusty possibly keeps boxes of cash in his house. The rapist/murderer, Zach, has learned that Rusty's house burned down, and he is afraid that Rusty will now want to ""collect on the debt"" that Zach owes him for his legal fees. So Zach decides to murder the lawyer who kept him out of prison, and steal the cash that he doesn't realize burned up in Rusty's house.Welcome to unreality upon unreality in this book. The whole premise here makes ZERO fucking sense, and the book is proud of that fact. It's abundantly clear that Slaughter views rapists and killers as brainless fools. I don't watch ""The Walking Dead,"" but I know the show is about zombies, and Zach is basically a murderous zombie in this book.Zach finds the three women at home alone. He and his partner proceed to shoot Gamma dead, shoot Sam in the head and bury her alive, and then brutally rape Charlie in a graphic rape scene that is described in detail. Chapter One is retold throughout the novel at least four different times, each time adding another layer of gruesome spectacle on a scene that was already gruesome spectacle. After Chapter One ends, the story jumps ahead 28 years, in which Charlie is now working as a lawyer, a lawyer just like her dad, defending drug dealers, rapists, and murderers from a life behind bars. She is also having an affair, and has to return her lover's cell phone to him at school. He is a middle school teacher. While Charlie is at the school, she witnesses a school shooting, and the gratuitous violence on display in the book goes from zero to one hundred again.The school shooter is a cognitively impaired teenage girl named Kelly. The plot of ""The Good Daughter"" centers on how Charlie and Sam work together to uncover the truth about how this school shooting took place, while the reader is constantly retold the events from Chapter One, supposedly so Charlie and Sam can ""heal"" from their past.""The Good Daughter,"" like most books, never once uses the word ""patriarchy,"" but I just want to say this: we live in a patriarchy, a system of power that intensely hates women and children, and these thriller authors have clearly gotten the message. Any time I pick up one of these books, I just think to myself: ""whenever there is an unknown killer on the loose, the killer will most likely be female, or a child, so pick out the women or child at the murder site, and all of the vile horror in the book will be the work of that woman or child."" This happens so often that I'm amazed anyone is ever surprised by ""the twists and turns"" in these books. ""The Good Daughter"" was sickeningly predictable that way.Also, the characters in most thrillers lack any adherence to realistic thinking and behavior. I guess if Slaughter were asked how the ""reveals"" in this book are supposed to make any sense, she would simply use that oft-repeated mantra of thrillers and suspense: ""they were all psychopaths.""Ah, yes. The psychopaths. The people who never make any sense because they were just born to never make any sense. Slaughter decided to cash in on some diversity checkboxing with this book, so she researched some information about Traumatic Brain Injury/TBI and wrote Sam's adult character with some mobility impairment as a result of being shot in the head at fifteen. Sam is still a genius who gets into Stanford at age 18 and lives independently as a lawyer in New York. She is also licensed to practice law in Georgia, so she is able to help Charlie solve the school shooting case, and take Kelly on as a client in this book. It's abundantly clear that Slaughter has no real-life experience of living with anyone with TBI, and even her Acknowledgments for this book make that clear. Sam is a highly ableist depiction of a woman with TBI, and the book's treatment of Kelly is outstandingly ableist on every level. Sam herself makes profoundly ableist, cruel statements throughout the book, things that no one with TBI would ever say 28 years after surviving a bullet to the head. Charlie's comments are not any better.Here is an exchange that Charlie and Sam have about Kelly on pg 273:""Huck said that she's low functioning. Rusty puts her IQ in the low seventy range."" She [Charlie] leaned toward Sam, elbows on her knees. ""I've met her mother. She's not bright, either."" [...]""So it's at least diminished capacity,"" Sam said. ""Her defense, I mean.""Again, Charlie shrugged with one shoulder. ""That's really the only strategy in any of these mass shooting cases. Why else would someone do that if they weren't crazy?""*****Later, on pg 351, Slaughter adds this --Rusty asked [Sam], ""What'd you think of her?""""Kelly?"" Sam considered her answer. ""I'm not sure. She could be smarter than we think. She could be lower functioning than any of us wants to believe. You can lead her anywhere, Dad. Anywhere.""""I've always preferred crazy to stupid. Stupid can break your heart.""*****I shit you the fuck not. That is HONESTLY the real dialogue in this book. Why do mass shooters exist? Because they are either ""stupid"" or ""crazy."" Holy fucking ableism, Batman. Also, a mass shooter is someone who kills four or more people in a single shooting event/killing spree. Kelly only kills two people: an adult teacher and an 8-year-old child. Kelly does not even qualify as a mass shooter, and these lawyers would all know that.""The Good Daughter"" just insists, with every page I turn, that I don't have a functioning brain, that I don't KNOW things, that I don't KNOW this book is such bullshit.I had other quotes I had planned to use in this , to illustrate the nonsensical, ableist, and misogynistic crap that this book is chock-full of. But on second thought, this is just not worth my time.Rusty never takes any responsibility for his behavior. In my home town, if you're a lawyer who defends a rapist murderer who sodomizes young children, and you keep that man free and he shows up at your house to murder your wife, shoot your 15-year-old daughter in the head, and brutally rape your 13-year-old daughter, we have an expression for that: ""You done got what was comin' to you."" No one ever says this to Rusty in this book. No one even THINKS it. Not his two grown daughters, who idolize him, and not anyone else in the town. The police are disgusting in this book. They're a bunch of corrupt monsters who kill people, plant evidence, and hate Rusty and his daughters simply because Rusty defends criminals. His daughters are bullied at school because he defends criminals. Everyone in this book is just shitty and gross. Except for Ben, Charlie's uber-perfect, long-suffering husband. Apparently, any woman who is brutally raped as a child becomes super determined to fuck up her life, because trauma. But as ""The Good Daughter"" makes sure to point out: because there are wonderful, loving men like Ben in the world, those women can overcome their trauma and heal.Thanks, I hate it.I think this book is fucking terrible. Negative twenty stars.(But I'm giving it 3 stars because I don't want the Slaughter stans to come after me. I have nothing against Karin Slaughter as a person. But this book is problematic and ignorant, and I hated it. Even skim-reading this crap robbed me of my will to live. I have to get this book back to the library ASAP, and hopefully allow my positive outlook on life to return.)Recommended for horror fans, and all the readers who are always ""surprised"" when the brutal mastermind killer turns out to be the woman or the child.

I don't normally enjoy mysteries, or thriller/suspense books, but I've been doing some research lately and was compelled to pick this one up.""Big Little Lies"" is like being served a big slab of cake that has a quarter-inch of cake with four inches of frosting on top. Cheap, heavy frosting that gives you a mild stomachache and stains your teeth. Reading this saccharine, silly book made me feel queasy. Moriarty is an excellent writer, and she has a real skill at crafting a scene and moving the dialogue along. ""Big Little Lies"" is designed to make the reader laugh aloud, since the book stars a mob of vacuous, I-need-to-speak-to-the-manager Karens, ""kindy moms"" complete with SUVs and iced bobs. If reading 458 pages of women mom-shaming each other over juice boxes and literally kicking sand at each other in an elementary school playground is your jam, then this book certainly caters to the mom-mockery appetite. Mmmm, all that frosting. So good.I dutifully read the first 180 pages, and then it finally dawned on me that reading this book carefully was pointless. There was really no content worth caring about, so I skimmed the rest. Moriarty did some nonfiction research on domestic violence, and this book features the most loving, sweet, Domestic Violence Lite portrayal I've ever read -- and that includes Colleen Hoover's 2016 bad romance, ""It Ends with Us,"" which had a very similar domestic violence portrayal. I forgave Hoover for skipping all of the verbal abuse in her book, since it was clear she researched a specific type of abuser to write her portrayal. Moriarty did NOT do that in ""Big Little Lies."" Her avoidance of the verbal abuse that this domestic abuser would be constantly using was simply to spare the reader -- and I found that choice morally wrong and problematic. The book also features some really bad hookup sex, hookup sex that is understood to be porn sex, since porn frequently depicts men choking, slapping, and hitting their female sex partners, forcing women to vomit, and plenty of other eroticized verbal and physical abuse against women. In the case of this hookup partner, he chokes the woman and verbally abuses her in his hotel room. The woman, a POV character named Jane, later says of this man and their hookup:""She'd never really existed to him. She was of no consequence in his life. He was married to a beautiful woman. Jane was pornography. Jane was the adult movie that didn't appear on his hotel bill. Jane was Internet porn, where every fetish can be fulfilled. You have a fetish for humiliating fat girls? Enter your credit card number and click right here."" (pg 416-417)I understand what Moriarty was going for here, but it's really goddamn offensive. Hooking up with a man who fucks a woman like a porn star, and treats his female hookup partner the way men treat women in porn, does NOT, in fact, make a woman ""pornography."" Jane was NOT paid to have sex with this man. He did NOT film her having sex with him. He did NOT put the video up on the internet, either for free or paid viewing.THAT is what pornography is. For Jane to claim that hooking up with a man who engages in porn sex with her makes her an ""adult movie,"" or ""Internet porn,"" is just wrong. It's wrong and offensive and sickening to me.Plenty of women have been filmed being raped or having sex with men who then made the video available online. ""Revenge porn"" is certainly a thing. A lot of porn is made *without* consent, too. With underage girls. When you watch or buy porn, online or in an adult store, there is just no way to know if the women you're watching on screen consented to it or not. Sadly, many women are violently coerced into porn, and many of the women are underage. Jane is not underage, she wasn't coerced, she wasn't paid for sex, she wasn't prostituted, she wasn't raped, and she wasn't filmed. It's wrong on all levels for her to call herself pornography. If Jane had called the abusive hookup sex ""porn sex,"" and been critical of porn sex, that would have been fine. Because it was clear her male partner *was* mimicking porn during their hookup, by choking her and verbally abusing her. All of that behavior is frequently featured in porn, and men *are* taught that women ""naturally"" orgasm to that treatment. During the hookup, it's clear that Jane's partner thought she would enjoy being choked, and that he didn't see anything abusive in his treatment of her.But ""Big Little Lies"" is careful not to critique the patriarchy too much. It hedges and softens. It promotes the idea that men who engage in porn sex and domestic violence deserve death, when in reality, both of these situations are preventable and fixable. Men can and do heal and change from having abusive porn sex as well as being domestic abusers. It takes work and commitment, but it is certainly possible. That's too much reality for ""Big Little Lies,"" however. Too much of a critique on the patriarchy for this book to engage in. I suppose it would detract too much from the main storyline, which is depicting the silliness and absurdity of a whole fleet of kindy moms with nothing better to do with their lives than be Karens. I can readily understand why this book was such a hit. It's very funny, and the plot hook of wondering: ""who was murdered, and how, and why, and by whom"" is very engaging. It gives the reader the sense that you might really be eating cake, rather than four inches of frosting.2.5 stars rounded up to three. Not the worst book I've ever read.

""Getting Off"" is nowhere near as emotionally challenging to read as Dworkin's work, or as hard-hitting, but he follows in her footsteps so well, adding a voice of male privilege into her radical feminist analysis, that this book was excellent, easy reading for me. I finished it in two days.Jensen's TED talk summarizes the main points from this book, so if you're interested in an abridged version of ""Getting Off,"" I would highly recommend his TED talk. He is an amazing human being. One of my favorites. <3Here is a section of text from the book's Introduction, pages 10-11:""Andrea [Dworkin] died on April 9, 2005, after struggling for several years with a variety of health problems that I assume were in some way related to her political work. Andrea had put her heart and soul and body on the line for a simple principle: Women matter as much as men, and men have it in them to recognize that and change. She remained open to the pain of both women and men in order to understand the complex way in which patriarchy can destroy women and constrain men. Whatever one thinks of her politics, it's impossible not to respect the courage with which she faced that pain. And it's hard not to recognize that it was that pain which, in part, killed her.I first heard of Andrea's death over the phone from my friend and co-author Gail Dines. I recall the sinking feeling in my stomach when she told me. My first words in response were, 'Oh Gail, what are we going to do now?'What we did, of course, was to keep on. Gail and I -- along with others who are committed to a feminist critique of the pornographic world -- have continued to work on research, writing, and organizing. It sounds clichéd, but it's what Andrea would have expected of us.I believe Andrea was the first person to understand that the contemporary pornography industry and the images it produces are a place to look squarely into the consequences of patriarchy and masculinity. To look honestly, I believe, is to open oneself up to the pain that Andrea articulated. That is not an easy task. It's tempting to want to look away or look only at the surface, and most people do. But to do that is to abandon our obligation to others and a duty to ourselves.This book is the product of nearly 20 years of work, activism, and struggle -- intellectual, political, and personal. I don't hold out my experience as completely typical, my path as a model, or my answers as universally applicable. But I'm pretty sure that the questions I have are important. I am sure that no matter how difficult it is to look at what pornography tells us about ourselves, we have to look.Can we bear to look? Can we afford not to?""*****As I type this  on August 21, 2020, recent reports have come out that domestic abuse against women and children during the COVID-19 pandemic have skyrocketed. Also, porn profits during the pandemic have skyrocketed. As men were sheltering in place, consuming more and more extremely violent and dehumanizing pornography, the violence against women and children has been not only more extreme, but more frequent and more widespread. Broken bones, concussions, mutilations -- health officials have noted a tremendous increase in severe domestic abuse.I have not seen ANY healthcare professionals discussing the link between increased porn consumption and the increased violence. In mainstream news, most people understand that Netflix profits and video game profits skyrocketed during the pandemic. But those profit increases were small peanuts in comparison to porn's profits. Pornographers saw a boom in sales that makes Netflix's market share look like a local dime store in comparison. Pornography sexualizes the objectification of women and children. Pornography eroticizes violence against women and children. Pornography is incredibly racist. Pornography is incredibly ableist. Pornography essentializes gender. Pornography depicts all men as animals who abuse women and children. Pornography depicts all women and children as animals who can only have orgasms if they're being sexually degraded and physically abused. Pornography treats *all* people as objects who can be easily disposed of as garbage.Most people I know who use pornography to achieve orgasm think a version of the following: ""Well, I use these videos as masturbation material, so these films must be fine, because I enjoy them, and I get off quickly when I use them. If other people get hurt by this stuff, then that's their problem, not mine."" Many people are conditioned by their parents and friends to use pornography, starting as children. Mainstream culture also encourages us to use pornography frequently, and to openly endorse using pornography with our own children and families. I honestly think crystal meth is healthier for your body than using pornography is. Crystal meth doesn't teach you that women and children are disposable garbage, and that men are animal rapists. But pornography sure does teach that narrative, and it uses close-up shots of people's genitals to eroticize extreme violence, including murder. I was heavily pressured as an underage child to be in pornography. I know very well how terrifying and violent pornography is for the people who star in it, and how the entire industry preys on underage girls and young people of all genders. I have never in my life been attracted to pornography as a masturbation tool, but I know Jensen is right: ""I am sure that no matter how difficult it is to look at what pornography tells us about ourselves, we have to look."" ""Getting Off"" is an excellent read. Highly recommended feminist literature.Big, big thanks to Robert Jensen for all that he does to make the world a better, safer place for all people.

The characters are all upper-middle class or upper-class art lovers and travelers, and while that ought to be fascinating, the character details all center on their mundane lives, sexual dysfunction, body shaming, and other details that you would associate with self-loathing literary fiction set in suburban America.

Feminist music scholar Norma Coates explains why, even if women sound like rock artists, they are ultimately positioned as pop artists:'In this schema, rock is metonymic with ""authenticity"" while ""pop"" is metonymic with artifice. Sliding even further down the metonymic slope, authentic becomes masculine, while artificial becomes feminine. Rock, therefore, is ""masculine,"" pop is ""feminine,"" and the two are set up in a binary relation to each other, with the masculine, of course, on top. The common-sense meaning of rock becomes ""male,"" while ""pop"" is naturalised as ""female."" Real men aren't pop, and women, real or otherwise, don't rock.'Gender still constrains the types of musical roles available to contemporary female artists, further compromising their meanings. The gender constraints imposed upon female pop stars by society, industry handlers, audiences, and even female pop stars themselves will be considered in depth throughout the body of the book.""*****Kristin Lieb's insightful study of the modern music industry's social construction of female pop stars is absolutely delightful! First published in 2013, ""Gender, Branding, and the Modern Music Industry: The Social Construction of Female Popular Music Stars,"" is a fascinating look at how the gender binary (and essentialized gender) are used by modern music executives to position female artists as short-term commodities, ""person brands"" with a limited shelf life. Female artists are constructed and sold to the public in very limited -- and highly gendered -- market categories: good girls, temptresses, whores, divas, hot messes, and a scant few other identities (all of them sexualized), whereas male artists have a much larger range of market positions/brand narratives open to them, and are rarely ever sexualized. For women artists, to be objectified as a sex object, either in a virginal Good Girl state or some form of transgressive Whore, are the two central narratives open to female musicians. Industry executives and artist handlers talk this way freely, and since these are the music industry's own terms for their products (the women they're selling), Lieb's book does not alter their interview language or frameworks at all. She set out to look at the impact of gendered marketing on female artists as well as their fans, and the book is a pretty horrific examination of acculturated misogyny and sexism within the music industry.Lieb's most noteworthy feminist influence is the work of Jean Kilbourne, especially the ""Killing Us Softly"" documentaries. Kilbourne's seminal work examining the sexism and misogyny in advertising helped create the field of media literacy. While the influx of pornography into the modern music industry is definitely addressed in Lieb's book, it is handled lightly. One essay by Gail Dines is cited concerning the ""everyday pornography"" in popular culture, and the effects this has on gender performativity and heteronormative messaging in the music industry.The prose in this book is concise and accessible; Lieb's book is NOT written in academic jargon. It was written in the hope that industry insiders and students -- especially those interested in pursuing careers in marketing and publicity -- might pick it up and consider the damaging impacts of gender in the music industry, and possibly be more creative in their own construction of female artist sales narratives after reading this book.I discovered Lieb's work after listening to her 2015 TEDx talk: ""Pop culture is teaching the wrong 'lessons' about gender & sexuality,"" which I will link here, for those interested --https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUN01...*****The description for Lieb's TEDx talk reads as follows:""Popular culture is a cunning, persuasive - and pervasive - 'educator' that influences students' ideas about gender and sexuality 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Yet Dr. Kristin Lieb believes that while teachers may only have students for a few hours a week, they can interrupt the institutionalized misogyny being spread by popular culture and teach more accurate lessons about girls and women. And the best tool to do this, Dr. Lieb says: Pop Culture itself. Dr. Kristin J. Lieb is an Associate Professor of Marketing Communication at Emerson College. Before arriving at Emerson, Lieb held numerous marketing and business development positions in the music industry, including posts with Atomic Pop and Newbury Comics Interactive. She also worked as a researcher for Harvard Business School and as a freelance writer for Billboard and Rolling Stone. Lieb published her first book, 'Gender, Branding, and The Modern Music Industry: The Social Construction of Female Popular Music Stars,' with Routledge in 2013.""*****It's a *great* TEDx talk, but I must say, her book is even better!Five stars!

Mixing slight bits of memoir with a lifetime of accumulated outrage from consuming sexist pop culture, this book is the literary equivalent of listening to Halsey's 2019 pop music hit, ""Nightmare."" This is a good book, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about pop culture and feminism. I just personally wasn't learning anything from it, and Chocano's analysis wasn't insightful or hard-hitting enough to keep my attention.This book has an audience. But I ain't it. For readers who avoid intersectional feminist tomes, and avoid reading radical feminist works like those penned by bell hooks, Andrea Dworkin, Jackson Katz, Robert Jensen, Gail Dines, Jean Kilbourne, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and so many others, then ""You Play the Girl"" will probably be much more revelatory and compelling. But if you've plunged into radical intersectional feminist literature before, then you might be sorely disappointed by ""You Play the Girl,"" which is focused solely on the trials and tribulations faced by white or white-passing, neurotypical, able-bodied, middle-class and upper-class cisgender women. While I'm not denying that the patriarchy oppresses this demographic, my own intersectional radical feminism has moved well beyond the limited insights Chocano offers up in this book, which is honestly just a super watered-down version of modern feminist theory, packaged around pop culture. This book will appeal to a much broader audience than the works of radical intersectional feminists ever do, and for that reason, I'm grateful to this book. It's bringing a palatable version of feminism to the mass market, and that's always a good thing.But for me personally, I wasn't learning anything new, I definitely wasn't engaged, and even though this book is easy to read, there was just too much lacking for me to find this enjoyable, and I had to DNF before the halfway point.When I read feminist literature, I need the steak and potatoes version. This book is crème brûlée. As a dessert, this is fine. It's just not enough for me at a mealtime.A couple of notes --1. Chocano mentions and quotes the radical feminist firebrand, Shulamith Firestone (1945-2012), early in this book, but pointedly never mentions her in Chapter 5: ""The Eternal Allure of the Basket Case,"" which contains this quote on page 81: ""Marriage or the nuthouse. One or the other. It started to dawn on me that it wasn't that I was attracted to stories about girls who went mad, I was attracted to stories about girls with ambitions who wound up institutionalized. Getting locked up was not the result of adventure, it was the price you paid for adventure, it was your punishement. I had mistaken correlation for causation. Rookie mistake."" How much more poignant it would have been if Chocano had pointed out that Firestone herself was institutionalized, and tragically died in one. The feminists who have helped Chocano resist and speak out against the patriarchy have faced the same punishment as the creative artists she mentions. But I don't think Chocano is actually aware of Firestone's fate, and that's why this link is missing, like so many other missing links that could have been made in these essays, but weren't. Here is a brilliant piece that ran in ""The New Yorker"" about Firestone, for those who are interested --https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/20...^^It's titled, ""Death of a Revolutionary,"" by Susan Faludi, and was published on April 8, 2013. It's an amazing essay. I learned more from that essay than I did in 108 pages of ""You Play the Girl.""2. Chocano doesn't off up any analysis of ""Fatal Attraction"" in Chapter 5, and she certainly never uses the word ""ableism"" (as in: this film is incredibly ableist against the mentally ill), but if you're interested in some truly insightful analysis of this film, here is a link to Jonathan Rosenbaum's excellent , which was written for the Chicago Reader in 1987, right after the movie came out -- it's titled, ""Fear of Feminism [Fatal Attraction]"" --http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2020...^^Rosenbaum makes it more than clear that this movie was a backlash film against feminism, a point many other feminists were quick to state as well, most especially Susan Faludi in her 1991 landmark book, ""Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,"" which argued that the 1980s saw the media profit from a number of misogynist slurs and lies in order to scare women against the strides they’d made during the feminist revolution of the 1970s. I don't recall ""Backlash"" or Susan Faludi mentioned anywhere in ""You Play the Girl."" Her name and her work are not mentioned at all in the ""Works Consulted"" and recommended reading list at the end of the book.3. Chocano takes a tiny stab at discussing the (very patriarchal and capitalist) film, ""Pretty Woman,"" in Chapter 6: ""The Ingenue Chooses Marriage or Death."" If you're interested in reading a more in-depth analysis of the potent combination of assumed-and-undermined feminism/patriarchal spectacle of male capitalist power on display in that film, I would highly recommend you read Mari Ruti's 2016 nonfiction book, ""Feminist Film Theory and Pretty Woman,"" which contains a much more in-depth analysis of that film and its (overall non-feminist) messaging. While Ruti does not condemn the movie (not at all!) and she wrote the book to defend the movie's female fan base from the misogynistic contempt these viewers receive for loving the film, the overall takeaways are damning. Since I only saw ""Pretty Woman"" once as a child, at age eleven or twelve, and absolutely hated the film, I read Ruti's book as an act of catharsis, and it was incredibly useful for me. While Ruti dismisses all claims by the movie's critics that the film has ""an unrealistic portrayal of prostitution,"" stating that only ""male misogynists"" would expect a rom com to be ""realistic"" about prostitution, I was able to read past this f*cking bullshit, and see what insights Ruti could actually offer. I was glad that I did. I forgave Ruti her shitty dismissal of the portrayal of prostitution (which has definitely had incredibly harmful effects on American culture), and really enjoyed her analysis of the film as a whole. Her book is easy to read and a lot of fun. Highly recommended!4. Chapter 1: ""Bunnies"" was like reading a watered-down, far less informative version of Ariel Levy's 2005 nonfiction book, ""Female Chauvinist Pigs: Women and the Rise of Raunch Culture."" I only gave that book 3 stars, but after reading Chocano's first chapter, I felt like Levy's book deserved a full 5 stars, because it was such a stronger piece of nonfiction text than these essays. 5. My favorite part of ""You Play the Girl"" is the Introduction. I loved those few pages. Five full stars to that section. *****I skim-read a few of the later chapters in this book, and they were so banal and dull that I was glad I chose to DNF on page 108. For me, ""You Play the Girl"" is to feminism what reading ""Shrill"" felt like for the fat-acceptance/body-acceptance movement: a good text for beginners, especially if readers relate better when the text does not discuss the intersection of race, class, or ability level at all. When readers are asked to examine their intersecting cultural bias, the text can often be really overwhelming, so paring down oppression to simply examine one type of oppression (in this case: gender oppression) can often allow the reading to feel much more productive and useful.For me personally, I'll take bell hooks and Andrea Dworkin any day over this. Give me all the radical intersectional feminist texts. They are my steak and potatoes, and I feast. Three stars. ""You Play the Girl"" is a good book for an initial understanding of looking at pop culture through a feminist lens. The text is easy to read and accessible, and focused especially on the middle and upper-middle class....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 06, 2020","Aug 07, 2020","Jul 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28114600-you-play-the-girl

Just so I look like less of a shithead for not enjoying this book. The 2017 adult fantasy, ""The City of Brass,"" by S.A. Chakraborty, is incredibly popular. I read this book because I often saw it mislabeled on Goodreads as Young Adult, and that told me one thing: the book probably prioritized the romantic plotline over everything else, and I was curious about how that was handled in an adult fantasy.And honestly, I really enjoy love stories in books. So an adult fantasy that prioritized romance sounded good to me. The first half of this novel *definitely* reads like verbose adult fantasy with a YA fantasy plot. There are two point of view/POV characters: a 20-year-old (highly magical) human woman named Nahri, and an 18-year-old djinn prince named Ali. Nahri lives in a fantasy version of 18th century Cairo, which she leaves in Chapter One and never returns to again. (At least not in this book; she might in the sequel.) Ali lives in the eponymous City of Brass: the magical djinn city of Daevabad.Daevabad reads as an allegory for modern America, police violence, and Black Lives Matter. The djinn king and his endless legions of bloodthirsty djinn henchmen torture and kill the ""mixed blood"" djinn-human residents with abandon. The allegorical Black people in this book are called the shafit. But since neither Ali nor Nahri ever state any moral condemnation against the entire city for this nonstop cruelty, murder, and oppression, the book just presents this behavior as ""background violence"" for the main story with Nahri. All of the scenes with the shafit left a really bad taste in my mouth. Daevabad is a vile, disgusting city. I longed to see it burn to the ground. All of the alternating POV chapters are written in close third, and feature huge blocks of expository text that really dragged down the book's pacing. I sympathize with all of the readers who found this novel confusing. I wasn't confused, but I sure was extremely bored.Expository text works well when the close third POV is used as a filter, illuminating the character's psychology and opinions as well as giving the reader worldbuilding material. But the exposition in ""City of Brass"" always read very flat, through an extremely dull omniscient narrative voice. The expository text read as author-tell, rather than character-tell, and it was godawful. At 526 pages, this is one massively long book, and a certain amount of skim-reading became essential.There are lots of silly, ridiculous things that occur in this novel. Nahri and her djinn love interest, Dara, begin the book on a magical carpet ride. Early in the trip, they are in need of a new carpet. But instead of stealing another carpet, they steal horses, and travel the rest of their journey on horseback and on foot. There was no reason for this to happen other than the author wanted to prolong their time together for the purpose of writing their love story. When characters behave this ignorantly, it is hard to take them seriously. It is hard to take anything seriously when books feature content like this.At another point in the story, Nahri sees snow for the first time, and while Dara is elsewhere for a minute, she goes for a short walk. When she returns to their camp, Dara asks Nahri, ""Where were you? I was worried something ate you"" (pg 162). Dara could have simply followed her footprints and found her in the woods, if he was that worried about her. The whole book is chock-full of moments like this, where I just couldn't take the characters, the world, or the story seriously, because everything was either thoughtless, silly, utterly boring, or a long scene of gratuitous violence that existed solely for spectacle. In addition to the gratuitous violence against the shafit, Chapter One begins with a neurodiverse girl being killed by Dara in scene. All of the girl's descriptors read as if she were autistic. She's around the age of twelve. She is the *only* character with a mental disability to appear in the book. Nahri tells the reader that the girl's mind is ""broken"" (pg 16). Her name is Baseema, and her death falls under the category of ableist violence; if the author had made sure to include other neurodiverse characters in the book, I would not call Chapter One ableist. But it is. The ""lesser"" shafit are slaughtered with abandon in this book, and so was Baseema. The last few chapters in this book feature a lot of high action in which lots of stuff happens because the author said it could. It really felt like watching a writer hurl buckets of paint at a wall and wondering which colors would stick, since the rules of this story-world are inconstant, and consist of ""whatever the author felt like writing at the time."" It's fatiguing, to say the least. The real heart and soul of this book centers on Nahri and the question of who she will one day marry and have children with. The book does an excellent job of setting up this narrative arc right in Chapter One, and then hammering it into the characters' dialogue for the rest of the book. I can absolutely understand why stories like this speak so strongly to readers: for so many people, the question of who we marry and have children with is the defining choice that shapes our whole lives. But when a book is loaded with so much gratuitous violence, injustice, and racist murder, and neither POV character ever calls for a revolution on behalf of the shafit, I just find myself not caring one bit about whose sperm will one day impregnate Nahri's womb. I was simply not invested enough in her character to place the question of who will father her children over all of the terrible violence occurring in Daevabad every day. While I can understand how foregrounding the question of Nahri's future motherhood with a background of nonstop gratuitous violence could be very satisfying to read, it's just *really* not compelling to me. As to the djinn history in this book, especially the different tribes of djinn, how they are different from demons, and how the djinn were punished with long-lived, mortal bodies that can sometimes be immortal -- all of this material felt either inadequately described, laughable, inconsistent, useless, or untrustworthy, since the author can and did break her worldbuilding setups more than once. Whatever the plot needed, the plot received. Especially in the final chapters, the deus ex machina reigned supreme. As to the main plot of this book: I'm assuming that Nahri and Dara are endgame. I'm assuming Dara will father her children one day. I will not be reading the sequels for the Nahri/Dara OTP denouement. One book of this drama was more than enough.One star. Should have DNF'd. Two stars because I knew by the first Ali chapter that this book was really, really not for me. But I wanted to know what was in this book, what readers fell in love with here, and I feel shitty for not enjoying it. I can understand why this story speaks to people. It was just nails on a chalkboard for me....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 12, 2020","Jul 30, 2020","Jul 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32718027-the-city-of-brass

The 2020 Young Adult/YA contemporary novel, ""Felix Ever After,"" by Kacen Callender, is a tender, heartfelt journey of identity, friendship, and love. It's a spectacular story starring an incredibly memorable main character. I devoured this book, and would highly recommend it to anyone.The main character/POV protagonist is a Black, queer, teenage transgender boy named Felix. He attends a private art school in New York City, and his classmates are an extremely diverse cast of LGBTQIA+ representation.""Felix Ever After"" is both a character- and issues-driven novel. One of the book's primary functions is to educate readers about concepts and terms in the LGBTQIA+ community. Since this is a YA novel, the book does an exceedingly good job of doing that.I had previously read Callender's 2018 middle grade novel, ""Hurricane Child,"" and did not enjoy it at all. The POV protagonists of both books (""Hurricane Child"" and ""Felix Ever After"") have absent mothers, mothers who have completely abandoned their children, leaving the home when the protagonist is between seven and ten. The trauma of parental abandonment is a strong theme in both stories.But I thought Callender's execution of that theme was so much better in ""Felix Ever After."" Story details, context, and the emotional resonance of trauma were present and effective in this book. The writing style was so much more accessible, too. Rather than the adult literary prose of ""Hurricane Child,"" Callender writes in contemporary Young Adult prose in this book, and the story is so much more compelling because of that choice. I also thought Callender's handling of class was much better in this book than in ""Hurricane Child."" That said, there were still a few classist problems. In ""Felix Ever After,"" there is a lot of attention given to Felix's household finances. Felix states that his father ""works most weeknights as a doorman for a luxury condominium in Lower Manhattan, and some days he'll try to take up extra jobs, like making deliveries and walking dogs. I'm on a talent-based scholarship, and even then, all his money goes into me and St. Catherine's -- just so that I can pursue my passion for art."" (pg 15)On his full-time income as a doorman, Felix's father is not only able to make sure his son attends a private art school, but he also rents an apartment, has paid for Felix's hormone replacement therapy and top surgery, makes sure Felix has a smart phone and spending money, they eat well at home and can even order takeout, they have a pet cat, and Felix is able to dress as he likes and come and go as he likes.Felix and his father are *solidly* middle-class in this book, and yet Felix states, without irony, that he and his father are ""poor as fuck"" (pg 27).The book presents Felix as ""poor"" because everyone he attends school with is incredibly wealthy, living in enormous apartments, or in mansions outside of the city. But the fact is, every day in the city, Felix is passing by homeless people and people who live in their vehicles. ""Nomad living"" in cars and vans is on the rise in New York City, as more and more people cannot afford rent, and live full-time in their vehicles in order to survive.""Felix Ever After"" erases the poor and the impoverished in New York City completely. They are unseen and unremarked upon in every way in this story.Felix is a middle-class student who attends an upper-class school, and while he seems ""poor"" in comparison to his affluent classmates, this does not, in fact, make Felix ""poor."" It is incredibly insulting and damaging that Felix calls himself ""poor"" in this book. This is a cruel example of classism embedded in the text.For a book that draws explicit attention to the fact that ""the marginalized"" have a moral obligation to consider those who are ""more marginalized"" than they are (pg 322), Felix's complete erasure of the poor and the impoverished, the way he ignores the fact of their presence in the city completely, while at the same time calling himself ""poor as fuck,"" is one glaring way in which Felix himself has unchecked privilege in this book, privilege he uses to do what he himself hates having done to him in this story: being erased, being treated as sub-human, being ignored.If authors are depicting middle-class characters in their books, they need to *call* those characters middle-class. Mislabeling the middle-class as ""the poor"" is cruel and wrong. It's classist. Every character in this book also has able-bodied privilege, but, like in most media, there are no disabled characters anywhere in the story to make that distinction. Whereas with economic privilege, the text gives a lot of specific material to establish Felix as middle-class, but purposefully mislabels him and his father as ""poor.""The entire story read as incredibly affluent to me. Felix enjoyed a level of economic privilege that made him seem as wealthy to me as he viewed his upper-class classmates. I don't know Callender's economic background at all, but I would guess they probably grew up in the upper-middle class or high middle class before attending Sarah Lawrence College. A middle-class upbringing combined with the upward-oriented class level of Sarah Lawrence would explain the mishandling of class privilege in the text of ""Felix Ever After"" as well as in ""Hurricane Child.""That criticism aside, the own voices representation of transgender identity is truly *outstanding* in this novel. The book's merits far outweigh any unease I have about the story's economic details. The story explicitly calls out transphobic behavior, informing and educating the reader through the in-scene action throughout the plot. It's all very well done.And my favorite scenes in the book were when Felix visits the LGBT Center and joins in public discussions about identity questions he has. All of that material was handled so well, and it's so vitally important, both to the story and to a Young Adult readership. I hope every high school library and public library buys a copy of this book, because all teens would benefit from reading this wonderful book.The story's tension and plotting were all finished by the end of Chapter 24 (pg 338), so the final fifteen pages (Chapter 25: pages 339-354) really dragged for me. If I hadn't been adamant about wanting to give this book a 5-star , I would have skipped the last chapter. I did love Felix's speech, though (pg 350-351), so that felt like a nice reward for pushing myself to read the final fifteen pages.Overall, this is just such a wonderful book. The prose is excellent, the emotional stakes are strong and engaging, the plot is vibrant, and the characters drive the whole story. The educational material in this book was woven into the story, either appearing in interior monologue when Felix is questioning his identity, or in direct dialogue when the characters are discussing LGBTQIA+ issues, especially when they're in conflict with one another.The teen characters often sound more like college students in this book. They certainly behave more like college students than high schoolers, but that's a hallmark of mainstream media anymore, and cannot count as any legitimate criticism to me. I just wanted to note that the teens speak and act like they're 21 or 22 in this story, rather than 17 or 18.If you enjoyed ""Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe,"" I would certainly recommend ""Felix Ever After."" While I think Ari and Dante's story was much more romantic than Felix's, the love story really takes center stage in this book. The plot beats are similar, and it definitely made me smile.""Felix Ever After"" is such an enjoyable, important book. Highly recommended.Five stars.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 07, 2020","Jul 10, 2020","Jul 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51931067-felix-ever-after

And since my local library is not currently purchasing new titles, my friend April kindly bought me a copy, and I immediately started reading.I knew by the end of Chapter One (page 14 of 301 pages total) that this book wasn't working for me. I was so utterly bored that I would have DNF'd right then, but since this book was a gift, I was determined to finish it. I hoped that it would get better.Alas. Not even the book's high-action ending could boost my star rating any higher than two.I knew in Chapter One that I did not connect with or care about the main character, Noemí, a wealthy young Mexican socialite, or her distant, married cousin, Catalina, who is introduced in Chapter One in a letter that kicks off ""the plot"" of the book.I put ""the plot"" in quotes because it never felt like a plot to me, only story action. Characters do things in this book, and then more things happen. Story action, however, is not a plot. I wasn't invested in any of the characters, and there were no stakes in this book. The author makes attempts at introducing stakes: Noemí must visit and possibly help Catalina so that her father will allow Noemí to attend university and pay for her anthropology degree. This was so jarring to me: Noemí is only driven to act by having money dangled in front of her, but later in the book, the reader is supposed to be convinced that Noemí ""truly loves"" Catalina. What the f*ck ever. If Noemí truly loved Catalina, she wouldn't need her father to force her to go and visit her and help her after they receive that strange letter, and then promise he'll pay for Noemí's college when she initially balks.Instead of being convinced of anything resembling emotional or personal stakes, Noemí heads to a Haunted House because reasons, and stays there because reasons, and the reader is just meant to nod along with it all because reasons. The book also pushes a big ""sisterhood"" message at the end that was completely at odds with the first two-thirds of the book. The sudden fierce devotion and love Noemí expresses for Catalina didn't make sense, and it certainly didn't feel earned. I love sisterhood messages in books; this one just came out of nowhere and felt more like a politically correct ending slapped onto an incredibly boring story.Near the end, the story introduces life stakes: will the characters live or die? For that reason, because the book finally introduced some actual stakes, the last 20-40 pages of the book read quickly, and were so much more interesting than all the pages that came before.But oh lord, was this book dull. I was only able to finish it because the chapters are short; I could power through a few pages at a time and immediately put it down, rewarding myself with a break before I picked it back up again.It breaks my heart to admit that this entire book falls into severely ableist and ageist discourse/storytelling messaging. I know that Moreno-Garcia is a highly intelligent author, and she made the main Evildoer in this book a eugenicist so that she could work against racist discourse in the text. But Moreno-Garcia's awareness of racist and misogynist eugenics doesn't save the book from its overt and horrifying ableism and ageism. In this story, the Evildoers all possess disabled, diseased, and aged bodies. All of the worst story tropes that depict the old and infirm as morally depraved, morally corrupt, and worthy of death are utilized in this book. If you are aware that entire fields of eugenics exist to justify murdering the disabled and the elderly, this novel is going to be repugnant.I often avoid horror novels because they are typically so misogynistic and racist that they make me nauseous and angry. Moreno-Garcia does not write narrative misogyny or racist discourse/storytelling messaging into this book. But the narrative ableism and ageism on display in this book is enraging and disheartening.People with skin diseases, fungal infections, elderly bodies, and/or disabled legs: I want to warn you that no one with an elderly or infirm body is portrayed in a positive or humanizing light *anywhere* in this story. Anyone who has a sick, disabled, or elderly body in this book is corrupt, evil, and worthy of death. I know this is a trope that horror novels frequently utilize because so many able-bodied and healthy readers enjoy the demonization of the old and infirm, and a lot of people genuinely love watching the elderly and the infirm be graphically killed in movies and books. But it honestly sickens me and makes me so angry. Authors write to discourse when the sole people they portray from a marginalized group are shown to be evil, morally corrupt, and disposable. ""Mexican Gothic"" is a prime example of What Not To Do in a book. If Moreno-Garcia had simply presented elderly and disabled characters in the story who were not vile pieces of sh*t, then this book wouldn't be so ableist and ageist.Alas. This book is problematic as f*ck.On another note, I would like to say I am a true lover of fungi, and it definitely saddens me that so many people hate and fear fungi so much. In another life, I was definitely a mycologist, and I had hoped that this book wouldn't entirely demonize fungi. I love fungi, and I know there are plenty of fungi that love me. Human beings could not survive without certain species of fungi that live in symbiosis with us, especially in colonies that live in our guts. I had hoped that ""Mexican Gothic"" would make sure to point out the life-giving forces of fungi as well as predictably using fungi as a Big Bad.Alas. Yet again, I was severely disappointed. If you are someone who hates and fears fungi (or even just hates eating mushrooms, and doesn't really know anything about how mushrooms are created), then this book is here for you. You'll thoroughly hate and fear mushrooms (fungal fruiting bodies) even more than you already do. Fungi of the world: I'm sorry. I'll return to the sisterhood message at the end of the book: I'll fully admit, this worked so well for me that instead of giving the book a one-star , since I was so utterly bored up until the very end, I could have given the book 4 stars, just for the ways in which the author depicts Noemí and Catalina coming together by the end. Those final scenes were definitely anti-patriarchal and stridently feminist, and I firmly approved of the narrative choices that came out in the end.But it was not only too little, too late, but it didn't realistically follow from the entire first half of the book. It was like I was reading a completely different book by the end, one in which Noemí had real feelings for Catalina and truly cared about her. All of that emotion was entirely absent from the first two-thirds of the novel. (And honestly, only really exists in the last 20-40 pages.)Moreno-Garcia also challenges masculinity in this book, especially predominant ideas about masculinity, attractiveness, and desire. One male character, Virgil, frequently expresses dominance, hostility, and aggression. He is a very sexually potent character. Another male character, Francis, expresses meekness, cowardice, and submissiveness. In a traditional gothic romance, the reader knows exactly which one of these two men will be the love interest. ""Mexican Gothic"" subverts that expectation entirely. It was an interesting choice, though I can't say it was a very satisfying one for me, emotionally. This novel also uses the trope of ""I could have told you about the whole thing on day one, but I didn't, because reasons"" logic that I never find very compelling. That narrative choice ended up making the love interest in this book seem just as racist as the other eugenics-loving assholes in the book, for the very reason that he could have spoken freely with the two women of color in order to help them, but chose not to. While the character does state why he withheld crucial information, the reason given for withholding it doesn't clear him of racism, only implicates him further. It is only the fuller context of this character's actions and ending that excuses him from that charge, but by no means expunges him.I loved ""Gods of Jade and Shadow"" so much that I wanted to give ""Mexican Gothic"" three stars and be able to say, ""problems aside, this is still a good book."" But I just don't feel that way. If I hadn't been having a personal reckoning with Gender Schema in fiction, and found myself interested in how much Moreno-Garcia worked against Gender Schema in this book with Virgil and Francis, I would give ""Mexican Gothic"" one star instead of two.Two is the highest I can rate it. If you are sensitive to ableist or ageist discourse, I would advise you not pick this one up. I personally didn't find anything in this book scary or frightening, but then again, I don't think I've been genuinely afraid of a story since I was a little kid reading Stephen King books. But for readers who fear and/or hate fungi, the elderly, and/or the disabled, your mileage may vary.One star overall. Two stars because I love Silvia Moreno-Garcia, and I think ""Gods of Jade and Shadow"" is a masterpiece. I want to keep reading her work. But ""Mexican Gothic"" was so off-putting, I'll have to really push myself to give her another try....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 13, 2020","Aug 03, 2020","Jul 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53152636-mexican-gothic

Since this family friend was herself an obese woman, I was searching for ways to assist her in overcoming her intense bias. Unfortunately, I didn't find this book to be very helpful to me. The author mostly assumes that all of her readers already inhabit an anti-fat mindset, and her text exists to set the record straight that this is a systemic, systematic problem that needs to be corrected. There is a lot of anger in this book, as well as a lot of unspoken assumptions. As a reader, I can completely understand that anger, and those assumptions. It's deserved, for sure. There is certainly a target audience for this book. I would say this is an especially good read for anyone who is looking to understand their own victimization in an anti-fat society, and has not encountered other voices that speak to this matter. It's very much assumed, at various places in the text, that all straight-sized individuals harbor anti-fat bigotry, and that all of these people will act on it, if given the right opportunity. While I personally don't find that to be true, I understand that it can sure feel that way.Personally, this book was a one-star, utterly forgettable read to me. It's only been a couple of months since I read it, but almost nothing has stayed with me from this book. Sadly, I didn't find the memoir material to be that insightful, and the book definitely didn't deliver what I had hoped it would: a lens to better understand why my family friend was so vicious about fatness, and a way to help her through her own bias. At best, this book assumed that as a fat woman, my friend would be rallying for justice for plus-sized bodies, not be at the forefront of condemning fat bodies. At worst, the book makes some stark assumptions that are intensely off-putting and erroneous. The book is here to argue that fat is not the enemy. And that argument, sadly, was something I already supported before I picked up this book. There are certainly readers who will benefit from what this book has to offer. I just wasn't one of them.Three stars.

There is some very dark content in this book, including incest, homophobia, murder, and the brutal treatment of women in Ireland, all of whom suffer greatly under the Irish Roman Catholic patriarchy.The story features an incredibly diverse cast, with excellent LGBTQIA+ visibility and PoC visibility within the main characters in the modern thru-story timeline.Much of the book is set in the past, however. The novel as a whole is an examination of the generational trauma of two Irish families whose descendants have intersecting lives in the present day.I found the first 70 pages of this book really compelling. Despite some initial plot-hole worries and intermittent doses of melodrama, I thought the story was unique and gripping, and Fowley-Doyle has a nice prose style that made the text easy and enjoyable to read.But then the story leaves the main characters in the present-day timeline behind, and delves into longer and longer sections of backstory of narrative history that completely drained all of my enjoyment out of the story. The book became a long, intense diatribe against the Irish Roman Catholic Church by listing crime after crime after crime against women. Not only that, but the spiritual world of female banshees in this story is depicted as just as ruthless, cruel, and inept as the patriarchal Catholic society of historical Ireland. Everyone hates women and queer people in this story: churchgoers and spiritual folklore beings alike.Of the 274 pages I read, I don't think the word ""patriarchy"" was mentioned once. The dominant message is simply that Ireland really f*cking sucks if you are a woman or a queer person. Somewhere around page 170, it is finally revealed that the present-day protagonist, the character who should be experiencing a character arc, is actually a completely unreliable narrator. The reader discovers that she has not only been withholding information from her good friends and family members, but completely withholding vast amounts of information from the reader as well. Not only that, but the entire plot of the book has been running on everything that the main character has been deliberately withholding from the reader. The revelation really devastated my ability to keep enjoying the book. Rather than deepening my interest in the main character's life, the entire novel felt cheapened. I didn't think so much deliberate coyness served this story at all. And when the book kept plunging into backstory and history lessons, focusing on so many different side characters and their terrible suffering, I just ended up going numb and not caring at all. For those who aren't familiar with the Catholic Church atrocities depicted in this novel, this book can serve as an important history lesson. The Author's Note at the very end of the book is especially moving, and was my favorite part of the book.I would also like to point out that the misogynistic and homophobic violence and murder depicted in this book happened in the U.S., too. The story talks about the babies of unwed mothers being adopted by people in ""America,"" and doesn't ever touch on the fact that America was not immune to the same patriarchal horrors as the ones in this story. Yes, the U.S. separates Church and State, but there was still plenty of institutionalized misogyny and homophobia in the U.S. in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, too. ""All the Bad Apples"" is an important book with important historical content and vital visibility for marginalized groups. The story's plot structure and narrative execution just really didn't work for me, and the novel as a whole became so unenjoyable that I DNF'd after 90%.For those readers who love YA magical realism, stories that prioritize women's pain and women's suffering, and are desperately looking for more LGBTQIA+ representation in the stories they read, then I would highly recommend ""All the Bad Apples."" The prose is evocative and urgent, there is a strong history lesson that unfolds in the book, and the novel is a rallying cry to speak the truth and banish shame. I can definitely get behind that. 3 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 05, 2020","Jun 28, 2020","Jun 05, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44139388-all-the-bad-apples

But for all of the years of therapy and self-reflection Brodeur has done, this memoir reads like an act of personal catharsis that severely lacks insight into the larger forces that made Brodeur's childhood and adolescence so deeply fucked up. Brodeur never calls her mother a ""narcissist"" in this memoir. But if you have ever studied Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), you will immediately recognize that Adrienne's mother, Malabar, is a Narcissist: someone with the full-blown disorder. (And not simply someone who has ""narcissistic traits,"" which is much less abusive than the mental illness.) This isn't lower-case ""narcissism,"" but the mental disorder Narcissism on display in this book.There are many reasons why people don't like to get real about Narcissism/NPD. I can understand why Brodeur shies away from calling her mother a narcissist, either from her own ignorance or from the conscious choice not to do so. But not getting real about mental illness is part of the much larger, and incredibly damaging, amount of ableism on display in this book. It is an ableism that, so far as this book is concerned, the author herself remains completely unaware of. Malabar was convinced that her second husband, Charles, was no longer worthy of being her husband after he suffered a stroke. Once Charles was disabled, he became garbage to her; human waste. And Adrienne, as a child, was taught her mother's views, and adopted them wholeheartedly.The word ""ableism"" never appears in this book. I don't think the author has any awareness of ableism. Especially because she presents an abhorrent scene in this book in which Malabar, right after Charles has a stroke, brings Charles his favorite cookies to the hospital, and then tells him he can only eat them if he uses his disabled right hand. Seeing Charles fumble clumsily for those cookies, until he is exhausted, defeated, with his right arm lying limp on his body, and a fallen cookie just happens to roll slightly down his chest and land on his palm, which he then lifts to his mouth, is celebrated as a moment of ""triumph.""Brodeur does not see the absolute cruelty of this behavior in any way. Instead, she uses the memory of this hospital visit as ""proof"" that her mother had ""truly loved"" Charles: because Malabar did this for him: forced him to eat a cookie with his disabled right hand. Two weeks after his stroke, after he'd lost a lot of weight while recovering in the hospital. This scene caused me immense pain to read. I certainly didn't see anything about that hospital visit as ""loving."" It was ableist and abusive. Just one more instance of Malabar's cruelty. Malabar's illicit lover, Ben Souther, is married to a woman who is also ill and struggling with her own disabilities. Malabar also sees this woman as unworthy garbage (because Malabar, as a Narcissist, sees *everyone* as unworthy garbage); but it is the deployment of ableism (the discrimination against the disabled and ill) that convinces Adrienne Brodeur that Lily is unworthy as a wife.None of which is reflected upon in this book. Brodeur does not reflect upon ableism as a whole, or her ableism against Charles and Lily, just like she avoids any discussion of Narcissism/NPD.Whether Brodeur consciously chose to do this or not, the fact remains: this memoir lacks insight and depth as a result of this choice. Brodeur writes effectively about what it means to grow up with Malabar as her mother, and her struggles to find herself in adulthood. This memoir is intensely personal, detailing a personal experience of profound economic privilege coupled with parental abuse. It is a memoir entirely disconnected from the larger forces of power that shaped Brodeur's experiences; Brodeur writes not to find solidarity, but to heal her own self. And you know, I fully support writing as an act of self-healing. I'm glad Brodeur is working hard to heal her own trauma and be a better mother to her children, rather than replicating the abuse she experienced. But this memoir didn't teach me anything, didn't widen my perspective in any way, and I certainly don't feel enriched as a person from reading this book.""Wild Game"" is a book that makes me reflect, once again, on how much economic privilege cushions a person in ignorance. Brodeur doesn't have to study ableism, mental illness, or the hard truths of Narcissism, because her financial situation allows her to avoid those topics entirely. I bought this book at Barnes & Noble, and paid full price for a hardback copy. I forced myself to read every word of this book, as a result of having spent so much money on it. For me personally, this book is a one-star, DNF read.But I can also see the value in Brodeur sharing her story for other able-bodied, upper-middle class, and upper-class white people to read. Brodeur is an example of a ""bully-victim"": a person victimized by abuse who then perpetuates that abuse upon others. Brodeur doesn't use that language (calling her behavior bullying, or abuse), but she does talk a lot about her guilt: feeling guilty about lying to people she loves, and participating in familial betrayals. It's good for people to see that upper-class white people are fucked up, I guess. Though I think that message doesn't come as a surprise to anyone. Three stars. Disappointing.

It's a pretty dark novel, with a cast of fairly bleak characters and a bleak ending. The book jacket does a good job describing the setting and identifying the intended audience for this story --""Set in 1950s Louisiana, Mandy Mikulencak's beautifully written and emotionally moving novel evokes both 'The Help' and 'Dead Man Walking' with the story of an unforgettable woman whose quest to provide meals for death row prisoners leads her into the secrets of her own past.""I've read Helen Prejean's memoir, ""Dead Man Walking,"" and I don't think that book works as a good comparison title for ""The Last Suppers."" While this novel is dark, and features men being executed in scene, the prose doesn't go into any kind of depth about the prison system, police policies, racist or classist court procedure, or the ramifications of systemic injustice to the extent that ""Dead Man Walking"" does. The KKK also features prominently in this novel, but there is no historical or background data given about the organization; the KKK exists just as spectacle in this book, and is only depicted in flashbacks. I did see the film adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel, ""The Help,"" and a work colleague gave me the book to read when the novel debuted, gushing over it and telling me I had to read it. I DNF'd that novel less than 40 pages in, but based on what I read of it, I definitely think ""The Last Suppers"" is very similar to ""The Help.""The narration styles are similar: both books head-hop among various point-of-view/POV characters, with a primary focus on a young white woman grappling with her own coming of age and dealing with white guilt in the South. Both books feature black women who nurture and support the white protagonist. ""The Last Suppers"" is a brave book. Mikulencak made a number of bold choices in structuring the plot. The main character, 29-year-old Ginny, is dating a 50-year-old man named Roscoe, who was a close friend of her father's. Both men were prison guards. Ginny's father was murdered when she was eight, and her widowed mother forced Ginny to watch an innocent black man be executed for the crime. The event was so traumatizing that Ginny suffers horrible nightmares all her life.As an adult in her twenties, Ginny works in the prison kitchen with a sense of atonement, and she begins cooking ""the last suppers"" for the men on death row. When the story begins, Roscoe has already been promoted from being a prison guard to the position of warden, and Ginny frequently sleeps over at his company house. They are having an open affair, even though this is 1950s Louisiana, which was an extremely gender-repressive society, and the birth control pill didn't come out until 1960. Unprotected sex as a single woman was risky, risky business for a young woman like Ginny, and being labeled a loose woman or a whore in those days had severe consequences. Suffice it to say, I didn't find Ginny's open love affair at all believable; I definitely thought she would have been labeled a whore and shunned by polite society, but this book has a modern-2000s gender dynamic throughout, similar to other historical fiction I've read.In the dynamic plot reveals in the story, Ginny discovers that Roscoe was actually the man who murdered her father when she was eight. Her father and Roscoe were both in the KKK in the 1930s, and Ginny's father was on a murdering rampage; Roscoe shot him in the back to stop him from killing. Ginny discovers that her father and Roscoe actively murdered their black neighbors and gang-raped their black wives. It's a shocking reveal in the book, and I was sufficiently horrified by the brutality and violence.I wish I could say that I found myself rooting for any of these characters, but I found the white characters (who are the only characters with story-arcs: Ginny, Roscoe, and Ginny's mother) all highly unlikeable. Ginny is incredibly foul toward her mother, often name-calling and swearing at her, while at the same time frequently needing her mother's help. Although Ginny is the head cook at a large prison kitchen, she often descends into tears or blacks out when life gets difficult. I didn't understand how she kept her job. I thought she would have been fired (many times) for incompetence, especially after she becomes basically unconscious (being cared for at home by Roscoe and a black woman named Dot) for an entire month of the main thru-story. This happens after a man on death row attempts suicide in front of Ginny, which gives her a complete nervous breakdown. The fact that she just keeps her job after this was another glaring example of how the book was not only inaccurate about the gender dynamics of the 1950s, but entirely inaccurate about the realities of being working-class in a non-union job.The story also treats the KKK as if it ""died out"" or ""ended"" in the 1930s, and that is not accurate. The KKK's third and current form emerged after 1950, and while I am not an expert on Louisiana history, I'm certain that there were active KKK groups murdering black people in Louisiana in the 1950s. To see this novel position Ginny as being far removed from ""the time of the KKK killing people in the 1930s"" completely clashed with my sense of reality. In ""The Help,"" a young white journalist helps a group of black maids anonymously publish their stories. In ""The Last Suppers,"" a young white cook helps death row inmates enjoy a last meal before being executed, while at night, she is having sex with the warden and wondering if he loves her or not. Shortly after Roscoe finally confesses his love for Ginny, she discovers the truth about his past: that Roscoe was once in the KKK along with her father; and that on the night her father died, it was Roscoe who murdered her father by shooting him in the back. Ginny learns he did this in order to stop Ginny's father from killing an innocent black woman along with her black husband, an event in which there were not only multiple witnesses (a gathered KKK group), but the black woman was immediately gang-raped by the KKK while Ginny's dad lay dead on the ground. Somehow, Roscoe not only kept his job at the prison, but eventually became the warden.I just... I just don't know what to make of all that. Louisiana's prison system in the 1950s was racist as f*ck, and to be on any side of the (white supremacist) law and kill one of your own is not taken lightly, not now and certainly not then. I don't find it at all realistic that Roscoe would have kept his job, much less ever gained the position of warden. I also don't find it realistic that Ginny would grow up never knowing that her father was in the KKK. Especially given the fact that her mother was incredibly loyal to her father, and took Ginny to see an innocent black man be executed for his murder. I think ""The Last Suppers"" is definitely written for an audience that enjoyed ""The Help,"" which also took liberties with historical fact in order to focus on a white woman's journey to learn about and forgive the heinous acts of the white men and women around her.After Ginny learns the truth about Roscoe, Ginny's mother does, too, and Ginny's mother soon shoots Roscoe and kills him. Ginny's mother gets away with the murder; the reader is meant to understand that Ginny's mother didn't really mean to kill him, and because she regrets her actions, it's fine. After Roscoe dies, Ginny leaves the prison and works as a cook at an all-black school. The ending is meant to be peaceful and hopeful, with Ginny looking forward to the Civil Rights victory ahead, but I honestly just felt sad. I knew all too well that Ginny had just taken one of the few paying jobs for black cooks in the South; it was just another unremarked-upon fact of white privilege in this book. While there were a number of brave choices in this book -- most especially in making the main character the daughter of a KKK member who was a cold-blooded murderer -- the historical inaccuracies and focus on action over emotional interior definitely made this book a struggle for me to read.For me, what made this book really shine were all the details about southern cooking; those were excellent. I loved the recipes and all of the cooking scenes in this novel. I would highly recommend ""The Last Suppers"" to anyone who loves to cook, so long as you are ready for a lot of violence and dark prison scenes in your fiction.I've shelved this book under ""prison life"" and ""racism,"" but ""The Last Suppers"" in no way reads as nonfiction. The focus of this story is on Ginny, her love affair with Roscoe, her sense of atonement toward the men on death row, and what happens to her life after she discovers that her father and her lover were once ruthless KKK members who killed innocent black people.

At all.Originally published in 2017, Rachel Sherman's nonfiction book, ""Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence,"" was not a book I enjoyed reading. At all.This is a book about how the upper-middle class and upper class perpetuate systemic inequality. They do this through voting choices, lifestyle decisions, education and neighborhood segregation, as well as perpetuating certain classist myths, especially the myth of meritocracy and the idea that those born into poverty ""deserve"" their fate. ""Uneasy Street"" is a book that could honestly come with a trigger warning for anyone who grew up in the income bracket beneath the middle class. If you grew up in poverty, this is going to be a hard book to read. I know it certainly was for me.Sherman grew up in the upper-middle class, and it *is* rewarding to see, by the end, how much she recognizes her own internalized classism illuminated in her interview subjects, and how difficult it was for her to see her own beliefs in the oppressive, upper-class values being shared. Sherman's analysis on this point is very subtle, but to a careful reader, the truth is certainly there.I finished this book a few months ago, and I honestly can't remember how often the word ""classism"" even appears on the page. It might not even be part of this book. Similar to examining racism or ableism, naming oppressive systems, even in a nonfiction text such as this one, is often taboo. Since most books are purchased by people who might ""see themselves"" in the affluent subjects Sherman interviews, she takes great care not to condemn anything that appears in this book. Sherman expresses great sympathy and consideration for everyone she interviews. If you are afraid that this book might openly discuss classism, please, have no fear. This is a gentle, considerate examination of the daily struggles of upper-class U.S. citizens. I learned a lot from this book, but not always from what was *on* the page. I learned an incredible amount from what went *unspoken* in this book. ""Uneasy Street"" was a dark, brutal read for me. Rather than ""seeing myself"" on the page, reading this book was like listening to antebellum slave owners sitting on a veranda, sipping lemonade, and casually chatting about how hard they work to deserve what they have, and all the struggles they face as slave owners, and how there is always one massively-rich plantation owner in town who makes it clear to them that they are not really ""rich"" at all, just middle-class slave owners struggling to get by.While reading this book, I listened to a few upper-middle class and upper-class podcast hosts interview Sherman about ""Uneasy Street"" on their show, and the hosts I listened to all expressed deep sympathy for the people Sherman interviewed. The hosts I listened to often expressed the following: ""Oh, these poor affluent people, suffering anxiety over their wealth. They should spend more time in therapy so they stop feeling any need to justify their privilege when they are asked direct questions about their wealth. They should just be able to say, 'Yes, I worked hard for all this, and I deserve it,' and not feel the least bit squeamish about income inequality at all.""If you find yourself agreeing with those statements, then you are definitely the target audience for this book.If the word ""classism"" is a filthy word in your household, the kind of word that should *never* be uttered, you are definitely the target audience for this book. I am glad that I read this book. It is dry, repetitive, and I wish it had come with a trigger warning, stating it was ""by the middle class, for the middle class."" But even so, it was a good read for me. I found it horribly insightful, due to all of the things that were carefully, deliberately left unsaid.Five stars....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 28, 2020","Jul 03, 2020","Mar 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42585167-uneasy-street

Published in May 2019, the contemporary literary novel, ""Disappearing Earth,"" by Julia Phillips, was a highly praised and critically acclaimed debut. This book earned a place on many awards lists and ""best of"" lists in 2019.Like a lot of people, I initially looked at this title and book cover and thought this was a book about climate change. But this novel has nothing whatsoever to do with climate change. It's actually a book about women's issues, especially violence against women, and the many different kinds of oppression and disappointments women face in their lives. The book is entirely framed through the viewpoints of women and girls. The point of view characters in this novel are all female. Each chapter examines the fictional story of a girl or woman living in Kamchatka, Russia, the far eastern peninsula most famous in the U.S. for appearing in the board game, Risk. (I don't know if the author is a fan of Risk. She's certainly a fan of Russia, and traveled there many times as a young adult and adult.)The first chapter narrates the story of two young girls who forget about Stranger Danger for a few minutes, and end up getting into a car with a male predator (the girls mistakenly think that he just wants to give them a ride home). The author was inspired to frame the novel with the abduction of two young girls after meeting one of her best friends in Russia (a grown man when she first met him) during her 1.5-year stay in Kamchatka on a Fulbright fellowship. The man took her on a walk to show her the beautiful landscape, and the author had a moment of terror in which she realized: if this man were really a predator, I would be in grave danger right now.Of course, the man was no predator, and the author (according to the interviews I've seen on YouTube) had a wonderful time in Kamchatka. She was not raped, kidnapped, forced into sexual slavery, diagnosed with cancer, lost a beloved pet dog, witnessed any crime against a woman and failed to have the police believe her witness statement because she was a woman, suffered in a marriage to a domestic abuser, or any of the many other crimes, oppression, or disappointment the women and girls in this novel face.Phillips has stated she wrote the book by ""making her imagined fear real"" in a fictional story. For a lot of readers, this book worked wonderfully, and the detailed chapters describing various women facing all kinds of different traumas and disappointments was a powerful read for a lot of people. Sadly, this book did not work for me. I was ready to DNF by page 2. The prose didn't captivate me, and being forced to read from the POV of a young child is always dangerous territory for me. I get bored and annoyed by the way certain authors write children's POVs. That definitely happened to me in these opening pages. I forced myself to continue. I skimmed a lot. I found the vast majority of this book super dull. These POV characters live lives of quiet desperation or worse, all framed around the unspoken institutionalized patriarchy that robs women of agency, resources, and choice. A lot of readers love the penultimate chapter, in which many of these women all come together to finally address the book's opening question: whatever happened to those two little girls who got in the car with that predator?I admit I was just rolling my eyes by the time I got to these pages. My ""I give zero f*cks"" meter had been maxed-out by then. I'm amazed that I read the final chapter. But I'm so glad I did.I'm giving all four stars of my rating to that final chapter. I loved it. Those pages were the first time in the book in which I finally felt something, gave a damn, cared one iota, and felt deeply moved.The final chapter of ""Disappearing Earth"" is a powerful piece of writing. And it definitely had so much more impact because of all that had come before, and because the reader knows something that the characters narrating the chapter don't yet know. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys books that deal with women's oppression. There is some intersection of misogyny and racism in this book as well, because some of the main characters are women of the Even tribe of reindeer herders in Russia. A lot of readers also loved the book's setting. This novel has strong 'exotic setting' vibes in addition to all of the 'patriarchy sucks' motif. (I know that ""naming patriarchy"" is problematic for a lot of readers because it makes a novel feel ""too political,"" and to my knowledge, Phillips never ""names the patriarchy"" in this novel. She simply features a lot of women leading shitty lives because various men in this book are f*cking horrible, from sexual predators to abusive partners to just neglectful, entitled pieces of sh*t, like that policeman one woman is married to, a woman so stifled in her life of being forced to be a stay-at-home mom that she fantasizes about the foreign workers [from Central Asia/Central Eurasia] near her apartment complex gang-raping her to ""make her new"" i.e. open her up to feeling alive again. I felt like I was in the midst of a low-grade depression while reading this book.)Anyway, just because this book wasn't my cup of tea doesn't mean I can't see the appeal for other readers. Big thanks to my friend Blair for sending me this one and letting me check it out. I loved learning a bit more about this really cool place in Russia. After reading that final, powerful chapter, the setting was definitely my second-favorite thing about this book.

If you are familiar with ""The Work"" by Byron Katie, or the Rapid Transformational Therapy Trainer, Marissa Peer, the principles of Al-Anon are identical: healing starts by focusing on yourself, and examining your own thoughts, emotions, and behavior. ""Returning yourself to peace and sanity"" is impossible if you are trying to ""control"" or ""heal"" someone else, especially if that person is an alcoholic.Al-Anon is an anonymous program, and members respect the privacy of everyone who attends a meeting. Identities of Al-Anon members are never made public.By posting this , I'm making my connection to Al-Anon public. I picked up and read this book because I found myself attending Al-Anon meetings in 2020, in the weeks before the COVID-19 pandemic stopped all public gatherings. Someone I love very dearly became incredibly ill in 2019, mentally and emotionally, which triggered a complete psychosomatic breakdown by January 2020. In order to help this person regain their physical, mental, and emotional health, attending daily Al-Anon meetings became an essential part of their recovery program.I am *incredibly* grateful to Al-Anon, both for hosting such wonderful, uplifting meetings, as well as providing such excellent literature. Al-Anon books and pamphlets are incredible resources. Anyone can attend a meeting at any time, free of charge. A member even let me take home a free copy of this book, since I didn't have the money to pay for it. Two weeks later, I had the $6.00 to cover the cost, and paid for the book, but it really warmed my heart to know that Al-Anon members wanted me to have this literature, regardless of whether or not I could afford it, just because they wanted me to have the help I needed. If you are struggling mentally, emotionally, and/or physically from a relationship (past or present) with an alcoholic, and you have never attended an Al-Anon meeting, I hope you will consider giving Al-Anon a try. Their website enables you to find the closest meeting where you live, listing all locations and times. In my area, I was grateful to discover that there were meetings available every day.""How Al-Anon Works"" is an incredibly helpful book.

Rosenblatt's book is chock-full of classic instruction for penning literary fiction, and I absolutely adore it.I first read this book in 2011, right after I heard Rosenblatt speak about it on the PBS NewsHour, and then I reread this book in February 2020. A lot has happened to me in the intervening 9 years. I've completed eleven commercial-fiction/genre novels in that time, I have self-published five of them, and I fully admit that my writing and my views about writing have changed a lot from my younger, more idealistic self.While I no longer wholeheartedly agree with all of Rosenblatt's advice, I can at least explain a little about why my views have shifted so much toward what remains a 5-star read about writing craft. Here is a paragraph from Rosenblatt's final pages, quoted from a letter he penned for his students many months after the class ended. It summarizes Rosenblatt's final advice, and delves into the thorny topic of writing and money:""How can you know what is useful to the world? The world will not tell you. The world will merely let you know what it wants, which changes from moment to moment, and is nearly always cockeyed. You cannot allow yourself to be directed by its tastes. When a writer wonders, 'Will it sell?' he is lost, not because he is looking to make an extra buck or two, but rather because, by dint of asking the question in the first place, he has oriented himself toward the expectations of others. The world is not a focus group. The world is an appetite waiting to be defined. The greatest love you can show it is to create what it needs, which mean you must know that yourself."" (pg 151)(As an aside, I would have worded that final sentence: ""which means you must know that yourself,"" but the wording typed above is what is featured in the book.)To disagree with Rosenblatt: I believe that writers can and do become influenced by the question, ""Will it sell?"" and those writers can and do keep writing, and producing quality work, without being ""lost."" Understanding the market, and how that market works, is about understanding power: how power operates in modern America. To understand power means being able to comprehend who holds power, and why, and what they will do to maintain it. Rosenblatt grew up comfortably middle-class. He is white, able-bodied, neurotypical, highly educated, and has been extremely successful as a writer. Having always lived inside the world of publishing and literature, it is easy for him to speak against writers trying to actively figure out how to ""sell their work"" for a profit. Part of me deeply appreciates that Rosenblatt's staunch opinion, prevalent within MFA programs, insisting that money ""corrupts"" art and artistic pursuits, still exists. A bigger part of me just wants to laugh, and I do laugh. No offense to Roger Rosenblatt, but the supposed ""purity"" of art is so rare as to be almost nonexistent. His own book included. American culture is like a giant machine, an enormous combustion engine that is always running, and understanding the book market is like popping open the hood of the truck. Why not take a look for yourself? I would never tell a writer not to pop the hood of that truck and take a look at the engine. What I've seen in that view has been fascinating, and complicated, dirty and ugly, and incredibly powerful. Once you know how the system operates, the engine of publishing becomes predictable, the same way any piece of machinery becomes predictable to a mechanic. It's not for the faint of heart, though. Seekers beware. Knowledge is dangerous stuff. But it certainly won't ""corrupt"" you. At least, I don't think it will. Rosenblatt disagrees. He's a purist, God bless him. This book is Classic MFA Literature, and I'll always love it, no matter how corrupted and impure I've become.Five stars.

The book was adapted into an opera in 2015, and then adapted into a Hollywood film in 2018. ""Bel Canto"" brought Ms. Patchett financial success and literary fame. The work of writing the book also introduced her to opera, a journey she describes in the essay, ""How to Fall in Love with Opera,"" which was included in my paperback copy. The essay's title was the working title of the novel, before ""Bel Canto"" was chosen. While the fans of this novel are legion, and ""Bel Canto"" came highly recommended to me by the literary author Colum McCann, when I finally picked up this book in February 2020, I was revolted by the text. Of the 318 pages in ""Bel Canto,"" I managed to read 42 of them before I put the book down in disgust.The story is boring. It's completely unrealistic. It's also entirely racist. I would not call this book literary fiction. While the story employs a somewhat elliptical timeline, hinting at the ending throughout the text, and the paragraphs are packed full of flowery tangents that signal ""literary prose"" and ""Iowa Writers Workshop,"" the text is dull and not realistic at all. ""Bel Canto"" runs on stereotypes and melodrama: racist stereotypes and racist melodrama, to be exact. ""Bel Canto"" is set in a mansion in an unnamed country in South America, a country that is only described as possessing ""dismal jungle,"" ""guerillas,"" illiterate peasants, and emasculated, wealthy brown men who are obsessed with watching soap operas, cleaning house, and fawning over white people. Plenty of countries are named in this book, and understood through the novel's omniscient narrative voice to exist with a specific history, and respected as such: Japan, Greece, Australia, Russia, the United States, Britain/England, etc. etc. But no Latin American countries are named. In this book, the ""host country,"" which is often referred to as the ""godforsaken country"" in the text, is not named because the reader is meant to understand the setting of ""Bel Canto"" is ""an interchangeable Third World sh*thole"" that needs no description and no history, and therefore, does not even get a name.Nowhere in the book, or in the supplementary materials published with the book, is it mentioned that Patchett used a real event, the Japanese Embassy hostage crisis, also called the Lima Crisis of 1996-1997 in Lima, Peru, as the basis for writing her book. Patchett thoroughly researched opera to write this novel, but Peru itself received zero study, zero consideration at all, and that fact is glaringly obvious on every page of ""Bel Canto.""If you enjoy ignorant, racist stereotypes about Latin America and Latin Americans, this book is here for you. Patchett employs every single stereotype I'm aware of, and a few more for good measure. In addition to racist stereotypes, there are some ableist tropes. The primary antagonist, a vaguely-revolutionary general who leads a takeover of the Vice President's house, is afflicted with shingles, which are described in great detail on his face, an ableist trope that marks the man as morally inferior and destined to die. In describing the themes of ""Bel Canto"" in interviews, Patchett has stated that it was her intention to portray these illiterate, uneducated guerillas as people who never understood the value of education, or the value of sitting down to enjoy a meal and relax, which is why (as Patchett explains) they turn to ""violence,"" which is ""ignorant"" and ""never the answer."" Patchett's comments display not only a glaring ignorance about the real lives of Latin Americans (people who do, in fact, enjoy meals and know how to relax, as well as understand the value of education), but a glaring ignorance about how the United States military-industrial complex works, wherein educated men who are able to ""enjoy meals"" and ""relax"" develop imperialist schemes to invade and dominate other countries. Violence is ""ignorant"" when illiterate peasants use it. But when ""educated U.S. citizens"" use violence, I suppose Patchett would say it's a mark of enlightenment, because white people.In ""Bel Canto,"" the illiterate guerillas take over the Vice President's house while he is hosting a birthday party for a wealthy Japanese businessman who loves opera. A beautiful, white American soprano has been hired to perform for the night's entertainment, and she remains the only female hostage in a group of 49 or so male hostages. The novel describes a fantasy version of the 126 days of the hostage crisis from real life, with the addition of a sole female foreign hostage. In real life, the foreign female hostages were all released after the initial shoot-out. All of the men in the story (hostages and terrorists alike) spend the book fawning all over the beautiful white American woman. If you are a white American woman who wants to experience the thrills and ego-boost of being the Center of the Universe, if you long to be worshipped as a goddess in the Most Unrealistic Hostage Crisis Ever, this book is here for you. Illiterate brown peasants, emasculated rich brown men, and intelligent wealthy businessmen are eager to shower you with love and praise, and obey your every whim. You will never have to worry about rape, sexual abuse, taking a bath in privacy, or using the toilet, because this book is Fantasy Crisis, and you are the star. You are the diva of this book, in every sense of the word. Everything about this story is artificial, cloying, and banal. On one level, ""Bel Canto"" is art at its finest: an artificial version of real life. Fake Life sells well as art, as do racist stereotypes, ableist stereotypes, and depicting all of Latin America as ""an interchangeable sh*thole.""But this is simply not the kind of ""art"" I crave in my stories, especially stories that strive to be literary. I expect realism and authentic humanity in my literary fiction, not wish-fulfillment melodrama and U.S. nationalism. I'm honestly disgusted that this book won so many prestigious awards. It just sickens me. But then I look at what happened with ""American Dirt"" in January 2020 (the backlash that book received after it was published), and I realize how far we have come, as a literary community. People are raising their voices more and more against the brutal stereotypes used in award-winning, bestselling literature, in supposedly-literary works like ""Bel Canto"" and ""American Dirt."" If Patchett had published ""Bel Canto"" in 2020, rather than in 2001, the ecstatic reception this book received would have included a backlash similar to the one ""American Dirt"" just received. In the case of ""Bel Canto,"" Patchett took a political story set in Lima, Peru, and made it all about a white American woman who is worshipped as a goddess. ""Bel Canto"" is an ignorant, romanticized version of real life that employs racist stereotypes about Latin America and Latin Americans to run the whole plot. The same argument has been made by critics of ""American Dirt."" Negative stars.

She spoke the title with reverence, and gushed over the book. A week later, none of the teacher's favorite students had taken the book from the school library, so I borrowed it and read it. I wasn't impressed. At the end of 2019, I decided to switch from writing Young Adult fiction to middle grade fiction, and because literary agents adore ""The Westing Game,"" and are eager to acquire ""another Westing Game,"" I decided it was time to reread this modern classic, and did so in February 2020.Even as an adult, I remain deeply unimpressed. This is an intensely plot-focused book, centered on a completely contrived, unrealistic plot, with a large cast of characters who are all either character-archetypes or walking stereotypes. This book reads like a 1960s stage play, a play in which people speak and act on behalf of the script, because the script gave them their lines, not because living human beings actually talk or act that way.In one way, this novel is ""art"" at its best: an artificial version of real life. Personally, this is just not the kind of art I enjoy. I love character-driven stories over plot-driven pot-boilers. And the plot of ""The Westing Game"" is the most contrived, unrealistic plot I have perhaps ever read. The whole book is an elaborate farce. This novel is best approached as a comedy: a 1960s stage play comedy, to be precise. There are racist, sexist, and ableist stereotypes throughout the book. There is a lot of linguistic ableism (i.e. the accepted use of ""cripple,"" ""Mongoloid"" for Down syndrome, etc.) that is simply a result of the publication date: 1978. I do not fault the book for the flaws of its time period, but because the character-archetypes and character-stereotypes are such a prevalent part of this book, everything grated on me even more. The story centers on the idea that a wealthy, successful businessman has nothing better to do with his time than to create multiple identities for himself, dress up and disguise himself as multiple people, fake his own death, claim in his ""death note"" that he was murdered, fake his identity as his own murderer, spy on an entire group of people, craftily manipulate those people into living in an apartment building together, craftily manipulate them into participating in a competition to inherit his $200 million dollar estate, and secretly participate in the competition himself. It's honestly f*cking weird. The reader has to accept a lot of horse sh*t to believe any human being would ever act this way, or ""play a game"" like this, especially when all standard procedures of ""real life"" are removed from the text (criminal investigations, autopsies, etc.) as well as from the minds of the entire cast of characters, which is how this ""estate game"" is allowed to take place. There is no doubt in my mind that the adolescent tomboy-genius character of Turtle Wexler is modeled on the real life of the author, Ellen Raskin. Raskin herself was incredibly brilliant and ambitious, and made a lot of money for herself at a young age by playing the stock market, the same way young Turtle does in this book.After Turtle ""wins the game,"" the book contains epilogue material that I found pretty interesting, material that countered some (but not all) of the heaviest stereotypes used in the book. It wasn't enough to erase the bad taste this book left in my mouth, but it did help a bit. What I found the most interesting about the epilogue-material was how it changed the framing of the rest of the book. What Turtle really ""wins"" in the game isn't money, but a mentor. Many modern Americans revere wealthy, white men in positions of authority, and Sam Westing/Julian Eastman is certainly that. When Turtle wins the game, Julian Eastman becomes Turtle's friend and mentor. There is powerful emotion in that situation: seeing a blue-eyed businessman in a fine, expensive suit befriending and mentoring a plucky tomboy-genius girl.I have to admit that I didn't warm to Turtle until the epilogue material, because she's so insecure and vicious throughout the competition (while she is playing the game to win Sam Westing's estate) that she was intensely unlikeable. I found myself wishing that one of the bombs would go off in her face and take her head off; that was how much I didn't like her. As to the competition, Raskin's clues to the reader are deliberately coy. This isn't a ""game"" that the reader can play along with, because so much information is withheld until the very end of the story. The plot of the book isn't structured like a murder mystery, but as comedic farce. ""Solving the puzzle"" to win the estate is contingent upon character backstory and long-buried secrets within the character backstory; books like ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006) make much better use of wordplay and puzzles to drive the main plot than ""The Westing Game"" does.I read the first 107 pages carefully, and then I skipped to page 140 or so, and skim-read the final action scene. There are 182 pages total in this book. It was honestly agony to read so much of this text. I am definitely not the ideal reader for a story like this. If you enjoy old Hollywood movies, especially from the 1960s, films that feature walking-stereotype characters, zany silliness, and artificial dialogue, you'll probably enjoy ""The Westing Game"" a lot more than I did. This book is technically middle grade fiction, but I honestly find the content and prose style (a sophisticated omniscient third person POV/point of view) to read as adult literary. As a sixth grader, this book made little sense to me. Even as an adult, I had to reread entire pages to make sense of the text and follow the story, because the omniscient POV often switches from character to character multiple times per page. From one paragraph to the next, the POV shifts among a very large cast of minor and main characters. Readers have to read carefully and rigorously to keep track of it all. The racist, ableist, and sexist stereotypes used for ""characterization"" in this book were also unknown to me as a child, which made this book even harder for me to follow when I was in sixth grade. As an adult reader, I had a far easier time immediately associating different character archetypes and stereotypes with the names in the text. I cannot imagine recommending this book to a middle school reader. I would classify ""The Westing Game"" as appropriate for high school and adult readers. It honestly baffles me that this book has always been categorized as middle grade fiction, and won the Newbery Medal. Two stars. Not the worst book I have ever read, but certainly not my preferred form of art. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 04, 2020","Feb 17, 2020","Feb 04, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/481510.The_Westing_Game

""Discipline Equals Freedom: Field Manual,"" by Jocko Willink (2017), is a heavy dose of motivation for anyone who wants to exercise, eat a paleo diet, and go to sleep every night by 9:30 p.m. so they can wake at 4:30 a.m. for an intense, muscle-building workout. The text reads like a drill sergeant yelling at the reader nonstop. Willink frames all of life as a war, in which you, the reader, must learn to be ever-vigilant against ""the enemy"" all around you. ""The enemy"" in your life is anything from a free donut at the office, to staying up late on the weekend to watch a movie, to a mass shooter that you'll need to kill with your own pistol. If you are someone who wants to treat civilian life like you're in the U.S. Marine Corps, I would definitely recommend this book. If you are someone who longs to have a drill sergeant shouting at you in book form, telling you to exercise, then this will be a good read. There are pages and pages of intense, military-style exercise routines that fill up the last fifth of the book. Personally, I don't think it's productive to view life as a war. Willink encourages his readers to use anger and fear as their daily fuel to power them through demanding workouts, and give them the ""aggression"" to stay hyper-vigilant all day, and remain on guard against ""the enemy."" I find this mentality exhausting and unhelpful; there are other ways to be highly disciplined without viewing daily life as ""a war."" But if this mentality works for Willink and his podcast fans, then power to them. I'm glad that people have the messaging that works for them to stay motivated. I personally would *not* recommend this book to anyone with PTSD. Willink's constant focus on ""war"" and ""the enemy"" frames all of life as a combat zone, and if I actually thought of life this way, I doubt I'd be able to sleep at night, especially if I had PTSD.

Since none of the main characters is old enough to possess a driver's license, shenanigans ensue. While the burial quest is the main plot of the book, it takes 60 pages (of 244 pages total) to arrive at the main plot. The beginning 60 pages of backstory and setup were a slog. I had to skim the vast bulk of this novel; the urge to DNF remained strong until over 80% through the story. The premise of the doll and its history is sufficiently creepy and interesting, but that content is only a small percentage of the overall book. The best parts of the story arrive in the final few pages. There are plot reveals concerning the doll and its history, and some great moral messaging about the three main characters, their lives, and their friendship. The ending featured the best prose I have ever read from Holly Black. Had the entire book been as good as the ending, I would have easily given this novel five stars. I'll split the difference between my bored, one-star opinion of the first 85% of this book with my five-star opinion of the final 15%, and award ""Doll Bones"" three stars.

This book is incredibly thorough, informative, and ruthless in its unflinching journalism. ""The Great Deluge"" was tremendously painful to read. I cried a lot. I sure learned a lot. I absolutely love this book.In late March/early April, 2019, I took my first (and so far, only) trip to New Orleans to attend the Tennessee Williams Literary Festival. Having never been to Louisiana before, I felt like a giant sponge, taking everything in. New Orleans is such an amazing, beautiful place. But some brutal facts were just inescapable. In New Orleans, most of the white-collar, affluent people are white, and most of the blue-collar, working-class people are Black. At the literary festival, almost all of the attendees were white. Almost all of the people serving the attendees were Black.At one event, I was able to hear the Pulitzer-Prize winning author Michael Cunningham speak (best known for his 1998 novel, ""The Hours,"" which was turned into an award-winning film). At another event, a local author hosting a writers' workshop engaged the audience in a Q&A session. Most of the audience members were residents of New Orleans who lived in the affluent neighborhoods (which are predominantly white). The event was held in the French Quarter, a neighborhood most popular for the city's tourism industry. When members of the audience were asked about misconceptions ""the larger public"" has about New Orleans, several people answered with irritation: ""they just think of Katrina"" (which occurred on August 29, 2005). Many people nodded, and one person vehemently said, ""People need to forget about Katrina. New Orleans is more than Katrina."" This proclamation was met with even more vigorous nodding, and even some applause. The service workers at this event, however, had a completely different worldview. Not only were these people -- who were working for minimum wage -- still *very much* thinking about Katrina and its impacts on their lives, but three different working-class people I spoke with actually believed that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had dynamited the levies and flooded the Lower Ninth Ward on purpose, in order to kill the poor.The information sent me reeling. HAD the levies been dynamited? I honestly didn't know. I did know one thing for certain: the affluent white people of New Orleans, and the working poor of New Orleans, live in two very, very different realities. My friend Blair loaned me her copy of ""The Great Deluge"" to read, and thank goodness she did, because this book is profoundly on the side of the people whose lives were devastated by Katrina, and speaks loudly, emphatically, for all of the people who were disgusted and outraged by the complete government failure of helping storm victims in the aftermath. ""The Great Deluge"" is a blistering examination of what went wrong, and why, and why the government response was so inept, cruel, and cataclysmic. I know with full certainty now that the levies failed on their own; they were not dynamited. But the fact that I met multiple people in New Orleans who believe they were dynamited is a sign of a huge class divide. It took me a long time to read ""The Great Deluge."" Every time Brinkley noted his source material in the text, I would look it up online, and read the articles and opinion pieces he quoted from or referenced. I watched several Frontline documentaries about Katrina, and other context pieces available on YouTube. ""The Great Deluge"" is a very long book, and all of the extra reading I did around it made the process of reading the book even longer. It was time well spent. When I think back on the writers' workshop I attended, in which affluent white city residents wanted the broader United States to ""forget about Katrina,"" I feel such a mix of emotions, none of them good. As a Louisiana outsider, a white Coloradoan who *does* associate New Orleans with Katrina, I know I was one of the people the affluent city residents in that room strongly dislike.But after reading ""The Great Deluge,"" I think that's a good thing. I hope to God we don't ever forget Katrina. I hope to God we don't ever forget that it was a massive human tragedy that was 100% preventable. I hope we don't ever forget that the people who died in the highest numbers were the poor: especially the elderly poor and the disabled poor. Especially Black people who were poor.I hope we never forget that the United States is a place of systemic inequality, and our national shortcomings were profoundly on display when we failed to evacuate people from the city, and then failed to help them after the city flooded.I hope we don't ever forget that the survivors of Katrina were horribly traumatized, and the reality of that trauma still reside in the minds and bodies of those people today. A huge thanks to Blair for loaning me this book.Douglas Brinkley, and everyone who helped Douglas Brinkley research this book, are a national treasure. ""The Great Deluge"" is one of the best books I've ever read. It's certainly one of the most important.Five million stars.

A great book for history buffs, policy wonks, laypeople, Twitter enthusiasts, social media users, and anyone concerned about the modern state of American politics, the prose is fluid and accessible, and the content is important and needed. The book defines ""polarization"" as simply having a population divided around two poles. Polarization is not equal to ""extremism."" Extremism and polarization are two different things, and the book makes sure to define its terms early and well. The final chapter, ""Managing Polarization -- and Ourselves,"" contains some suggestions for readers and legislators alike. The entire book is incredibly informative and realistically hopeful. I loved it.Klein offers a number of insights about the identity politics operating within the current Republican Party, and why the GOP has become so hypocritical, bizarre, and dysfunctional. If you are someone who keeps hearing the double-speak of modern Republicans and wondering, ""why do conservatives continue to associate Trumpism with conservatism, when those are actually two different things?"" or ""how did beating the Left become all that conservatives care about, to the detriment of any actual governance taking place?"" or ""how did a 'conservative identity' come to replace actual conservative ideology in the modern GOP?"" then I highly recommend you read this book.""Why We're Polarized"" helped me so much to make sense of what has seemed, more and more, as irrational and nonsensical about the modern-day GOP. Here is a nice summary quote from page 229:""The polarizing forces I have described throughout this book are acting on both coalitions. So why has the Democratic Party weathered them in a way the Republican Party hasn't? Why are the two parties so different? The answer is twofold: Democrats have an immune system of diversity and democracy. The Republican Party doesn't. This has not left the Democrats unaffected by the forces of polarization, to be sure. But if polarization has given the Democratic Party the flu, the Republican Party has caught pneumonia.""The rest of that chapter, titled: ""The Difference between Democrats and Republicans,"" detailing party diversity, party democracy, and the effect of Fox News on the Republican identity (pages 229-248), were some of my favorite pages in the entire book.

Emetophobia is a fairly common phobia, though I admit I had never heard the actual term for that fear before reading this book. The artwork in ""Guts"" is absolutely fantastic. The story is warmhearted, humorous, and uplifting. I'm really glad this book has proven to be extremely popular with middle school readers as well as adults. The story is compelling, and the ending left me with such a strong feeling of happiness. I loved it. Highly recommended.

The entire book is a nonstop nightmare. Every sentence is true. Everything depicted in this book is real life. It's the bravest book I've ever read. I absolutely loved it.There isn't a word out of place in this book. Urrea is a phenomenal writer, and his prose is superb.This book is a follow-up to Urrea's first book, ""Across the Wire: Life and Hard Times on the Mexican Border,"" and this sequel focuses on the people who survive by scavenging garbage from the dump sites in Tijuana, Mexico.I had previously only read one other book by Urrea, his stellar 2004 nonfiction book, ""The Devil's Highway: A True Story,"" which describes the harrowing May 2001 attempt of 26 men to cross the Mexican border into the desert of southern Arizona. That book was plenty dark. ""By the Lake of Sleeping Children"" is *so* much darker.I decided to read this book after discovering that author Jeanine Cummins had plagiarized content from Urrea's work and (however unwittingly, subconsciously or consciously) written it into her own bestselling novel, ""American Dirt,"" which was published in 2020. A number of Latinx authors called Cummins out for doing this, and the content of ""By the Lake of Sleeping Children"" was one of Urrea's books that was named the most often in the list of unacknowledged books Cummins stole from.In January 2020, NPR interviewed Urrea about ""American Dirt,"" and he stated that his wife had decided to read his Advanced Review Copy/ARC, sent to him by the publisher in 2019, and she had been the first one to tell him that the novel featured content from his own books. Urrea stated that he had no plans to ""American Dirt.""""By the Lake of Sleeping Children"" depicts poverty so carefully and unflinchingly that this book reads like a horror novel, and Urrea includes a warning about the book's content in the opening pages. If any reader cannot handle the realities of living in poverty, you should not read this book. Urrea also includes some specific content warnings for different chapters, so readers can choose to skip certain chapters if they don't wish to read about particular subjects.I'm so glad that Latinx authors spoke up so forcefully about ""American Dirt,"" and brought my attention to this beautiful, dark, horrifying book of Urrea's. It's a stunning read. Ten million stars. Highly recommended.

But I just can't finish this book. ""The Thirteenth Tale,"" Diane Setterfield's debut novel, first published in 2006, is categorized as ""gothic suspense."" But I never felt any suspense, and the gothic elements are almost nonexistent.The book is named after a collection of stories featured in the novel, a collection that is missing its final -- thirteenth -- tale. Part of the allure of reading this book is to discover whether or not the protagonist, Margaret Lea, will locate a copy of the missing thirteenth story.I couldn't care less if the thirteenth tale is found, or what information the story contains. I don't care about Margaret Lea, or the reclusive author Vida Winter. I don't care about any of the characters named in this book. It pains me that I kept turning pages, hoping something would peak my interest. But I'm beginning to feel actively hostile toward the relentless boredom this book inspires, and enough is enough.Other readers have found Setterfield's prose highly enjoyable, but I find these sentences serviceable at best. The storytelling is both utterly dull and packed with childish melodrama. I just don't understand the appeal.

Hochschild's consistent focus throughout the book is to ""climb over the empathy wall"" between the political viewpoints of Democrats and Republicans. She does a fine job. This is a wonderful book, and I look forward to reading more of her work. I finally had a chance to read ""Strangers in Their Own Land"" in January 2020, but this book was most widely read in 2017, right after the election of President Trump. Hochschild's central thesis -- that Tea Party voters have ""a deep story"" that involves ""waiting in line for the American Dream"" while people at the back of the line ""cut in front of them"" -- has been cited in so many other books and media sources I follow, that I was already well aware of her central thesis before reading the book.What I really learned from ""Strangers in Their Own Land"" was how incredibly polluted the state of Louisiana is. I knew the pollution levels were bad there, but I had no idea how bad it really was, or the extent that current politicians are encouraging even more industrial pollution to be dumped into Louisiana every day. Passages in this book were utterly horrifying to read. In her Acknowledgements, Hochschild credits a book titled ""Petrochemical America,"" by Richard Misrach and Kate Orff, with ""opening her eyes"" to the extent of petrochemical pollution in the United States. An image from that book was used for the book cover of ""Strangers in Their Own Land."" I was so shocked to discover how incredibly polluted Louisiana is that I really want to read ""Petrochemical America"" as well. ""Strangers in Their Own Land"" is concise, interesting, and easy to read. I was surprised that I was able to read this book so quickly. I thought the prose was going to be more academic and demanding, like Nancy Isenberg's ""White Trash,"" but ""Strangers in Their Own Land"" was as quick and easy to read as Michael Lewis or Malcolm Gladwell.

I only skim-read this series, so I don't feel comfortable rating any of these books or discussing them with any depth. I just wanted to say that I found all of the plot twists in the second half of this book so entirely predictable that it took effort to even skim-read to the last page. Not only does the book's cover broadcast what will happen in the text before it happens, but the resolution to the main plot problem didn't deviate from anything I assumed Black would write. I know other readers genuinely feared for Cardan and Jude, but I always assumed Black would give them this ending, and she did.I also find it fascinating that so many readers finished this book still hating Taryn, even after Taryn does some really badass stuff for Jude in this book. I had to grit my teeth when Jude chose to trust anything out of Madoc's mouth, especially concerning that magical bridle. It was another point of complete predictability in this novel (that Black would have Jude making an error like this), and I wasn't a fan. Jude should not be making such foolish mistakes at the end of book 3, but Black writes her main characters this way, and it just doesn't work for me.It definitely works for other readers, though, and I'm glad so many people have enjoyed this trilogy. I wish these had been 5-star, gripping reads for me, too. Black's prose style is lovely, and I always enjoy her word choice and exposition. It's the story content and the plot structure that just fall flat for me. Unrated. Not my cup of tea.

I really enjoyed it.""Together Tea"" centers on the bond between a mother and daughter named Mina and Darya. In 1981 (about a year after the start of the Iran-Iraq War), their immediate family leaves Tehran, Iran and moves to New York City, where they eventually become permanent U.S. residents. In 1996, Mina and Darya journey back to Tehran to see their friends and family again.The novel gives just enough information about 1970s Iran, and a brief mention in dialogue of the Iran hostage crisis (1979-1981), to provide cultural and historical context to an American (and assumed non-Iranian) reader. ""Together Tea"" is a book about the challenges of leaving one's homeland and finding a new place in the world. As highly educated, affluent Iranians and affluent Iranian-Americans, the two main characters and their families harbor no ill will toward the U.S. The dark, frightening realities of life in Iran that led to the 1979 Revolution are glossed over or completely unmentioned. ""Together Tea"" is a feel-good book, not a history lesson. It's certainly not a book that examines U.S. foreign policy or the CIA.And I'm perfectly fine with that. I'm already highly aware of that history, and this novel does an excellent job of humanizing Iranians and Iranian-Americans. This is a domestic novel, not a political diatribe. ""Together Tea"" certainly doesn't read like nonfiction at all. The story is sweet and endearing. It's a book that made me smile a lot and feel good. A lot of the themes in ""Together Tea"" are similar to those found in ""Funny in Farsi: A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America,"" a 2003 memoir by Iranian American author Firoozeh Dumas. Dumas penned a sequel memoir, ""Laughing Without an Accent: Adventures of an Iranian American, at Home and Abroad"" (2008), which is also delightful. Kamali's novel isn't as laugh-out-loud hilarious as Dumas's heartwarming two books, but Kamali and Dumas definitely share similar purposes in writing for a largely non-Iranian American audience. Kamali's ""Together Tea"" is nowhere near as dark as Marjane Satrapi's illustrated memoir, ""Persepolis"" (2000, 2004). But if you enjoyed the infusion of humor, warmth, and humanity found in ""Persepolis,"" then you would absolutely enjoy ""Together Tea.""And if you are a reader who knows absolutely nothing about Iran or Iranians, and you enjoy domestic, contemporary fiction, then ""Together Tea"" would be a great introduction to the nation and its people. The characters in this book are incredibly lovable, and the author has a highly engaging prose style. I read every word of this novel, and it's a rare book that doesn't force me to skim or skip pages.

Part research analysis, and part how-to guide, this book illuminates why habits form and how people can consciously change them.I really loved it. I highly recommend it. The book is easy to read. I finished it in less than a week.The one big point that is missing from this book (a point I have learned from years of listening to Tony Robbins, among others) is how much our underlying beliefs about ourselves (i.e. ""the stories"" we tell ourselves about who we are, as individual people) can become one of the ""cues"" that triggers a habit to kick in (in order to receive our reward from completing the habit).Duhigg's book focuses on identifying triggers/cues for our habits in our external, physical, and emotional realities -- for instance, when we are tired or a little sad, we might identify that feeling as a ""cue"" to drink a cup of coffee.But I have learned that some habits are also ""triggered"" because we are trying to stay consistent with who we think we are -- i.e. who we believe that we are -- and this means we are not solely driven by emotional or physical cues (such as boredom, thirst, hunger, etc.). I still found this book incredibly informative and fun to read. I just wanted to add a caveat that I think the author failed to understand that our ""underlying beliefs about ourselves"" are one of the biggest ""cues"" that trigger people to perform habits (in order to attain the rewards from a habit), whether those habits are good or bad. Fortunately for me, the author gives out his email address at the end of the book, and states, ""If you have found a way to change your habits, I would love to hear from you. My email is charles@charlesduhigg.com -- or you can find all of my contact information on my webiste at www.charlesduhigg.com. I reply to every email. I look forward to hearing what has worked for you.""I will definitely email him about this, because I am someone who has learned the power of changing my underlying beliefs about myself -- i.e. changing a core ""story"" I tell myself about who I think that I am -- which has had instant, profound, and long-term changes on my habits. These are habit changes that come with zero willpower to make them ""stick"" because the human mind is completely driven to stay consistent with who we think we are.

Orenstein's heart is in the right place. The limitations of this book are highly noticeable, however. My original  for this book focused on three major limitations: 1. Orenstein's acceptance and embrace that boys watch modern online pornography as part of a ""natural"" aspect of sexuality. Orenstein ignores any mention of the extreme dehumanization of pornography, and never mentions the psychic impact on boys when they masturbate to images of extreme dehumanization. Orenstein also fails to point out that pornography's harm is not only scarring to boys, emotionally and psychologically, but to the people who are in the films, too. 2. Orenstein avoids all mention that the people in pornography are largely from working class and impoverished backgrounds, and the fact that they are completely dehumanized in the films, which is an ugly aspect of classism in modern America. Modern pornography is an actively oppressive art form that takes a huge toll on everyone involved in creating and consuming it. The emotional, psychological, and physical toll of modern pornography is the highest on the people who are in the films, and many of those people are actually underage, and starring in films as a result of being sex trafficked. Pornography preys upon the poor and the most vulnerable members of our society: homeless children, people in poverty, and children from working class families. For ""Boys & Sex"" to ignore all mention of this, while at the same time promoting the consumption of this art among middle class boys and young men, illuminates a stark vein of classism that runs through this entire book.3. In discussing the different situations that boys and young men can be raped, Orenstein avoids all mention that boys and young men can be raped by their own family members, starting as young children. While it is good that Orenstein sheds light on young men being raped by young women in high school and college, there are certainly boys who are raped before puberty in their own homes, and I wish the book would have at least mentioned this. Rape culture/porn culture/patriarchal culture harms everyone in American society, including young boys. Many of the people who star in modern pornography films are victims of incest, even as infants and toddlers. The effects of rape culture impact all children, including boys and intersex children. Personally, I found ""Boys & Sex"" disappointing and lacking. But this book was definitely written to target a certain type of reader: a middle-class reader who does not want to read about certain content, and Orenstein made sure to avoid certain content for that reason. I would recommend this book to any reader who wants a soft, easy introduction to the damaging effects of mainstream American culture on boys and young men.Orenstein never mentions the excellent 2015 documentary, ""The Mask You Live In,"" and I really wish she had. It's another excellent resource for understanding the harmful effects of rape culture and hetero masculinity (i.e. the patriarchy) on boys and young men.Orenstein never mentions the sex education program ""Our Whole Lives"" in this book, but if you are a parent who is looking for concrete help in talking to your children about having a healthy sex life, please consider checking out OWL. The Unitarian Universalists are really ahead of the pack in America, as far as helping people of all ages embrace pleasure and love, for their own bodies as well as with their partners, and this pleasure and love is open to people of all sex identities and gender identities.  I am glad that this book exists, because I know Orenstein's work can reach a mainstream audience that many other types of feminist authors cannot. ""Boys & Sex"" is not a book that examines the harm of patriarchy on American society as a whole. This is a book about mitigating the patriarchy's most harmful effects on middle class boys and young men. If you find yourself more interested in helping everyone in society, not just the middle class, I would suggest you seek out other titles. For those readers who are solely concerned with helping middle class boys and young men, ""Boys & Sex"" will be a far more rewarding and empowering read than it was for me....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 18, 2020","Jun 18, 2020","Dec 20, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45730106-boys-sex

After skim-reading the first 139 pages of the sequel, I actually think that the second book is much worse. All of the characters have dropped into full-on depravity mode. The supposed heroes/protagonists are sending people on suicide missions to destroy food stores. Death and destruction are everywhere. Zélie screams and cries and throws tantrums nonstop. No one has even the semblance of a brain in this book. By the time I got to the scene in which Inan is watching his mother torture people to death while he looks on, as the King, witnessing atrocities and doing nothing, I just couldn't skim-read anymore. It was all just too awful. I have read some spoiler tags for the book's later content, so I know that the characters do much more heinous things before the end. I'll add a Content Warning/Spoiler Warning below for those who are interested.Adeyemi drew inspiration from ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" (the animated show that ran from 2005-2008) in writing this book, and now that I've finally seen the TV show (I watched every episode in August 2019), I can officially state that I'm appalled that anyone would compare Adeyemi's work to that TV show, including Adeyemi herself. ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is *not* a gore-fest. The adolescent main characters in ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" are doing everything they can to save lives. But in Adeyemi's work, torture and slaughter are the tools of the teenage heroes. It's really sickening.At least when Good Morning America made their book selection, they left ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" out of it. GMA called the book: ""Game of Thrones meets Black Panther"" in promoting the sequel to readers. Which is fair enough. The GoT reference is clearly meant to alert readers that ""Children of Virtue and Vengeance"" is a gore-fest. Also: this book is not Season One GoT, but Season Eight GoT, wherein the characters have no internal consistency, motivations, or functioning brains. If you enjoyed watching Daenerys Targaryen lose her mind and go full-on Hitler because Plot Puppet, then you will probably love ""Children of Virtue and Vengeance.""I didn't watch GoT's Season Eight, but I enjoyed the fireworks that occurred after the internet suffered a meltdown when the penultimate and ultimate episodes aired. Adeyemi finished writing ""Children of Virtue and Vengeance"" in September 2019, a full three months after Daenerys Targaryen became a mad dictator, genocidal asshole, and murder victim. (RIP Daenerys, May 2019.) I have no doubt that Adeyemi enjoyed that plot twist, and drew inspiration from GoT in penning her sequel. If you enjoy horror and gore, and believe that YA fantasy should feature buckets o' blood and genocidal protagonists, then I definitely recommend you add ""Children of Virtue and Vengeance"" to your TBR. For me personally, I have to be honest: I don't want to root for teenagers who promote torture, murder, and genocide. I feel like I get enough of that when I turn on the evening news and listen to what's happening in Yemen and Syria: civil war, starvation, torture, genocide, leaders with zero morals, bloodshed that leaves me feeling numb and powerless. I sure as hell don't want to read about nonstop depravity in my fiction. One star.

In 2003, Golden's publisher settled with Iwasaki out of court for an undisclosed sum of money. Iwasaki later went on to write an autobiography, which shows a very different picture of twentieth-century geisha life than the one shown in Golden's novel. The book was published as ""Geisha, a Life."" I compare ""Three Women"" to Golden's novel in order to disparage ""Three Women,"" not to in any way belittle what happened to Mineko Iwasaki. I know that what she went through -- the death threats she received, etc. -- was horrifying, and I would never wish that on anyone.) ""Three Women,"" by Lisa Taddeo (2019), is officially categorized and sold as nonfiction. I have no idea how anyone could actually call this book nonfiction. It's a novelization of real events. Which means: this book is a novel. Lisa Taddeo ""imagined"" herself into the real lives of these three women she interviewed the same way Arthur Golden ""imagined"" himself into the real life of the geisha he interviewed. Then Lisa Taddeo wrote this novel and sold it as nonfiction.At least Golden's work was technically sold as ""historical fiction."" I would not think ""Three Women"" was so utterly terrible if the book had been sold as fiction. But then again, if this book had been sold as fiction, no one would have read it. ""Three Women"" hit the New York Times bestseller list. I read the first 40 pages carefully. Taddeo is an excellent writer, and her sentences are good. The content, however, is incredibly sloppy. Again: because it's written as a novel, but sold as nonfiction. Long passages of this book are written in second person. There are zero facts, zero data, and zero research anywhere in this book. ""Three Women"" is laughably bad. I skim-read to page 150. Then I DNF'd because this book is intolerable. It's too massively ignorant to even skim-read. This book is the conventional wisdom of the patriarchy masquerading as ""something new."" The book is supposed to be about women and their ""desire,"" but it's really a novel detailing the sad, grim lives of three able-bodied, white, heterosexual, middle-class American women. Saddest of all, the narrative is actually Lisa Taddeo's worldview and opinions being presented as ""fact."" This book essentializes gender. It reduces women to stereotypes. It reduces men to stereotypes. ""Three Women"" is like reading Lisa Taddeo's memoir, but a memoir in which she imagines herself living through the events that the three women she ""profiles"" lived through. One star. Recommended for no one. I'm so glad this was a library borrow. I would hate myself if I had wasted money on this.For anyone who would like to read an *actual* nonfiction book about female desire, I highly recommend ""What Do Women Want?

I really enThe 2015 middle grade contemporary novel, ""Crenshaw,"" by Katherine Applegate, is an extremely realistic and surprisingly dark little book. I really enjoyed it.At just over 25,000 words long, this book is quite short. The length and the prose style are ideal for middle grade readers ages 8-12. Applegate is an award-winning author of children's books, and her prose in ""Crenshaw"" is streamlined, pithy, and highly accessible.The main character of this novel (and first-person point of view protagonist) is a young boy named Jackson. The story begins during the summer before he starts fifth grade. The novel is a short, slice-of-life story that follows the events of Jackson's life during a few days in the summer. His home life has taken a turn for the worst, and his parents are not behaving responsibly.**spoilers ahead, please beware**The real villain of this book is never -- ever -- named in the story, and that is the internalized ableism of Jackson's mother and father. During the many flashback scenes in the book, the reader learns that when Jackson was in first grade, his father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Jackson's father lost his job working construction, and refused to seek any help, either for himself or for his family. In reality, (and these details are never mentioned in the book), an adult in the United States who is diagnosed with MS can sign up for Medicaid, food stamps, housing assistance, home aide assistance, and other necessities. This is especially true if the person who is diagnosed with MS is also a head of household, as Jackson's father is. But instead of seeking out ""charity,"" Jackson's father has decided that he would rather become homeless than accept any help, and his wife has always agreed with him. In order to keep their able-bodied, self-reliant dignity, Jackson's parents chose to live in their minivan with six-year-old Jackson and his baby sister for several weeks (this was right after Jackson finished first grade). When the parents finally found work, they were able to rent a place to live again.Three years have passed since that frightening time, and Jackson's parents have fallen on hard times again. His mother has been laid off, and his father is struggling to find work. Jackson's parents have stopped paying the rent, and they are being evicted. Once again, Jackson's father is insistent that he does not accept ""charity"" from people, and Jackson's mother remains a cheerful, Stand By Your Man lady. She has decided she will happily live in the minivan again with her family, if that's what her husband wants, and Jackson overhears enough of his parents' conversations to know what lies in his future. He is scared and upset, and suffering in silence. His parents are cheerfully determined that they would rather be homeless than accept anyone's help, and they both consider Jackson to be a ""good"" child; Jackson doesn't feel able to share his ""bad"" feelings with his parents. In his state of extreme distress, Jackson begins seeing his imaginary friend, Crenshaw, again. Crenshaw is a giant, fun-loving cat. He appears to Jackson in order to provide comfort and strength during this entirely stressful and traumatizing time in Jackson's life.The novel doesn't end with Jackson's family being homeless, but it doesn't end with a Happily Ever After, either. Instead, there is a brief reprieve. On the day they are evicted, Jackson's parents are given jobs running a music store that has a small apartment above it. For the next month, the family will be living in the apartment while Jackson's parents run the store. The novel ends there. The parents' internalized ableism is never dealt with in the story. Neither is the fact that all of the trauma they're putting Jackson through is entirely preventable. In that way, this book is very similar to another 2018 middle grade contemporary novel I read recently, ""Where the Watermelons Grow,"" by Cindy Baldwin. That book was more than twice the length of ""Crenshaw,"" and it read more like a Young Adult novel than middle grade. I intensely disliked Baldwin's book, but I find Applegate's novel easily worthy of five stars. Here is why:1. Jackson's parents are kind. Applegate humanizes them, and the prose makes her empathy for her characters clear. Applegate wrote these parents to be entirely sympathetic, and they are. Despite their irresponsible decisions due to their internalized ableism, these are decent, hardworking, and incredibly loving people. The love in this family is palpable. 2. Many parents make their children suffer due to their internalized ableism; writing this problem into a book is entirely realistic. By the end of ""Crenshaw,"" Jackson's father has not yet signed up for any disability assistance. But in ""Where the Watermelons Grow,"" the main character's mother is locked up against her will in a mental ward. ""Crenshaw"" does not feature medical doctors, or anyone else within the medical or social services establishment who can provide a harsh reality check for Jackson. This is a very different situation than the ending in ""Where the Watermelons Grow.""3. The two novels have very different timelines. ""Crenshaw"" takes place over a few days. ""Where the Watermelons Grow"" takes place over a few weeks. As a longer work with a much more drawn-out ending, ""Where the Watermelons Grow"" featured many pages of narrative aftermath that should have provided an explanation for the unnecessary suffering the main character's parents had put the protagonist through. Cindy Baldwin chose to resolve her main character's situation by eating some local honey, rather than focus on the need for better communication between the parents and their child. The resolution in ""Crenshaw"" is entirely focused on the fact that Jackson's parents need to communicate better with Jackson, and as I mentioned in point #2, Jackson does not yet have contact with any medical doctors or social workers in regards to his father's disability. 4. The entire middle section of ""Crenshaw"" details the time that Jackson spent living in his family's minivan when he was six. The novel's clear purpose is to illuminate the plight of homeless children in the United States, and to open up a space of understanding and empathy for them. The book does that very well. *****After finishing ""Crenshaw,"" I do not believe that Applegate actually knows anything about MS, other than the general, vague information that most able-bodied people know. Nothing in this novel led me to believe that Applegate had researched MS for this book, or that she understands anything about living with MS as a head of household.I think Applegate chose to give Jackson's father MS simply as a plot device to make the father and mother more sympathetic. In reality, a great many homeless children in the U.S. are not homeless because their parents are disabled or diagnosed with a disease like MS. Sadly, many homeless American children have parents who are alcoholics and drug addicts. And many people -- including many American readers -- have zero sympathy for adults like that. It was also clear to me as I read that Applegate herself has never been homeless before. While she did complete research on homelessness for this book, the text really read that way: as an adult writer who has completed research in order to write about a dark topic they have never experienced before. That isn't a bad thing, and I'm not saying that Applegate did anything wrong in writing this book. I'm just saying, as someone who has suffered from homelessness and homeless parents in childhood myself, this wasn't an own voices book, and that was obvious to me as I read. I still think ""Crenshaw"" is an excellent book. I highly recommend this novel to middle grade readers and readers of any age who enjoy reading middle grade books. The author did a wonderful job of showing the love within Jackson's family, and humanizing them throughout the story. Sadly, depicting such love and humanity is something many other authors fail to do when they write about people who are economically disadvantaged. As an author, Applegate clearly has a tremendous amount of empathy for the homeless, the disadvantaged, and ""the working poor,"" and that empathy is apparent on every page of this book.Five stars.

It follows the journey of a young girl and her family during the Partition of India in 1947.Surprisingly, East and West Pakistan are never named in the book, nor is East Pakistan featured on the large, two-page map which is prominently displayed on the front and back covers. Hiranandani included an Author's Note at the end of the book, to provide the reader with some general historical information about Partition, but East and West Pakistan aren't named in the Author's Note, either. I thought that was a shame. ""The Night Diary"" was published, marketed, and sold as middle grade fiction, but I would feel much more comfortable calling this book Young Adult. I also highly doubt I would have understood this book had I read it as an actual child (age 8-17), because I didn't know anything about Partition until I went to college. While the violence in ""The Night Diary"" is understated, quiet, and narrated to the reader days after it has been witnessed by the main character (rather than appearing in the novel as immediate scene), as an adult, I know very well the level of atrocity this book is actually dealing with. ""The Night Diary"" carefully skirts around the worst horrors of Partition in order to be suitable for an 8-12 year-old reader. As a college student, I'll never forget the moment I learned about the butchery that took place during Partition, and the fact that train cars full of body parts would show up on both sides of the border, such as train cars full of women's breasts. A million people or more, of all ages, were brutally killed during Partition. Many of the victims were tortured and dismembered before being murdered, or killed while having their limbs ripped off or their bodies split in half.""The Night Diary"" features no such torture, butchery, or graphic violence like that. But as an adult reader, what made this book so gripping to me is that I know full well the real history of what took place, and what this young girl is bearing witness to in this middle grade book.Had I not known anything about Partition, I think I would have found this book pretty dull. It takes the narrative a long time for any real action to begin. And even after the family's journey begins, the pacing slows down again, more than once. I don't think I was a very patient reader when I was 8-12 years old, and I probably would have DNF'd this book as a kid.But as an adult reader, this book was very good, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who enjoys YA historical fiction. ""The Night Diary"" has *far* less violence and horror in it than Ruta Sepetys's masterful YA historical novel, ""Salt to the Sea"" (2016). But if you loved ""Salt to the Sea,"" or you enjoy any kind of fiction that deals with Partition, then I would highly recommend ""The Night Diary."" This book is very emotional and deeply moving. It's sad, it's hopeful, it's dark. I truly enjoyed it.Five stars.

Honestly, if I hadn't been reading a bunch of middle grade books solely for research, I would have DNF'd this by page 100. The entire middle section of this book is a slog. There's a whole lot of nothing that happens before the action picks up again at the very end.I'm giving it two stars because I did learn things from this book; for the purposes of doing my writerly research, this book was useful to me. I'll highlight my list of what this book taught me below, for those who are interested. For me personally though, this book is a one-star read. I didn't enjoy anything that I read. I intensely disliked this novel.**please beware of unmarked spoilers ahead, thanks**Things I Learned from ""Serafina and the Black Cloak,"" an incomplete list:1. This book reads like YA fiction. It's verbose, and the word count is quite long (overly long) for middle grade (20,000-50,000 words). I'm not sure exactly what the word count is for this book, but it's 293 pages total, and the word count per page seemed typical of most YA books I've read. This book felt like it was around 70,000 words long. I know the first Harry Potter book was 77,000 words, but HP reads fast. This book really dragged.2. Mr. Thorne's attacks on Serafina and another young girl named Clara at the very beginning of the book (pg 16-23) were described in a way that felt like I was reading about sexual assault, or a man trying to rape two young girls. The scene was really drawn out and read very rapey to me. I wasn't a fan. But now that I know that over half of all middle grade books are self-selected and purchased by adult women, I can understand why this kind of violence is appealing in middle grade books. The fear of rape is a standard fear among women as well as young girls, so novels that evoke that fear sell a lot better in the market.3. Serafina is born special. She is Not Like Other Girls, and her father even says this in direct dialogue on page 57: ""It's plain to see that you're not like other girls, but you're not misshapen or hideous like them nuns said you'd be."" Serafina was born with four toes on each foot, and a unique bone structure regarding her clavicles (she can bend her arms to fit into any space big enough for her head). As the reader learns at the very end of the book, Serafina's mother is a magical shapeshifter who can turn into a mountain lion. The text makes it clear that Serafina is incredibly beautiful and very thin (glamorously thin); she is athletic and agile; she also wears unique, boyish clothes and has singular ""amber"" eyes.I would like to take a moment to point out that there are other girls in the world who have been born with four toes on each foot, and girls who have been born ""misshapen or hideous,"" and they are *still* girls. They are still ""like other girls"" because they are all girls. Being born in a non-normative body doesn't make someone ""not like other girls."" Also, we never make this statement about boys. We would never look at a boy born with eight toes, for instance, and tell him he was ""not like other boys."" Serafina's father would never tell his handsome, athletic son that he was ""not like other boys"" just because he had four toes on each foot rather than five. The Not Like Other Girls statement is deeply rooted in misogyny, and evoking it in a story is always incredibly patriarchal. Much is made in this novel of Serafina being Not Like Other Girls. This language comes up a few times in the text, including a scene on page 168, when Serafina is spending the night in her love interest's room, a boy her own age named Braeden. Internalized misogyny is so deeply rooted in the American public that I can absolutely understand why Not Like Other Girls was stamped so heavily into this middle grade book. But it still really pisses me off to read it in fiction like this.4. Serafina has no female friends. See trope #3.5. Serafina's only friend in the book is Braeden, the love interest. See trope #3 and 4. 6. Serafina saves the day. Because badass. Because she is physically strong as well as beautiful and brave. Because Not Like Other Girls. 7. A lot of the book develops Serafina's friendship and tingly-hopeful-maybe-something-more-there feelings for Braeden. A lot of YA fiction develops a love story this way: the characters interact with zero admission from either party that they have any romantic feelings for each other. Then they suddenly kiss or have vague-sex on the page, out of nowhere. The blooming ""relationship"" between Serafina and Braeden read like a YA fantasy love story for that reason.8. Braeden is the heir to the Biltmore Estate, i.e. he's super wealthy and a ""real catch"" for a girl who lives in the basement and spends her days chasing rats (both mundane and supernatural, since she calls Mr. Thorne ""a rat"" throughout the book). People love the Cinderella trope, and I'm not knocking it, only pointing out that this book utilizes it quite effectively. 9. The combination of tropes really makes this book super successful: a beautiful girl who is Born Special and is repeatedly tagged as Not Like Other Girls meets a rich, handsome boy who is her First-Ever and Only Friend, as well as probable love interest. She soon realizes the boy's life is in danger and willingly, eagerly sacrifices her own life to save him (which is stated explicitly on page 224). Then the Born Special girl Saves the Day, after which she humbly downplays what she has done as the entire community celebrates her achievement.10. Before Serafina puts her sacrifice-myself plan into action to Save the Day, she puts on a dress for the first time in her life, brushes her hair, and makes herself ""as pretty as she could"" (pg 227). This is such a crucial genre trope in YA, and in books marketed specifically to female readers, that I will quote it at length:""Serafina put on the beautiful, dark maroon winter gown that Braeden had given her the night before.The intricate black brocade corset felt tight around her chest and back, and she worried that when it came time to fight, it would restrict her. She twisted and turned to test her freedom of movement. The long skirt hung heavily around her legs, but even as unfamiliar as the girls' clothing felt, she couldn't help but be taken by it. It felt almost magical to be putting on a dress for the first time in her life. The material was fine and feminine and soft, like nothing she'd ever worn before. She felt like one of the girls in the books she read -- like a *real* girl, with a real family, with brothers and sisters, and a mother and father, and friends."" (pg 226)What's jarring about this line is that Serafina has grown up with ""a real father"" her entire life, and she *does* have a good friend -- Braeden -- when this line appears in the text. I'm not bashing on femininity here, all I'm saying is that it's really sad to see that ""correctly"" following gender roles is so strongly tied to having a family and friends, even in a fantasy middle-grade book published in 2015. Paragraphs like the one above just give me a really sad, sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. *****In sum, I can understand why this novel is incredibly popular with girls ages 8-12, with fans of YA fiction, and with all of the adult readers who adore this book. The tropes used in this story are enduring and deeply appealing. Sadly, ""Serafina and the Black Cloak"" just wasn't for me....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 24, 2019","Dec 06, 2019","Nov 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23507745-serafina-and-the-black-cloak

This book is adult literary fiction marketed and sold as a middle grade novel, and I find it entirely baffling that anyone would ever put this novel into an actual ten, eleven, or twelve-year-old's hands.If you enjoy adult literary fiction with magical realism and extremely unlikeable, loathsome characters, then I would recommend ""Hurricane Child"" as your next read.This book features a lot of violence. Within the first twenty pages, the main character, a twelve-year-old girl named Caroline, is stoned at school, and then Caroline picks up even bigger rocks and throws them at the bullies. All of this is written in active scene. Later in the book, Caroline knocks over a security guard, kicks him while he is down, breaks his nose, runs away, and then laughs and laughs about what she has done. Caroline is full of violence and rage because her mother has abandoned her, and her father is a dysfunctional asswipe of a human being, but this absolutely does *not* excuse Caroline's nasty, sadistic behavior. Her parents are both disgusting people who behave atrociously, and the story never calls them out on their lying, their concealment of their secondary secret families, the mother's abandonment of her daughter, or their overall terrible parenting. Instead, the main character is chastised at school for being ""self-absorbed,"" and the novel presents that assessment as the truth.The magical realism felt awkwardly tacked on. I don't think it added anything to this bizarre, nonsensical story.I'm glad to see LGBTQIA+ stories being published in middle grade fiction, but ""Hurricane Child"" is an absolute mess of a book.

In this book, the twelve-year-old first-person protagonist, Della, witnesses her mother's medication begin to fail, and then watches her mother descend into a non-functioning state, a situation that grows increasingly scary until finally, the mother is hauled off in an ambulance against her will and locked up in a mental ward until her medication can be adjusted.I recently wanted to do some research on modern middle grade novels, and I admit that this book's topic really spoke to me because my own mother is mentally ill, and I have long suspected she has paranoid schizophrenia. Unlike Della's mother, my mother's condition remains undiagnosed, though I did witness her locked up in a mental ward against her will when I was Della's age in this book: 12/almost 13.""Where the Watermelons Grow"" should have been a home run for me; I expected to love this book. But within thirty pages, it was clear to me that the author was not writing from her own experiences. After reading the acknowledgments, I understand that Baldwin chose to write about schizophrenia in order to publish a novel, not because she had any personal experience with schizophrenic parents herself.The book really suffers for it. The presentation of Della's mother sometimes reads like my own experience with a schizophrenic parent: no one talks about what is wrong, no one even acknowledges there is anything ""wrong,"" everything is entirely secret, no one knows what to do or say, the sick person refuses all help and throws away their medicine, etc. etc. That was definitely what I have experienced as a child, as a teenager, and as an adult. My experience with a parent's mental illness has been relentless, frightening, and sickening.But Baldwin put Della into a completely different situation. By the end of the book, it's made abundantly clear that Della's mother, Suzanne, didn't fall into this ""secrecy, shame, and ableist dysfunction"" category at all. Suzanne's family was entirely open and helpful concerning her mental health, and she sought and received help for her disorder. Suzanne received a clear diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia after her first child (Della) was born. Suzanne's husband, her husband's parents, and her own parents were supportive and loving, helping her through getting a diagnosis, receiving correct medication, and supporting her through the ordeal of being a new mother. Suzanne also had close friends who helped her a lot, and she lives within a tight-knit community that cares for her and her family very much.Ten years after Suzanne's second child is born (and Della is now 12 years old), Suzanne's medication starts failing. Even though Della's father could have stepped in and said, ""Honey, something is not right, let's visit the doctor,"" and quickly discovered that her medication had been failing for months, the father ignores the growing problems and advocates secrecy. Della, a timid, meek, and completely believable bookworm of a child, goes along with her father's plan, until the mother finally gets to the point that she is screaming, raving, hitting, and biting (all of which takes place off-scene, pg 183). That is when the father finally calls for an ambulance to haul the mother away. The book should have strongly addressed the bad parenting choices that went into this breakdown. Instead, the story ignores that point. The novel focuses on Della's reaction to her mother's illness, and closes with Della needing to be a better person in order to cope.I'm not against giving twelve-year-olds the message that they can control their own emotions and reactions to things, but I also needed the book to point out that the ADULTS in this story -- Della's mother and father -- seriously f*cked up. They behaved irresponsibly and were clearly in the wrong. Suzanne should have visited a doctor to have her medication altered, and if she was too sick to be able to do that, then her husband should have taken her to the doctor. He should have recognized that her medication was failing long before Suzanne descended into yelling and biting people. Della's father read like someone who had no idea what was wrong with his wife, and his ableist secrecy and shame for the bulk of the novel made no sense when the full extent of Suzanne's history was spelled out later in the text. In the end, I did not like either of Della's parents. The father, especially, behaved badly, and he owed Della a big apology by the end of the book -- an apology that never arrived. Della's mother never apologizes to her, either. At the end of the novel, Suzanne is still so sick that she is caught in her delusional paranoia, so the reader never sees Suzanne return to a healthy mental state in order to be able to apologize for ignoring her illness and refusing all help, long before things got so bad.I just really hated both of these parents. If they had been killed in the ambulance ride to the mental ward, I would not have been sad.Della herself is so meek and mild that she is easy to feel sorry for. But the novel is hardly ever written in immediate, active scene. The vast bulk of this book is interior exposition and long, long stretches of backstory. Della thinks to herself, and thinks to herself, and thinks to herself some more. It makes the novel boring to read and leads to skipping entire pages and sections of text, because nothing new is happening. Della simply ruminates over the past, or summarizes material that should have been written in active scene, but Baldwin wrote the material as backstory instead.Many of the sentences in this book are quite long and ponderous. Baldwin tends to let her similes go overboard, with unnecessary prepositional phrases that should have been cut, especially for a middle grade novel. Here are two examples:""I hugged the Emily Dickinson book to me, feeling it hard against my chest just like a second heart, and tried not to let my cheeks flame as red as the cherry tomatoes dripping off the vines in the garden out behind our house."" (pg 46)""His minute-long visit had added something different to the jumble of feelings inside of me: swirling through the worry and the sadness and the knotting in my insides was a tiny springtime bloom, like the finger-long purple crocuses that popped up all around our front porch step in February, before the sun had even come back into the sky."" (pg 213)Overall, I did not enjoy or recommend this book. I did like Della's character, and I liked that this book is a love letter to the South. But Della's parents were incredibly irresponsible. Della went through a very traumatic situation in this book that was *entirely* preventable, but NO ONE in the text ever pointed that out, or took any action to end it. As a middle grade novel, Della's grim, unrelenting suffering was gratuitous and unfair, and it was entirely caused by her parents' choices, rather than her reactions to her mother's descent into delusional paranoia. The author's choice not to advocate within the text for more open communication about mental illness within the family, and specifically between Della and her parents, was a missed opportunity to educate the reader about psychiatric conditions. After finishing this book, I believe that Della ought to be seeing a counselor, and instead, this book shows Della drinking a jar of local honey to ""heal"" her emotions, rather than seeing a therapist. But I truly believe Della would need therapy by the end of this book. I think ""Where the Watermelons Grow"" is a book that was probably written with good intentions, but which still ended up being an incredibly damaging portrayal of how families cope with mental illness. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 21, 2019","Nov 24, 2019","Nov 21, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36341193-where-the-watermelons-grow

The story narrates the childhood and coming-of-age of a Chinese-Canadian boy named Peter who ""knows he is really a girl."" The book is a transgender bildungsroman set amidst the misogynistic and transphobic nightmare of a traditionalist Chinese family. The novel is narrated in first-person. In elementary school, Peter and a group of his male friends sexually assault a little girl named Shauna. The boys violate her under a set of bleachers. ""Roger dragged Shauna there by the arm. Our feet crunched on the gravel. We herded her toward the back of the hollow, blocking the entrance with our bodies."" (pg 17)Shauna cries throughout the violation. ""Not like I cried, not the way I heaved and sobbed into [Peter's sister] Adele's chest in a closet. Soundless tears, as though crying were impolite."" (pg 17)Shauna is alone, surrounded, and trapped. A boy named Roger tells Shauna to lift up her skirt. ""She raised the hem of her skirt by the corners, not quickly, not slowly. With a knowing I hadn't expected. Like she'd done this before."" (pg 17)When I read those sentences, my heart stopped. I just could not f*cking BELIEVE that the novel would give a terrified little girl being sexually assaulted a description like that: that she is lifting her skirt ""knowingly,"" as if she had ""done it before.""Let me insert some reality into this moment: whether a human being is five (or six, or seven) years old like Shauna, or fifty-five years old or eighty-five years old, people of any gender who are being raped and tortured will often do what their attackers tell them to do. It is a basic function of terror and an aspect of survival.Small children are especially prone to doing what they are told to do. Especially when they are in a terrifying situation like the sexual assault being described here. But Peter ascribes a ""knowing"" willingness to Shauna in this scene. And the assault continues from there:""Roger's eyes fixed to the spot. 'Peter, pull down her underwear.'I looked into Shauna's eyes. My hands on her small hipbones. I tried to tell her that I was sorry. That we were both victims. I wanted her to see who I really was. The one who took a stone in the back. The one who combed his sisters' hair. In her eyes, I could see only the reflections of four attackers, four boys in that dead, marble blue, like you could see the sky right through her.""Whose job is it to wordlessly understand that Peter is a victim, according to the narrative voice of this book? The sexual-assault-victim's job, of course. Right at the moment when she is being violated. Peter wants Shauna to see that he is a victim of the bullies just as much as she is. The ""bullies"" here are Peter's school friends, the group he spends time with daily. While I do understand that many bullies *are* the victims of bullies, the LAST place I want to see that being pointed out is while a little girl is being sexually assaulted in-scene by four little boys. I cannot handle the fact that this novel is equalizing Peter's trauma as a little boy who has NEVER been sexually assaulted with a little girl who is currently being sexually assaulted in-scene.If you are the type of reader who finds prose like this completely appropriate, and you agree with Peter's adult-looking-back-on-his-life narrative voice, and you believe that being the victim of sexual assault by a group of boys is equal to being a little boy who suffers the ""roughhouse play"" of his elementary-school friends, then you will most likely enjoy this novel a lot more than I ever could.While I found this scene horrifying enough, it's not even finished. The author continues to drag out Shauna's violation this way: ""There. Shauna's ankles bound together. A bald, pink wound.Shauna's legs trembled and then buckled. She hit the ground on her knees. Her skirt pooled protectively over her thighs. Better to be one of us, better to be standing on this side than kneeling and weeping in the gravel while they leer, that was all my father wanted from me, to be one of them, to be a king.But I belonged in her place, holding something so stunning they'd steal for it, they'd stare into its hot center even as it blinded them."" (pgs 17-18)Let me be clear: these four little boys are not being ""blinded"" by the ""stunning"" sight of Shauna's vulva and vagina. They are performing an act of domination over her. They are not ""stealing"" anything from her or anyone else in this moment. They are subjugating a victim in an act of sexual assault. This act has nothing to do with Shauna as a person. It also has nothing to do with her individual vulva and vagina. Rape culture presents rape in this way: that women and their vaginas are so alluring to men that men cannot help themselves but to attack and rape women. According to rape culture, when women are raped, they have a ""knowing"" awareness of what is happening to them; even little girls as young as Shauna ""know"" that their vaginas are magical and that boys willingly want to ""blind"" themselves by looking at the ""bald, pink wounds"" between their legs and raping them.Peter might be a little boy in this scene, but the narrative first-person voice is an adult voice looking back on this childhood, narrating the events of his life for the reader. Even as a transgender adult who has become a woman, Peter's narrative voice is steeped in rape culture.When Peter gets home that night, Shauna's mother has called his parents. His parents know what Peter and his friends did to Shauna. Peter's mother yells at him in Cantonese (which Peter doesn't speak or understand), and then his mother slaps him once in the face. She immediately walks out of the room. Peter's father rewards him by smiling approvingly and then forcing Peter's two sisters to share a room so Peter can have his own bedroom. (pg 19)I am someone who completely supports the LGBTQIA+ community and sympathizes with transgender children and transgender adults in all ways.But when the book portrays a transgender boy participating in a gang-rape against a little girl, and then demands that the reader equalize Peter's trauma ""earning his bully credentials with his bros"" with their gang-rape victim's trauma, I just fucking can't with this.Fuck this book. Fuck this messaging. DNF. One star.

Tucker, is a great read for anyone who enjoyed the 2003 romantic comedy film, ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,"" starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. In that movie, two white, able-bodied, upper-middle class, physically-gorgeous heterosexual adults meet for the first time and then treat each other like garbage for a few weeks in the process of falling in love. That is the plot of ""The Simple Wild.""The book uses extreme gender stereotypes (Calla is a vapid, entitled, spoiled-princess city-girl obsessed with her appearance and little else, and Jonah is a tall, buff, good-with-his-hands hunk of man-meat) to create a Pride-and-Prejudice-esque/negative-first-impressions romantic comedy set in ""wild""/small-town Alaska. The setting was my favorite part of this book, next to the cruel barbs and zingers Calla and Jonah hurl at each other, which definitely made me laugh. ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" made me laugh, too. Watching beautiful people treat each other like sh*t is humorous to me because I know nothing really hurts these people; their money and privilege cushions them so much from life's cruelties, and they're so entitled, mean, and sh*tty that I don't relate to them as human beings but as the Plot Puppets they really are.As a romantic comedy about overcoming bad first impressions, this book is quite good. It made me laugh, the prose is lean and well-written, and the boring stuff was easy to skim so I could get to the end.I can't say that I actually enjoyed the content at all, or enjoyed my time with these characters. I closed the book feeling like I'd just watched some stand-up comedy that used ableism, racism, fat-phobia, or some other nastiness to crack ugly jokes and get me to laugh, and then I felt really gross afterwards for having laughed. ""The Simple Wild"" felt gross in the same way, like I got coated in a layer of slime that I need to hurry up and scrub off. The beginning of ""The Simple Wild"" really drags until Jonah arrives on page 57, and the plot finally kicks into gear. Jonah wastes no time calling Calla a ""high-maintenance little ass"" (pg 64) and a ""real, live Barbie doll"" (pg 118), before this delightful dialogue exchange occurs in a grocery store parking lot --""He gives me a sideways glance, amusement in his eyes. 'Fake hair, fake face, fake nails...' His eyes dip to my chest before flashing away. 'Is anything on you real?'My jaw drops. '*These* are not fake!' And I've never had anyone insinuate otherwise. They're not even particularly impressive.'I don't care one way or the other.'"" (pg 118)^^Oh, that Jonah. What a charmer, huh?Though I honestly hated Calla so much by that point, I was *glad* he was being such a sh*t to her. Did I mention the slimy feeling I had when I finished the book? Yeah, that.Calla, like many romance heroines, describes every woman's body in detail throughout the book, making it clear that she is always ranking herself against every other female around her, regardless of age. For instance, here is how Calla describes a random woman she meets in the grocery store, who appears only briefly (in two highly unimportant moments) in the whole book --""My face is twisted with disgust when an older Alaska Native woman wearing an oversized New York Knicks sweatshirt and a navy-and-orange floral pink headscarf over short, gray hair sidles her cart up to Jonah. [...] Her face reminds me of Agnes's, though age and weight has made her cheeks heavy and her wrinkles much more prominent. She's also short like Agnes. I'd put her at five foot one, which makes the height difference between her and Jonah almost comical."" (pg 110)And here is how Calla describes a 12-year-old girl named Mabel (Agnes's daughter) in a later scene in Agnes's kitchen --""I find a teenaged girl facing me, long, glossy hair the color of espresso pulled into a messy, off-kilter ponytail, her inky black eyes sparkling with curiosity. [...] She kicks off her muddy boots. [...] Mabel's face splits into a wide grin that rivals her mother's. Her face is not as round as Agnes's, I note. But she certainly has the same deeply set, hooded eyes, only larger."" (pg 133)A little later, Mabel leaves the kitchen and returns, and Calla describes her again when she reappears --""Mabel saunters into the kitchen, changed into black leggings and a plain but fitted white T-shirt that shows off narrow hips and the small buds of breasts. Long, poker-straight hair hangs halfway down her back, recently brushed. Her innocent eyes flitter quickly at our faces before settling on Jonah's to linger."" (pg 141)^^Mabel might have the beginnings of breasts, but the 26-year-old Calla's are obviously way better; Jonah even thought they might be fake, after all. I find Calla's POV and descriptive details deeply unsettling, to say the least.Here is how Calla describes another random woman who appears only once in the book --""I try not to gape as I take in those mile-long legs clad in blue jeans and her long, golden-blonde tendrils of hair, damp from the rain and yet still falling around her shoulders in a natural sexy beach wave. She has lively teal-blue eyes surrounded by a fringe of lashes that are thick and long, but naturally so. Her nose is dainty, her lips are full, and while her cheekbones may not do much for her, the rounded shape of her face is flattering. I'd put her in her early thirties, with a fresh girl-next-door vibe. Not a stitch of makeup touches her face."" (pg 278) ""[...] she reaches up to smooth her long fingers -- with bare, neatly trimmed nails -- over [Jonah's] beard"" (pg 279).Over and over, Calla gives thorough, sexualized, objectifying descriptions of every woman she meets. This is in stark contrast to how Calla treats the male characters, including her own father, who is one of the main characters of the book. Here is all Calla has to say to describe her estranged father, who she meets for the first time on her trip to Alaska --""His wavy hair still hangs a touch too long, like something from the 1970s, but the brown has been mostly replaced by gray. Where his skin used to be taut and smooth, age has carved deep lines and crevices. He's wearing [...] jeans, hiking boots, and a layer of checkered flannel."" (pg 82)Here is how those descriptive word counts compare:Rando-Native woman/minor character: 80 words.Tween-girl Mabel/somewhat-minor character: 119 words.Blonde bombshell/minor character: 119 words. Calla's dad/main character: 51 words.I just pulled three random female side characters to compare with the father's descriptive word count; I had plenty of options to choose from.As the male lead in a romance, Jonah's muscular body is described in detail, though the details of his genitalia are not given. This book isn't erotica, but the less-explicit romance-positive-prose, which doesn't go into details about a man's penis size (or even discuss it at all). Women have their breast size detailed, but men are allowed their masculine privacy when it comes to their man-parts.Around page 200, the Calla & Jonah Show really begins, and the couple verbally spar with each other for many hilarious scenes. Then the book slows down and gets boring again, as the domestic fiction part of the story becomes the main plot at the end. I was able to finish the book because I skimmed and skipped sections. I would recommend this book to fans of Colleen Hoover. The overall content and storytelling style was much the same, though I do think K.A. Tucker's prose is much stronger than Hoover's. Two stars. Not the worst book I've ever read.

Beginning with 2006's initial novel of the same name, the series follows the lives of four girls – Spencer Hastings, Hanna Marin, Aria Montgomery and Emily Fields. The novels have appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list.""They were also turned into a hit TV show, which aired on ABC Family from 2010 to 2017.I was in a Barnes & Noble a few days ago (November 2019) and picked up a copy of ""Pretty Little Liars."" It sounded like the YA version of ""Big Little Lies,"" the bestselling adult novel and popular TV show. ""Pretty Little Liars"" also sounded like a millennial version of ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Melrose Place,"" and I wondered if it was a better version of Cecily von Ziegesar's ""Gossip Girl,"" which was first published in 2002, with a popular TV show that ran on the CW network from 2007 to 2012.When I began reading ""Pretty Little Liars,"" I thought the prose was quite good. The four main characters are well-drawn and engaging. Their situation felt compelling. On the last day of seventh grade, their best friend and leader of their friendship group, Alison DiLaurentis, went missing, and was never seen or heard from again. Now the girls are all in eleventh grade, and they start to receive cruel text messages from someone named ""A."" The texts expose the girls' secrets, and contain vicious attacks and threats. I thought, ""Well, the most obvious answer is that A is Alison, back from the dead somehow because they never found her body.""There are 286 pages in this book, and by page 166, I grew bored with the plotless storylines of three of the girls. I skipped ahead to see what the author did with Aria's storyline, the girl who is having an affair with her high school English teacher. The scenes grew increasingly ridiculous and unbelievable. By the time Aria bites the teacher's hand, drawing blood, before she runs out of his apartment, I put the book down. Everything had become too absurd in this book to continue.The beginning of the novel felt rooted in just enough reality to keep my attention. But after I put the book down and read some s for the final book in the series -- the 16th novel, ""Vicious,"" was published in 2014 -- I quickly discovered that ""Pretty Little Liars"" is not only hella unrealistic, but it completely demonizes people with mental illness. This book is ableist af, in addition to being melodramatic, absurd, plotless, and incredibly boring.DNF on page 166. Hard pass. Not recommended.**spoilers**It turns out that the assumption that A is Alison, alive and hell-bent on destroying the lives of her four former ""friends,"" is entirely correct. By the end of ""Vicious,"" it is made clear that Alison faked her own death on the last day of seventh grade, and was assisted in doing so by her mother. Four years pass by in which Alison has no contact with anyone in society, until her four former ""friends"" are in eleventh grade. That is when she finally begins her dastardly plan to destroy them all. In ""Pretty Little Liars,"" Alison and her mother arrange for the police to discover a dead body under a tennis court, a body that passes as Alison's body, and the four main characters attend a funeral for Alison in the second half of the first book.By the end of the 16th book, ""Vicious,"" Alison is finally ""locked up"" in a mental ward where she can no longer be a danger to anyone else. There is also a big plotline in which a girl in sixth grade willingly blinds herself in order to escape her rapist brother. Years later, she talks about how she is happy to be blind and has no regrets for the damage she inflicted on her own body in sixth grade. I don't even have enough what the f*cks for this content.I think ""Pretty Little Liars"" is disgusting. I read ""Gossip Girl"" in 2006 or 2007, and I didn't feel any urge to DNF. I certainly didn't feel any anger after I finished the book. While I didn't read anymore books in the Gossip Girl series, I didn't hate ""Gossip Girl."" But with ""Pretty Little Liars,"" I definitely feel hatred. The ableist content in this entire series is out of control. As Gollum would say, ""IT BURNS US.""I'm glad other readers have enjoyed what I personally think of as the sh*tf*ckery that is this book. It made a lot of money. The TV show was quite popular. I personally find the success of this series incredibly gross. I would rather drink a gallon of lead paint than ever look at this book again. Final note: I read the 2017 YA novel, ""One of Us Is Lying,"" by Karen McManus, earlier this year (2019), and now I know why that book was sold as ""The Breakfast Club meets Pretty Little Liars."" The entire premise of ""One of Us Is Lying"" was taken from Sara Shepard's book. It was eerie reading ""Pretty Little Liars"" and realizing how much of McManus's plot came from this book.A number of Goodreads ers gave ""One of Us Is Lying"" low ratings due to the fact that the ""dastardly Alison-stand-in character"" in that book suffered from depression, rather than whatever severe psychotic mental illness Alison is suffering from in ""Pretty Little Liars."" I find it laughable that some ers were so upset about what they perceived as ableist content in ""One of Us Is Lying,"" but those same ers gave glowing s to ""Pretty Little Liars,"" and went on to read all 16 books and gush about the series as a whole.I think McManus handled the Alison-villain character in ""One of Us Is Lying"" with much more sensitivity and reality than Shepard handled Alison's character in ""Pretty Little Liars."" I also appreciate that McManus made her ""villain"" a male, rather than the female demonic Other featured in Shepard's work. There's a heavy dose of misogyny in ""Pretty Little Liars"" that ""One of Us Is Lying"" didn't replicate. And ""One of Us Is Lying"" is a happy, hopeful book that sends incredibly positive messages about LGBTQ relationships. While there is a lesbian couple in ""Pretty Little Liars,"" it isn't handled in the same way at all.In summary, ""Pretty Little Liars"" is incredibly problematic and boring. The strong prose on display in the first half of the book is soon buried under the weight of unrealistic, plotless melodrama that serves the book's ableist storyline.

Listening to this audiobook is an exceptional experience.This is the fourth book I have read by Gladwell. I have enjoyed and 5-starred all of his work, and I consider ""Talking to Strangers"" to be his best book yet.

Woodiwiss, is recognized as one of the classic, groundbreaking, bestselling books in the romance genre.I have always disliked romance books. Intensely. I hated them as a teenager, and as an adult, I have to check my animosity in order to read romance novels for research.I don't regret checking out ""Shanna"" for research, but I wish I had put this book down by page 200. It is 666 pages long (in my mass market paperback edition); a fitting number, I think: the supposed mark of the devil, which makes me laugh a bit.The titular Shanna is a character archetype in romance, the heroine I recognize as ""the spoiled princess"" character: rich, gorgeous, selfish, and childish, Shanna is the consummate brat. She falls in love with a man who is also rich and gorgeous. This book is an enemies-to-lovers story. If you enjoy watching rich white people treat each other like sh*t while they fall in love, with a dash of smut on the side, then this book is for you.The first two sex scenes (starting on pg 65 in my copy, and the second starting on pg 165) are good smut scenes. The first sexual encounter delves into rape culture territory, so if that's a deal-breaker for you in this genre, I would not recommend this book. A lot of romance novels feature rape and rape-esque scenes with the male hero/male lover, and ""Shanna"" definitely courts that trope.The second sexual encounter is not rape-esque at all. I thought it was pretty good smut, especially smut that was first published in 1977. It was a well-described scene of genuine ""love-making,"" without humiliating the heroine in any way in order for the scene to be ""sexy."" The sex was tender and romantic. I appreciated seeing how romantic sex was depicted in a classic novel in the genre. I didn't have any problems with that second sex scene. Overall, the writing in this book is entirely verbose and frequently features purple prose. It's very tiresome to read. Skimming was essential. I could never have carefully-read this entire book. It's the kind of prose that just makes me want to die.While I appreciated this book for smut research, the novel is told through a white colonialist lens, and the racism and classism embedded in the prose and the story just got to be too much for me. I couldn't stomach it. I was told there was a good sex scene later in the book, so I kept going. But after the first two sexual encounters (cited above), the rest of the sex is the fade-to-black, off-scene kind. If anyone else reads this book for smut research, I'll warn you that the descriptive sex is finished by page 200, and the big emotional finale of the novel is when Shanna finally realizes she loves Ruark, and tells him so. This novel is like reading a modern hookup-culture romance before hookup culture was labeled as such. In other words, this is a story about two hot people who meet each other as perfect strangers, have a lot of hot hookup sex, and end up catching feelings for each other, because hotness and sex. If you're into that kind of thing, and enjoy historical romance, I'd recommend ""Shanna."" For me, I ended up disliking this book more and more with each page I turned. I really hated the book by the end. Intensely. It was another fitting reminder of everything I most hated about romance novels as a kid and as an adult.Two stars. Not the worst book I've ever read.

I devoured this book in two days; I couldn't put it down.This novel is categorized as adult fiction, but many people have marked it as a Young Adult/YA novel on Goodreads. The book features an omniscient narrative voice that centers on three main characters, one of whom is an eighteen-year-old girl named Casiopea. I saw this book tagged as YA so often that I mistakenly believed that this book *was* YA when I picked it up. But when I began reading, I quickly discovered that the prose doesn't read as YA at all. I went to the Goodreads page for this book, and found this quote from the author, confirming that this novel is adult fiction, not YA:""Book classification is a funny thing. Some reasons for having this out as an adult book have to do with the choices of my publisher, but also my own feeling that the omniscient tell-don't-show bits of the novel would make it feel distancing and unappealing for teenagers (plus some other stuff, which I won't go into right now). And sure, there's adults who also hate omniscient POVs, but teens seems to hate them more (at least judging by the ones I know). If new adult had taken off as a category maybe that might have worked as a shelf, but it doesn't seem to have done very well. Ultimately, I think it's a fantasy bildungsroman, which may be very appealing to adults who like a fairy tale feel but also cross-over well to older teenagers."" I was relieved to know that this book is classified as adult fiction; I definitely believe that is the correct market category for this novel.The prose in this book is spectacular. The worldbuilding is superb. The narrative voice is outstanding. I loved the characters. Even the antagonists in this story pulled at my heart and won me over.

Dao and her publisher for my free copy of this novel. The 2019 YA fantasy, ""Song of the Crimson Flower,"" by Julie C. Dao, features a fantasy-historical Vietnamese setting, and a large part of this novel is inspired by “The Boatman’s Flute,” a Vietnamese story. In an interview with Bookish (linked below), Dao was asked: ""When did you first come across 'The Boatman’s Flute'? Which elements of the original tale did you want to keep and which did you want to change or expand on?""Dao responded: ""I first learned about the story from my mom, who is Vietnamese, and liked it aside from the fact that the girl turns down the boatman for a very superficial reason: He’s ugly, and not handsome as she expected! I knew that if I kept that part, I would have a very hard time convincing readers to like Lan. So I changed the story a bit in terms of why she’s disappointed that the boatman is who he is. But I wanted to keep the bamboo flute and the girl’s remorse when she discovers what happened to the boatman. Everything else is original!""https://www.bookish.com/articles/juli...In the novel, Lan rejects Bao because he is poor. Bao is also an orphan who, so far as everyone knows at the start of the book, has no surviving family. It seems that Dao believes rejecting someone for being poor and lacking a family is not ""very superficial,"" but I disagree. I still think Lan was extremely unlikeable in this book, and I think people who reject others just because they are orphans or poor are extremely superficial. Lan's behavior was cruel in this book. People who reject orphans and poor people are cruel. I would never want to marry someone like Lan.Is Lan a realistic character? Yes, of course. Do I still think she is an asshole? Certainly. Lan does redeem herself in the book. Bao has to redeem himself, too. He is also not very likeable at the beginning of the novel. For years, Bao has been secretly coveting Lan and hoping to marry her, even though she is betrothed to the son of the wealthy family who is caring for Bao. It seems like such an underhanded thing for Bao to do, even though Bao's foster family are a bunch of assholes. Lan's biological family are a bunch of smug, rich assholes who only appreciate other smug, rich assholes. The only people who are at all likeable in this book are the poor fishermen and village folks who are kind to Bao; those characters appear only briefly in the first few pages. Everyone else in the first third of this book is a hot mess. I really wish Bao had married one of the poor, kind girls he interacts with at the start of the book, and not been so determined to get his foster-brother's betrothed (the rich and beautiful Lan) instead. Bao was as superficial as Lan at the start of the book. They both really annoyed me.""Song of the Crimson Flower"" reads as YA contemporary. It is largely focused on the romance between Lan and Bao. The story takes place after the events in Dao's first two novels, ""Forest of a Thousand Lanterns"" and ""Kingdom of the Blazing Phoenix."" Although Dao has stated that these three novels can all be read out of order, I do not believe that is wise. Not only are there massive spoilers in ""Song of the Crimson Flower"" for the first two books, but if readers have no prior investment in Dao's other characters, it would be easy to feel lost or uninterested when they appear in the third book. In particular, Xifeng’s ex-lover, Wei, plays a big role in this book. I was glad I'd read ""Forest of a Thousand Lanterns"" and remembered who he was. While Dao includes a description of him in the pages of ""Song of the Crimson Flower,"" I would not have been invested in him at all if I hadn't read the first book.A big theme of Bao's story is forgiveness. In particular, he forgives a character who was incredibly cruel and vicious to him in the first half of the book. Sadly, I felt like Bao's forgiveness of this character (at the end of the novel) was really unearned and actually harmful. I didn't agree with forgiving this person at all.I also thought Lan's family should have been called out on their behavior, too. They didn't believe that Lan, a young woman, should know anything about politics or history. They hid things from Lan and refused to let her participate in their community. They also kept her ignorant and trapped in their house. Their misogyny was really barbaric and shitty. A big part of the story is about showing the reader how much better off Lan is once she can get out of her family's house, see the world, talk to people, learn things, and participate in activities outside of the home. The text never calls attention to the fact that Lan's parents were wrong to keep her cooped up in the house, unable to learn anything about how the world works. In both instances, the text prioritizes ""loving,"" ""maintaining,"" and ""being with"" one's family above all else, even when one's family is cruel or outright abusive, as the case was with Bao. It's not a message I can get behind. The woman Bao ""forgives"" and accepts as his family at the end of this book deserved jail time or some kind of consequence for what she did in this book. And I wish Lan had at least called out her parents on their bullshit parenting choices, since they were the whole reason that Lan was an ignorant asshole at the start of the book. In the end, I am giving this book five stars because Julie C. Dao is an amazingly sweet human being, and I was truly delighted to read a YA fantasy set in a historical-fantasy Vietnam. I would love to read a realistic contemporary Vietnamese story from Dao. I hope she considers writing adult contemporary books in the future.I would recommend ""Song of the Crimson Flower"" to anyone who is craving a YA fantasy in which the hero and heroine are not soldiers, warriors, assassins, or sword-wielding, magic-wielding saviors. If you want to read about two ordinary teens who end up in a high-action battle, and if you are craving a fantasy in which magic is hardly present, then this quiet story will be a welcome respite from the explosions and violence commonly found in other YA fantasy books....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 13, 2019","Dec 08, 2019","Oct 13, 2019",,,view (with text),/book/show/32605126-song-of-the-crimson-flower

Here is the link to For Harriet's vlog about the TV show ""Shrill,"" for those interested --https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=... Based on the fact that ""Shrill"" has already become a TV show, I fully expected to love Lindy West's book. But I seriously did *not* love it. In fact, I would have DNF'd this within the first 35 pages, but I pushed myself through the first half of the book. I found it brutally painful. I wasn't learning anything, I did not enjoy the tone of her prose, and I felt like reading the book was a waste of my time. Then I attended my book club meeting, and what I learned from my book club members was incredibly shocking.My book club friends and acquaintances *loved* this book. They loved it for the same reasons that For Harriet's vlog praises the TV show: because Lindy West's work was their first encounter with understanding how much they hate and fear fat, and it was their first encounter with realizing how much they fat-shame people, and that fat-shaming people is cruel. By their own admission, these are all people who do NOT have fat friends or obese friends. They all admitted that they look at fat people with the most intense hatred and disgust, and reading ""Shrill"" made them realize that they have been acting like assholes their whole lives. Their ages range from 39-83. When I heard these women being honest about how much they fat-shame, I thought to myself, ""holy f*ck (!!!)... imagine not having any fat friends (!!!)... holy f*ck (!!!)... ALL of these women have zero fat friends (!!!)... what the hell???... these 'liberal, progressive' women refuse to be friends with fat people (!!!)... holy f*ck, this is so sad and so sickening... seriously, wtf wtf wtf (!!!)."" That just keeps running through my mind, over and over, whenever I think of that book club meeting.I have spent my life loving people who are fat and people who are obese. I have always had fat friends and obese friends. Recognizing fat-shaming is not news to me. I found Lindy West's tone to exactly match her title: shrill. Yelling at me about things I already know about. Teaching me nothing. I deeply resented her screechy tirades, smug class privilege, and lack of disability awareness. This book was a brutal chore to slog through. I would have rather reread the entirety of Naomi Wolf's ""The Beauty Myth"" (1990) than a single sentence from Lindy West.But my book club friends and acquaintances, and For Harriet, felt otherwise. They had never heard any information about the complete and utter sh*ttiness that is fat-shaming before. To them, Lindy West's book was a revelation. They *did* learn from this book. And again, all I could think was: ""holy f*ck.""If not for my book club meeting, I would have rated this book a one-star and DNF'd. After my book club meeting, I forced myself to skim-read the rest of the book. I would still give the book a one-star. I wish I had never read this book. But because of what I learned at my book club meeting, I would give the book 5 stars for allowing me to learn how utterly clueless people are, and about how much the liberal, progressive, granola-eating, Subaru-driving, hippie-loving, dog-loving, Hillary-voting people I interact with treat fat people like sh*t on the daily. And they actively discriminate against fat people and cultivate their friend group based on body size. (!!!!!) I find this SO horrifying, to the point that I wanted to yell at the meeting, ""Do we even live on the same planet???"" because I felt like an alien at the table. I'm glad that I know the truth now, but holy sh*t, what an awful, awful truth to learn. I would have never known the ladies I attend book club with fat-shame on this level had it not been for ""Shrill.""""Shrill"" is not a book I enjoyed. I think this book was written for thin, white, able-bodied, middle-class women who have a lot of race and class privilege and have never studied fat-shaming before. I'm really glad that this book exists for a target readership that would not otherwise be exposed to this information.As you might guess, everyone at my book club is a thin, white, able-bodied, middle-class woman with a lot of race and class privilege. As you might also guess, *no one* at that meeting liked the thought of examining their able-bodied privilege, class privilege, or race privilege. They were open to questioning their fat-shaming, and that is what Lindy West focuses her book on: the fact that misogyny and fat-shaming are both awful, and that the world would be a better place without misogyny and without fat-shaming. I totally support that message, even if ""Shrill"" wasn't a book that taught me anything. Because of the revelations I had during my book club meeting, wherein I finally ""felt"" what it is like to be a person who hates fat people, I'm bumping my personal one-star rating of ""Shrill"" up to 3 stars. I did ask everyone at the book club meeting if they had ever read Roxane Gay's ""Hunger"" (2017), or Wolf's ""The Beauty Myth,"" two 'mainstream' titles that deal with body size and its impact on women. They all answered ""no"" to both. I would personally recommend those two books instead of ""Shrill,"" but for many readers, ""Shrill"" would probably be the better choice. I'm just not the right audience for it....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 15, 2019","Oct 14, 2019","Sep 15, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29340182-shrill

But wow, does this book glamorize unhealthy adult women, unhealthy ideas about wholeness and love, and unhealthy relationships. It also demonizes therapy, which a lot of people benefit from. This novel adds to the many reasons some people already have to avoid seeking therapy. If you are a person who hates the idea of counseling and seeing a therapist, you will love ""Mud Vein."" The entire plot book of this book is the worst kind of Thought Experiment, where everything is so unrealistic that I kept thinking the main character was going to wake up any second in a psych ward to see someone in a white cap and gown saying, ""You forgot to take your meds today, Barbara."" This book is so starkly unrealistic, starting right on page one, that it is part of the writing style: unrealism upon unrealism upon unrealism. If you like that kind of thing, then this book is for you.**spoilers ahead**The main message of ""Mud Vein"" is that women need men to save them. According to this novel, women do not know their own minds, but a woman's ""soulmate"" will know her own mind, and know it better than the woman knows it herself.If you find that kind of messaging romantic, then you are going to love this book.Here is how the main character, Senna, summarizes what she has learned about her true love and soulmate, Isaac, by the end of the novel. Senna also reflects on why Isaac is so much better than her previous boyfriend, Nick, who was a ""great love"" but was not Senna's soulmate --""I didn't know I needed someone to dig into my heart and figure out why on some days I wanted to play, and why on others I craved solitude. I didn't even like it when he [Isaac] did it. It's a painful thing to look inside yourself and see the whys and the hows of your clockwork. You are a lot uglier than you think, plenty more selfish than you are ever likely to admit. So, you ignore what's inside of you. Thinking if you don't acknowledge it, it's not really there. Until someone unlikely comes along and cracks you. They see every dark corner, and they get it. And they tell you it's okay to have dark corners, instead of making you feel ashamed of them. Isaac wasn't afraid of my ugly. He rolled through the highs and lows with me. There was no judgment in his love. And all of a sudden there were fewer lows and more highs.Nick loved me enough to leave me alone. Isaac knew better than I knew me. I said I wanted to be left alone, he knew better. I said I wanted white, he knew better. He brightened me. He enlightened me. Because Isaac was my soulmate. Not Nick. Nick was just some great love. Isaac knew how to heal my soul."" (page 262)According to Senna, Isaac knew her better than she knew herself, and that knowledge allowed Isaac to ""heal her soul.""In the book, Isaac first meets Senna by inserting himself into Senna's life without asking and against her wishes, and this is romanticized. Senna eventually takes out a restraining order against Isaac, and the story frames her restraining order as an act of self-destruction, an action that Senna comes to regret. Later in the story, after Isaac is married to another woman who is expecting their first child, Senna's therapist kidnaps Senna and Isaac (independently from each other), drives them both to Alaska, and locks them up in a house together for over a year. Their long imprisonment in this isolated house by a cliff is horrifying, and their wretched ordeal almost kills Isaac and Senna numerous times. Senna's therapist has arranged this horrendous imprisonment in order to help Senna realize that she [Senna] truly loved Isaac all along, and that her restraining order was a mistake. The therapist also wanted Senna to realize that Isaac loved Senna unconditionally, an unconditional love that Senna threw away when she filed a restraining order against him.Since I happen to live in the real world, on planet Earth where women must daily deal with stalkers, domestic violence, the threat of murder, acquaintance rape, controlling boyfriends, terrifying husbands, and manipulative, violent partners of all kinds, I find novels like ""Mud Vein"" highly problematic and damaging.In opposition to this novel, I must insist that women are fully capable of knowing their own minds. No woman needs a ""soulmate"" to ""heal her soul."" No one can ""heal"" another person's soul, male or female. If you want to heal your soul, then seeking professional counseling is often a good step to take. But in this novel, Senna's therapist is a homicidal criminal, and Isaac is a soul-healing savior. The man who Senna needed to take out a restraining order against because he refused to heed the word ""no"" was actually the only man who could ""heal her soul.""I found nothing to praise in this book. I would never, ever recommend this book to another woman to read. Instead, I want to tell all of the women in this world: every woman has the power to know her own mind, to know her own desires, and to communicate those desires to any man who would love her. Men who do not respect a woman's wishes are not worthy of a romantic partnership. Abusive men should not be loved unconditionally. Abusive men who are loved unconditionally only continue to abuse the women who love them unconditionally.To love yourself means that *you* must plumb your own depths to know yourself, and you must have standards for the people who love you. Allowing people to harm you or disrespect you is not an act of self-love. Abuse is not love. That message is not in ""Mud Vein,"" however. Everything in this book is a senseless, Thought Experiment plot device: Senna's rape while she's jogging, her breast cancer, her imprisonment by her therapist, her conclusions about love and wholeness at the end of the book, her statement that she will travel the world with Stage IV breast cancer before she dies (page 280), and her ideas about needing a soulmate to heal her soul. None of this material is handled realistically or responsibly. The entire novel reads as if Senna is having a mental breakdown and hallucinating the events in the plot.On a final note, the cover art of a naked woman tied with rope makes it seem like this book is erotica, but ""Mud Vein"" contains no graphic sex scenes or erotic content. This book is about a very mentally-unhealthy woman who is kidnapped by her homicidal therapist, forced to survive a harrowing imprisonment with a former lover, and discovers that she needed a man to heal her soul all along. There are only two, very brief (and supposedly ""romantic"") sex scenes in this book; blink, and you might miss them. Negative stars.

All have been read earlier this year (2019). ""Last Days at Hot Slit"" was definitely the darkest Dworkin book I have read, by far. I loved this book, and I felt empowered reading it, but I also cried. This book is so dark that I wasn't able to finish it. I skipped around in the collection and read the material in my own order, and there were a few selections that I didn't read. I checked this book out three times from my library, keeping it for more than two months -- and honestly, I just needed longer to finish it. Sometimes, written material requires a long, long time for me to emotionally process in order to consume it in full. That was the case with ""Last Days at Hot Slit."" It's very tragic to me that Andrea Dworkin is labelled a ""radical,"" when her ""extremism"" is nothing more than telling the truth. I have never read a writer who can break down power structures so clearly and succinctly as Dworkin can. I don't find Dworkin's work ""radical"" at all. In the past ten years, I've heard a number of Young Adult/YA authors describe their own fiction work as being ""radically honest,"" but that is the kind of ""radical"" that Dworkin really is: radically honest.She is much more than honest, though. This is a writer who saw power clearly. She wrote about power clearly. Reading her work is a gift. She exposes power as it is, and her prose is ruthless and exacting. Other people call that radical. I call it a gift. I call it grace. When I take a walk in the woods or swim in the sea, I feel grace. When I read Andrea Dworkin's work, I feel grace. It's that powerful feeling of Truth washing over me. Dworkin's prose is as clear as a blue summer sky.Five stars. An excellent read. And one day, when I'm ready, I'll read the remaining selections.

It examines American misogyny without ever really using the word ""misogyny."" It certainly never names what bell hooks calls ""the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy,"" but if you have ever read bell hooks, you'll know exactly what Peggy Orenstein is discussing, though she never goes so far as to name it.""Cinderella Ate My Daughter"" was a big hit with its intended readership: harried middle-class mothers of young daughters who are increasingly besieged by the digital media of the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, transmitted to mothers and daughters through their devices (smart phones, tablets, etc.). Orenstein uses humor and deflection to examine the increasingly pornified culture aimed at young girls, from infancy into adulthood, or ""womb to tomb,"" as she puts it. ""Cinderella Ate My Daughter"" chronicles Orenstein's struggles raising a healthy preschooler, and a healthy elementary-school-aged daughter.In 2016, Orenstein published her much darker book about adolescent and teenage girls, ""Girls & Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape."" After Orenstein's daughter turned into an adolescent, the lighthearted humor quickly fell away, and the stark realities of sexism and misogyny could not be laughed off or ignored. ""Girls & Sex"" is a much more troubling, uncomfortable look at the realities of porn culture and pornified social media on American adolescent girls.As I write this  in 2019, there is even more data that young girls are being harmed by their time spent on social media. The troubling issues Orenstein humorously examined in 2011, in ""Cinderella Ate My Daughter,"" are no longer so humorous. Rates of anxiety and depression in young girls and teenage girls have skyrocketed, along with the rates of self-cutting and self-harming. Since 2010, the rate of self-cutting hospitalizations in girls ages 10-14 has gone up 189%. This directly coincides with the rate of middle-schoolers getting on social media (when middle-schoolers began having their own devices to spend a majority of their time after school on social media). Orenstein's own daughter falls within this demographic. Also since 2010, the rise in suicide for 15-19 year-old girls has increased 70%. The rise in suicide in girls ages 10-14 has increased 151%.(If you want to know where I obtained these figures, please see this link -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5IGy...) There is a large portion of America's population that is ""fine"" with this development. Here is how the ""everything is just fine with social media"" rhetoric goes: ""Oh, young girls are committing suicide at higher rates than ever before? Well, whatever. They're just 'stupid' girls, aren't they? Their lives don't matter. Who cares if young girls are cutting themselves at higher rates than ever before? They're just 'idiot' children ending up in the hospital over social media, lolz. God, girls are so 'dumb.' If social media is causing an increase in self-harming and suicide in girls, then I guess that is just Survival of the Fittest weeding out the 'morons,' killing off the unfit females who are 'too stupid to live.' Good riddance.""There are plenty of people who agree with that logic. I am not one of them. Girls matter. Their lives matter. The harm they are facing from their time spent on social media matters. Parents deserve to know that social media is directly impacting the lives of their daughters in extremely negative ways. In ""Cinderella Ate My Daughter,"" Orenstein questions what she was witnessing in 2008-2010, but this book was not written to sound an alarm. ""Cinderella Ate My Daughter"" was meant to be humorous, not dire. The reader closes this book on the last page feeling like good parenting can counteract whatever damaging forces are bombarding girls through social media. Sadly, the data in 2019 shows otherwise. Gen Z (children born after 1995) have higher and higher rates of anxiety and depression. Many of those young people have wonderful parents. Millennials/Gen Y (children born 1982-1994) who got on social media in college have fared much, much better than the Gen Z'ers (born after 1995) who got on social media in middle school. Handing a device to a ten-year-old girl and telling her, ""Have fun with that,"" is having disastrous results on the health of young girls and teenagers.""Cinderella Ate My Daughter"" was still a good read, but the pop culture references in this book are becoming increasingly dated, and this book is nowhere near as good as Orenstein's ""Girls & Sex."" But if you want a light, easy, humorous look at the negative effects of porn culture on young children, a book that leaves you feeling happy and hopeful without a shred of despair, then ""Cinderella Ate My Daughter"" is exactly the right choice. There are no alarm bells clanging in this book. The reader closes the last page feeling like things are okay, and you can rest easy. You can let your middle-schooler spend as much time as she wants on social media and sleep well. If you need that kind of messaging as a parent, then this book is for you.If you want to be a more active parent than that, or be more informed about American culture overall, then I strongly suggest you read ""Girls & Sex."" Orenstein definitely upped her game in that book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 22, 2019","Aug 26, 2019","Aug 22, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8565083-cinderella-ate-my-daughter

This book is lThe 2015 nonfiction/self-help book, ""Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear,"" by Elizabeth Gilbert, is a short, fun, lighthearted read. This book is like reading an updated version of Natalie Goldberg's ""Writing Down the Bones,"" (1986), but with zero writing prompts or craft advice. ""Big Magic"" focuses solely on Gilbert's ""you can do it, please don't let low self-esteem stop you"" positivity. As a self-help book, I enjoyed ""Big Magic"" a lot more than ""Writing Down the Bones."" Gilbert's prose also speaks more solidly to people who have been writing for a long time and have still failed to find any ""success"" for their work, rather than focusing solely on encouraging the novice, which was the intended readership for ""Writing Down the Bones."" I admit that I'm much more of a stone-cold realist about ""creativity"" and ""art"" than I think Elizabeth Gilbert is. I believe that the act of writing and making art is much more deeply tied to power and dominance than Gilbert would ever acknowledge, and she certainly does not speak to the role of power in art in her book. This book is about harnessing positivity and adopting an attitude of perseverance to create works of art, a message that is especially important for a lot of women to hear, and Gilbert's prose makes it clear that she's aware her intended readership is largely female.Honestly, I'm all for it. This book made me smile and laugh. Gilbert makes it clear that there are no guarantees in the world of art, and I cannot support that message enough. You can work really, really hard as an artist and receive no rewards for your art. A lack of outward success doesn't mean that your art isn't ""worthy,"" it just means that your art never brought you the ""success"" that you might have wanted from it.I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 because Gilbert approaches creativity as if we all come to it from equal starting points, so long as we live in the U.S., and I just have to say, growing up in poverty in America can make artistic pursuit just as difficult as pursuing the arts in the developing countries Gilbert names in her text. Nonfiction books like ""Evicted"" and ""Just Mercy"" examine precisely how ""unfree"" poor people are in America. You don't have to leave the United States to understand that making art is brutally difficult when you lack basic resources (like clean water to drink and a roof over your head), or when you live in a place where hearing gunshots and witnessing gun violence are daily realities. For a great many people in the U.S., pursuing their creativity is something that requires a lot more than internal ""permission-giving"" and positive self-esteem. But ""Big Magic"" is a book intended for a middle-class readership, and I think it does a great job of boosting the intended reader's self-esteem and emotional stamina for creating art that might never be praised or rewarded. Gilbert's message is clear: make art anyway. Make art for the sake of making art. The work is its own reward.Recommended for any artist who is in need of a self-esteem boost, especially writers craving a big dose of happy. This is a book that makes you feel happy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Aug 21, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30278755-big-magic

Renault's work served as the basis for Oliver Stone's 2004 film, ""Alexander,"" a movie I have not seen.I didn't discover this book through Oliver Stone, however. While I was reading Madeline Miller's bestselling 2018 novel, ""Circe,"" (in the summer of 2019), I watched an interview in which someone in the audience asked Miller a question as to whether she had ever read Mary Renault's work before. Miller stated that she knew of Renault's work, but wasn't sure how to pronounce the author's last name. (For the record, I watched another, much older video filmed at Oxford, celebrating Renault's body of work, in which an academic stated that the pronunciation, to the best of their knowledge, was ""Ren-awlt,"" not ""Ren-oh."")Intrigued by the audience member's question, I decided to check out Mary Renault for myself. I chose ""Fire from Heaven,"" and bought a used copy at a Goodwill store. This book is truly amazing. It's lush, vivid, dark, beautifully written, and richly imagined. The historical content is also very dense. I had to read this book slowly, often rereading entire pages in order to comprehend this material. I also had to research information about Alexander as I read, in order to understand the story and the liberties Renault takes with historical record in order to craft her tale.I read the great bulk of ""Fire from Heaven"" in the summer of 2019. Then I suddenly became busy with other projects, and I didn't finish reading the last 40 pages (of 370 pages total) until January 2020. I really wish the gap in time hadn't occurred, but once I remembered all the sub-plots and side characters again, the ending of this book was truly stunning. ""Fire from Heaven"" is a fascinating, delightful novel.I took a lot of notes while I read this book last summer, concerning points I wanted to discuss in this , but unfortunately, I cannot find those notes now. Since I'm not an authority on Greek history, I'll simply state that a number of experts have discussed some of the inaccuracies in this novel, concerning dates and character portrayals in ""Fire from Heaven.""One glaring inaccuracy I noticed, which I could not find any academic discussing (in videos or in papers online), was Renault's use of the word ""corn"" in this story. A number of times in the text, the characters discuss ""corn"" and ""trade routes for corn."" Renault was a scholar and reader of Greek text, and I know for a fact that the ancient Greeks of Alexander's time weren't growing corn or trading corn because corn is a New World crop. Edith Hamilton also uses ""corn"" quite a lot in her 1942 classic, ""Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes,"" about ancient Greece and Greek mythology. While reading both books, I kept scratching my head and muttering to myself, ""These authors were reading the actual Greek text to pen their own versions of these stories. Why do they keep saying the ancient Greeks had corn?? What the f*ck is going on??""It's frustrating to me. Deeply aggravating. And then I go looking for academic papers that include this huge ""corn"" inaccuracy in these works, and I can't find any. That bothers me even more.So I just want to say this: Native Americans cultivated corn. Native Americans were, and are, amazing horticulturalists. They were, and are, incredibly good farmers. They grew food in abundance, and developed incredibly inventive and environmentally astounding ways of farming crops. No one in Europe ate corn until after 1492. When I see ""corn"" used in books about ancient Greece, all I can think about is erasure: the erasure of the fact that Native Americans were, and are, amazing farmers. There is a powerful, pervasive stereotype and outright lie that Native Americans were ""a bunch of savages"" who ""ran wild on the land"" and ""didn't know how to settle the land and farm it."" That lie even shows up among Greek scholars who are reading Greek text and should absolutely know that ancient Greek texts do NOT feature the word ""corn,"" because the ancient Greeks did NOT have any corn. In ""Fire from Heaven,"" the use of ""corn"" in the novel is such a minor detail that it in no way detracts from the work as a whole. I just wanted to point out that this crap really pisses me off when I find it in books. I'm not a scholar or an academic, and I certainly cannot read ancient Greek, but I damn well understand basic history, and I know where corn came from. Inaccuracies aside, I still recommend ""Fire from Heaven"" to anyone interested in the childhood and youth of Alexander the Great. This is a great work of art. Renault (who died in 1983) obviously loved Alexander a great deal, and her story is entirely sympathetic toward him. ""Fire from Heaven"" romanticizes Alexander in all ways, including the promotion of gay love and gay sex as a way to escape the ""debasement"" of having sex with women, who were seen in ancient Greece (and in the 1960s) as being inferior. Please don't pick up ""Fire from Heaven"" hoping to see a sympathetic portrayal of women, because the narrative voice of this book is as misogynistic as the characters. Promoting gay sex among men does not necessarily coincide with promoting gender equality, and such is the case with ""Fire from Heaven.""But this book is so much more than the sum of its parts. Reading this book was a lush, vivid dream that took my mind to new places and gave me indelible scenes that were dark and delightful. ""Fire from Heaven"" is a thorny, imperfect book. I perhaps loved it all the more for how problematic it is. Five full stars.

""The Unhoneymooners"" is a romance novel advertised as a ""hate to love"" or ""enemies to lovers"" romantic comedy, starring a biracial couple who end up taking a free ""honeymoon package trip"" together to Maui. I read this book because it's been blowing up my Goodreads wall this summer, receiving rave s, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I'm exceedingly glad that I could borrow this from my library, because I would have been pissed if I'd wasted any money on this. Unlike Sally Thorne's hate-to-love romance novel, ""The Hating Game"" (2016), ""The Unhoneymooners"" did not feature any fat-shaming from the protagonists, and I was very grateful for that. The female love interest, Olive, does make some very genre-typical, catty remarks about tall, thin, blonde women being nasty and gross. Par for the course in a modern romance novel, if you ask me. This book and ""The Wedding Date,"" by Jasmine Guillory (2018), have a lot in common: both feature curvy, full-figured women of color who fall in love with white men who have only previously dated tall, thin, blonde women, women who are portrayed as materialistic, shallow, and mean. Both books center on the trope of fake dating, and both end up turning into an insta-love story rather quickly. But at least in ""The Unhoneymooners,"" the fake-dating part lasted longer, and made the book more comedic and enjoyable as a result. I still found this book pretty boring. Especially after the couple leaves Hawaii and returns home, and several chapters are dedicated to their lives after they return to the dull city setting where the novel began. I've never been to Hawaii, and I fully admit that I was hoping to get a vicarious Hawaiian vacation by reading this book. Alas, the Maui setting is underutilized, to say the least. This book could have been set at a hotel in Florida or Texas, for all that the setting matters. The characters spend the majority of their vacation time inside their hotel, with one brief snorkeling trip and a visit to a dive bar near their hotel. If you're looking for a book-vacation, I wouldn't recommend this novel. Come for the romantic banter of the fake dating trope, if that's your thing, but read something else if you want to feel like you're in Hawaii. There is no erotica -- no explicit sexual material -- in this novel. All of the sexual content is handled carefully, with either vague sex descriptions or none at all; most of the sex is actually skipped over entirely. What is strange about that choice is that the novel assumes the reader is very well-versed in hardcore pornography, and the male love interest frequently uses ""bukkake"" as a running joke through the book. The word is never defined for the reader, but the love interest, Ethan, uses the term more than once to mock the name of the company that Olive used to work for. Here is some dialogue that appears on page 216, in which Ethan baits Olive (yet again) into saying the name of her previous employer (""Butake""), so he can have the pleasure of yelling, ""Bukkake!"" in a public restaurant, as he has done previously in the book --""Where did you meet Frank again?""""Butake."" As soon as I say it, I realize it was a setup.""Bukkake!"" he sings, and I push his water toward him. As I mentioned, the word ""bukkake"" is never defined in the book. For the record, bukkake is a sex act in which multiple men come on a woman's face, a pornography scene that is usually filmed as part of a gang bang, or a gang rape. Often, fifteen or more men will stand in a circle around a woman who is on her knees, and the men each come on her face in a group, covering her entire head in their come. In Japan, one woman died while filming bukkake; her throat was filled with the men's come, sealing off her airway, and she suffocated to death on camera, all while the director yelled at her that she was ""ruining his film"" by choking. No one realized that the woman was dying until she was dead. Bukkake and gang rapes are an extremely violent and popular sex act in pornography, and filmed explicitly to showcase the humiliation, objectification, and degradation of women. Feminist activist Gail Dines calls bukkake: ""one of the most degrading acts in porn."" And then here is this PG-rated ""romantic comedy"" using the word as a ""fun joke"" on behalf of the male love interest, who keeps yelling it out while he's laughing and mocking the female main character's previous place of employment.I don't know why female readers find this funny. Do women really watch bukkake and giggle? Do romance readers watch hardcore pornography and laugh at the women being gang-banged and having their faces covered in come? Do other women find bukkake hilarious? Why is a man like Ethan considered ""charming"" for watching bukkake pornography, and yelling the word out in public, and laughing, and treating it like a joke? I honestly don't find it funny it all. It's horrifying to me. It horrifies me that a woman died on a pornography set while men were filming bukkake. Her death is one of the most horrible things about prostitution and pornography: the fact that women can die even while it's being filmed, and the vast majority of women in porn films permanently end up as street prostitutes, and don't live to see thirty. I don't think Ethan is ""charming and cute"" for yelling ""bukkake!"" out in public and laughing, especially because he's always making fun of Olive's former employer when he does so. The misogyny of it all is entirely too vicious for me. When Olive and Ethan finally share their first kiss (pages 219-220), Ethan is thoroughly drunk. He later describes their first kiss in this way: ""It was the kind of kiss that feels like fucking"" (page 237). Ethan wants to make sure that Olive knows he remembers the kiss, even though he was drunk. Ethan's statement arouses Olive mightily, and sends her ""libido spiraling out of any controlled orbit"" (page 237). I understand that Olive finds Ethan's statement sexy. But wow, does it turn me off. How is tongue-fucking supposed to be romantic or sexy? I have never kissed a man who tried to ""fuck me"" with his tongue, but I guarantee that if a man ever tried to tongue-fuck me, I would never kiss him again. It honestly sounds like the kind of ""bad sex"" crap that the TV show ""Sex and the City"" was famous for exposing. On a final note: ""The Hating Game"" and ""The Unhoneymooners"" both feature paintball scenes, in which the love interests play games of paintball together. I can officially say that this is a trope now: the ""lovers play paintball"" trope. I honestly find this particular trope pretty boring and I dread seeing it repeated so often in books. It's in rom-com films, too. The 2006 movie ""Failure to Launch"" and others have featured this trope. *sigh*I don't really understand why ""The Unhoneymooners"" is so popular. But I guess a lot of women watch hardcore pornography and find bukkake funny, enjoy tongue-fucking, and delight in men who wait to kiss them until they are drunk. For me personally, I would rather reread ""Jane Eyre"" than get tongue-fucked, thanks.Two stars. Recommended for people who loved ""The Hating Game"" and ""The Wedding Date."" The same readership who enjoyed those books is currently 5-starring the hell out of ""The Unhoneymooners.""

As I type this  in 2019, this book has enjoyed 33 years of popular success. Plenty of writers and non-writers have encouraged me to read this book; a friend even gave me her paperback copy last year, which is how I finally managed to read this book.If I had read ""Writing Down the Bones"" as a teenager, this book might have had a bigger impact on me. As it is, I would have DNF'd this if so many of my friends hadn't been so persistent that I read this book. I prefer craft books that discuss the nuts and bolts of prose, especially structure and editing. ""Writing Down the Bones"" contains none of that.This book is a universal call to all of its readers to write -- to write for the sake of writing -- and much of the impulse for writing, according to this book, seems to be rooted in the writer's own ego: the ego that longs to be known, to be remembered, to be read. The ego that suffers from terrible loneliness, and combats loneliness by putting pen to paper. Which, okay, fine: plenty of writers write only for themselves and their egos. Plenty of writers suffer from debilitating loneliness, and writing helps them feel less lonely. I get it. I have no problem with that any of that, and I fully support people who write only for themselves. Do it! Write and write and write: I support all writing! I can appreciate the need for books like ""Writing Down the Bones,"" a text that is full of kind, supportive words for tender writer-egos, and the lonely writers who carry those egos. For me personally, I write because I like to *entertain* people. I don't record the details of my life to ""prove that I lived,"" or to be remembered, or to make people care about me. I honestly don't give a damn about using my writing to acquire those things. I try to erase myself off the page as much as I can, and I certainly don't write to prove that ""I lived."" I know that I lived. I don't need to ""prove it"" to anyone. I write because I like to entertain. I write because I like to move people; I like to make people laugh and cry. I write because it's really, really hard work, and it makes me feel more alive when I do it. That's the reason why I've always preferred nuts-and-bolts craft books rather than cheerleader-books like ""Writing Down the Bones.""Natalie Goldberg gives a lot of good advice in this book. She emphasizes the importance of listening, and being present in any space you inhabit. She emphasizes using concrete details as opposed to being vague and writing bland prose. That's all fine. It's good advice for a beginning writer, as well as anyone who longs to write but hasn't yet given themselves permission to write. I completely understand that a lot of people restrain themselves from doing things that will make them happy, including writing, and that books like this one, which support anyone's right to write, are important and necessary. ""Writing Down the Bones"" just wasn't my kind of craft book. I don't struggle with giving myself ""permission"" to write. For years, I have written steadily; I don't struggle with loneliness, or an ego that won't permit me to write. When I pick up a book about writing, I want to read about structure and editing techniques. I don't need pages and pages of encouragement, which is what this book is. But I'm glad that this book exists. I would happily recommend this book to any aspiring writers and beginning writers who are in need of kindness, support, and words of encouragement. A number of published authors have also stated that they reread this book every year; the text bolsters their spirits and renews their enthusiasm for their work. And I think that is just great. If you find yourself in need of words of love and kindness in regards to your writing and your work, I wholeheartedly recommend you read ""Writing Down the Bones."" This book is medicine for the people who need it....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 10, 2019","Aug 10, 2019","Aug 10, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/578518.Writing_Down_the_Bones

The novel seeks to humanize and empathize with German Nazis who fled for their lives as Russia began its military push toward Berlin.Author Ruta Sepetys chose the same situation and setting in her YA historical fiction novel, ""Salt to the Sea,"" published in 2016. I loved that book. Sepetys's novel made me care about the characters a lot more than I ever cared about the characters in ""Skeletons at the Feast."" There are parts of this novel that moved me to tears, but sadly, none of those tears were ever for the main characters. This novel features an omniscient, head-hopping point of view, jumping from a large number of main characters, secondary characters, and tertiary characters. The POV shifts from page to page, scene to scene, and often within the same scene. Rather than following a linear timeline, the novel starts mid-way through the characters' journey, and then narrates the bulk of the novel as backstory, including many long sections of backstory detailing scenes before the war has even begun. The prose seems far more focused on teaching history lessons rather than building up high stakes for the characters. Bohjalian definitely wanted me to sympathize with Anna, Theo, and their mother. I wanted to; I definitely sympathized with the characters in ""Salt to the Sea."" But in ""Skeletons at the Feast,"" I just didn't care.Anna's innocence and Theo's innocence were given the most focus, with their mother's innocence a close third. But I didn't care about any of them. Part of that was due to their lack of stakes -- in seeing no reason to care whether they lived or died. Another part was due to the distance in the narrative voice; their emotions often felt buried or nonexistent. Another factor against caring about them was the presence of Cecile's point of view, and constantly reading about the ongoing atrocities against the Jewish people in this book while the German Nazis flee for their lives. I also felt apathy toward the Nazi characters due to the characters not reading true to life. For example, in the multiple erotic scenes in this book, Anna reads like an adult woman having intercourse, not a teenage girl experiencing her first sexual relationship. Other times, Anna reads like a man writing a woman, not like an actual young woman contemplating her life. I don't know of any teenage girl who would say that boys grow up faster than girls do, but Anna makes comments like that in this book, even though the story is full of graphic rape scenes and the horrific sexual mutilations of women, before they die and as corpses. Girls always grow up faster than boys in the patriarchy, and girls know that. Anyone who doesn't understand that doesn't understand how the patriarchy works. Tears welled in my eyes when horses died, and when innocent Jews were slaughtered. But when the German Nazis met their fates? Nothing. I won't give away any spoilers, but even when I read what happened to Uri, I felt nothing, though I did care about him. That scene just felt like it was a plot pull to make the book more dramatic; it felt rushed and inauthentic, and therefore, I was not moved. It felt like the author knew that Uri would be the reader's favorite character in the book, and the story wasn't written to make the reader feel good, but to teach a lesson.Bohjalian did a good job writing horror. Parts of this book reminded me of watching ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List."" The Holocaust material was all *very* well done. I was sad that the mass murder of disabled people, queer people, the Roma, and other groups targeted by the Nazis was not included in the text, but I understand that Bohjalian wanted to focus his narrative on the mass murder of Jews. I just wish I had *felt* more emotion and authentic, internal drama from the main characters. Everything felt so distant and drained of emotional force. David Benioff's ""City of Thieves"" (2008), Ruta Sepetys's ""Salt to the Sea"" (2016), and Anthony Doerr's ""All the Light We Cannot See"" (2014) all took traditional ""unlikeable"" main characters (to a modern U.S. reader) -- i.e. German Nazis and Russian soldiers -- and narrated history lessons from WWII that felt more immediate and gripping than ""Skeletons at the Feast."" The other books gave the characters stakes beyond the end of the war, and high human worth -- making me care deeply whether those characters lived or died. Rather than an omniscient POV, the other books had close-third POVs. Emotions -- including confusion, rage, and ambition -- drove the other stories, rather than a narrative voice teaching a history lesson.Overall, I'm glad this book was written. I've just had better experiences with others, and I'm already very familiar with the WWII history that was described in this book....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 07, 2019","Aug 10, 2019","Aug 07, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6218909-skeletons-at-the-feast

I also kept expecting the author to mention rape. With each page I turned, I thought: ""Okay, surely this page will at least *mention* rape, even if Scarry doesn't want to analyze it in depth."" That assumption turned out to be false. The author never mentions rape. Not once. Despite the fact that rape is often the first act torturers use to subjugate their victims. Scarry's complete silence regarding rape is a glaring and unforgivable omission. In fact, the ""establishment of dominance"" through torture is also mentioned NOWHERE in the first part of the book. The prose is so overwritten -- and unnecessarily confusing -- that it's almost comedic. These sentences are penned with a ""Baffle The Reader with Bullsh*t"" mentality. It's aggravating to read. This book has severe limitations. After reading four books by Andrea Dworkin this summer (2019), it's clear to me that Dworkin's prose and analysis just blows Elaine Scarry out of the water.I'm DNF'ing ""The Body in Pain"" at page 65.

All three indie titles have left me scratching my head, wondering what, exactly, I have just read. ""Of Murders and Mages"" left me the most puzzled. To begin, Chapter One is told as if it is a dream sequence from the main character's point of view. I read more than one hundred pages before I realized (independent of the first-person prose) that Chapter One is the only place in the novel that is not told from the protagonist's point of view, but from that of a dead woman named Ethel. Furthermore, only the reader has access to the information in Chapter One; the main character is entirely unaware of the contents of the opening pages, even though Chapter Two begins with the main character waking up from ""exhausting and disturbing dreams"" (page 3), leading the reader to assume that Chapter One was one of those dreams. The name ""Ethel"" is also very close to the main character's first name -- ""Ella"" -- a name that the reader is not given until page 9. Even though the rest of this novel is told from Ella's first person point of view (Chapters 2-20), she is addressed as ""Miss Ramono"" throughout Chapter Two. By the time I started reading Chapter Three, and finally learned that Miss Ramono's first name is ""Ella,"" I did not go back to reread the confusing dream sequence of Chapter One. I thought it would be explained later in the text, and I definitely conflated the single mention of ""Ethel"" on page one with the name ""Ella"" introduced on page nine. I thought these women were the same person, which is why I assumed the text would explain the existence and meaning of Chapter One. But Ella never explains why Chapter One exists in this book. The reader is left to link that information together on their own, and it took me over one hundred pages to realize that Ethel -- and Ethel alone -- had been narrating the opening scene -- which turns out not to be a dream sequence at all, but a scene from Ethel's real life. I thought Chapter One had been a dream sequence from Ella's sleeping mind, but it was really a complete POV shift that only seemed to serve one purpose: to make Chapter Two even more confusing and discombobulated to read.""Of Murders and Mages"" is set in the present-day, modern world of the fictional town of Rambler, Nevada, and while I expected to be reading about realistic human beings, no one in this book ever speaks or behaves like a real person. The dialogue and actions of every character swings between melodrama and the most childish, extreme histrionics, to the point that I actually thought I was reading a story about aliens, robots, or people possessed by demons. I had to keep reminding myself that this novel was an adult contemporary book, not dystopian science fiction. In Chapter Two, Ella is at her new office job when she wakes up from a nap at her desk, is weirdly accosted by an extremely threatening man, and is then viciously bitten by a cat whose bite seems to send an immediate and horrible infection all through her body. None of the office staff ever gets a first aid kit, or suggests that she see a doctor, and Ella herself accepts being bitten as if nothing is out of the ordinary. She soon follows the angry, scary man to another office room, where she sits through a business meeting as if nothing is wrong. After the meeting, another worker puts the cat who bit Ella on a body-leash and tells Ella that the cat is hers to take home. Ella takes the cat home without question, along with numerous boxes of cat supplies that have been given to her by the office staff. I cannot imagine letting someone's animal bite me like that on a job site, not bothering to seek any medical treatment, then being told I am the new owner of the animal that bit me, and being told to take ""a new pet"" home from work, without voicing one word of objection. Yet Ella does all of this and more, with a mindset that reads like she is really age two, not twenty-something. Throughout this book, Ella stomps her feet like a child, throws tantrums, and is frequently knocked onto the ground so that her shirt can pop open and show off her cleavage, especially whenever the angry, scary man at the office is around. That man turns out to be Ella's romantic love interest.He is also a mage, and Ella soon becomes a mage in training. Her new employers at the office are the mages who take her on as a witch in training. But rather than spending time teaching Ella about magic, her new bosses simply demand that she solve a murder case at their casino, rather than immersing her in lessons about her new powers. As both a student of magic and a reluctant crime detective, Ella is infantilized and constantly pornified in this book. For a large section of the second half of the book, Ella is forced to be a waitress in a low-cut top and shiny gold panties, and people repeatedly knock her onto all fours in her skimpy outfit. The elements of modern pornography are extremely high in this novel. The sexualized violence and constant sexual humiliation Ella blithely suffers in this book were incredibly off-putting and upsetting to me. This book is advertised as ""a humorous adventure,"" but I never found myself laughing, or even cracking a smile. I spent the first half of the book struggling to make sense of what I was reading, feeling like I'd landed on Planet Crazy. By the second half of the book, I finally had my bearings, but Ella's long stint waiting tables in gold panties was the opposite of the ""magic detective work"" I thought I would be reading about. This isn't a mystery novel that invites the reader to put together clues to solve the puzzle along with the main character. This is a book that jumps from one zany situation to the next, and waits until after the high-action climax, during the calm period of resolution, to finally explain the facts of the case, and why everything in the book happened the way it did. I've read Janet Evanovich's ""One for the Money,"" (published in 1994), and while I wasn't a fan of the book overall, I certainly understand the appeal of the main character, Stephanie Plum, and her madcap adventures to solve mysteries and find love. I don't remember Stephanie Plum being so debased and pornified as Ella Ramono is in ""Of Murders and Mages,"" but I would guess that Ella Ramono is meant to be an appealing heroine to fans of Stephanie Plum.If you enjoy watching pornography and reading cozy mysteries, and if you like the thought of combining a character like Stephanie Plum with the pornographic imaginary, then you might enjoy reading ""Of Murders and Mages"" much more than I did. I admit that I am certainly not the right audience for a novel like this. I was raped as a small child and take no pleasure in pornography, and I've never had a desire to read more than one book by Janet Evanovich. I'm giving this book five stars because I believe I am not the right audience for this book, and I am unable to tell if this book is well-executed for a market that I am not a part of and fully admit that I do not understand. I would recommend this book for readers who enjoy pornography, zany cozy mysteries, and books like ""One for the Money.""""Of Murders and Mages"" is a short novel, and it has been professionally proofread. It is the first book in a series.

Greg Picard co-wrote ""Keepers of the Sandbox"" and ""Old Bones"" with his daughter, Wendy Picard Gorham, who is cited on the book cover and interior as the co-author.Much of the content in the Chris Becker books has been drawn from the real lives of the authors. In many ways, Park Ranger Chris Becker echoes the real-life author, Greg Picard, and Becker's daughter Allie is much like the real-life author Wendy Picard Gorham. For the sake of this , I am going to insist upon not conflating the real-life people with the story characters in ""Keepers of the Sandbox."" I am going to treat Chris Becker as a solely fictional character: someone made-up for the purpose of a story. I will also consider the other characters in this book solely as fictional characters, along with the plot events that take place around them. While I understand that the setting is a real place, the characters and plot in that setting will be viewed as fiction: something created, crafted, and manipulated into meaning by the author team who penned this novel.Nothing in my  is intended to reflect on the real lives of the authors. ""Keepers of the Sandbox"" is a work of fiction. I am reading it and ing it as fiction. *****Overall, this book is a strange mash-up of two genres of fiction that have two different audiences: cozy mystery and men's pulp. Cozy mystery is largely marketed toward female readers, and men's pulp is almost solely the domain of male readers. Technically, ""Keepers of the Sandbox"" reads like a cozy mystery, a genre that largely avoids descriptions of corpses and gore, with violence that rarely (or never) takes place in-scene. Cozy mysteries are also known for placing the domestic drama of family life and the yearning for romantic love into the main plot of the novel. Most typically in this genre, a single woman who is longing for love and dealing with her day-to-day domestic struggles ends up solving a murder case through pluck and happenstance.That is largely what ""Keepers of the Sandbox"" is: a gender-swapped cozy mystery. It is a story about a man who is newly-separated from his wife, Lori, who left him unexpectedly with the full-time care of their seven-year-old daughter, Allie. While the newly-single male protagonist struggles with being a full-time parent with a full-time job, a murder mystery case unfolds at his job site, a case he ends up trying to solve through pluck and happenstance. The vast majority of the word count of this novel is spent detailing Chris Becker's domestic life with his young daughter, searching for appropriate daycare for her, and struggling with the demands of being a full-time working father on a middle-class income. Becker also struggles with a deep-rooted rage against his wife for suddenly leaving him. Becker takes no responsibility for the collapse of their marriage; he repeatedly gives Lori all of the blame. He calls Lori a ""jerk"" more than once and resents her mightily for leaving him. In many ways, Lori is the true antagonist of this novel: she is the one who has introduced the most strife into Becker's life. The novel even contains an unrealistic male-fantasy revenge scene in which Becker humiliates Lori, a scene that is to be read as Becker's ultimate triumph over her (pages 217-220).Becker's lack of introspection over his failed marriage and his deep-rooted rage is combined with his overall view of women in this book: that women are the sexual property of men. Becker constantly objectifies women as he has been culturally taught to objectify women. Becker is immensely patronizing and condescending toward every woman and girl he meets in this book. If the women he meets are in their twenties, he instantly views them as potential ""girlfriends"" now that he is newly single/currently separated from his wife. Mentally, women rank somewhere between dogs and toddlers for Becker. The sexism in this novel is extremely high, and it is the hallmark of the genre I know as men's pulp: books written by and for other men. Men's pulp is largely the domain of white, able-bodied, middle-class American men. These books are very popular with men's rights activists who feel victimized by modern America, which they see as rigging the courts against them, taking away their rights, humiliating them, and siding with women in rape cases, divorce cases, and other situations that they view to be reducing men's sexual property and forcing men to suffer.As a work of men's pulp, this book is certainly a five-star read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys men's pulp, especially if you are a men's rights activist who also enjoys cozy mysteries.**spoiler territory ahead, please beware, thank you**The central problem with this book, as I see it, is that most men's rights activists, and most lovers of men's pulp, prefer more violence and action in their fiction than what is contained in a cozy mystery. Chris Becker is not a typical action hero. Twice, he stumbles into high danger and needs someone else to save him, including the high-action climax of the book. Rather than being a traditional take-charge hero of men's pulp, guns blazing in righteousness, Becker is repeatedly weaponless and powerless, including the last action scene, when he runs away from danger, and needs other men (a Hispanic man and a subordinate white man) to save him.Becker's masculinity reasserts itself in his overall disdain for being saved. After the white man named Nick, a subordinate who works under Becker, saves Becker's life and Allie's life, Becker later takes time to thank him, apologizing to the man for belittling him earlier in the book. But the scene is not really about thanking Nick -- it is about reducing Nick by showing him to be a lesser man than Becker --""Becker reached out his hand, 'So, I just wanted to say thank you again for saving my life and Allie's.' Nick knocked over the cashbox trying to reach for Chris' hand to shake and they both laughed. 'I'll let you clean that one up. Have a good evening.'He and Allie jumped in the truck and they rolled down the dusty camp road.""(page 313)Chris Becker can't even be bothered to kneel down on the floor to help the subordinate who saved his life pick up some pennies, nickles, and dimes. ""I'll let you clean that one up,"" he says dismissively, adding a pleasant, ""Have a good evening,"" before he leaves. Although the book doesn't contain any scenes of Becker's married life, I am certain that this was exactly how Becker treated his wife: as a house slave who was there to serve him, to kneel on the floor and do ""the dirty work,"" the same way Becker treats Nick, his subordinate at work who has just saved Becker's life.The Hispanic man who helped save Becker's life is not sought out to be thanked, as he is revealed to be complicit in protecting/shielding the Hispanic evildoers in the book. As in traditional men's pulp, the evildoers in this book are ""Hispanic"" and ""Mexican"" men, members of ""Hispanic and Black gangs"" who engage in race warfare, with violence that spills over into the peaceful white population around the State Park. The murder victim who begins the novel's main plot is a white homosexual man whose gay lover is later brutally beaten by Hispanic men in the gay men's shared home. The brutal beating almost kills him. This book comes close to having a ""kill your gays"" trope; fortunately, the beaten gay man wakes up from his coma and lives, but not before Chris Becker can engage in an act of cruelty toward the gay man's seven-year-old daughter, a girl in his daughter's class named Melanie.Here is what Chris Becker says to his daughter Allie and Melanie while picking them up from school to take Melanie to the hospital to see her comatose father:""'Okay guys, into the truck you go. Get those seat belts on tight as we will be attaining supersonic speeds that will likely rip your faces off.' Allie laughed at his joke and Melanie either was too emotionally overwrought or just didn't appreciate Becker's humor."" (page 250) Melanie's father just has just been attacked in her childhood home, had his head smashed in, and is lying near death in the hospital, while Chris cracks jokes about ripping Melanie's face off in his truck. The message is clear: it is perfectly all right for a straight white man to terrify and further traumatize the daughter of a gay man who has just been beaten to near-death.Chris Becker belongs to the same ""Christian Church"" that the beaten gay man is a member of. Becker makes it clear that the closeted gay man will probably be cast out of his church the moment the other church members learn that he is gay, following his hospitalization (page 311). Becker has no problem staying a member of this homophobic church. The novel does not point out that being a member of a homophobic church means that Becker condones and supports ostracizing gay men, despite his claim that he thinks it is ""wrong"" to be ""negative"" about homosexuality (page 311).The demonization and degradation of people of color and homosexual people in this novel is completely in line with popular men's pulp. It is the reason this genre is so popular with men's rights activists. Do I believe that the authors purposely set out to write men's pulp? I really don't know. But to guess, I would say: probably not. The thing about fiction is that most writers pen stories seemingly from their unconscious minds. The troubling thing about the unconscious mind is that it is shaped by discourse: hegemonic discourse, to be precise. In the United States, that hegemonic discourse is what bell hooks refers to as the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. That power structure is also ableist, homophobic, and transphobic. Discourse drastically shapes what we all think and believe, whether we like it or not. The narrative schema of America's dominant, hegemonic-discourse is fully on display in this novel.As a woman, I do not believe that this novel was written for me: a female reader. While I have greatly enjoyed a number of mainstream action books with male protagonists, including ""Open Season,"" by C.J. Box (2001), ""The Black Echo,"" by Michael Connelly (1992), ""Presumed Innocent,"" by Scott Turow (1986), and ""Killing Floor,"" by Lee Child (1997), none of those books made me feel belittled, mocked, and patronized as a female reader. While I would not go so far as to say those mainstream action titles are all ""feminist works,"" they all presented enough counter-discourse material that I didn't feel insulted as a woman to read them, and could enjoy the stories they contained. I would not call those mainstream titles ""men's pulp,"" but action novels that are marketed toward both women and men. If you are a member of the LGBTQIA+ community, are a person of color, or a feminist, I would caution you that ""Keepers of the Sandbox"" might not be an enjoyable read, due to the content I have described in this .If you are a white male who is a member of a men's rights organization, if you enjoy books that demonize ""bad hombres,"" or if you are a female patriarch who voted for President Donald Trump, then ""Keepers of the Sandbox"" might not strike you as being problematic at all, but simply really good fiction.For those reasons, I have rated this book five stars as men's pulp, recommended with the cautions I have stated above....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Aug 2019,"Aug 04, 2019","Aug 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34892309-keepers-of-the-sandbox

The voice of bell hooks rings with moral rectitude, but it is also a voice that is full of kindness, openness, and wholehearted forgiveness.I loved this entire book. Here are a few of my favorite quotes from the second half:""It is a testament to the learned ignorance of political reality that so many females cannot accept that patriarchy requires of men cruelty to women, that the will to do violence defines heterosexual, patriarchal masculinity."" (page 168)""Nothing was more frightening to women who wanted to be with men than a feminist movement exposing the depths of male contempt and disregard for the female sex."" (page 169)""The rise in sexual sadomasochism both in everyday life and in our intimate lives seems to be a direct response to the unresolved changes in the nature of gender roles, the fact that so much gender equality exists in the context of the same old oppressive patriarchy. Let's face the fact that it helps to eroticize domination if you feel you can't change it."" (page 228)""Romance is different when two people approach each other from the space of knowledge rather than absolute mystery. No matter how well we get to know someone else, there is always a realm of mystery. Old ideas about romantic love taught females and males to believe that erotic tension depended on the absence of communication and understanding. This misinformation about the nature of love has helped to further the politics of domination, particularly male domination of women. Without knowing one another, we can never experience intimacy."" (page 240)""It is certainly clear that sexist men are not rushing out to buy literature that will help them unlearn sexist thinking."" (page 169)A lot of people react to the statements in this book, and others like it, by yelling things like, ""Not all men!"" or ""We live in a post-feminist world!"" or ""Don't disrespect people who are into kink!"" or ""Sex workers are good for society!"" and so on and so forth. Lost is the fact that bell hooks, and writers like her, are discussing a power structure, not individual people. In this case, the power structure being scrutinized is patriarchy, a power structure that degrades, dehumanizes, mutilates, maims, and destroys the bodies of women, and does so through sexualized violence. Sexualized violence renders violence invisible (a quote from Gail Dines). Which is also to say: sexualized violence renders dehumanization invisible. As Andrea Dworkin consistently points out, regarding rape culture and the patriarchy, the message of sexualized violence, no matter what horrifying thing is being done to any individual woman, is always crystal clear: ""She wants it. They all do."" The victim is always to blame. ""She wants it. They all do.""They all do. They, of course, are women, and the girls who will one day become women. Girls and women who are all, truly, whores. Whores who must be policed by the violence that men dish out to them, to keep them in line. bell hooks focuses her sights on the patriarchy, both male patriarchs and the female patriarchs who have learned to support the patriarchy in all ways. ""Communion"" is intensely powerful for its clarity and wisdom.bell hooks also includes some memoir material in this book, detailing parts of her life I had never read about or learned about before. I enjoyed that material a great deal. bell hooks is such an incredibly brave, incredibly fierce and inspiring feminist. It always ennobles me to read her work. Five full stars.

This book sat on my TBR for a few years for that reason. As Clare's fan base has grown, so has my need to read this particular book.I'm happy to report that I was able to read every page. Cassandra Clare's writing improved a LOT between ""City of Bones"" (2007) and ""Clockwork Angel."" I had to skim, skip pages, and DNF ""City of Bones,"" but ""Clockwork Angel"" was immensely more readable. I found the main character, Tessa Gray, to be very bland, psychologically inconsistent, and emotionally unrealistic, but other readers love this protagonist a great deal. Ditto the love interest, Will Herondale. He did not make my heart flutter at all, but I understand why his ""wounded bad boy with a heart of gold"" persona has such a strong effect on other readers. I liked Tessa and Will a *lot* more than the two love interests in ""City of Bones,"" and that enabled me to finish the whole book. The characters and plot situations in ""Clockwork Angel"" read much more like middle grade fiction, similar to reading the ""Percy Jackson"" books, but the gore level in this novel definitely runs to YA. Very early in the 476 pages of my paperback copy, on page 43, Tessa and Will find themselves trapped in a room full of corpses, where a pair of demons have been killing humans --""The place was a slaughterhouse. There were long wooden tables running the length of the room. Bodies lay on one of them -- human bodies, stripped and pale. Each had a black incision in the shape of a Y marking its chest, and each head dangled back over the edge of the table, the hair of the women sweeping the floor like brooms. On the center table were piles of bloodstained knives and machinery -- copper cogs and brass gears and sharp-toothed silver hacksaws.""I admit that the gore level of that scene was so high for me that it was impossible to think about anything else but all of those corpses for a very long time, despite the fact that the main characters banter around with the bad guys inside of that room, have a humorous, slapstick-level fight in which one of the bad guys escapes, and then the scene cuts away and drops the slaughterhouse altogether, forgetting it in the narrative in favor of developing Tessa's character and the new warlock/shape-shifting skills she has been taught. The inability to grasp the magnitude of spending time in a human slaughterhouse (or, more aptly, a torture-people-to-death slaughterhouse, as was the case here) is the kind of psychology I encounter in middle grade novels. Tessa and Will have no lingering trauma over being trapped in that room full of naked, mutilated corpses, with the super-powered demons bearing down upon them. Tessa also has no lingering trauma from being kidnapped and brutally enslaved by those same demons for six weeks before she tries to escape and finds herself trapped in that slaughterhouse. Tessa, Will, and the other Team Good Guy characters in the story never made logical sense to me. The big plot reveals in this book require the reader to overlook the obvious, over and over again. Overlooking the obvious is accomplished because Tessa and the other good guys have no real human psychology; they aren't reacting to the events around them the way living people would. As book characters, they do what their author tells them to do. In truth, Tessa would have had a lot of trauma after those six weeks of being enslaved by the demons, and anyone, even ""a bad boy,"" would have some trauma after seeing a human slaughterhouse. Tessa would have also had a lot of rage and resentment against her captors, and I do think she would have started to question if the letter she was handed at the docks was not written by a victim, but by an enemy. After being knocked unconscious and removed from the slaughterhouse to a place of safety, Tessa would have certainly been terrified that the escaped demon and the Magister would have continued to hunt her after she got away; and yet, Tessa never has this fear or this thought in the text. The very next day, she goes out shopping for dresses and strolls around in the park, with no thought that the escaped demon or the Magister could easily kidnap, enslave, and torture her again.I found this whole book to be very silly. Tessa was unrealistic and bland, I didn't care for Will, and I thought the Institute's adult leaders -- a married couple named Charlotte and Henry -- had the mentality of ten-year-olds. Early in the book, Charlotte and Henry interview a man named Mortmain -- literally, ""primary death"" -- and the whole scene read like two children trying to interview Chief Satan. I stopped seeing Charlotte, Henry, and Mortmain as book characters, but cartoon figures. I kept having flashbacks that I was watching an episode of ""He-Man and She-Ra"" as a kid. Worst of all, Charlotte's big declaration at the end of the novel is to call Tessa ""a commodity"" for the Institute and for herself -- ""'And you, you are a precious commodity. What you can do has already helped the Enclave once; the aid you could offer us in the future could be incalculable. And if you are known to be a firm ally of mine, it will only help me.'"" (Charlotte speaking to Tessa in direct dialogue, page 459)Pro-tip: If ANYONE ever calls you ""a commodity,"" that is NOT a good thing. Tessa was ALSO ""a commodity"" to the Magister. And look where that got her. But here is Charlotte at the end of the novel, echoing the Magister's own motivations, and Tessa is over the moon with happiness and relief to be called ""a commodity."" I just... don't understand this. That dialogue really depresses me. As to the main plot of this book, I had no idea that the story contained steampunk elements, and Terminator-type robots. All of that was entirely unexpected and really surprised me.I'm super glad that I finally read this book so I can unhaul my paperback copy, and allow it to find a new home. I'm especially glad that I finally know the content of ""Clockwork Angel,"" and can understand for myself what all of the fuss is about. I won't be reading the next two books in this trilogy, but I can see why other readers became so hooked on this series and love it so much. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jul 24, 2019","Jul 31, 2019","Jul 24, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24885649-clockwork-angel

People who are terminally ill should have the right and the dignity to determine if they want to end their lives, and there are better ways to do that than slicing open their throats. ffsBut in the able-bodied world of the YA market and this story-world, slicing the throats of the sick just goes unquestioned as: ""anyone 'tainted' with illness deserves to be murdered."" It's no wonder that no one in the story wants to pay these ""Crows"" for their services, and they have to ""dance threateningly"" to ""force"" people to pay for their murdering.F*ck this ableist book.For the record, I support hospice care, nursing homes, and adequate care for people who are sick and/or disabled. Ableist novels like this one are NOT for me. The modern U.S. already has a problem with funding nursing homes, hospice care, and care for people with disabilities.

Reader, be warned.I read this book in 2019, and parts of the text have not aged well at all. ""Chapter Four: From Womyn to Bois,"" is particularly problematic, containing transphobic language and a transphobic narrative schema/narrative framing that is no longer appropriate or politically correct.But the text of Chapter Four is not the only thing that is problematic about Levy's book. Her focus throughout ""Female Chauvinist Pigs"" is to identify the self-loathing and deep-rooted misogyny some women have. The text is overall mocking, scolding, and damning toward these misogynistic, self-loathing women. The book never examines men, or men's cultural group behavior, and never orients the reader to the larger patriarchy influencing the young women Levy examines and interviews in the book. Levy repeatedly takes pains to separate herself from these misogynistic women, rather than empathizing with them, expressing compassion for them, or even communicating the fact that their behavior is a survival strategy. All oppressed groups adopt degrees of self-loathing in order to survive within the dominant cultural hegemony that degrades, dehumanizes, and oppresses them. Levy, unfortunately, does not express that awareness anywhere in her text. She singles out ""female chauvinist pigs"" for mockery, ridicule, and outright contempt, in an authorial exercise that is about separating herself (and the assumed non-chauvinist-pig reader) from such self-loathing, clueless women. Levy is emphatic that the reader understand she is above such self-loathing, misogynistic behavior. The assumed reader, who is probably not a stripper, porn-star, or vapid-minded supporter of ""raunch culture,"" is assumed to be above such behavior as well.All of the narrative schema and subtext of this book stressed me the f*ck out. The shortcomings of ""Female Chauvinist Pigs"" are massive, and highly misogynistic. This is not a book to ""wake you up"" to the patriarchy. This is a book that helps you, and wants you, to blame women for the patriarchal behavior that oppresses them. What remains cogent about this book are the words of the women Levy interviewed, quoted at length throughout the text. Misogynistic women speak authentically in this text, and their words and opinions still have tremendous value to illuminate the deep-rooted misogyny in modern America. I was fascinated to hear women express their disgust for women in order to hold themselves ""up above"" women, completely dissociating themselves from the crucial fact that they themselves are women. Levy's narrative text does the same thing, but Levy assumes that all she is doing is illuminating this dissociation in her interview subjects, without ever realizing her own narrative is guilty of it as well. The quoted words of the interview subjects in ""Female Chauvinist Pigs"" largely presaged Peggy Orenstein's phenomenal 2016 nonfiction book, ""Girls and Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape."" Orenstein's grasp of history, research, and trenchant analysis is much more insightful than Levy's work. But Levy was interviewing adult women for her book, rather than teenage girls, and her subjects are much more cutting and misogynistic than the teenage girls Orenstein interviewed for her work. The fireworks of misogyny are much more spectacular in ""Female Chauvinist Pigs.""Sadly, I felt like the narrative text of this book is solely about victim-blaming, rather than raising awareness about the patriarchy and supporting the work of feminism. This is not a book about increasing solidarity. This is a book about mocking women who are participating in their own degradation. What Levy titles ""raunch culture"" is more aptly named ""rape culture"" by feminists. It is also named ""porn culture"" by writers and researchers like Gail Dines. Levy never uses the term ""rape culture"" in her book; she uses ""raunch culture"" instead, because this is not a book about feminism. Although there are parts of this book that are feminist, overall, there is more narrative misogyny in this text, embedded in Levy's authorial schema, than there is feminism.Truthfully, I know that it is deeply satisfying to any self-loathing female reader to scorn the women in this text, and never examine the patriarchy at all. ""Female Chauvinist Pigs"" is not about raising awareness of the patriarchy; this is a book about mocking the women who ""go along to get along"" with ""raunch culture"" in the most self-debasing and self-destructive ways. I don't regret reading this book. But for anyone who wants to understand the patriarchy, misogyny, feminism, or how to have better solidarity with women, I would recommend these books instead:1. ""Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality"" by Gail Dines (2010)2. ""Pornography: Men Possessing Women"" by Andrea Dworkin (1981) 3. ""The Macho Paradox: Why Some Men Hurt Women and and How All Men Can Help"" by Jackson Katz (2006)4. ""The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love"" by bell hooks (2004)5. ""Girls and Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape"" by Peggy Orenstein (2016)^^All five of those titles avoid the knee-jerk reaction of victim-blaming, and fully orient the reader into a larger analysis of the power structure that creates and reinforces rape culture in modern America.There are many excellent books on this topic, of course. The five I have listed above are simply five titles that I have read myself, know for a fact are well-researched, and can personally recommend without reservation. Levy's book is one that awoke my own inner-misogynist, and I had to fight to hold that misogyny in check, rather than give in to the siren song of loathing, scorning, and mocking the deeply misogynistic women interviewed in this book. I find it morally wrong to blame the victims of oppression for adopting the tactics of their oppressors in order to survive. I need to have more self-awareness and more compassion than that. I think all of us do. I wish this book had been better than what it is. But I deeply appreciate that Levy interviewed women and quoted them at length in this text. I'm really glad to read their authentic voices. I just wish the narrative framework around their words had been more researched and self-aware. But then, the misogyny in the narrative is part of why this book sold so well. Sexism sells. Misogyny *really* sells. It always pays to sh*t on women. This book's commercial success was a function of that economic truth....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 21, 2019","Jul 23, 2019","Jul 21, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18745.Female_Chauvinist_Pigs

The author is a personal acquaintance o""Thoughts of an Eaten Sun,"" published in 2018, is the debut novel of Kyle Tolle, who self-published this book. The author is a personal acquaintance of mine, and that is how this book came into my hands.The story begins in a medieval-European-esque setting, with a logger named Hantle who has a wife and two sons around the ages of eight and ten. The opening pages set up the peaceful, loving household of this family, and then the book takes a very dark turn by page 14, when Hantle's idyllic family life is suddenly destroyed. What I had thought would be a hero's-journey fantasy novel, or quest novel, immediately revealed itself to be horror novel instead, featuring the kind of graphic violence and gory detail that is usually only seen in grimdark fantasy or horror. The book stays in horror-mode as an enormous, paranormal wolf starts devouring multiple people at a time. The wolf grows in size with each meal, and gets so large that it begins eating entire villages, buildings, and things much larger than buildings.At first, all of the horror I felt reading about this ravening wolf reminded me of the thrill I felt as a kid while reading books like ""Relic"" (1995), ""Jurassic Park"" (1990), and ""The Hot Zone"" (1994). Some of the graphic detail about the wolf's earliest behavior was nearly identical to the horror scenes in the 1987 movie, ""Predator,"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. I don't seek out horror anymore, in fiction or in films, but when I suddenly find myself reading a horror novel, I can well remember how I am meant to feel while reading scenes of graphic violence and death.""Thoughts of an Eaten Sun,"" however, doesn't stay in horror-mode for long. After 80-ish pages, the book shifts gear and becomes a more traditional fantasy novel, with a hero's journey/hero's quest kind of plot. The horror recedes and the reader follows Hantle on a long, dusty trip to a city he predicts will soon be devoured by the ravenous wolf. While there are a few more horror scenes on the journey, they pale in comparison to the graphic content of the first 80 pages. Hantle's enemies become fellow human beings who do not believe his tale of a supernatural, devouring wolf, and he clashes with people more than once in an effort to kill the wolf and save the world.I won't give away any spoilers, but I will say that this book doesn't really have a conclusion. While there seems to be some hero's-journey trope-subversion in the plot of this book, I admit that I didn't understand the ending or find it conclusive at all. The author has mentioned that he might write a sequel, and I think that would be a good idea, because this debut novel ends on a cliffhanger, rather than featuring a conclusive ending. I'm giving this book 5 stars in the hope that Kyle Tolle will continue his work as an author and publish more books. The prose in ""Thoughts of an Eaten Sun"" displays a good use of vocabulary and inventive storytelling. If you are a fan of horror and fantasy, I would recommend this book. But if you prefer YA fantasy or adult fantasy that is not grimdark, then the content of this book will most likely put you off. Although YA fantasy can feature some heavy violence, it is not quite on the same level as watching a movie like ""Predator.""Five stars for an indie author who is hopefully just beginning his publishing journey. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 09, 2019","Jul 14, 2019","Jul 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42516646-thoughts-of-an-eaten-sun

Her second novel (which is not a sequel), ""Sorcery of Thorns,"" was released on June 4, 2019, and has been receiving some good hype, so I thought I would go ahead and read her first book. Many readers have loved ""An Enchantment of Ravens,"" and the book description mentioned ""barrow mounds"" in the story, so I was all in. I wish I had enjoyed this novel. Alas. This book was yikes. The main character, a teenage portrait artist named Isobel, possesses a personality that is both arrogant and foolish, pompous and childish. It's one of the hardest character types for me to connect with. I know that it's currently gauche to call a female main character ""unlikeable,"" but I really didn't like Isobel. For the first 53 pages, she had no aspirations or goals. There was nothing about her that I could connect with or relate to. I didn't find her compelling at all. After page 53, once a crisis with the love interest occurred, and Isobel was forced into the forest against her will, her thinking was often so illogical and disjointed that I just didn't care about her, even when she was in immediate danger. I would have stopped reading this book by page 20, when the love interest, a fae prince named Rook, first appears on the page, and Isobel has an instantaneous and melodramatic reaction to seeing him for the very first time. This scene was so cringey. Isobel makes an attempt at having a goal statement on page 20, but it was only a coyly-worded paragraph of interior monologue that actually meant: ""wow, I suddenly really want to be with this hot fae guy who just saved my life."" The level of cheese and Isobel's complete lack of her own character goals made me wince. But I spent money on this book, and I was determined to get something out of it, so I read almost all of it for trope research, and I came away from this book thinking that the author picked some very, very bizarre tropes for YA. First, this book features a Beauty & the Beast character-reversal for Rook, who outwardly appears to be a gorgeous young man, via fae glamour, but his ""true form"" actually looks like Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings."" Here is how Rook is described on page 58:""In his true form Rook resembled some hellish creature spawned from the forest's heart -- not hideous, precisely, but terrifyingly inhuman. The life had leached from his golden skin, leaving him a sickly tallow gray, with hollow cheeks and hair that tangled about his face like the shadows cast by a briar thicket. His luminous eyes reminded me of a hawk's, soul-piercing and devoid of mercy or feeling. His fingers were uncanny in their length and jointedness, and I could tell by the way his clothes hung from him that he had grown gaunt as a skeleton beneath them. Worst of all were his teeth, each one needle-sharp behind his peeled-back upper lip.""Not only is that *really* un-sexy, but there are many, many pages in this novel in which Rook does not have his glamour, and appears in scene in his ""true form."" If Rook had looked like Gollum, but had also possessed a likeable personality, I would have been fine with his ""true form"" being ""terrifyingly inhuman."" But alas, I found Rook to be even more unlikeable than Isobel. When Rook starts the plot moving on page 53, he arrives at Isobel's house to kidnap her. He is completely enraged, and acting like any other abusive alpha-male love interest that is so typical of this genre. Rook even uses a spell to force Isobel to walk into the woods against her will. A little later, when Isobel has to pee, Rook stands right behind her -- so close that his clothes are touching her -- ""looming over her"" while she ""squats"" in the bushes (page 61). I wish I could erase this entire scene from my mind, but it is burned into my memory in disgust. Rook's inability to grasp Isobel's need for ""privacy"" while she pees is meant to be humorous, and it dramatically shifts his character from the ""alpha-male"" character trope into the Born Sexy Yesterday trope. This trope was identified and named by Pop Culture Detective, who created a vlog to describe it. You can watch his video essay at this link --https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0thpE...As Pop Culture Detective points out in his video, it is rare to see a male love interest embody the Born Sexy Yesterday character trope in mainstream fiction. As Pop Culture Detective states of the rarity of seeing a gender-reversal of this trope: ""Perhaps that's because most grown women don't find the idea of dating an inexperienced adolescent boy all that appealing."" This is definitely part of the reason why I didn't like Rook's character. I also really didn't like that he is first presented as a highly abusive alpha-male, but then embodies Born Sexy Yesterday (bumbling and clueless, outside of his fighting skills) for the rest of the book. After Rook and Isobel go into the forest, they enter the world of the fae, and travel around for a bit. By page 133, they reach the springlands, or the spring court of the fae, where they remain for almost the entirety of the rest of the book (which ends on page 297).Since roughly 80 pages of the overall novel are dedicated to journeying, I wouldn't classify ""An Enchantment of Ravens"" as a journey book. While the characters do travel, the bulk of the novel takes place at a single location (the spring court). There is a scene on page 182 that made me really uncomfortable. Rook decides to lie down in bed with Isobel after both of them have been drinking. Because Rook is in his Born Sexy Yesterday phase, there is no threat of sexual abuse, which was a relief. But when another fae woman comes to check on them, Rook transforms into a raven to hide under the covers. The woman leaves, and Rook wants to transform back into his human form, but Isobel doesn't want him to. She holds him against his will, ""nestled against her stomach,"" while she pets him and croons, ""What a pretty bird you are,"" until they both eventually fall asleep, surrounded by hundreds of ""eyes"" watching them from the hundreds of painted portraits hung on the walls.I didn't like that Isobel held Rook against his will, which also meant that he couldn't transform. If a man did this to a woman in a love story, I would be just as sickened. Isobel's enforced cuddle time, and the fact that she is ""stroking"" a raven in bed with her, instead of Rook in his human form, just reinforced how much I wasn't enjoying this book. The eye imagery was also unnerving and creepy. Overall, the prose in this book was easy to read, and the descriptions of the rotten, maggot-infested forest creatures were interesting. There was a nasty surprise during a party scene at the spring court that was pretty revolting, and therefore fun to read. 1.5 stars rounded up to 2. Although I personally didn't enjoy this book, ""An Enchantment of Ravens"" is recommended for fans of romance, fae stories, and forest settings. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jul 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38472041-an-enchantment-of-ravens

""Paper Princess"" is the first in a trilogy. All three books have been published. The fandom is large and loyal for this series, which is why I picked this up. I know that ""YA erotica"" is not technically a genre, but this book was marketed and published as Young Adult, and this book contains graphic sexual scenes, including detailed scenes of sexual violence. The scenes of sexual violence are written to be titillating, and lead to the main character having multiple orgasms. This book is an example of what is often called smut. It is YA erotica, and I personally didn't think it was very good erotica, since I severely disliked the abusive love interest. But of course, tastes vary. A lot of readers adore Reed Royal, the 18-year-old ""super-rich bad boy"" who falls in love with Cinderella/Ella Harper in this story. Ella is a 17-year-old orphan who is suddenly and randomly taken into Reed's family home; she becomes his father's ward during her junior year of high school. Reed has four brothers in high school and college who are all super-rich, super-hot, and super-bad-boys along with him. Their father, Ella's new guardian, is also super-rich, super-hot, and super-bad. The family patriarch even has sex a few times in front of his children and Ella during the course of the book. A lot of readers loved all the angst, violence, and smut in this book. Personally, this was the first book I've ever read that made me feel like I needed to spray myself off with Lysol after I put it down. I just found it all really gross. I picked this book up with an open mind, but within the first few pages, I knew that ""Paper Princess"" was too unrealistic and melodramatic for me to ever enjoy. This novel makes the histrionic storytelling in soap operas like ""Days of Our Lives"" look like serious war journalism in comparison. Although I am rating this book a one-star because I found it boring as well as repulsive, there are two things that this book does really, really well. The first is that the writing is *strong*. This is very good prose -- the grammar, the sentence mechanics, paragraph structure, and scene flow -- all of this is objectively very good. The book is easy to read and the writing is strong. This novel has fluid, fast prose full of voice. The second item that makes this book stand out concerns its employment of popular tropes. For trope usage, ""Paper Princess"" uses the most popular, satisfying YA tropes very well. For what it is, this book did a stellar job. I found it repulsive, but I have to give the tropes their due as being the most popular tropes in the YA book market.Of course, tropes only go so far in explaining a book's popularity. I continued to read almost all of ""Paper Princess"" as an exercise in trope deconstruction, because I know that not all tropes are created equal -- some are much, much more powerful than others. And picking certain tropes to work in combination together can enhance them even more. ""Paper Princess"" not only picked *very* powerful tropes, but combined them in a much more potent mix. Trope combination is also highly specific to a particular audience. To know which tropes will perform well vs. not be as compelling depends upon the target audience. Not all audiences are the same. ""Paper Princess"" knew its target audience very well. I'll list out a few of the most popular tropes this book uses, in case there are any writers reading this  who are interested, and might want to pick this book up for a trope deconstruction, which is how I ended up reading this book.*****1. The Happy Prostitute trope. When the story begins, Ella is an underage stripper who is making good money, has never been sexually assaulted, and is still a virgin who is totally ignorant/innocent about the mechanics of sex in all of its forms, including how to give a blow job. She has been stripping since she was fifteen. Ella is tough and proud of her body because the opportunity to strip for cash as a teenager has made her strong, wise, confident, and super-hot. (First side note: the Happy Prostitute is a trope that upholds porn culture and rape culture in all ways. Hence, this trope's abundant appearance in popular culture, such as in novels like this one.)(Second side note: underage strippers do *not* make ""good money."" Neither do underage porn stars, or any other adolescents and children who are forced into sex work. But this book is 100% unrealistic, and the Happy Prostitute trope always requires a foundation of unreality in order to work.) 2. The 45-year-old woman's mindset in a 17-year-old virgin's body trope. Always a favorite in modern YA, Ella has the hardened worldview of a grown woman in her mid-forties, but she also has the lithe, sexy, porn-ready body of an adolescent girl. 3. The sausage-fest trope. Lots of dicks, and mostly one vagina. Once Ella is taken in as a ward, she is one of only two (sexy) women who live in a household full of super-rich bad boys. The other woman is older, and she is dating Reed's father, but this older woman is also Ella's sexual competitor, and she is written to be super vile and disgusting. 4. Women as competition trope. See trope #3.5. The vengeance equals justice trope. This trope is used when a scene of physical violence and vigilantism is upheld as ""justice"" in a novel; when the vigilantes are rewarded in the narrative because the text frames them as heroes whose behavior is worthy of emulation and praise. In porn culture books like this one, the trope is always used to ""serve justice against"" a sexual predator. In the case of ""Paper Princess,"" no rapists are killed, but one date rapist who almost rapes Ella is violently assaulted and publicly humiliated. The book gets a *lot* of mileage out of this trope. 6. The rags-to-insta-riches trope. Other popular YA books that use this trope: ""Warcross,"" ""Harry Potter,"" and too many other titles to list. Many readers tend to enjoy reading about characters ""in poverty"" when those impoverished characters quickly find themselves with piles of gold and big bank accounts. ""Paper Princess"" utilizes this trope very well. 7. Teenagers attending a ritzy private school with sexy uniforms: setting trope. Constant pranks occur because money is no object and civilization has been reduced to a Lord of the Flies kind of high school environment. I understand why this trope is so popular, but when the setting is this histrionic, it's so unrealistic that it bores me. 8. Female main character mouths off a lot but has no real agency trope. Ella talks tough, but when it comes to having real agency, she goes along with what the authors need her to do, because she's a plot puppet, and she's also not as strong as her tough mouth makes her seem. To a lot of readers, Ella seems to be self-determining. I found her to be anything but. Her choices throughout the book did not read as real strength to me. She struck me as very weak-willed and easily cowed on the things that mattered the most, but highly self-determining on matters of no consequence, such as working at a coffee shop and tying Reed to a chair to prove to him she has never given a blow job before. Ella's acts of vigilantism in the story (such as fighting a mean girl at school, and beating up a date rapist) did not counter all of the many, many times she let other people abuse her throughout the book and simply took their abuse as normal, status quo behavior. Ella accepts and sees nothing wrong with a *lot* of the abuse in this book. It definitely increased my revulsion. *****There are plenty of other tropes this book uses, and I didn't even put ""bad boy"" on my list. I guess bad boys are so ubiquitous in YA that they seem more like standard-issue plot points these days, along with having a setting, conflict, rising stakes, and a climax. I would recommend ""Paper Princess"" for anyone who is in the mood to read some YA erotica and knows that the tropes this book uses are ones that they personally enjoy. For myself, I'll be unhauling ""Paper Princess"" as soon as possible. I think this book is gross, and I need to get it out of my house. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Jul 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29508471-paper-princess

McManus, claimed a spot on the New York Times bestseller list for so lThe 2017 Young Adult mystery, ""One of Us Is Lying,"" the debut novel of Karen M. McManus, claimed a spot on the New York Times bestseller list for so long that I dreaded picking it up. I'm not a mystery fan to begin with, so reading a YA mystery had zero appeal.I was greatly relieved to discover that this book *isn't* a mystery. A mystery novel features the goal of solving a murder as its main plot. But within the opening pages of ""One of Us Is Lying,"" it is crystal clear that this is a John Hughes movie in book form. I have never seen ""The Breakfast Club,"" but I feel like everyone in America knows what that movie is about. ""One of Us Is Lying"" is the novel version of ""The Breakfast Club,"" but with a murder thrown in to raise the stakes around the main plot-- and that main plot centers on the love stories and growing friendships of the main characters. Solving the murder case is a minor subplot of this book, a subplot that (supposedly) masquerades as its main plot. That fact made ""One of Us Is Lying"" far more enjoyable to read. There are four main characters, and all four are point-of-view protagonists. Each has a coming-of-age character arc that is centered on romance. Two of the main characters fall in love. One mc deals with a terrible breakup and its aftermath. The fourth mc finds the courage to be with the love of their life. Secondary to the love stories are the growing friendships among the four main characters. All of that material is handled quite well.There is a lot of moral messaging in this book, too. The story is very much pro-diversity in all ways. I liked that a lot. Another big plus: a boy living in poverty remains endgame in the central love story. I could give this book five stars just for that. This is the most feel-good book I have read in a long time. I imagine people have a similar reaction after watching a John Hughes movie, which is certainly why I have never watched one. Those movies are so happy, happy, happy, and I am so salty, salty, salty. But even my bitter soul can appreciate all the sappy-happy-feels in this novel.In all honesty, the mystery in this book is silly. I think this book only qualifies as a mystery if you play cheesy '80s love songs while you read it. That said, I think the final reveal was well done. I appreciated all of the moral messaging at the end. All of the narrative messaging was on point.There are readers who have denounced this book for its negative depiction of people struggling with mental health. I disagree with those critics. There are plenty of teenagers in America who are not receiving the mental health support that they need. School shootings and mass killings at schools are a major problem in the U.S., and the mental health of mass killers does factor into some of those tragedies. It felt good to read about an author handling this material in a YA novel. The writing in this book is very strong on a sentence level. This is objectively good prose, regardless of how anyone feels about the John-Hughes-esque content. The book never drags. Details are carefully chosen. The exposition is lean and effective. The characters and the setting felt authentic to real teenage life, even if it's a rather Hollywood version of real teenage life. Keeping the main plot focused on the love stories kept the pages turning quickly. I can fully understand why this book sold so well, and stayed on the bestseller list for as long as it did. That makes me glad. This isn't a book I would push into anyone's hands, but if you love John Hughes films, and are looking for a feel-good YA novel, I think you would enjoy this book. Five stars. Very well done. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 04, 2019","Jun 12, 2019","Jun 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32682118-one-of-us-is-lying

Duncan. It is the first book in a planned trilogy. If you are a fan of Leigh BardThe 2019 YA fantasy, ""Wicked Saints,"" is the debut novel of Emily A. Duncan. It is the first book in a planned trilogy. If you are a fan of Leigh Bardugo's ""Shadow and Bone"" series, and are craving some Alina/Darkling fanfiction, then this book is here for you. You will find extra enjoyment in ""Wicked Saints"" if you are also a Kylo Ren fan, and find yourself wishing you could have Kylo Ren's babies. Had I known that, I certainly would have avoided this book. I went into the story cold, and immediately discovered that the prose is awful: grammatically sloppy, repetitive, disjointed, and nonsensical. Here is a sentence from the very first paragraph:""It was late afternoon, just before Vespers, a time where [sic] psalms to the gods were given up in an effortless chorus."" (page 1)That was my first red flag that I was reading a clusterf*ck. The sentences began in a nadir of bad prose, and just kept going down; there was truly no end to this slop pit. The ill-conceived word choice mirrored the plot holes, character inconsistencies, and melodramatic nonsense that make up the whole story. In the second half of the novel, the prose became so repetitive, hyperbolic, and meaningless, I felt my brain shutting down, preferring death to even skim-reading this mess. ""Wicked Saints"" was published by Wednesday Books, an imprint of St. Martin's Press, which is part of Macmillan. The editor cited in the Acknowledgements is Vicki Lame. I know that authors always have the final say in every word that appears on the page. But it saddens me that such a carefully-marketed debut novel can still feature such sloppy, nonsensical prose, and people are paying money for this.There were also constant shifts in point of view, when the narrative switched between close third person and omniscient third person. Here is one such paragraph on page 5, shortly after the monastery bells have begun to sound the alarm, warning Nadya and the other residents of an attack:""She shoved open the heavy doors that led behind the sanctuary, only managing to move them enough for Kostya and herself to slip through. The tolling of the bells pounded against her temples, painful with each heartbeat. They were made to pull everyone out of sleep at three in the morning for services. They did the job."" Leaving aside that appalling ""painful with each heartbeat"" sentence, which is shockingly bad, the author's choice to add the last two sentences into that paragraph are a POV shift. The prose shifts from the main character's point of view into the author's omniscient third person narration. The author wanted the reader to know that on a typical day at the monastery, the bells sound at three a.m., loud enough to wake everyone up. But in the story, Nadya is already well aware that the bells are tolling at a different time, and that they are warning of an attack, not calling anyone to a service. Nadya was also wide awake and peeling potatoes when the bells started tolling, not in bed asleep. The information in the paragraph's last two sentences doesn't arise from Nadya's point of view, but from the author's desire to dump omniscient world-building and backstory into a high-action scene. It's aggravatingly sloppy prose that slows the story down with useless drag. The whole book reads like this.Many ers have stated that the writing in this book is ""really good."" I emphatically disagree. This is *not* good prose. Even on a storytelling level, ignoring all the mechanics of writing, this novel is constantly contradicting itself, as if the author cannot remember what information she has given the reader between one page and the next. For instance, on page 4, these sentences appear:""The cellars shook and dirt rained down. Nadya looked at Kostya, whose gaze was flint-eyed but fearful. They were just acolytes with kitchen knives. What could they do if the soldiers came?""But that information turns out to be a lie. Nadya is a trained warrior at the monastery, which is quickly revealed a few pages later, and best summarized by this sentence that appears on page 209:""Nadya liked taking spells apart, casting magic that wasn't flashy or dangerous. She had been trained for destructive magic -- for spells that would turn the tide of battle -- but she liked doing smaller things most.""When the story begins, Nadya is certainly much more than ""just an acolyte with a kitchen knife."" But the novel persists in presenting her in the most disjointed, nonsensical way possible, depending upon the whims of the author. Nadya is either a witless, untrained child or a highly-trained fighting machine -- her characterization changes from one page to the next throughout the story. This is one of the most obvious signs of bad writing.While I am not a fan of the ""Shadow and Bone"" trilogy, I did enjoy the first book in that series, enough that I could pick up on some of the most obvious similarities between ""Wicked Saints"" and ""Shadow and Bone."" Here are a few direct character and world-building tie-ins that I can name:Shadow and Bone/Wicked SaintsBagra/Pelageyavulcra/VulturesMal/MalachiaszBlack Heretic/Black Vulture, the hereticAlina/NadyaThe second half of ""Wicked Saints"" becomes heavily focused on the romantic relationship between Kylo Ren and Alina -- by which I mean, Malachiasz's Darkling-esque character and Nadya. Here is one such tender moment on page 203, at the very beginning of their budding romance:""He took her chin in his hand, his nails cold and sharp against her skin. He could press a little harder and rip open the flesh of her jaw. Her heart sped up, but she couldn't tell if it was from fear or something else. [...] His hair brushed against her cheek, his mouth hovering so near to hers that she could feel her lips trembling. Her knees felt weak. His gaze lingered on her lips.""I honestly cannot comprehend how the thought of having the ""flesh ripped from my jaw"" while I am contemplating my ""first kiss"" with a man is meant to be romantic or erotic. If someone asked me if I would like to have an icicle rammed into my cervix, I would have a similar reaction to how I felt reading that passage. When I was a kid, my friend used to play a really awful trick on her little brother, in which she would get up in the middle of the night and flip his bedroom lights on and off really fast, screaming, ""Welcome to hell!!"" She thought her game was hilarious. While reading ""Wicked Saints,"" I kept feeling like the author was acting like my friend with her little brother, only I was the little brother in bed, wondering what in the f*ck was going on.One star. Not recommended. Unless, of course, you are craving Alina/Kylo Ren fanfic. In which case, definitely pick up ""Wicked Saints.""

I did not enjoThe 2017 YA fantasy, ""Windwitch,"" is the second book in Susan Dennard's 'The Witchlands' series, which began with ""Truthwitch"" in 2016. I did not enjoy ""Truthwitch"" at all, but I felt compelled to read ""Windwitch"" after learning that Susan Dennard had spoken publicly against the toxic masculinity featured in so many YA novels. Ms. Dennard stated that she had learned, belatedly and much to her chagrin, that she had written toxic masculinity into her male love interest in ""Truthwitch."" In an interview, Ms. Dennard stated that she had taken steps to correct that in the sequel.I was very interested to see the changes for myself, so I picked up a copy of ""Windwitch"" at my library. I didn't hate this book, but I didn't enjoy it, either. I managed to carefully read the first 70 pages of this novel, and then I skim-read the rest, slowing to examine the scenes that featured the offending toxic male characters, in order to study how they were written.""Windwitch"" features five different point-of-view/POV main characters, and all of them are introduced to the reader within the first 50 pages. This book is a lot of work to read. I think the plot is more thoughtful in this book than in ""Truthwitch,"" but there is so *much* plot in this book that it's pretty taxing to read. The story features nonstop action. The characters never get any down-time or moments of quiet relaxation or reflection in this book. It's a constant Go! Go! Go! of Plot! Plot! Plot! for all five of the POV characters, with zero moments of pleasure or calm. Even Dan Brown gave his characters some tea and cookie time in ""The Da Vinci Code,"" with some poisoned food making an appearance. ""The Da Vinci Code"" moves at breakneck pace, but the ""breathing room"" scenes still appeared in that book, adding important moments of rest, so the reader can catch their breath. ""Windwitch"" dispenses with all of that. The biggest impact of that choice is that it makes the book read more like playing a video game than reading a novel. Adding to that sensation is the fact that the POV characters never have emotional reactions to any in-scene trauma in this story. In ""Windwitch,"" sailing ships blow up, killing all aboard, fields of rotting corpses become hiding places for teenagers, mutilated bodies are encountered in gardens and forests, corpses reanimate and start attacking, etc. etc. -- but the POV characters could just as well be looking at some daffodils in bloom, or some old shoes discarded in the dirt, for all the emotional impact the body count ever has in this book. It really does feel more like playing a violent video game, where the gamer's avatar shoots people or blasts them away in sprays of blood before charging into the next ""wow-so-cool"" setting of explosions and death.To Ms. Dennard's credit, I think she provided a good service to her readers by making sure toxic masculinity was no longer being rewarded with lusty, almost-sex scenes in this book, as happened in ""Truthwitch."" But the offending character from Book 1 and his lady love are *never* together in scene in this book. I would have to pick up the next book to see what actually becomes of the author's good intentions with him. A second male character from Book 1 was also a toxic male, and he spends most of his time in-scene with his lady love in this book. That male character is no longer an established villain, as he was in Book 1; I thought their scenes were okay. Not great, but not horribly offensive to me. I'm honestly not compelled by any of the romances in this series, so it's hard to feel anything for these couples. I don't find the bloodwitch or the windwitch attractive as leading men at all. I wish the lady loves would just find better witch-dudes to get their kiss on with, but that's me.I'm also not a fan of Ms. Dennard's use of verbs. The first two sentences of this novel are:""Blood on the floor.It weeps sideways, pooling in a moonbeam before the gentle roll of the ship sends it trickling back the other way.""That first sentence is a fragment, and I'm happy to report that fragments are not typical of the writing style of the whole book. But using narrative exposition to claim that blood can ""weep"" *is* very typical of the verb choices used in third person throughout the novel. It's super aggravating to me to slog through imprecise verbs. I don't read the author's verb choice [blood weeps] as poetical or lyrical, but as deliberate confusion or sloppiness. Incorrect verb choices slow down the prose a lot. 1.5 stars rounded up to 3 for the good intentions of the author and the importance of calling out toxic masculinity in YA love interests. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 09, 2019","Apr 08, 2019","Mar 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29939390-windwitch

The prose was ponderous as well as repetitive, the heavy-handed romantic plotline was tepid by a factor of ten-thousand, and the novel featured extremely disjointed worldbuilding, along with the most foolish rebel leader I have ever encountered in a YA novel.""Mirage"" is a combination of ""The Prince and the Pauper"" and ""Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" fanfiction. In interviews, the author makes her love for ""Attack of the Clones"" and its influence on her novel quite clear. If this sounds like a good time to you, then please pick up the book and read it. Unfortunately for me, the worldbuilding made absolutely no sense, and therefore the white colonialism allegory the novel set out to construct fell flat for me. As many other ers have pointed out, ""Mirage"" features a real-world medieval-Moroccan-inspired Star Wars-esque setting that doesn't actually work the way that the Star Wars setting works. The main character/sole point-of-view protagonist in this book, a teenage girl named Amani, has a medieval Moroccan worldview and she has grown up in a medieval Moroccan setting -- i.e. a world that has not yet invented the printing press, the microscope, the combustion engine, the novel, or gone through the Enlightenment -- and yet all of the people in ""Mirage"" have huge spacecraft they can conquer the galaxies in, and they employ a variety of droids as servants, just like the characters in the Star Wars universe do. Because the story has a medieval setting/medieval worldview, with the addition of futuristic tech artificially inserted into the story, ""Mirage"" isn't really an Afrofuturism tale. The author doesn't even use the term ""Afrofuturism"" to describe this novel at all, probably because she knows she didn't create a future world; she created a medieval Moroccan setting and added droids and spacecraft, as if technology exists in a vacuum, independent of the cultures, worldviews, and landscapes of the people who have created the tech. Before I continue this , I need to make a statement about technology and human history: in order to create spaceships and droids, the medieval world had to go through the Enlightenment, and create all of the other technology that has made droids and space travel possible. This includes: the printing press, the novel, the combustion engine, and everything else that has shaped what we know as ""modernity."" The author does not agree with the above paragraph. She wrote ""Mirage"" in order to reject dominant Western modernity, and simply write droids and spaceships into medieval Morocco, because Star Wars. After I finished the book, I watched this interview with Somaiya Daud, which was uploaded by Chelsea R. Grimmer (link below) --https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS8JP...Titled: ""Somaiya Daud on YA SciFi, Colonialism, and Poetry"" -- this interview explained a lot about why this book did not work for me.In the link above, and in other interviews promoting this book, Somaiya Daud has stated that she translated 11th century Arabic poetry into English, and then presented it in her novel as her own work. I was so shocked and appalled to hear she had done that, I carefully looked over the hardback edition of ""Mirage,"" and read through the Acknowledgements, too -- and there is *no* mention of the poets or the work Somaiya Daud translated and put into her book as her own. This is just straight-up unethical. I don't care who you are or whose work you are translating. If you take poetry you didn't write, translate it, and put into your novel, you need to credit the poet whose work you took. I don't care about copyright domain or the fact that dead 11th century poets can't sue modern American authors. No one should steal other people's work. It's f*cking wrong. Just because Somaiya Daud ""wrote the English version"" of a poem does not make it her poem. And the fact that her agent, her editor, and her entire publishing team also had no problem with her doing this is horrifying to me. This is just so f*cking wrong in all ways. I mean, what does modern publishing even stand for, that this is happening in a 2018 YA novel? Where the f*ck are our values?On the book jacket, it is stated that ""Somaiya Daud is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington."" She should clearly understand what plagiarism is. Anyway, moving on.Also in the interview cited above, Somaiya Daud states that the poetry she used in ""Mirage"" was written in al-Andalus/Muslim Spain, and that she crafted her worldbuilding to follow an 11th century worldview, then added droids to give the book a sci-fi element. As she states around the 17:00-minute-mark: ""If I'm going to create a world that's based around this particular like, [11th century] Moroccan culture, I can't do that and then pretend that they have the novel, right?""To any reader like me, who doesn't agree with the idea that droids and spacecraft can exist in a world that hasn't yet created the novel, the printing press, or gone through the Enlightenment, or ""been forced to modernize,"" Somaiya Daud states around the 5:00-minute-mark that what I am actually expressing is ""an unacknowledged racism"" by not appreciating her worldbuilding. I can completely accept that this author, who is a person of color, is accusing me, a white reader of YA fantasy, of racism. I will go ahead and say that yes, I am a reader with white skin, and yes, I benefit in countless ways from a racist power structure in the United States that prioritizes and lauds white skin in all ways. I cannot separate the racist hegemonic discourse that shapes my worldview from all of my conscious and unconscious thought; no one can. If the author wants to believe that my points about not enjoying her worldbuilding are solely due to my racism, then I respect her right to hold that opinion.But I do not believe that my lack of enjoyment of her worldbuilding is driven by the fact that the author is a person of color. I am just a lover of history and science, anthropology and the arts, and all human endeavor that makes culture possible. I did not enjoy the worldbuilding in ""Mirage"" because it was completely disconnected from reality and all believability. If droids were inserted into medieval Morocco, or colonialist spaceships were inserted into medieval Morocco, then the ""modern ideas"" that have shaped that technology would be inserted right along with them. Tech doesn't exist in a void. That is why the modern world is so damn difficult for cultures and people in power who ""do not want to modernize"": you can't get the ""stuff"" without ""the ideas"" that made that stuff possible. Leaving the worldbuilding aside, the story features a female rebel leader from the marginalized/oppressed group of people of color. Her name is Massinia. Massinia convinces Amani to become a spy for her. Amani risks her life to steal important information from the white-colonial-esque Vathek Empire. Massinia benefits greatly from Amani's work as a spy. Then Massinia decides to eliminate Amani, either by assassinating Amani herself or the 17-year-old Vathek princess Amani is pretending to be. There is no reason to do this, and every reason to keep using Amani as a spy. With rebels and rebel leaders this cruel and inept, I have no desire to root for the rebellion in this book. They sound just as disgusting as the Vathek Empire, and at least the Vathek Empire operates with some kind of intelligence, however brutal their hierarchies may be.As an example of the repetitive prose in this book, here is a quote from page 28:""I was dragged up a ramp to a Vathek cruiser, and my last sight of home was the kasbah, lit by the spark of fire a droid had set just as the doors shut.""Chapter 3 ends with those lines, and Chapter 4 begins with these lines on page 31:""I'd dreamed forever of leaving Cadiz, of visiting other star systems in our galaxy. But I'd never thought I would be taken against my will. I was dragged through the building, pulled onto a ship, silent and numb, then finally deposited in a holding cell.""If you enjoy reading novels that repeat information like this, you might enjoy reading ""Mirage."" Other readers have called this prose beautiful and well-crafted. I call it the kind of prose that I have to skim-read or skip large sections of, or I will just long for death due to boredom. The sequel to this book, ""Court of Lions,"" is due to be published in 2019. I certainly won't be continuing this series.One star. Frustrating and boring. Unethical.

Every romantic element in this Labyrinth-retelling/Hades-and-Persephone-marriage-in-hell love story made me break out in mental hives. I didn't enjoy this novel at all. First, I need to express how much I hate stories that moralize women's physical bodies. The main character in this book, Liesl, is repeatedly said to be ""ugly,"" with a female body lacking in ""curves"" and outward attractiveness. Her sister is repeatedly described as being ""pretty"" and ""curvy,"" with a busty chest and ample hips -- i.e. hips more generous than Liesl's. Not only is Liesl's sister highly attractive to men, she is also very lascivious, and portrayed as ""less than"" Liesl for being so boldly sexual. Liesl has a rich interior life, a selfless demeanor, a higher I.Q., and a passion for music, whereas her sexy, curvy sister is happily lusty and lacking in character/moral fortitude due to her wantonness. It pains me that YA novels, even YA fantasy novels, are still moralizing women's physical bodies like this. To give a ""curvy, sexy woman"" a lascivious-and-vapid personality to match her ""lust-provoking physical body"" is so common, and so wrong, it just sickens me to see it in books. Liesl spends the first half of the book freeing her lusty sister from the Goblin King, a magical man who is using the sister as bait to catch Liesl. A little over halfway through the book, the sister is returned to the living world, and Liesl gives herself in marriage to the Goblin King.What follows is a lot of weird, brutal, and cringe-inducing sex scenes, interspersed with long scenes of miscommunication or no communication between the two main characters. By the very end of the novel, the Goblin King and Liesl finally start opening up to each other, and sharing important personal information that they couldn't tell each other before for no discernible reason. But this happens only a few hours before they divorce/formally end their marriage and split up, with Liesl returning to the human world and the Goblin King staying in the Underground.""Wintersong"" reads less like a marriage tale and more like a modern, dysfunctional teenage relationship, where the guy is having brutal porn-sex with a girl who isn't sure if the guy even likes her, and no matter how much she wants to know if he really desires her or if he's just using her, it's clear to the reader that the guy could get another girl anytime and everything just feels pathetic. Here is the sex scene in which Liesl and the Goblin King have sex for the very first time, after they are married -- ""He presses against me, lost in the wilderness, and the side of his arm catches against my throat. I cough, but the Goblin King does not hear. My gasps are strangled and tears start in my eyes. Fullness. There is fullness. It hurts. I hurt.""""[...] I start to cry in earnest, a rush, a torrent of emotion, of beauty, of shame. My mind goes blank and I am nothing but my body."" (page 302)I just want to say, if any man ever started choking me and making me cough during sex, I would make him *wish he were dead* in about .002 seconds. Being strangled while I lose my virginity isn't goddamn romantic to me, and I'm horrified that I encounter scenes like this in YA novels.After Liesl's first sexual encounter, she and the Goblin King fall asleep in his bed, and she wakes up before he does. Liesl tells the reader --""I was naked, I was sore, and between my thighs was a mess of blood. I suddenly wanted nothing more than to be away from here, back in my own chambers, clean and alone."" (page 305)I count my blessings that I have never had consensual sex that made me bleed, and I would just like to point out, for the record, that this is *most frequently* a sign that a woman hasn't been properly lubricated before a large object is inserted into her body, whether the woman is a virgin or not. Liesl was clearly scared at the time the Goblin King's ""fullness"" entered her, and it doesn't surprise me that he tore her vaginal walls and caused her to bleed. A lot of ink has been spilled by people far smarter than me who keep trying to let the world know that young women feel lust, that feeling lust isn't a sign of moral depravity or a vapid interior life, and that losing your virginity does not need to come with tearing, blood, or pain. And yet, YA authors keep ignoring that data in favor of writing brutal porn-sex into books, which further normalizes painful, abusive sex and the mistreatment of women's bodies. If you enjoy reading porn-sex and angst-filled teenage relationships full of miscommunication or no communication, starring an ""ugly"" girl who is desperate to find out if her lover thinks she is ""pretty"" before he f*cks her and makes her bleed, you might find the love story in ""Wintersong"" a lot more romantic than I did. I cannot in good conscience recommend this novel to anyone. S. Jae-Jones is a good writer, and her sentences and language choice are very strong; overall, her prose style is well-suited to the YA genre. But the content of this book made my stomach twist with horror, and it wasn't due to the author's creepy depictions of the Underground, but all of the sexual content and body-moralizing going on in the story.Two stars. There is a sequel titled ""Shadowsong."" I won't be picking it up.

In the first half of the year, anyway. Erin Morgenstern's much-anticipated second novel, ""The Starless Sea,"" is due out later this year, and the buzz for that book feels about equal to the buzz surrounding ""King of Scars.""First, I must say I would only recommend ""King of Scars"" to readers who are already familiar with the ""Shadow and Bone"" trilogy and the ""Six of Crows"" duology. If you pick up ""King of Scars"" without having read those other books, you are gonna be hella confused trying to slog your way through this.Some background on where I stand with the previous books: ""Shadow and Bone"" remains a 5-star read for me, even though I admit that the racist stereotypes and cultural appropriation on display in that book are problematic as f*ck. I did not like the two sequels at all. They were both skim-reads for me, with very little investment in anything past book 1. ""Six of Crows"" was beautifully written (from a technical/writing craft standpoint), but I could not stand the ableism, misogyny, racist stereotypes, and other problematic material in the narrative of that book, and it was a one-star read for me. I did not read the sequel, ""Crooked Kingdom,"" but from listening to interviews with Leigh Bardugo online, I know that Matthias dies in ""Crooked Kingdom."" Since ""King of Scars"" picks up after the end of ""Crooked Kingdom,"" I wasn't surprised to read that Matthias was dead.""King of Scars"" is told through multiple points of view/POVs, and combines characters from the ""Shadow and Bone"" trilogy with the ""Six of Crows"" duology. This book was written for the fandom, and specifically, for the fandom around a character introduced in book 2 of the ""Shadow and Bone"" trilogy: Nikolai Lantsov. I fully admit that I picked up ""King of Scars"" for the Nikolai Show. I wanted to know if Leigh Bardugo could pull it off: if she could actually write a whole novel starring the liveliest, snarkiest, most charismatic character from her canon. My answer is: sort-of yes, but mostly no. Nikolai is a POV character, and he does (sort of?) have a character arc in this book. It's a very weak one, but technically, it's there. Leigh Bardugo wrote a number of retcons/retroactive continuity plot points into this book -- and the first big retcon from the ""Shadow and Bone"" trilogy was that Nikolai is still cursed as a monster (rather than being healed of the monster curse, as I was led to believe in the original trilogy); and Nikolai, as a monster, is also acting as a horcrux/soul-vessel/life-continuation force for the Darkling, who -- RETCON -- planned for his death all along, and the Darkling has now Grishaverse-horcrux'ed his way back to life by the end of ""King of Scars.""(Side note: the word ""horcrux"" belongs to the Potterverse, not the Grishaverse, but since I don't recall Leigh Bardugo giving the Darkling's soul-survival-things a name in ""King of Scars,"" I'm just calling the Darkling's ""psych, I'm not really dead!"" magical come-back-to-life things horcruxes.)Was I excited to see the Darkling come back, a la Voldemort-soul-power at the end of this book? No. It just didn't make sense. I call it a retcon because I never got the sense in the ""Shadow and Bone"" trilogy that the Darkling ever believed he could or would be defeated. His hubris felt boundless. In reflecting on this fundamental change in his character, I thought about how YA author Sarah J. Maas made retcon-ing YA characters *super* popular (see: Rhysand in ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" vs. Rhysand in ""A Court of Mist and Fury""), and ""King of Scars"" felt like Leigh Bardugo had decided to copy Maas and do some plot-pulls with her characters. ""King of Scars"" is slow, slow, slow, and very boring. The first half of the book switches among four different POV characters: 1.) a boy who I don't think is ever seen again after Chapter One, 2.) grief-stricken Nina from ""Six of Crows,"" 3.) mean-girl-turned-general Zoya from ""Shadow and Bone,"" and 4.) Nikolai. I really wish the whole book had just been told from Nikolai's POV, but then ""King of Scars"" might have actually been fun to read, and that didn't feel like the goal of this book. It was a slog.Of the three principal characters: Nina, Nikolai, and Zoya -- none of them have personal goals in this book. Nikolai technically wants to get rid of his curse/monster self, but since his curse/monster self reads as a stand-in for emotional pain/physical pain/and *all* of Nickolai's vulnerability, it's not really a goal for him to get rid of it, but to accept it and endure it, which is what he ends up doing. I guess the only way he can rid himself of the curse is by killing the Darkling -- again! -- when we all know at this point that -- RETCON! -- the Darkling could just come back again, leaving Nikolai with his monster curse for the rest of his life, which is what I think Leigh Bardugo intends to do in this duology. If Nikolai's only vulnerability is his monster curse, he's not going to be interesting anymore without it.The only ""personal goals"" that exist in this novel are that Nina, Nikolai, and Zoya all want their 1860-esque-Russian country of Ravka to survive/not be defeated by a foreign power. This goal is seriously the most NOT-compelling thing I have ever read in a YA novel. Sorry not sorry, but I do not give a damn if Ravka survives or not. If the fantasy Germany, China, or Netherlands in this story-world wipes Russia/Ravka out, I do not care. Ravka is a brutal nation and I can't force myself to be on #TeamRavka, especially since Ravka is just Leave No Stereotype Behind Russia, and I just can't with it. But those are the stakes in this book: will fictional Ravka survive, or will one of Ravka's fantasy-foes develop superior weaponry and wipe Ravka out? Read the 511 pages of this book to find out!Fans of Peter the Great will be able to see how much Leigh Bardugo borrowed from his real life to craft Nikolai's characterization and fixation with early submarine tech in this book. I was like: wow, Peter the Great much in this book? Well, okay. It's Leave No Stereotype Behind Russia, after all. The real-life borrowing fits. Submarine tech is really post-1860 but everything is always a mash-up in the Grishaverse, so combining Russia's first navy + Peter the Great + humorously anachronistic submarine tech is just part of the fun here. Sadly, though, it was still boring. Characters who lack personal goals and personal stakes are very, very boring to read about. I could only make it through the first 165 pages of this book, and then I just skipped a massive chunk of the book, and picked up skim-reading on page 244, looking for something interesting to snag me. By that point, I had to skip all of Nina's POV chapters, not only due to boredom, but because they had no bearing upon the Nikolai-Zoya storyline taking place elsewhere in Ravka. To see how Nina's story impacts Nikolai's sections, readers will have to pick up the next book.In the second half of ""King of Scars,"" a character named Isaak is suddenly introduced, and arrives on the page as a POV character. I skipped Isaak's chapters altogether. When he dies in the final pages, I was *really* glad I hadn't wasted any time reading about him. His storyline seemed really pointless, like it existed only for melodrama and for ""death of a POV character"" points, which many people in the YA fandom keep track of. For readers who are much more invested in the Grishaverse, ""King of Scars"" will be a fun read. I think Zoya really steals the show in this book. If you adore super-strong, super-invulnerable female heroines, and are looking for your next Badass Warrior Girl Who Gives Zero F*cks and Can Out-Snark All The Snarks, then you might really enjoy ""King of Scars,"" because Zoya is even more invulnerable and super-powered than Katsa in ""Graceling,"" and that is saying a lot. Zoya doesn't even have to bear the weight of any kissing scenes in this book. ""King of Scars"" is almost entirely devoid of romance. There are the tiniest glimpses of lust from Nikolai toward Zoya, and Zoya toward Nikolai, but those fleet and fleeting internal thought-flashes are as far as it goes (and don't even appear until late in the second half of the book). If you think romance is a barf-fest to avoid at all costs, then ""King of Scars"" might be for you. Two stars. Not the worst book I've ever skim-read. But I really did not enjoy the retcons, and Zoya stole the show. Nikolai definitely lost some star-power to her; she outshone him in this book. Given that the book's title referred to Nikolai, the fact that the story belonged more to Zoya by the end made the narrative feel even more scattered, especially once the Darkling appears on the very last pages.I'll definitely pass on the sequel....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Feb 12, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36307634-king-of-scars

This book remains as insightful, important, and valid as the year it was published. A number of ers on Goodreads have called this book ""dated."" I absolutely disagree. In the 28 years since this book was first published, the beauty myth has only gotten stronger and more extreme. Female models have gotten even thinner, teenage girls who don't even have driver's licenses are opting to get labiaectomies, pornography has become even more violent, fat-hating and fat-shaming are as vicious and pervasive as ever. Books like Peggy Orenstein's 2016 ""Girls and Sex"" and Gail Dines's 2010 ""Pornland"" update information that Naomi Wolf could not have had in the early 1990s, examining new developments in perceptions of ""female beauty"" and misogyny, but they do not replace this book at all. ""The Beauty Myth"" remains as powerful and true as the day it first hit bookstore shelves.I learned a LOT in this book. ""The Beauty Myth"" is horrifying to read. I am so grateful that this book exists, and that I was finally able to read it. I will forever be counted among the readers who state: this book is as important in 2019 as it was in 1991. I wish I had read this book in 1991. I wish I had read this book in any year before 2019. I didn't even know this book existed. I only learned about ""The Beauty Myth"" because I read a Goodreads interview with Jessica Chiccehitto Hindman, author of the 2019 memoir, ""Sounds Like Titanic,"" and she mentioned ""The Beauty Myth"" in her interview. You can read that interview here --https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/1...After I finished ""The Beauty Myth,"" I watched a number of YouTube interviews with Naomi Wolf.

I have never read the book and have never wanted to read the book. My critique partner thought I should read it, and she informed me of things in her spiritual belief system and the Law of Attraction that I had never heard of before. Namely, that in the New Thought belief system, people ""manifest their own misfortunes in life by choice” -- for instance, people choose to be born into poverty, to be born with a disability, to be killed by a tsunami, or to be raped as a child. According to the belief system of ""The Secret,"" hardships are all a personal choice. People ""thought"" about being killed by a tsunami on July 17, 2006, and those thoughts created the tsunami that killed them. People ""choose"" to be reincarnated into terrible misfortune, like being born with a disabled body to parents in poverty, because they want to ""learn what it is like to live that life.” I had *no idea* that following the Law of Attraction came with such a toxic and delusional form of victim-blaming. I was literally sickened when this woman told me this was her spiritual belief system. For days after the meeting, I read up on the history of New Thought, the Law of Attraction, the principles put forth in ""The Secret,"" and then I picked up a copy of Ms. Ehrenreich’s ""Bright-Sided.""Discovering the level of victim-blaming in the Law of Attraction made me so ill that reading ""Bright-Sided"" was medicine. This is an excellent book. I am truly appalled that anyone believes that human beings ""make"" reality with their thoughts, elevating the human mind to the power of a God, and I'm so, so glad that ""Bright-Sided"" is firmly rooted in reality. Ms. Ehrenreich's book is rich in history, science, and social commentary. Here are a few of my favorite quotes –“Happiness, after all, is generally measured as reported satisfaction with one’s life—a state of mind perhaps more accessible to those who are affluent, who conform to social norms, who suppress judgment in the service of faith, and who are not overly bothered by societal injustice.” (page 169)“The real conservativism of positive psychology lies in its attachment to the status quo, with all its inequalities and abuses of power.” (page 170)“In vastly different settings, positive thinking has been a tool of political repression worldwide. We tend to think that tyrants rule through fear—fear of the secret police, of torture, detention, the gulag—but some of the world’s most mercilessly authoritarian regimes have also demanded constant optimism and cheer from their subjects.” (page 201)*****I highly recommend “Bright-Sided” to any reader who has struggled to understand America’s obsession with positive psychology, New Thought, prosperity gospel preachers, the Law of Attraction, and the victim-blaming that goes along with it. This book examines the dark side of positive psychology, and how this belief system impacts American life in extremely negative ways.Five stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Jan 16, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6452749-bright-sided

Ms. Campbell is an author of a number of self-published novels. She is also an active and very honest member of Goodreads. Her s make it clear that she has no f*cks to give for books she doesn't enjoy. Her authentic opinions have gained her both haters and fans. Personally, I am one of her fans. I enjoy reading her scathing, hilarious, and insightful s. As a reader, I have a lot of authors I admire as people, but that doesn't mean I always admire their books. For example, the YA authors Julie C. Dao, Alexa Donne, and Roshani Chokshi are all wonderful people who I admire as people. But that does *not* mean I automatically five-star their work. There is a tremendous amount of danger in honesty, especially online, and especially when people have the means to retaliate. Ms. Campbell has navigated this path as an indie author, and her book about writing is all the more rewarding for it. I would definitely recommend ""How to Write Good: A Guide for the Aspiring Independent Author"" to all the aspiring authors and writers I know. This book is funny, smart, and well-written. The advice is solid, and Ms. Campbell discusses problems and pitfalls I haven't seen other books mention before. If you're thinking about self-publishing and beginning a career as an indie author, then I hope you'll check out ""How to Write Good"" before you hang up a digital shingle and start selling your work. This is a fun and useful book, and I fully agree with *all* of the advice Ms. Campbell shares in these essays. She speaks from experience, and it shows. My one caveat with this book is that it is *very* short. I'm a slow reader, but I finished this book in one sitting, and that is due to the book's brevity as well as its accessible and witty prose. If Ms. Campbell were to publish a much longer, much more thorough book on the topic of writing, I would buy it and read that as well. I wanted more content -- more pages -- in ""How to Write Good,"" but that is not to say I was disappointed with the pages I had. I just wanted *more* -- and if Ms. Campbell ever writes more on this subject, then I will happily read it.Five stars. Great writing advice.

But I couldn't force myself to read the final chapter. I just hated this book too much, and the idea of reading another page brought me agony.I wish I had never heard of this book. I certainly wish I had never paid full price for a first edition hardback. I thought I was supporting a fellow woman who had grown up in poverty and found a way out, the same way I did. But no, that is not this memoir at all. This book is advertised as ""social criticism."" It is not. This book is compared to ""Nickel and Dimed"" and ""Evicted."" This memoir is nothing like those nonfiction titles. I learned nothing about society from reading this book; all that was offered up for me to learn about in this memoir was the personal life of the author. Stephanie Land was born in 1978, and she grew up in the middle class. At age 18, she could have gone to college. She chose not to. She shredded her college applications and chose to live life as a free spirit, working as a barista and bartender, enjoying her life and smoking a lot of pot. For the next decade, her life was a party. By age 28, she was living with a guy who had already made it clear that he didn't want children. Ms. Land accidentally got pregnant; her birth control failed. Ms. Land was very excited to have a baby, and she thought that her boyfriend might change his mind about kids and be excited, too. Ms. Land hoped they could be a happy family together and leave their free-spirit lifestyles behind. They could buy a house and become part of the middle class. Her boyfriend, however, did not change his mind about wanting children. He reacted to the news with absolute rage, including physical violence, the details of which are only briefly mentioned in this book. Ms. Land stayed with him for a long time after his abuse began, hoping he would change his mind and give her a big diamond ring and a safe home for their family, and be a loving father to their child.Instead of getting a ring, Ms. Land finally had to flee this man's abuse, and because she could only receive free daycare during ""mom hours"" (as she has stated in interviews), she could no longer work as a barista or as a bartender. She found work as a maid, making very low wages, and she learned how extremely difficult life is when you are a single mother raising a child in poverty. Ms. Land does not reflect on her own choices at all, or how her own choices put her into this situation. At every turn, she expresses shock, bafflement, and irritation that she doesn't have the middle class lifestyle she expected to have as a mother, and she blames other people for her suffering: primarily, her lack of a financial safety net in the form of her family. Her family members are all either broke, barely scraping by, or married to people who refuse to give Ms. Land any money. It is clear that Ms. Land feels entitled to financial help from her family, and resents her family for not helping her.Ms. Land also resents society at large for not doing more for her, and frequently complains about the red tape of government programs such as free daycare, free medical care, and applying for housing vouchers. At every turn, Ms. Land is given massive amounts of assistance as a single mother. This assistance eventually puts her through college and allows her to become ""a spokeswoman for the poor"" as a freelance writer, allowing her to stop working as a maid and become a full-time writer. Her memoir is not about expressing gratitude for any of the help she receives from government programs, but complaining about the help she is getting. Other ers have described the voice of this memoir as being ""whiny"" and ""entitled."" I would absolutely agree.Ms. Land does not reflect upon the patriarchy in this book, or why she believed she needed a diamond ring so badly from an abusive boyfriend, or why she assumed that her baby fever would put her into the middle class, or why she kept thinking that her abusive boyfriend would become a loving father. Her great woe in life is her lack of a financial safety net in her family, and the classism she faces as a single mother using government programs for the poor.In interviews, Ms. Land has stated that this memoir became possible after she went to college and wrote an essay that went viral, an essay I will link here --https://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8961799...The voice in that essay is ruthless and cutting. It is not the voice of a woman who sees herself as a victim.But in Ms. Land's memoir, her voice is that of a victim. Rather than being ruthless and cutting, Ms. Land projects innocence, naivete, and an incessant, almost breathless whine. She narrates her life story to present herself as blameless but still doomed to fail: ""woe is me, I am a sweet and good person, I am an innocent victim who has done nothing wrong, it's not my fault that my boyfriend didn't want our baby, and then my family couldn't take care of me and my baby and they should have, my life is so hard and America is so cruel, I had to wait in line sometimes to receive government assistance, and then I had to write this memoir to teach everyone in America that it is really hard to be poor, because no one else knows this but me.""The problem with ""Maid"" is that Ms. Land kept the scathing content in her essay about the homes she was cleaning, and continued to pass judgement on the people she cleaned for. But instead of being a middle-class person of agency who was passing judgement on her employers, Ms. Land's voice in ""Maid"" is one of an innocent victim of poverty, being cruelly debased by a classist society. Ms. Land's chosen combination of blameless victimhood and middle class entitlement, along with her continuing judgement against the middle class she feels she deserves to belong to, made this memoir an extremely unenjoyable and myopic read. Other ers have mentioned the author's white privilege and U.S. citizenship. I would also like to add that she is able-bodied, neurotypical, cisgender, heterosexual, and grew up in the middle class. If you are looking for a memoir that features analysis of what it is like to actually grow up in poverty or in the class just above poverty, this book will not help you. Please read ""Hillbilly Elegy"" instead. If you are looking for a book with actual social criticism, please read ""Nickel and Dimed,"" ""Evicted,"" ""Methland,"" or any number of nonfiction titles about America's poor.This book is not about passing reforms to aid the poor in America, or showing solidarity with people in poverty. This memoir is about Stephanie Land defending herself from the classist judgements she suffered from her middle-class friends after she became a single mother in poverty. One star. Waste of money.

I love watching Donne's YouTube/AuthorTube channel, and I really wanted to love ""The Stars We Steal."" I read her first novel, ""Brightly Burning,"" with the same high hopes. Sadly, I was unable to finish either book. I hit a hard DNF point in ""The Stars We Steal,"" and could barely force myself to skim the final pages, just to see how it ended. I was able to do so only for the purposes of writing this .""The Stars We Steal"" was marketed and pitched as ""PERSUASION meets THE BACHELOR in space."" I have not read Jane Austen's ""Persuasion,"" I have not seen ""The Bachelor,"" but I do enjoy science fiction, and I did enjoy (most of) Kiera Cass's YA novel ""The Selection"" (published in 2012, a dystopian romance modeled after ""The Bachelor""), so I thought I would be fine with the book's content. And for the most part, I was. Because the story is initially given the same set-up as ""Persuasion,"" the opening of the book was compelling. I was very interested to learn the details as to why Princess Leonie/Leo, the 19-year-old first-person protagonist, was so quickly convinced to break off her engagement to Elliot Wentworth three years ago. Formerly the son of Leo's family butler, Elliot is now an extremely wealthy, independent young man, and he is considered ""the biggest catch"" of the ""engagement season"" taking place on Leo's family spaceship. I also really liked the fact that, when the story begins, Leo has designed a new water filtration system, a system that she wants to have the entire space fleet adopt. I always enjoy reading science and engineering-focused protagonists, of any gender, so this character detail was highly engaging. But although the book's content sounds promising, its execution ended up being the biggest problem I had. Leo's interest in water filtration did not feel authentic; there was nothing in her interior monologue, dialogue, or behavior that ever convinced me that Leo actually cared about science, engineering, or water conservation. It was no more a part of her character than, say, an eleventh-grader who takes band in high school and plays the clarinet, has no real interest in being a musician, and is only taking the class because it's an easy elective. That's how much water filtration mattered to Leo's character. As in: not at all. The ""engagement season"" is also nothing like watching ""The Bachelor,"" where women compete for the attentions of one man, a bachelor who chooses which of the contestants passes each ""dating round"" and advances to the next part of the show. The cover of this book features a beautiful gold rose, which is what the women competing in ""The Bachelor"" receive before advancing to the next dating round. But there are no roses being given out in ""The Stars We Steal."" Roses don't even exist on the page. There isn't even a ""dating competition"" in this story. There are just a bunch of young men and women mingling together at random throughout the book, like college students. If you took a college campus, registered everyone on the same dating app, and called their time spent together on campus ""an engagement season,"" you would have this book. The setup really isn't like ""The Bachelor"" at all.As to the details I was most interested in learning -- namely, the backstory concerning how Leo was convinced within 12 hours of her engagement to Elliot to break up with him -- that information is not in the book. The story does not provide any information about Leo's wrenching night of the soul, and what had been on her mind to make her break up with Elliot. Leo simply never gets any interior space in this story. The reader is told she has invented a water filtration system, but Leo has no thoughts or feelings about it. It's just there, a ""thing"" that exists that she supposedly cares about, driving her actions throughout the plot. The reader never sees Leo doing any science or engineering work in the book, yet we are told she ""invented"" a system that she spends no time working on, obsessing over, or even thinking about.The situation is the same with the romance. The reader is told Leo finds Elliot attractive, and still has feelings for him three years after breaking off their engagement. But again, her interior space is just nonexistent. None of Leo's complicated emotional backstory is ever shown to the reader, and that means her current thoughts and feelings are never shown, either. Leo reads as a cipher, a blank space, a body that exists only to follow a three-act plot: Act I: meet the boy she broke up with three years agoAct II: reconnect with himAct III: use that renewed relationship to stop the Big Bad/Ultimate Villain and Save the Day by the end, because sci-fi dystopian fiction.This is a rare YA novel that bluntly addresses the fact of class oppression. The topic is brought up, but it is not handled well, and it is largely just dropped from the second half of the story. The reader is told that Leo ""cares"" about poor people in Act II of the book, and that basically concludes the subject of class oppression. Leo also helps defeat the Big Bad at the end, so the reader is probably supposed to feel like class liberation has occurred, because love conquers all and the Big Bad is now in jail. But class oppression is not created because one Big Bad leader makes shitty decisions. In the first half of the book, ""The Stars We Steal"" honestly addresses the hard facts of class oppression: poverty, starvation, lack of medical resources, premature death, hopelessness, etc. But the book doesn't address the real causes of class oppression, much less any solutions, within its pages at all. Instead, the story just drops the issue after the reader is told, with certainty, that Leo ""cares"" about poor people, and the final third of the book plays out like a typical YA fantasy does: the star-crossed lovers are reunited and the Big Bad is vanquished. Because ""The Stars We Steal"" follows a three-act structure, there is a ""big reveal"" that separates Acts II and III. At the end of Act II, Leo learns that the real source of Elliot's new wealth is not from whiskey sales, but thievery. Elliot uses a group of associates to steal from the rich, and then he sells the stolen goods on the black market.It honestly grossed me out *so much* to discover this -- especially because some of the stolen items included Leo's dead mother's wedding dress, and other personal items -- that I almost DNF'd the book right then. To find out that the love interest in a YA story is a Depraved Shithead at the very end of Act II is an extremely bitter pill to swallow. I do NOT find thieves ""attractive,"" and anyone who has ever had their personal belongings stolen should certainly know how awful it feels. To have someone enter your home and take treasured mementos, especially cherished personal items like your dead mother's wedding dress that you had hoped to wear at your own wedding, is such a harsh violation, that I totally lost all interest in Elliot as a love interest. I thought he belonged in jail. I forced myself to keep reading because I wanted to see how Donne handled this development. And I was so disappointed.Given that the story just rolls on along like any typical YA fantasy does, I must say I don't think the revelation was handled well at all.Instead of keeping the two leads, Leo and Elliot, together on the page, to discuss this horrible development and work out their differences, Donne separates them for nearly all of Act III. Leo distances herself from Elliot, dates another guy for pages on end, and Elliot avoids all contact with Leo.Much later, near the end of Act III, Leo decides to read the letter Elliot wrote for her right after she discovered he was a thief, a letter telling her he was sorry and confessing his love for her, and so the story ends up running on the ""if only they had just talked to each other, all would have been well and every tragedy avoided"" scenario that I never find very appealing, and certainly didn't here.To summarize my main thoughts on this book: ""The Stars We Steal"" felt very empty; empty of genuine characters with genuine thoughts and feelings. It just felt like I was reading a plot, a plot that I was not invested in at all because the characters themselves were not invested in it at all. Despite a compelling and interesting opening chapter, I never felt any stakes, I never felt worried or concerned, I never felt like I had to keep turning pages. Three stars. This isn't a terrible book. It's just very flat. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 10, 2020","Mar 25, 2020","Dec 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40950392-the-stars-we-steal

The Raven Cycle is a set of four contemporary fantasy novels, and the last book, ""The Raven King,"" came out in 2016. I *love* the cover for ""The Raven King,"" and since so many of my Goodreads friends love the Raven books, I had high hopes that I would, too. Alas... alas. I won't be reading the next three books in this series. I was barely able to skim enough pages enough to ""finish"" the first one. Let me start by sharing why I think this book works, even though the book did not work for me. There are three different groups of characters in this novel. Each group features the kind of common stereotypes and wish fulfillment that many readers enjoy. The first character group stars a teenage girl named Blue and her house full of quirky, psychic, magically-gifted women. Blue is special. She is Not Like Other Girls. Her mother and ""aunties"" are like a version of the parental witches in the 1998 film ""Practical Magic,"" and if you've ever seen that movie (starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman), then you can understand the appeal. Blue and her aunties certainly weren't as much fun for me as watching ""Practical Magic,"" and I personally thought the psychic house was an absolute drag on the page, but this group of characters definitely go down as part of What Makes This Book Fun. The second character group is a set of four teenage boys who attend a super rich boys-only prep school that isn't far from Blue's house. The star of the teenage boys is named Gansey. It is stated that Gansey has a trust fund that is larger than most state lotteries. He is super attractive and sometimes insensitive, because rich. Then there is Ronan, another super-rich boy with a tragic past and a bad attitude. Ronan likes to get into intense physical brawls with his brother and skip class. Ronan is very, very smart but he doesn't care about grades or school, because rich.Adam is the third boy in this group. Adam grew up in a trailer park and attends the rich-boy prep school on a partial scholarship. Adam's father constantly beats the crap out of him, but Adam won't move out of the trailer, because pride. Gansey owns an entire warehouse to live in that he bought with his millions, but Adam refuses to live in it, because reasons. ""The Raven Boys"" definitely reads like Ms. Stiefvater grew up in the middle class or upper-middle class, and then wrote her personal theories about trailer park masculinity into this book. The early portrayal of Adam in this trailer made me grind my teeth, but it was a later scene at the trailer that just enraged me. But more on that later.The fourth boy in Gansey's group is named Noah, and halfway through the book, the reader learns that Noah is actually a ghost. He was murdered by a schoolmate (i.e. the antagonist) seven years before the novel begins, and Noah's ghost-self hangs out with the boys because Gansey is searching for an ancient Welsh king. Gansey believes the ancient Welsh king is buried somewhere in Virginia, not far from the prep school.If you are wondering why an Utterly Wealthy Boy needs to find an ancient Welsh king buried in Virginia, then I hope you enjoy the reasons the books supplies: 1.) because Gansey likes the mystery of it, 2.) because Gansey is allergic to bees and once heard a mystical voice telling him about the king while he lay almost-dying from bee stings, 3.) because it is said that the king will grant a wish to the person who wakes him and Gansey wants the wish.The third character group of common stereotypes and wish fulfillment fun involves one man: the antagonist. Formerly Noah's best friend, he now teaches at the rich-boy prep school. I wish the antagonist had just been called The Murdering Asshole, but his last name is actually Whelk. Which, of course, irritated me. Why did the villain have to be named after sea snails? Of all the names a villain can have, why did the author have to do this to sea snails? While this name choice in no way detracted from my already nonexistent enjoyment, I must confess that I was not a fan. Sometimes I just get the feeling an author does not fully appreciate marine gastropods, like when they name their villains after one, and let me just say, my eyebrows were raised. A whole lot of Nothing happens in this book. The ""plot"" is simply that Gansey is searching for this ancient Welsh king. SPOILER: Gansey doesn't find the king. And nothing is resolved by the end of this book. The characters have a starting point, and they end the book by achieving stasis with their starting point. I think you have to read all four books in the series to find an actual plot. Don't look for one here, because the first book simply ends in the same place it begins. ""The Raven Boys"" reads like one giant prologue, and since the book is 408 pages long, that is one helluva slog. The story is told from an omniscient third person point of view. It felt like an uncontrolled point of view to me; the constant head-hopping felt frustrating and lazy, rather than purposeful and crafted. The prose also draws an absurd amount of attention to itself. There are unneeded descriptions, excessive adjectives, dialogue tags that are specifically placed to be annoying and sound pretentious, useless paragraphs and entire passages of text that separate short lines of dialogue for no reason other than it seems like the author believes If It Sounds More Confusing Then It's Good Writing, and multiple scenes that pad the story with plotless fluff. The prose constantly veers off on tangents, especially Tangents of Quirky. It's like the YA version of Iowa Writers Workshop short-story prose, but with a far more limited vocabulary, pointless dialogue, zero lyricism, and zero plot. Halfway through the book, some talking trees make an appearance, and near the very end of the novel, a mystical and super-vague herd of ""white-horned beasts"" run through the forest. The supernatural elements of this book last all of a hot second, and then the story swiftly returns to the mundane world of discussing notebook scribbles, talking on the phone, driving around in cars, and getting dressed. Gansey has his sister fly him around in a helicopter for a short scene, adding some flare to the mix.If there is any ""plot"" in ""The Raven Boys,"" it is the fact that over 150 pages is devoted to the buildup of Blue becoming Insta-Friends with the group of four boys. Overnight, Blue and the four boys all bond, and it's described in the text as ""feeling like"" they've been friends forever, all five of them click together so well. There is no sexual competition, no weirdness, no resentment that Blue just crashed the party and joined the group. No jealousies or petty rivalries from anyone. It's just Wish Fulfillment Du Jour, YA fantasy style. Adam is characterized as staying with his physically abusive/extremely violent father in the trailer park because Adam has an excessive amount of pride. He wants to ""be his own man"" and ""move out on his own terms"" by ""paying his own way."" (Those lines are paraphrased from the text, but they might also be direct quotes.) Adam's refusal to live with Gansey, however, does not make any sense. It just makes Adam look like a fool. I know of *NO* teenage boy who wouldn't move in with his friends in a heartbeat if it meant avoiding a daily beating. Especially since Adam's father beats him so badly near the end of the book that he causes Adam to permanently lose his hearing in one ear.This was the scene when Sh*t Really Went South for me with this book. While I found ""The Raven Boys"" annoying and boring for most of the book, it wasn't until the trailer park scene on page 341 that my apathy turned into rage. Shortly after being dropped off at home, Adam is in the midst of being permanently deafened by his father (i.e. Adam is lying helpless on the ground), when Ronan pulls his car back into the driveway, gets out, and beats the sh*t out of Adam's dad *for* him, thereby saving Adam from his prideful, foolish misery. In reality, Adam's pride would be hurt FAR MORE by needing Ronan to save him from his own father than from moving in with Gansey at the warehouse. But the author writes the scene to show that Ronan's ""sacrifice"" of beating up Adam's father is the act of kindness that finally allows Adam to ""see reason"" and move out of his father's trailer. Ronan, of course, is unscathed by the fight. I grew up around a lot of kids who faced domestic violence and physical abuse at home. Myself included. If a friend had offered me and my younger siblings a free place to live, we would have gone there in a heartbeat. Every single person I knew who lived with physical abuse at home would have done the same thing. The problem was not a matter of ""not taking the help on offer,"" but a problem of having no other options. Staying together as siblings meant staying at home. We loved each other, and we didn't want to leave each other. Adam has no siblings. He has no other reason to stay at home other than his plot-puppet pride. He doesn't act like any real teenage boy I've ever known. And when he *should* feel humiliated, after Ronan has to rescue him, Adam's pride isn't wounded by that fact at all. His pride remains damaged by the fact that he doesn't have the money to pay his own rent *and* pay his tuition fees, despite working a job that pays him $18,423.00 a year, because all of his money goes toward his schooling. This is presented as the reason why Adam won't move out of his father's trailer. Very few high school students are pulling in a yearly income like that. I think that income is currently more than most U.S. soldiers make who enter the service with a high school diploma. It's absurd that Adam doesn't take MASSIVE PRIDE in the fact that he is probably out-earning his father *while* he is attending high school full time.I'll just end by saying that this book felt very classist to me, and it was upsetting to the point that I hate this book.I'm glad that other readers have found enjoyment in ""The Raven Boys."" But this one was definitely not for me. One star.

If you have read any of these nonfiction books -- ""Nickel and Dimed,"" ""Evicted,"" ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" ""The Other America,"" ""Behind the Beautiful Forevers,"" ""Random Family,"" ""Just Mercy,"" ""Between the World and Me,"" ""Thank You For Your Service,"" Nancy Isenberg's ""White Trash,"" or Nick Reding's ""Methland"" -- then please, do yourself a favor, and skip reading this memoir. Or read one of those other books I just mentioned, if you want to learn more about classism and poverty. The intended audience for ""Heartland"" is a white, able-bodied, upper-middle-class American who would struggle to find the state of Kansas on a U.S. map, and has never heard of the word ""classism"" before. If any of these questions sound like legitimate questions you would need to Google to answer -- 'Karl Marx, who was he, a Bond villain?' 'Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, is that like, something on Snapchat?' 'Jimmy Hoffa, wasn't he the purple-haired guy in an episode of Spongebob?' 'Didn't the French have a War on Poverty or something? like, when they cut off that rich lady's head with a guillotine, lolz?' 'Wait, LBJ was a President? wut??' -- then you might really enjoy this book. I learned nothing from ""Heartland"" that the author intended for me to learn. Instead, I discovered that with each page I turned, the tone of the book became more patronizing, and the author's essentialism of class as her One Great Hurdle in Life became more and more problematic. This book has NO MENTION of ableism, sundown towns, the patriarchy, NAFTA, the corporate employment of undocumented immigrants, meth, black tar heroin, the specific income level for the poverty line in America in the 1980s and '90s, the great factory shutdown and relocation of jobs in the 1980s and '90s -- I could go on and on with topics that either never come up in this book or directly come up but are never labeled correctly or discussed in the narrative. Maybe Sarah Smarsh has never heard of sundown towns, or encountered words like ""ableism,"" or researched the income levels for poverty so she could put some actual figures into her book. I really don't know why Sarah Smarsh essentializes class oppression as her One Great Hurdle in Life without ever discussing the larger societal problems that have led to more and more people falling into poverty since Richard Nixon held office. I just know that this book was lacking in all ways for me, and I didn't learn anything. The narrative is scattered and makes chronological leaps without providing transitions, and most of this book isn't even about Sarah Smarsh, but her large extended family in Kansas. ""Heartland"" should have been a home run for me. I truly expected to love this book because of its content, which is why I purchased a copy. Like Sarah Smarsh, I also grew up in rural poverty in the Midwest. We were born in the very same year, just a few months apart. We both attended prestigious universities after graduating from high school. We both knew that having a baby was our ticket to nowhere, and chose to never have children in order to give ourselves a middle-class future. Unlike Sarah Smarsh, I also faced food scarcity, homelessness, severe child abuse, and being raped as a child. I'm really glad Sarah Smarsh didn't have to suffer these things, but her tone in this book never included readers like me, or anyone else who has grown up in poverty. Instead, Sarah Smarsh writes as if she has suffered alone, and uniquely striven alone, and I felt no solidarity with her in this narrative. I don't exist to Sarah Smarsh as a reader. She wrote this book for smug middle-class people who ask questions like, ""Where does wool come from?"" and ""What do chickens eat?"" She didn't write this book for readers like me, and with every page I turned, the narrative condescension increased. I don't know how it is possible for me not to learn anything from a work of nonfiction, and still feel so patronized while reading *a memoir* -- but Sarah Smarsh achieved both of these feats in ""Heartland."" I want to give this book negative stars. I want to tell everyone to avoid it. Please go read ""Methland"" or ""Hillbilly Elegy"" or ""Thank You For Your Service"" instead. As a reader who grew up in poverty, amidst violence and food scarcity and drug use, I felt seen and heard in those narratives. Every book that I listed above has made me feel seen and heard.""Heartland"" just made me so angry. The entire tone of the book was patronizing. The content was shallow and clueless. I'm so f*cking pissed off that I wasted money on this book. I can't believe it almost won a National Book Award. I waited three full months after finishing this book before I wrote this , just to give myself time to cool down, and my wrath is still running white-hot. I wish I had read the first Goodreads page of s for this book, and avoided it. I should never, ever have picked this book up, much less purchased a copy.

This series will be a trilogy, and the third book, ""Finale,"" will be published in May 2019.I did not enjoy ""Caraval,"" but I liked this sequel a lot! The misogyny and rape culture was turned way, *way* down in this book. Another BIG plus: no gratuitous violence!! No. Gratuitous. Violence. (!!!) This book is *nothing* like the gory original, and it was *such* a relief!""Legendary"" read similarly to Tricia Levenseller's ""Daughter of the Pirate King"" for me -- fun, campy, silly, easy to read and easy to enjoy. I also largely ignored the fact that I had ever read ""Caraval,"" because I hated everyone in that book except for Scarlett. I read ""Legendary"" as if it were a standalone, and that allowed me to start a new relationship with each character. That worked well for me because *all* of the characters were written so differently here. In ""Legendary,"" everyone was very decent and acted like human beings. The story also made sense, in terms of character arcs as well as plot. I WAS SO GLAD. Donatella/Tella Dragna is the point of view character in this book (her sister Scarlett was the POV character in ""Caraval""). Both books are written in close third person. I thought Ms. Garber's writing improved in this book. The characters were *definitely* more enjoyable. The plot centers on a romance with a love interest I could *actually* ship. The whole time! (*Grin!*) Tella has a couple of different men she interacts with in this book. Dante is back, and there is a new character named Jacks. Other characters appear that surprised me, given the world-building details in the first book. Paloma's appearance in this story definitely came as a surprise. The prose is repetitive in places, and since I'm not invested in the larger world of this story, I definitely skimmed or just skipped most of the exposition. ""Legendary"" is much longer than it needs to be, but skimming made that bearable. The love story in this book made me happy. There are some great lines of dialogue that made me smile.Reviewers frequently compare Garber's prose to Laini Taylor's, but I just want to say, the way Garber uses metaphor reminds me as much of e. lockhart/Emily Jenkins' prose in ""We Were Liars"" as much as Taylor's prose in ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone."" Especially in ""Legendary,"" the prose is far less focused on whimsy for the sake of whimsy, and the metaphor use was more reminiscent of ""We Were Liars.""Here are some of my favorite lines from the book -- other readers might hate these examples, but I just love them, sentences like these are what make ""Legendary"" such campy fun for me --*****""The air tasted like wonder. Like candied butterfly wings caught in sugared spiderwebs, and drunken peaches coated in luck."" (page 112)""The thick bars of the cage smelled of metal and royal ambition."" (page 128)""He tasted of exquisite nightmares and stolen dreams, like the wings of fallen angels and bottles of fresh moonlight. Tella might have moaned against his lips as his tongue slipped between hers and explored."" (page 133)""But somehow she was in a brand-new dress -- the same silver sea salt and blue as Jacks's eyes, with sleeves held together by a simple tie, a flowing skirt, and a bodice strung with dark thistle ribbons that made her look like a present someone had halfway unwrapped."" (page 284)*****How can I not enjoy this? These sentences make me laugh and laugh, and because there's no gratuitous violence to drag down my good time, the lightness of the story could just *be.* This book is silly and fun and I read it in a day.And there were parts in this book that were deeply moving to me as well. I liked Tella a lot as a main character. She is a flawed and physically-limited human girl. She is sure men are happy to use her, but that no man will ever love her. She doesn't think she is smart enough or good enough to be loved; she isn't chaste or demure or highly literate; Tella is a girl with a pretty face and blonde hair, and people always assume she isn't intelligent, and therefore, expendable. When she has to defend herself from attackers in this book, her fight scene was realistic and well-done. It was also utterly heartbreaking for this moment of truth: ""Unfortunately Tella wasn't the sort of girl people saved -- she was the one they left behind."" (page 273)Bravo, Ms. Garber.

These two books belong to the ""Strange the DreamerThe 2018 YA fantasy, ""Muse of Nightmares,"" by Laini Taylor, is the sequel to ""Strange the Dreamer."" These two books belong to the ""Strange the Dreamer"" duology. I did not enjoy ""Strange the Dreamer"" at all, and I only picked up the sequel because another Goodreads er stated that this book had explicit sexual content. I was shocked to hear that. While a number of YA authors have been writing erotica into their novels, that has never been Laini Taylor's personal style. Romance: yes, indeed. Erotica? No, not at all. I skim-read the first half of ""Muse of Nightmares"" in order to examine the sexual content in this book. I focused on the passages starring Lazlo and Sarai, and a few passages of sexual content starring Feral and Ruby. I was relieved to discover that none of this material qualifies as ""explicit sexual content"" to me. There is certainly nudity, and at one point, Lazlo has Sarai's nipple in his mouth, but that is the extent of the explicit material. This book has no description of touching or examining genitalia, no mention of male or female genitalia, and any act of heterosexual intercourse is always skipped over with an asterisk break and a time jump. The story begins again with the word ""Later,"" and omits the details of what happens after the characters took their clothes off.This is in stark contrast to YA novels that do contain erotica, or explicit sexual content. Laini Taylor did not go full-on ""A Court of Mist and Fury"" erotica-level with this book. And that made me relieved. That said, I did want to say a few words regarding the scenes that I read, and the role of porn culture and the male gaze in this book.Many academics (who are far smarter than me) have pointed out that the rise of porn culture in America has led to a situation in which a lot of adolescent girls, young women, and adult women confuse their own sexualization/sexual objectification with their innate sexuality. When female sexualization/sexual objectification is confused with female sexuality, women view their own sexual pleasure solely in terms of how they look (their appearance). ""Looking hot"" for a male partner is their sole focus; their own sexual desire and pleasure is denied or ignored. Modern hookup culture largely functions this way, and this ideology is part of rape culture and the larger misogynistic messages of the patriarchy in general.It struck me as I read pages of ""Muse of Nightmares"" that the sexual scenes in this book are dominated by the male gaze. Just like the framing device used in most films, by which I mean the framing language a film uses to objectify women and communicate the male gaze to an audience, ""Muse of Nightmares"" employs a narrative voice structured by the male gaze. Rather than the camerawork framing a shot for a film, it is the narrative voice of the story that performs that same role in this novel. Laini Taylor writes in an omniscient third person point of view. Her prose head-hops constantly. Head-hopping refers to a story that jumps into the thoughts and feelings of any character on the page, at any moment. Omniscient third is also not limited to human characters. Animals, plants, deities, insects -- Laini Taylor can jump into the POV of anything, including the omniscient voice of the narrative itself, which I just refer to as ""the god of the story telling the story."" Laini Taylor's god of the story, i.e. her omniscient narrator/narrative voice, is completely a god of the male gaze. Pages 98-104 deal with a long scene in which Sarai exposes her nude (or almost-nude) body to Lazlo for the first time. Sarai is the only one to be naked (or nearly-naked) in this rather long scene, and her body is the only one to be described at length. The scene also focuses on a tattoo Sarai has around her navel. In the human culture in this book, girls all receive a navel tattoo surrounding their belly buttons as soon as they reach menarche (i.e. their first menstruation). The tattoos are seen as an important part of female empowerment, and receiving one makes a girl feel ""powerful."" That power is described in this way: ""Fertility, sexuality, strength, the ability to create and nurture life: These were the powers of a woman, and the ink honored them, connecting them with all their foremothers going back hundreds of years. But it was about more than fertility. [...] It was a ripening, yes, but not just for the purpose of bearing children, or being a wife. It represented a claiming of one's self -- stepping forth from childhood and all the ways we're shaped by others, to choose and make a new shape, all on one's own."" (page 98)First, I just want to say that while I have a lot of issues with modern American culture, at least I don't have to be subjected to THIS: being publicly marked with a navel tattoo after my first menstruation. This sounds utterly horrible to me, especially if I'd been a girl who began menstruating at age eight or nine (or younger), or a girl who never received her period at all. The public body shame in either situation would feel extremely severe. The period-tattoo in this book is completely distasteful to me, and I find it vile. I'm so glad I wasn't subjected to anything like that as a child. Anyway, back to the story. Sarai chose a moon and stars for her menarche tattoo, and she focuses Lazlo's attention on the idea of revealing it to him to spark his lust before they have sex. Many sentences on page 99 are spent describing how Sarai's body looks in her pink slip, while Lazlo sits on the bed in front of her, watching her ""tracing a slow circle around her navel."" She does this so much that Sarai's navel-tracing motion is described as ""hypnotic."" Eventually, her slip comes off, Lazlo gets to look at her tattoo, and then there are many, many more sentences describing Sarai's beautiful teenage body clothed only in ""smallclothes, sweet and brief,"" (i.e. her panties and bra), while Lazlo stays fully clothed. He also stays seated, while Sarai continues to stand. Lazlo's bodily description is limited to his nose and eyelashes. Sarai is now almost-nude; I think she keeps her panties on for this scene, but after she removes her bra, she is definitely topless long enough for Lazlo to suck her nipple, all while he is still fully clothed. This sex scene is interrupted by Minya, the antagonist, so the characters do not have intercourse here. But some pages later, Lazlo and Sarai both get naked and lie down to fall asleep, so they can immediately enter into a dream together and have sex off-scene in their dream space. Lazlo's nude body is not described with any detail whatsoever. In fact, the focus is on how Sarai's body feels to him as they lie down in that moment, without a word on how his nude body feels to Sarai: ""He let the feel of her skin ripple over his like music, and it was lucky that he was very tired, because she felt *so good*"" (page 201). I'll pause here to say Lazlo is not an abusive male love interest at all. He does not emotionally, verbally, or physically abuse Sarai in any way. He also does not stalk her, or push her to perform for him sexually. It's a real breath of fresh air to find a male love interest like Lazlo in a modern YA novel. But the sexual content in this book, unfortunately, is still framed by the male gaze. Reading this material reminded me of when Season One of ""Outlander"" debuted, and a lot of people were talking about how radical the camerawork was for the wedding night scene starring Jamie and Claire. When the camera frame in that episode lingers on Jamie's nude body, solely for the pleasure of the female audience, it was (and still is) a radical moment in film. ""Muse of Nightmares"" is nothing like that. The female characters in ""Muse of Nightmares"" are all drawn by describing their physical appearances in detail: clothing, body types, height, facial features, breasts, menarche tattoos, skin coloring, hair coloring, hair length, etc. etc. In comparison, look at how a male character named Eril-Fane is described from the point of view of the omniscient narrator as well as his female lover, Azareen -- and please note how little detail is given here regarding his physical appearance and body type --""He was the only other youth, a year older than her but already as powerful as a man. He was a blacksmith's apprentice, and though he wasn't from her district, Azareen had seen him in the marketplace. You couldn't help but see him, if he was anywhere nearby. It wasn't only that he was handsome. That seemed almost incidental. There was a warmth and energy about him, as though he were twice as alive as the next person, a fire burning in him and furnace doors thrown open so you could feel the flames. He radiated an extraordinary vitality. He held his eyes wide and saw everything, really *saw,* and seemed to love it, all of it, life and the world. Even though it was grim, it was precious, too, and fascinating, and when he looked at you... at least, when he looked at Azareen that night and after, she felt precious and fascinating, too, and more alive than she had been before."" (page 216-217)Like Lazlo's physical characterization, Eril-Fane's description focuses on his work, his personality, his interest in the world, and his eyes. Eril-Fane's gaze is also described as the ultimate achievement of the male gaze itself: when he looks at Azareen, he makes her feel precious, fascinating, and more alive. Someone might say, ""It's true, though -- men look at women, and women feel more alive."" To which I say, please point to one passage in this book in which a male character is being looked upon by a female character and he says that her gaze makes him ""feel precious and fascinating, and more alive than he had been before."" Show me one place in this book where a female's gaze makes him feel he is ""worth more"" than he was before she looked at him. I guarantee you're not going to find it. The human women in this book (and Sarai) have power because they have periods, and mark the onset of their periods with tattoos. The human men and male godspawn are incredibly powerful already, and they don't have menarche tattoos to help them feel powerful, or let the world know they are fertile, or as a way to ""claim themselves"" for their own. The men already belong to themselves. Women are the ones who need menarche tattoos and the male gaze to ""feel powerful"" and ""more alive."" I don't know enough about film studies to be able to say whether the wedding night in ""Outlander: Season One"" qualifies as ""the female gaze"" or not, or even if ""the female gaze"" is a thing. I only know that, as a female viewer myself, seeing a man's body filmed in full by the camera made me feel good. It equalized the nudity in the scene between the male and female characters, and it was enjoyable to gaze upon a man's body lit with candlelight. Reading the sexual content in ""Muse of Nightmares"" made me feel the opposite. It reminded me of how much pleasure I was missing out on because the novel's descriptions sexually objectified the female body but did not do the same for the male body. I'm so used to seeing young teenage girls in underwear and bikinis in modern media that I wonder why I would even expect anything different in a book. And yet, I do. I do expect more from authors, especially YA authors. Female sexualization employed by the male gaze does not move me romantically or erotically. It makes me uncomfortable, sad, and depressed. I feel no pleasure from sexual content like this, however prettily it's all written. Sarai's skin might glow like stars and moonbeams when Lazlo touches her, but the light show is all for his eyes, as he and the reader gaze upon her body at length. It's the same in porn, and Hollywood films, and TV shows, and commercials, and everything else. Male gaze tires me and saddens me and often sickens me. It certainly does not turn me on.But, if you find female sexualization erotic, and like the idea of eroticized menarch tattoos, you'll enjoy the sexual content in this novel a lot more than I did....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,not set,"Nov 18, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25446343-muse-of-nightmares

This novel is meant to be a darkly comedic examination of a biracial woman's frustrating search for racial identity in 1990s Brooklyn, New York. I appreciate that this book deals with microaggressions and their impacts. I appreciate that the author's own experience as a biracial woman informed parts of this novel. But I found this book completely nihilistic. The plot is structured around a false equivalency that I found entirely problematic. The prose is not even enjoyable on its own, it's simply adequate writing that delivers a punishing and hopeless story. The novel excoriates microaggressions against black people, but then the prose commits microaggressions against other marginalized groups, such as the Roma. I do not recommend this novel to anyone, and I find myself deeply appalled by this book.The main character of ""New People,"" a young woman in her mid-twenties named Maria, is described as ""a one-dropper, that peculiarly American creation, white in all outward appearances but black for generations on paper"" (page 89).Maria was born to a black mother but looks entirely white, and she has grown up suffering from ""'that particular rage of the light-skinned individual'"" (page 31). As a baby, Maria was adopted by a black woman named Gloria, who died at age 49 while trying to complete her dissertation for a PhD. In the story, it's clear that Maria suffers trauma from being an adopted child. She suffered additional hardships from being poor while her adoptive mother was in graduate school while Maria was growing up, and Maria is still grieving Gloria's death when the novel begins. The novel's primary focus, however, is on Maria's racial trauma as a one-dropper in modern America.As a result of being black on paper but white in appearance, Maria grew up ""hating"" white people (page 31). ""She felt she was allergic to them. She looked a lot like one of them, which made her understand how much they were getting away with every day of their lives. She flinched in white people's presence"" (page 31). It's clear that some of Maria's mistrust of white people came from Gloria. ""When she was just a kid, Gloria told her never to trust a group of happy, smiling multiracial people. Never trust races when they get along, she said. If you see different races of people just standing around, smiling at one another, run for the hills, kid. Take cover. They'll break your heart"" (page 29).As an adult woman who is now in graduate school when the novel begins, Maria is studying the music of the Peoples Temple Choir of Jonestown, the infamous cult led by Jim Jones that committed mass suicide in Guyana, South America, in 1978. A total of 918 people died after drinking poisoned Kool-Aid in what came to be known as the Jonestown Massacre. Since Jim Jones began his preaching career in Indiana on the tenets of racial equality and social justice, the specter of Jonestown looms large in this novel, both in plot details for Maria as well as in overall thematic content. The tragedy of the Jonestown Massacre serves to uphold Gloria's dark view of life: that if you see different races of people just standing around, smiling at one another, run for the hills. If the people of Jonestown had only taken that advice, they wouldn't have died committing mass suicide in 1978.Reading ""New People"" felt like reading ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X,"" if Malcolm X had never taken that trip to Mecca and had continued his virulent hatred of the White Devil (i.e. all white people) until the day of his death. Fortunately for Malcolm X, he learned to question his racial prejudice and his hatred, and his autobiography was much richer for it. Maria, however, is full of extremely self-destructive self-loathing and self-hatred up until the end of the book. At one point she even admits this aloud to herself, when she tells her own reflection in the mirror, ""I hate you"" (page 162). The novel ends with Maria being consumed by her own self-destruction. After breaking and entering into a man's apartment, a man she has developed an unrequited and completely unhinged obsession for, she lies under his bed until morning, when her presence will be discovered by the man and his lover in the full light of day.Other ers have noted that Maria seems sociopathic or deranged in her level of anger, aggression, and violence toward others in this novel. Twice, she breaks into a man's apartment, as well as another woman's apartment, she shakes a small baby in rage, she hits an ice skater in the head with an ice skate as a child, and as an undergrad college student, Maria called her own black boyfriend's campus phone pretending to be a white fraternity student, and left this message for him: ""Me and the brothers, we're coming for you. We're gonna string you up by a fucking dreadlock, man, and light you on fire. Nigger boy."" The entire university took the threat seriously, and responded as such, all while Maria never admits that *she* left the message. The entire event is played for dark humor in the book, treating her hate crime as silly, the situation as silly, and the university's response as silly.If you are someone who believes the delightful myth that ""college education cures prejudice"" and that ""we don't have white nationalists or Neo Nazis on modern college campuses,"" you will particularly enjoy this section of the book. Personally, I know too much about the presence and recruitment strategies of the alt-right on college campuses in America to find any of the novel's trivializing treatment toward Maria's ""mock-up hate crime"" funny.The alt-right and the Neo Nazi terrorist groups of the alt-right are no joke. These people *do* make death threats and kill marginalized people. Seeing a black biracial main character mimic the alt-right for laughs in this book made me *really* upset. I would never give this book to any of my black friends to read. I found two black women readers online who posted YouTube s for this novel, and I wasn't surprised to hear that they both one-starred this book. I'm not saying every black or biracial person would dislike this novel, but as a white person myself, I certainly wouldn't recommend it to them. Maria's entire narrative serves to draw a false equivalency between the Jonestown cult and the horrifying practices of Jim Jones, with the culture of modern America and its pressure to conform, which has taught Maria to be self-hating and self-destructive. The novel does not use the language of bell hooks to discuss the culture of modern America, but the ethos of the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy is always present in this narrative, as the dominant culture that Maria rages against. So I would just like to say, emphatically, that popular culture, as well as Maria's upper-middle class life as a graduate student in modern America, is NOT the same as living in a cult. Especially not the Jonestown cult. I resent this book mightily for creating a narrative structure that compares these two things directly. Modern America is a white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, but it also embraces social justice movements that aren't simply lies, social justice movements that are inspired and organized by people who are 100% the opposite of Jim Jones and his victims. Maria's America of 1996 was also the America of Gloria Watkins/bell hooks, Dolores Huerta, and too many other badass people to name. Life in modern America can be overwhelming and sh*tty, but there are plenty of people who live here who aren't drinking poisoned Kool-Aid, and no one is forcing them to drink any, either. Before I close, here are some examples of problematic exposition in this book.After Maria receives a perm at a hair salon and a Brazilian bikini wax, the text states: ""She rides the subway all dressed up in her outfit, her vagina bald and her head hair curly"" (page 151). For the record: women don't wax their ""vaginas."" They wax their external genitalia, and the word for that is ""vulva."" The word vulva encompasses: the labia, clitoris, vaginal opening, and the opening to the urethra. When I read literary fiction in the voice of a third person narrator, a third person that sometimes reads as close third and sometimes as omniscient, then I want the words to be the right words. Literary prose does not sound edgy and smart when it's wrong. Honestly, the prose in this book read as lazy and dull, and sentences like this one did not help.On page 153, the text relates the hardship of Maria's life as a child while Gloria was in graduate school. ""Maria looked poor too [like Gloria]. She was only seven at the time, but in photos she had the look of one of the Roma you see on the streets of Paris. Her hair was always tangled, her pants too short, a perpetual stain of dirt and lollipop juice around the rim of her mouth."" This appearance is also described as the look of ""poverty"" in the text (page 152).This is one of those places of microaggressions committed in the text by its omniscient third person narrative voice. Reading those sentences, in a book that is taking a clear-eyed stance against microaggressions, just fills me with rage. If those sentences don't immediately sound racist, let me make this comparison: replace the word ""Roma"" with ""Navajo,"" and the words ""streets of Paris"" with ""reservation."" Many avid readers of literary fiction in America would immediately know that categorizing ""all Navajo people"" as dirty and poor would BE RACIST. Because it's RACIST. But in 2018, I can read an award-winning novel with racist Roma content like this, and it's given a pass. The text quoted above goes on to say this: ""Harvard notwithstanding, she [Maria] lived like any other poor child on a steady diet of hot dogs and ramen noodles. She lived in a cement tower that looked -- if you blurred your eyes just right -- like any other housing project"" (page 153).This is classist on a number of levels, but I'll give two main reasons. First off: Maria has food. SHE HAS FOOD. Second: she has a place to live. SHE IS NOT HOMELESS. Maria and Gloria are never homeless. If you think that ""any other poor child"" in America means food and shelter is a given like this, then I would suggest reading Matthew Desmond's Pulitzer-winning nonfiction book, ""Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City"" for a much-needed wake-up call. I suggest ""Evicted"" because it deals with urban poverty and is more applicable to Maria's situation than a book about rural poverty.There were many other instances of class privilege and clueless classism in this novel, and they upset me as much as anything else in this book. I don't know why books like this win awards, or arrive on ""best of the year"" lists. ""New People"" makes me despair. One star.

The writing in**spoilers!! please beware**The 2018 YA fantasy, ""The Hazel Wood,"" by Melissa Albert, is a debut novel with extraordinarily good prose. The writing in this novel is highly literary, and felt reminiscent of the prose style of Raymond Chandler and Joan Didion, if those writers had ever gotten together to pen a dark YA novel about nihilistic ""fairy tale"" stories from an alternate world called The Hinterlands.""The Hazel Wood"" is a classic portal story (like ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" or ""Outlander""), but this 17-year-old main character, a modern American girl named Alice Proserpine, is nothing like Lewis Carroll's titular Alice. In ""The Hazel Wood,"" it is Alice's surname that is the primary clue to what kind of book this is: ""Proserpine"" is the Latin form of Persephone, a deity who is known in Greek myth as the only daughter of Demeter, Goddess of the Harvest. The tale of Hades and Persephone, or the Rape of Persephone (the word ""rape"" primarily meaning ""kidnapping"" here), Demeter loses her daughter to the Lord of the Multitudinous Dead, who takes her into the underworld and marries her. Because Demeter's grief is inconsolable, Zeus forces his brother to release his child bride back to her mother (above ground) for part of the year. The story of Hades and Persephone provides the reasoning for why the seasons exist. When I read the first sentence of this novel: ""Althea Proserpine is raising her daughter on fairy tales,"" I thought it was going to be obvious that the name ""Proserpine"" was chosen on purpose, and that the reader was meant to immediately understand that the main character, Alice Proserpine, was a reimagined/retold Persephone character.It turns out, however, that this knowledge is meant to be ""a big reveal"" in the text, and when the reader learns that Alice Proserpine is not originally from the human world, the reader is meant to be shocked, delighted, and awed by ""the twist"" in the story. I don't know how the actual reveal plays out in the novel, because I DNF'd long before I got to that point. I stopped reading on page 138 of this book, after the first 38% of the novel. I was so bored and unengaged by the first person point of view of Alice, and the narrative voice in general, that I could feel my internal organs shutting down. I could not force myself to keep reading this book; each sentence felt like swallowing mouthfuls of sand and I just couldn't inflict it on myself anymore. At the point that I stopped, Alice had yet to discover that she was not really human, but from the supposedly-mythical Hinterlands that her grandmother (Althea) wrote stories about. Alice was born ""through the portal."" She is ""a character"" from a story there, which, much like the Greek myths are to the gods, was not ""a story"" to Alice but her real life. Alice's ""mother,"" Ella, is the recast Demeter of this novel. Ella took Alice from The Hinterlands into the human world, which caused a bunch of problems for The Hinterlands, the same way Demeter's grief caused endless winter, death, starvation, etc. for the human beings of Greek antiquity in the original story of Hades and Persephone.My main inability to enjoy this novel was the voice of the main character, Alice, who is supposed to be seventeen, but honestly sounded like the most bitter, caustic, 45-year-old woman I've ever met in a YA novel. I'm currently 38 years old, and Alice sounded far more educated, older, and world-weary than I'll ever be. I never believed she was seventeen. I know that YA author John Green gets a lot of criticism for the narrative voices of his ""teenage"" characters sounding like adult Buddhist monks or retired poetry professors, but I think John Green's characters are more realistic as teenagers than Alice. Alice believes she is infinitely superior to everyone around her. Her cleverness and her inner superiority are boundless. Alice also seems to exhibit signs of coprolalia, a neurological disorder defined on Wikipedia as: ""involuntary swearing or the involuntary utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks. Coprolalia is an occasional characteristic of tic disorders, in particular Tourette syndrome, although it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit coprolalia.""Alice doesn't have any tics, but she admits to being physically violent with Ella as a child. I think she states in the book that the last time she hit Ella that she was eleven or twelve; by the time the story begins, Alice's violent behavior is limited to verbal abuse. Alice says mean things in her head all the time about the people around her, and sometimes those scathing comments come out of her mouth. While Alice does sometimes swear, she focuses mostly on socially inappropriate speech and derogatory remarks. In the book, she aims many of these at Ella, as well as the only other person who cares about her and tries to help her, a teenage classmate and son of a billionaire named Ellery Finch. Ellery Finch is the only person I would label a human being in this book, in terms of his thoughts and behavior being ""humane."" Alice, and everyone else around her, operate with a constant, basic level of shittiness that made the world of this novel unbearable to me. I assumed that Ellery Finch would have to die in this book, as he was the only person who did not operate with constant shittiness. Although I DNF'd this book, I read the last few pages to make sure my assumptions were confirmed (they were), and then I asked my friend Blair what happened to Ellery in the part I skipped over (i.e. most of the book). Blair confirmed for me that Ellery did die ""a metaphorical death"" in The Hinterlands, which means he might be alive in another world, as Alice suspects at the end of the novel. Blair believes Ellery can never again visit earth/modern America because he died a gruesome death in The Hinterlands. I'm unclear whether Ellery was fully human or one of The Hinterland residents to begin with, but I was so uninvested in this novel that I forgot to even ask Blair about it.Like many YA novels, the plot of ""The Hazel Wood"" involves a Very Special Main Character (Alice, who is not really human but a Hinterlands resident) who has grown up in difficult circumstances (Alice and Ella moved regularly throughout Alice's childhood, and as the reader learns after ""the plot twist"" in the book, they were living on the run from The Hinterland residents who wanted Alice back). The inciting incident, like many other popular teen stories, is that the teen character's parent is kidnapped, and the teen must set out on a journey to save them.I made it that far through the story, at least, before DNF'ing.Author Melissa Albert might directly mention the Brothers Grimm somewhere in this novel, but I don't remember ""the Brothers Grimm"" being named anywhere in the 138 pages I read, or in the ending pages I skimmed over before closing this book. (If someone finished this book and can cite the page number where they might have appeared in the text, please comment below and give me the page number, and I'll cite that in my ; thanks!) While I didn't find any mention of the Brothers Grimm, clearly, the Brothers Grimm play a *big* role in the story structure of ""The Hazel Wood,"" with the character of Althea Proserpine being a modern-day version of those two brothers. Most people know the basic history of the Brothers Grimm, but if not, here is a brief summary from Wikipedia: ""Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, were German academics, philologists, cultural researchers, lexicographers and authors who together collected and published folklore during the 19th century. They were among the first and best-known collectors of folk tales, and popularized traditional oral tale types such as Cinderella, The Frog Prince, The Goose-Girl, Hansel and Gretel, Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltskin, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White. Their classic collection 'Children's and Household Tales' ('Kinder- und Hausmärchen'), was published in two volumes, in 1812 and in 1815.""What is especially fascinating to me about the Brothers Grimm is that they took a number of French tales and falsely stated that they were German, because the whole purpose of their endeavor was to use folk tales and popular culture to identify and build a German nationalism. Some of the stories in their work that were attributed to German peasants actually came from the French upper-class. Similarly, reading ""The Hazel Wood"" inspired me to pick up Edith Hamilton's 1942 classic, ""Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes,"" and reread her version of Hades and Persephone, which is the only version of the original myth I've ever read, and since I was thirteen at the time, I assumed I'd forgotten important parts of it. By rereading the tale, I thought I might pick up on additional similarities between ""The Hazel Wood"" and the Greek myth.But what actually struck me was that Edith Hamilton was doing the same thing with those Greek myths that the Brothers Grimm were doing with folk tales: she was engaging in nationalism through story and myth, the same way the Brothers Grimm were.Hamilton's nationalism wasn't German, of course, but American. Hamilton was born in Dresden, Germany, in 1867. According to Wikipedia: ""Shortly after her birth, the Hamilton family returned to the United States and made their home in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where Edith's grandfather, Allen Hamilton, had settled in the early 1820s. Edith spent her youth among her extended family in Fort Wayne."" As an adult, Hamilton had a very prestigious career as an educator and author in the United States.When Hamilton refers to Demeter, over and over in her work, as ""the Goddess of the Corn,"" rather than ""the Goddess of Grain"" or ""the Goddess of the Harvest"" (which are not titles Hamilton uses), she is engaging in American nationalism. Hamilton had thoroughly studied Latin and Greek, studies that started when she was a child. She knew that the ancient Greeks were NOT growing corn. Corn is a New World crop. Native American tribes cultivated corn and harvested corn. By appropriating corn as a crop of Ancient Greece, Hamilton plays into the racist ideology that Native Americans just ""ran wild"" on what became U.S. land, that Native Americans were not farmers, and that they did not contribute essential food products into the modern U.S. economy. A lot of modern Americans still think of Native Americans like that today: that they weren't farmers, and that they just ""ran wild"" on the land, rather than contributing anything ""important"" to the world (for instance, the way the ""mighty"" ancient Greeks did, or the ""mighty"" ancient Romans, etc. etc.). Corn is a major product of the Midwest, especially in Indiana, where Edith Hamilton grew up. While I would certainly be interested in reading a book about the intersection of American nationalism, Edith Hamilton, Greek mythology, and the German nationalism of the Brothers Grimm, my attention flags while trying to read the Greek myths themselves, especially as told through the narrative voice of Edith Hamilton. The myths are loaded with so much toxic masculinity, rape culture, and patriarchy that my brain just powers-down and turns off, the same way the prose of ""The Hazel Wood"" made my brain power-down and turn off, which was why I had to DNF.Melissa Albert will be releasing a sequel to this novel, as well as a collection of fairy tales like the ones she wrote for this book. Albert's postmodern fairy tales lack morality (i.e. the moral messaging found in traditional fairy tales) as well as the narrative structure of an ending. They read like a piece of journalism about the current war in Yemen, or the violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. If you're interested in fairy tales that lack meaning, morality, and endings, while still containing all the dark hideousness of real life, you should probably check out that book of fairy tales when it is published. A lot of readers who loved ""The Hazel Wood"" are very keen to get their hands on Melissa Albert's collection of fairy tales. Once I skipped to the end of ""The Hazel Wood,"" and read the conclusion, I discovered that Alice Proserpine did have a kind of magical version of coprolalia from eating ice in her fairy tale story. The ice was still inside of her in the human world, and causing all of the meanness and irrational nastiness I attributed to undiagnosed coprolalia. By the end of the book, the ice is no longer inside of her, and she can live as a regular human girl. She misses the ice, however, and she spends her time at AA-type meetings for other outcasts of The Hinterlands who live in modern America. They meet in church basements and community halls to discuss the woes of being Hinterland outcasts. Why couldn't Ella tell child-Alice that she was a Hinterlandian with ice inside of her? I don't know. I would guess that the novel explains it in some kind of sci-fi/warp-of-time/it-would-destroy-the-fabric-of-reality dialogue, but you'd have to read a  from someone who 5-starred this book to find out for sure. It was clear to me that Ella had to keep Alice's origins a secret from Alice because reasons, and that was why, after 38% of the book, Alice was still in the human world, and still had no clue who she really was. It took the plot so long to get rolling in this book. For a classic portal story, my attention span just wasn't up for that kind of a slog.Some ers have called this book magical realism because so much of the story takes place in modern America. But the fantasy elements from the magical worlds aren't normalized as part of modern America. When anything involving The Hinterlands shows up in the U.S., it is definitely Other and not part of normal, mundane life. ""The Hazel Wood"" is a portal story, which puts it firmly in the realm of fantasy, not magical realism.I wish I could have loved this book. I feel like I missed out on the best part of it, which is when Alice finally goes ""through the portal"" and arrives in The Hinterlands. I can understand why some ers believed that The Hinterlands was intended to be like Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, but I honestly believe that ""The Hazel Wood"" has more in common with Hades and Persephone and the real lives of the Brothers Grimm than it does with Carroll's work. I enjoy the messaging at the end of the novel. Like Demeter and Persephone, Ella and Alice are reunited, and the story is a triumphant tale of mother-daughter love. I give the book a solid star just for that messaging, and a solid star for its literary prose.""The Hazel Wood"" is a dark, reimagined tale of the real lives of the Brothers Grimm and the myth of the Rape of Persephone. Kudos to the author for taking such interesting story elements and combining them in such a unique way. I just wish I had enjoyed the end product more....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 02, 2018","Nov 25, 2018","Nov 02, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34275232-the-hazel-wood

I didn't enjoy this short, plotless, meandering book, but my friend Lynn thinks this is a strong novel, and we had a good discussion about the storytelling choices and why this book works so well for her.The story is told in first person, from the perspective of the protagonist, Janey, who is looking back on the summer when she was twelve. Janey's parents are upper-middle class white folks who own a summer lake house, and they host raucous parties for their adult friends each night. Janey and her five-year-old brother, Jim, are mostly left to care for themselves through the summer. They spend their days wandering the marshland around the lake, playing in some kind of estuary or confluence, where they swim, fish, build sand castles or mud castles, sit in a sailboat they can't sail, and just pass the time with each other.It was never made clear how old Janey is as the narrator looking back on this summer, a summer which turns out to be an extremely traumatic time in her life. Based upon the naive and uninformed statements Janey makes in this book, I would guess she is only twenty or maybe thirty as the narrator, or possibly still a teenager, age 18 or 19. She doesn't seem to have received any therapy to help her process what happened, and she makes no statements in the book to orient the reader to her current mindset in any satisfying or enlightening way. The purpose of this book is to narrate the long days of her summer that lead to the final pages of the book, when sudden devastation and trauma occurs. The book ends at the very moment a plot seems to arrive. I had originally assumed Janey's 12th summer took place in the early 1990s, but after talking with my friend Lynn, I realized the author had set the story in the early 1970s. Ms. Gunn was born in 1960, so she would have turned twelve herself in 1972. Given that knowledge, it does make sense that this novel is set in 1972, though the text itself never provides any dates. The author also grew up in New Zealand, so I believe the novel is set in New Zealand, though the text itself never gives specific setting details. Nature, and the lake environment around the house, is given a lot of description in this short book, but I did not realize the novel was set in New Zealand until after I finished the book and researched the author.According to my friend Lynn, a reader can look at all of the long, plotless exposition of the natural world in ""Rain,"" which makes up the bulk of this book, and understand it to be a detailed metaphor for Janey's adult interior self: she is awash in a numbed state of emotion, living in a perpetual state of lassitude after what has happened to her. She has been unable to process or come to grips with her trauma, and she is narrating the earliest phase of her journey of healing, wherein she gives voice to the traumatic event, and nothing more. This explains why the book ends just as the plot appears, or just at the moment when the traumatic event occurs, because the adult Janey is finally leaving her state of numbness and/or denial to acknowledge that something terrible happened to her when she was twelve. If you are someone who likes funeral scenes in movies that take place in the rain on gray, stormy days, scenes that use the environment to represent the emotion of grief so that the characters never have to name any of their feelings at all, then you will enjoy ""Rain"" a lot more than I did. After reflecting at length on this book, I have decided I do not enjoy books that rely solely on the natural setting to instruct the reader on a character's emotional state. It feels cheap to me. It feels like shoddy prose. The film version of ""Rain"" drew attention to things that I completely misread or failed to pay close attention to in the narrative. In the movie, Janey is older than twelve, more sexually aware of herself, and she is competing with her mother for the attention of the adult men who show up at her parents' house parties. There was nothing like that in the novel. In the book, Janey has no narrated awareness of her sexuality, but there is one adult who does: an adult man comes into the bedroom Janey shares with her brother late one night, and while the reader fears the man is coming to rape Janey, Janey's mother quickly appears and leads the man away. The man doesn't appear on the page again until the final pages in the book, when he suddenly shows up at the lake, while Janey and her brother are playing outside. The man leads Janey into some bushes, where it's clear they have sex, though the act isn't described on the page. Then the books shifts into second person, in which the ""you"" addressed to the reader is trying to save a small unnamed child who has drowned. The prose is focused and determined, going through the ordeal of performing CPR on a child, but is as emotionally detached as it is detailed. The reader is meant to understand that this is Janey's extremely traumatized way of telling the reader that her little brother drowned and she tried to save him by performing CPR, but she was unable to resuscitate him. Near the end of the book, on page 80, Lynn drew my attention to some lines I had clearly misread. It is a scene in which 12-year-old Janey is interacting with her mother, and then describing her mother's perfume and makeup for the reader, but the narrative quickly changes direction: ""All her things were laid out there before the mirror. I touched them, the thick creams in jars, tissues blotted red with colour. I unstopped the bottle of her fragrance and the sharp, sweet smell came up at me again, adult.'Come here, honey...' Her things were warm to the touch. The creams, the lotions. I could spread them on my own skin.'Don't be shy...'It was just once at first, letting myself be taken, then more times, over and over until it was me myself going back for more. Leaving my family, leaving my little brother playing while the tides in the river were rising.""*****I had completely failed to understand that this text was telling the reader that Janey had begun having sex with the adult man who first crept into her bedroom at night, that they had engaged in sexual intercourse many times, and that was why Janey chose to have sex with him on the day her brother drowned.Lynn said that this adult man must have been grooming Janey for sex, but the extent of his manipulations of Janey are limited to the passage I've quoted above. I don't think that text is being clear about this man's predatory behavior and rape of a child; instead, the narrative focuses on Janey's choice to have sex with him of her own volition. While I understand that many rape victims do engage in this type of thinking -- psychologically, it is untenable to many people to have no control over their lives and be purely victimized by other people, and the human mind prefers to think we have control in situations where we really had none -- as a reader, I don't get any sense of Janey's victimization from this text. From an objective distance, i.e. as a thinking adult reading this book, I know that Janey is twelve and that this man was a pedophile and a rapist, but the first-person protagonist narrating this tale is the voice of a legally-adult woman who is telling the reader that she ""chose to have sex"" with this man on the day that her brother died. There is a disconnect going on in the narrative, and it feels like deliberate obfuscation. I can understand grooming, pedophilia, and rape, but none of those terms are used in this book, and if Lynn hadn't pointed that specific passage out to me after I had finished the book, I would have assumed this adult man had just shown up to rape Janey, and while he was raping her, Janey's little brother drowned. Knowing that Janey chose to have sex with this adult man more than once adds to my understanding that she would probably blame herself even more for her brother's death, but this novel is not about the aftermath of Jim's drowning at all. The book does not discuss matters of grief, blame, shame, or guilt. The author chose for the natural environment to express to the reader that Janey is traumatized, and shortly after the reader learns Janey was unable to revive her drowned brother, the book ends. Janey finishes narrating her story by returning to the same type of storytelling she began the book with, in which she and her brother are playing at the lake again, before he died:""In rain we could take off our clothes and walk down the beach and into the lake in one continuous gliding movement. There was no telling where land ended, waves began. Sand and water dissolved into each other, blotted in mist. Nothing else existed on those days except two children. Watch them. Two with the whole beach to themselves, the whiteness of cloud and water swirling at their feet as they dance, round and around, round and around... With each turn becoming smaller, further away, smaller and smaller in the distance until you can't see them at all."" (page 95)If this type of storytelling and focus on nature-as-metaphor for a character's emotional landscape sounds like a good read to you, then you should check out this book.Personally, I did not enjoy this novel at all, and I would have DNF'd after a few pages if I hadn't agreed to buddy-read this book with my friend. I'm glad that I finished the book only because I enjoyed talking about the novel with her, and I appreciated that she was able to tell me about the movie and how it differs from the book.

This book is a YA retelling of Thomas HardyThe 2018 YA fantasy, ""Tess of the Road,"" by Rachel Hartman, is a long, slow, and incredibly detailed read. This book is a YA retelling of Thomas Hardy's 1891 classic, ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles,"" and, in many ways, is just as grim. The dragon on the cover of this book gives the reader an expectation that this book will star a dragon, but there are only sub-dragon ""serpent"" creatures in this story, and these animals have only brief, intermittent scenes throughout the story. The ""real"" dragons are elsewhere, occasionally spoken of in dialogue, but none of them interact directly with the plot.It's impossible for me to discuss this book without unmarked spoilers, so please be warned that you should stop reading here if you don't want this book spoiled. Thanks!**unmarked spoilers ahead**First, I must give the author a lot of credit for starring a YA novel with such a clueless and unlikeable protagonist. The landscape of fantasy YA is dominated by super-powered teens, Mary Sues, and Chosen Ones, and the seventeen-year-old main character of this book, Tess Dombegh, is certainly none of those things. There are 521 pages in the hardback edition I read, and by page 75, it is clear that Tess is an ordinary human girl who has suffered a *lot* of trauma: by the age of fifteen, she gave birth to a baby she is now permanently separated from, and watching Tess grapple with her internalized shame is the entire point of this book.I must confess that by page 75, once it was clear to me that this entire book would be a slow-reveal of Tess's traumatic backstory, and coming to grips with her past, with barely any mention of dragons or serpents by that point, and certainly none being featured in scene, I had to start skimming for the following reasons:1. The world this story is set in is extremely depressing. The culture of this society is highly religious and full of a fantasy version of historical Christianity; it's very similar to a 1650 version of Puritanism or a 1650 version of Catholicism. There were more Catholic elements in this fantasy-religion than Protestant, but the overall message and ethos of the novel's religion is founded upon the most intense misogyny. Women are seen as being good for only two things: virginity and motherhood. Women's sexuality is completely demonized and suppressed. 2. While the setting feels like 17th-centure Europe, modern-day gender egalitarianism in the workforce is featured alongside this 1650s version of fantasy Christianity. Women must wear long, binding dresses with corsets, men wear pants, but women can still be scholars, adventurers, ship captains, and road crew bosses. The novel features modern-day sexism in the workplace as being symbolic of the realities of women's oppression in a 1650s version of Catholicism -- and this is so inaccurate as to be nonsensical and upsetting to me to read. Having gender equality in the workplace (for the ambitious few women who choose to work) also makes Tess an even weaker character overall, because she can see for herself that there are other options open to women than marriage and procreation, and yet she is a self-destructive, self-loathing teenage girl full of internalized shame and self-hatred, regardless of the multiple pathways in life that are open to her. 3. No one ever challenges the religious ideology in this book, or calls out the religious order in this novel as a form of systemic oppression. The novel focuses solely on Tess's long journey to overcome her internalized cultural and religious shame, without ever once asking the question, ""Why is our religion this way? Why does the entire culture oppress women? How can these religious texts be reinterpreted, to allow women to honor and appreciate their own bodies, rather than teaching women that their bodies are inherently bad and full of sin?"" 4. I understand that modern American culture is extremely pornified and deeply misogynistic, and I understand why Tess's journey should have been moving to me to read. But the characters in this book are not modern Americans -- they are all people who practice this misogynistic religion and live in this *extremely* misogynistic society -- and no one in this book is respectful of young women like Tess, or the hard realities women like Tess face in this religion at all. Tess's family is the worst: her two sisters, her mother, her father, her brothers. Everyone in this book is just the worst. I hated the world of this story, I hated Tess's family, I hated the society of rapists and rape-culture-supporters surrounding Tess, I hated the unquestioned misogyny that saturates this entire book. If women can be scholars in this world, why aren't there feminist scholars? Why aren't there feminist religious scholars? Why isn't there any feminism at all? Modern porn culture and modern sexism is a very different form of misogyny than 17th-century Christian colonialist misogyny. I can understand that the author believed she was writing allegory about modern American misogyny, but the equal access to jobs in this book combined with the extremely sh*tty religion made the book read like a dystopian novel in need of a revolution, a revolution that no one ever realized was needed. *****The plot of this book reads like an exercise in futility, which echoes the fact that Tess also begins the story with a drinking problem, struggling to numb her pain with any alcohol she can find. Addiction often reads like an exercise in futility, with no forward motion in life due to internal pain. Tess's story reads in a similar way. Within the first one hundred pages, while attending her twin sister's wedding reception, Tess is given the opportunity -- by a woman sea captain, to join the woman's crew on ""an expedition through the Archipelagos"" and ""Antarctica"" (page 59). Tess can work on the ship, and learn ""cartography, navigation, languages, zoology"" (page 59) -- and this opportunity is given freely, with no fees or other obligations demanded of Tess.Tess, full of self-loathing and cluelessness, angrily turns down the woman's generous offer and storms away, then proceeds to f*ck up her life even more than it is already f*cked up. After an inane scene of drunken bullsh*t, Tess leaves her family and sets off ""on the road"" -- wandering from place to place for the rest of the book -- until finally, a year and almost 500 pages later, Tess returns to this woman who offered her the job on the expedition, and the novel ends with Tess finally taking this job, and looking forward to a great adventure.As a character who has developed a drinking problem by the age of seventeen, it should come as no surprise that Tess is someone without a strong inner voice of self-worth. Her self-worth comes from the world around her, and while Tess is on the road, it is the voices of the people she encounters who give her the messages of wisdom she needs to hear. I am not saying that this is not true to life. Tess, as a character, is very realistic. But watching someone flounder through life, reacting to events and relying upon the wisdom of strangers to teach her life lessons, without ever questioning the roots of the extremely misogynistic religion and culture that has shaped the story's grim and utterly depressing setting -- this book just kept sapping the life right out of me. Rather than feeling a sense of increasing agency, I felt more despair the further into the story I went. My severe dislike of this novel increased when Tess is given an important ""life lesson"" from a stereotypical ""happy prostitute"" named Dulsia (page 350). It gave me the strong impression that this author has never studied prostitution, or the incredibly difficult work people have put into rescuing modern sex workers from prostitution. In the story, Dulsia makes it clear that she was forced to turn to prostitution to save herself and her brothers from homelessness and poverty, and yet, Dulsia's life is presented as a happy one full of agency and volition, and she loves her work. Dulsia is presented as if she's a modern, enlightened woman who chooses to have sex with men simply because: 1.) men pay her for this service, and 2.) it's ""easy"" work, ""easier"" than other forms of physical labor. There is no threat of disease or unwanted pregnancy for Dulsia, and she faces no sense of worthlessness as a result of her work. Dulsia's entire character was deeply insulting to me. It doesn't match modern reality, to say nothing of the world of this fantasy setting Dulsia lives within. Many modern sex workers struggle with depression, many of them commit suicide, they face the highest rates of homicide (being the victims of homicide) in America, and the vast majority of them are dead before they turn 35, either from violent abuse, homicide, suicide, or disease. Prostitution is steeped in the forces of patriarchal oppression, and seeing ""a happy prostitute"" in this book giving Tess ""important life lessons"" about how a woman can experience ""pleasure"" on her own, ""with no man required,"" was honestly enraging to me (page 350). It's not that I disagree that women can experience ""pleasure"" without a man, but that this lesson comes from ""a happy prostitute"" who became ""a whore"" at a very young age to save her family from destitution -- it's the way Dulsia was characterized as the messenger of women's pleasure via prostitution -- THIS IS ALL A GIANT NO FOR ME. If you cannot see the inherent absurdity of taking a victim of the patriarchy, a victim of intense suffering, and turning her into the source of women's self-awareness and self-pleasure, all I can say is please watch a TED talk or read some well-researched nonfiction about the realities of prostitution. Modern adult women who *choose* to have sex for money are not the same as teenage girls who turn to prostitution to save their families from homelessness. I resent and deeply hate ""Tess of the Road"" for confusing financial desperation with sex positivity, and ignoring the realities of social stigma and oppression, even the modern oppression against former sex workers, with the horrendously false idea that prostitution is the source of women's sexual empowerment. Women don't need to be prostitutes to learn that the female body is capable of self-pleasure and that women can respect their own bodies, and I'm so sick of novels that continue to tout the message that prostitution is the source of women's sexual empowerment. It's a lie and it's wrong and yet HERE IT IS IN A YA NOVEL. Modern prostitution continues to plague the world with suffering and oppression, horrors and atrocities that are most acutely felt by young children, adolescents, and young adults. I know many people like to support the fantasy that sex positivity is rooted in prostitution and modern pornography. For the record: this is entirely false. The modern porn industry is a complete nightmare of misogyny, disease, and high numbers of young women who end up as street prostitutes and die before the age of 30. But you have to read nonfiction to understand the oppressive realities of patriarchy, prostitution, and modern porn culture. That level of understanding is nowhere here in this YA novel. Instead, the reader is presented with Dulsia. And later, the reader is presented with a Happy Disabled Man named Josquin. Josquin's family hires Tess to be his personal aide, to bathe him and help him with personal care. Josquin is approximately thirty years old, and became disabled as a young man in his twenties. Tess observes that ""he had a variety of apparatuses that helped him live -- braces, tubes, catheters"" -- and he also uses a wheelchair that makes him look like ""a man with eight legs"" (page 428). The device scares Tess when they meet: ""First she saw that the spider legs belonged not to the man but to an iron chair he was sitting in; his own legs, thin as sticks, were curled under him"" (page 428). As Tess spends many weeks (months?) working for Josquin and being paid by his family, she develops a strong sexual attraction for him. Because everyone in this book seems to be a caricature or a vile piece of sh*t, when Tess finally gains the courage to lie down beside Josquin in bed, and kiss him, he responds by immediately needing to know if Tess is a virgin or not (page 454). It's hard to say what enrages me more: the happy prostitute in this book, the lack of ANY religious ableism in this extremely body-hating/woman-hating world full of fantasy-Catholicism, the fact that Josquin is a well-adjusted Happy Disabled Man in this 1650s-esque body-shaming world, or the fact that his reaction to his first kiss with Tess is to demand to know whether this is her ""first time"" or not (page 454).YA books seem more than happy to insist that a kiss immediately leads to f*cking on the page. YA books seem to insist that all men need to be obsessed with finding out whether they are f*cking a virgin or not. YA books never seem to question the fact that stopping a romantic kiss to demand information about virginity is something that only an asshole would do.To no one's surprise, Josquin's need to know the status of Tess's nonexistent virginity puts an end to the passion of their first kiss, and the two do not have sex for quite a long time after that (weeks, maybe months).Eventually, Tess and Josquin do have sex in a bathtub, which is described in this way: ""She caught him in her arms [as he was getting into the tub] and kissed him again, and together they were broken/unbroken. All/nothing. And any chasms left between were swiftly bridged."" (page 466)That is the extent of the sex scene, and all erotic content, between these two characters. Although Josquin and Tess fall in love and have sex, Josquin happily encourages Tess to continue her journey ""on the road"" while he stays at home with his wheelchair. ""How could I keep you from it, in good conscience?"" he asks Tess, as he tells her to return to her journeys (page 497). When Tess promises to come back, Josquin says, ""I know you will. And you'll have had other paramours by then, and so will I, and we will be dear old friends, happy to see each other, full of wondrous stories."" (page 497)They kiss one last time, and then Tess leaves and continues her journey on the road, to eventually meet up with the woman who first offered her a job on page 59. Thank you, Happy Disabled Man, for serving your healing-sex purpose with Tess, and then encouraging her to pursue her able-bodied adventures without you. In contrast, consider the ending of ""Jane Eyre"" -- the book ends with Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester united, a team who can travel together, have a family together, and love each other always. Jane marries Rochester when he is blind and one-handed, and she chooses to assist him with walks, reading, and other activities, through a sense of love and companionship. Edward Rochester only recovers some of his sight in one eye two years after their marriage. True to the story's time period and setting (early 1800s England; the novel was published in 1847), Edward Rochester situates the harm that has befallen his body into the religious context of his Christian worldview. There is none of that going on in ""Tess of the Road."" Josquin's character is a non-suicidal version of Will Traynor in ""Me Before You."" While it is nice to see a non-suicidal disabled character in a work of modern fiction, I'm not going to pretend that it doesn't make me profoundly sad that the able-bodied Tess has ""better things to do"" than spend her life with her disabled lover.Tess's pregnancy at fifteen was a result of being raped by a boy named Will. Their first sexual encounter was rape, and Tess stayed with Will for ""eight months"" after that. Tess never uses the word ""rape"" to describe what happened to her (and neither does anyone else), even in the closing pages when the truth finally comes out. I understand that this is true for a lot of rape victims: to give up all agency over our lives and admit that events were completely out of our control is terrifying, and people are loathe to do this. But in a novel full of so much misogyny, I really needed more from Tess's final conclusions regarding the event (birthing a child out of wedlock) that changed the entire course of her life. She was raped at age 14 or 15, her family and her society placed ALL of the blame upon Tess, the baby was born premature and died three days after birth, and NO ONE offered a SHRED of compassion to Tess. She was further traumatized and victimized by everyone in her family and her society. Everyone around her was uncaring and cruel, and while I don't blame Tess for developing a drinking problem by age seventeen, I really wish she had run away from her family before her baby was born, at age fifteen, rather than compounding her extreme suffering by waiting two years.  ""Tess of the Road"" is an incredibly difficult story to read. The main character has been deeply traumatized, and the novel is a long, slow revealing of that trauma, as well as Tess's journey to heal.If you don't mind the tropes of ""happy prostitutes as the voices of sex positivity,"" ""happy disabled men who cheer on their able-bodied lovers to have able-bodied adventures without them,"" ""healing sex for female rape victims,"" and tropes I can't even name because I skim-read large chunks of this book, then you will most likely enjoy ""Tess of the Road.""I would have never picked this book up if a dragon had not been on the cover. I wish I could scrub this book out of my mind. But alas, I wanted to read about dragons.

Titled ""Notes to Self"" on my ARC paperback cI won a Goodreads ARC Giveaway for this memoir/collection of personal essays by debut author Emilie Pine. Titled ""Notes to Self"" on my ARC paperback copy, the back cover states that the expected publication date for this book is June 2019.On a prose level, this book is very good. Ms. Pine is a fine writer. ""Notes to Self"" is also a very short book. While the content is often very sad, this is a pretty quick read. Here is a list of the essays in this book, and their general content:*****1. ""Notes on Intemperance"" focuses on Ms. Pine's alcoholic-turned-sober father and her complicated love for him. My own father was an extreme alcoholic who died after years of being homeless, living on a riverbank just outside Cincinnati, so I expected that this essay would really resonate with me. Instead, the first essay read the flattest to me. I know that part of the blandness in this essay for me was the fact that Ms. Pine had access to so many resources, family, and friends to lessen ""the burden"" of her father's struggles upon her own life, including a friend of her father's who helped him tremendously, even inspiring him to get sober. Ms. Pine read as being very, very fortunate to me, but her tone was one of victimization throughout the bulk of the essay. I also lost my father young while Ms. Pine's father is still alive and well. I would be so incredibly grateful if my father were still alive. I understand the complicated love for addicts, and I appreciate Ms. Pine's struggles. This particular essay just didn't have the intended effect for me at all. I kept thinking, ""I wish my life had been this easy,"" when her tone was one of, ""Oh my god, look how bad I have it."" People with lives that more closely resemble Ms. Pine's middle-class upbringing will probably enjoy this essay a lot more than I did. 2. ""From the Baby Years"" discusses Ms. Pine's struggles with infertility, her miscarriage, and her sister's experiences with childbirth. I was moved to tears as I read about Ms. Pine's sister's experiences. It was the only place in the book that moved me. 3. ""Speaking/Not Speaking"" deals with Ms. Pine's youth. Her parents separated in 1982, when Ms. Pine was five, but divorce wasn't legal in Ireland until 1997, when Ms. Pine was twenty. I had no idea that divorce was illegal in Ireland for so long!! That shocked me to realize I was so clueless. But the essay isn't about the underpinnings of conservatism in Ireland at all; it is about Ms. Pine's inability to talk about divorce until it was finally legalized. 4. ""Notes on Bleeding and Other Crimes"" focuses on Ms. Pine b*tching about menstrual blood and cramps, as well as shaving her armpits and conforming to all of the appearance commands that women are given, and then realizing that menopause means the possibility of ""losing"" her womanhood: ""I fear that the end of my period is the end of being a woman"" (page 97). This is also the first essay in which Ms. Pine admits that she developed a severe eating disorder at age ten, when she began starving herself. She continued to starve herself until the age of twenty or so, when she was in college, and then she continued to inflict/suffer from bouts of starvation on and off over the years. Her self-imposed starvation sounds a lot like anorexia to me, though Ms. Pine never uses the terms ""anorexia"" or ""eating disorder"" anywhere in the book. 5. ""Something About Me"" was my favorite essay. It details Ms. Pine's rebellious youth as a self-starving adolescent who became the life of any and all parties, staying out all night at clubs in London, drinking and drugging to extremely self-destructive and suicidal levels. Ms. Pine started drinking and drugging at a young age. She states that she lost her virginity at age thirteen. She had a number of sexual partners. Two of her partners raped her, and one man was her boyfriend at the time. This is a long essay, and it had direct bearing upon essay #2, but the author never ties the two essays together. I'll discuss this more below, but for now, I'll just say that the book really took a serious dive in enjoyment-level for me when I realized how much insight and depth these essays truly lacked as a whole. 6. ""This Is Not on the Exam"" sketches out some highlights and low-lights from Ms. Pine's successful career as an academic. The book jacket states that she is ""Associate Professor of Modern Drama at University of Dublin College Dublin, Ireland."" I'm not sure what kind of work that entails, and the final essay didn't provide any details outside of a few anecdotes about the author talking to students. Ms. Pine focuses on being overworked, the stresses of the university outsourcing its funding by telling academics to bring in their own money with grant projects, and then the burnout she suffered when she performed all of this extra unpaid work with very successful financial results that came with a horrible emotional toll.*****I would recommend this book to any reader who is new to the idea of women struggling to talk about divorce, having periods, suffering cramps, infertility, miscarriage, developing an eating disorder at a young age, self-destructive partying, and having alcoholic parents.Personally, none of this material was new to me, and if you are already familiar with any of the above topics, I would recommend these powerhouse reads instead:""The Beauty Myth"" by Naomi Wolfanything written by bell hooks""Pornland"" by Gail Dines""Woman: An Intimate Geography"" by Natalie AngierMs. Pine does acknowledge in ""Notes to Self"" that she is ""a white, Western, middleclass, heterosexual, cis-gender woman"" (page 101). She never leaves that limited perspective; this book is solely focused on Ms. Pine and her own experiences. While I can completely respect that choice, Ms. Pine often adopts a tone as if she is speaking for ""all women."" As a reader, I was constantly reminded that this book was very limited and did not speak for ""all women,"" and I only differ from the author in class, regarding her own list of traits. The author's limitations are why I closed this book feeling like the only things I learned were the date divorce was legalized in Ireland and how absolutely, and tragically, clueless these essays often felt to read. Again, I must state that I wasn't the intended reader for this book. I think the intended reader is obviously someone whose own experiences better mirror the author's: middle-class white women who have led financially successful careers. Here are some realizations I had that are never addressed in these essays: 1. I can tell that Ms. Pine was *very* externally motivated throughout her whole life. Her external motivations were strong enough to starve herself for ""skinny"" praise as a child, become a gregarious party girl in adolescence, do well at college, and be very successful in her chosen career. As a highly externally-motivated person, Ms. Pine has made a very strong initial effort at finally examining her unplumbed interior. These essays read as a good, strong initial start at Ms. Pine trying to understand herself. Unfortunately for my enjoyment level, I don't think she's read any of the books I listed above. Because this book of memoir-essays is far, far too limited for me to ever believe Ms. Pine is familiar with Naomi Wolf, bell hooks, Gail Dines, or Natalie Angier.2. Ms. Pine has obviously never researched the effects of starvation in adolescent girls. Her severe starvation began at age ten and continued until she was twenty or so, with bouts of anorexia (or her self-imposed starvation) throughout her twenties. I know that starvation has immediate and long-lasting impacts on fertility, especially on the fertility of young girls and young women. In essay #2, Ms. Pine laments her infertility at age 37, 38, and 39, when she started trying to have a child and found that she couldn't: ""For all the research and testing -- mine and the medical profession's -- I still don't know what went 'wrong' with my body. Why is that?"" (page 67). I don't think that Ms. Pine has ever learned that a woman's highest fertility levels are during her teenage years, the years Ms. Pine spent depriving herself of the nutrients her body needed to be fertile. Overall, women's fertility decreases slightly between the ages of 20-28, taking a sharp nosedive at age 28, and declining at a faster rate until the age of 35, when fertility levels suddenly plummet. That is only for women who have not yet had a child, however. Pregnancy changes things quite a bit. Whatever age a woman gives birth to her first child, her fertility will basically remain at that level until menopause. Teenage mothers have the highest fertility levels up until menopause. Women who have their first child in their early twenties are a close second.This isn't to say that older women cannot be fertile, or safely give birth past the age of 35. I'm saying that Ms. Pine admits that she wanted to know what was 'wrong' with her body at age 37 that stopped her from having a baby, after nothing was revealed to be physically wrong with her reproductive organs, and yet she never reflected upon the negative impact and lasting trauma her starvation inflicted upon her fertility, starting from the ages of 10-20 and then into her 20s. There are some traumas the body can readily recover from. Other traumas have lasting and permanent damage. I know this from studying the biological effects of poverty: poverty does permanent physical damage to a child's body. Starvation and malnutrition in children are highly detrimental to growth and long-term adult health. I'm not blaming Ms. Pine for her eating disorder or any of the problems in her life. I am stating that one of her essays *answered* the question she herself asked: ""What went 'wrong' with my body?"" -- i.e. why was I so infertile in my thirties when my reproductive organs were all sound? -- and yet she never, ever reflects on the impact her many years of starvation had on her own fertility.3. Ms. Pine is a very good writer, and I'm glad she has finally given herself permission to talk about her shame, her hardships, and her traumas in life. I wish her all the best on her journey. She shares many good messages about trying to accept herself as she is. I hope she does some research about ageism soon, because she seems especially uninformed about that. Her extreme dread of aging feels very sad to me. I also hope she reads ""The Beauty Myth"" by Naomi Wolf. If I were her friend, I would press that book into her hands immediately. She would understand that she fell victim to that myth in a big, big way. She could forgive herself even more, I think, if she took the time to read that book.Overall rating: 3 stars. Glennon Doyle (formerly Glennon Doyle Melton) wrote the blurb on the front of my ARC copy. Personally, I think Glennon Doyle's memoir, ""Love Warrior,"" was a far better book than this collection of memoir-essays. ""Notes to Self"" is definitely a book where a reader's mileage will vary, depending upon how familiar they are with the book's content and themes, and how closely their own background mirrors the author's. **Thank you to Random House Marketing for providing me with a free ARC paperback copy of this book....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 26, 2019","Apr 30, 2019","Oct 15, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40381501-notes-to-self

New Agey-preachy stuff often emphasizes the impact of individual choices as the sole markers of success in life, and while I'm not totally opposed to that messaging, I can't tolerate that messaging at all when it's completely removed from the larger culture, and treats every individual as if all things are equal, and I felt like that happened with ""Brave Enough.""This is a short book to read, and none of the content in this book is new, but I couldn't finish reading this book.

As I write this  in 2019, after 172 years of super-fandom has accrued for this book, there is no more obvious sign of how beloved this novel is than its thousands of adaptations into other media forms, including the digital media of the modern age. Every few years, this book is adapted into a new TV mini-series or Hollywood film. Even actor Michael Fassbender has taken a turn playing Edward Rochester (2011). I love this book. I love ""Jane Eyre."" The prose, the story, the messaging, the content: everything about this book turns me on. After I finished ""Jane Eyre,"" I read the ""Critical Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism: Charlotte Brontë: Jane Eyre,"" edited by Beth Newman. These are academic essays that provide the historical context of the book, and analyze the content through different fields of academic study. I loved reading that book as well, and highly recommend it.I went back and reread ""Jane Eyre"" a few more times. This book is really addictive. And, like any great book, it offers up a more enriching experience each time it is reread.With that said, I was really shocked to discover that YA author John Green presented a ""Crash Course"" video essay on this novel that completely trashed ""Jane Eyre."" Titled: ""Reader, It's Jane Eyre: Crash Course Literature 207,"" uploaded on April 10, 2014, this video essay was shared after John Green's YA novel, ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" was published (2012) and became a bestseller.The video essay credits someone named ""Alexis Soloski"" as the ""writer,"" but John Green is the sole speaker in the video, and he presents the false information he is sharing as an objective examination of the book and its author. The video essay, however, is not at all objective; it features a number of falsehoods about the book and its contents. The entire essay is like reading a one-star Goodreads  from someone who mistakes their opinion of a book for the facts of a book. I do not mind reading critical s of a book that I love, and I often take pleasure from rant s. But for a rant  to be enjoyable, the er should at least have the facts straight about the book's content, and a rant  should never present a single reader's opinion as an objective ""Crash Course"" on the book. But that is not the case with Green's video essay on ""Jane Eyre.""I found Green's video essay disgusting. It repulsed me so much that I felt compelled to speak out against it here in my own Goodreads  for this book, and thereby share my own understanding of this book and its contents. I speak as someone who has enjoyed reading critical essays examining the racism, ableism, colonialist messaging, and other hegemonic discourse in this text. I speak as someone who is not hiding the fact that I love this book, have read this book multiple times, and will go to my grave convinced that ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the greatest novels ever written. And I honestly cannot believe that an author like John Green would trash this book in a ""Crash Course"" video essay in 2014. So, I feel compelled to say this about John Green and ""The Fault in Our Stars"": yes, that book was turned into a movie. Yes, that book had its time in the sun. Yes, that book is still riding a continuing popularity-high as a supreme example of schmaltzy Sick Lit in Teen Fic that brought it acclaim and enormous success. Other writers have discussed the ableism and melodrama on display in ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Other writers have complained that the book capitalized on ableist discourse to rocket to the top of the charts. Other writers have pointed out that John Green is not a cancer survivor himself, and that his teenage characters sound like 45-year-old adults in his dialogue, not actual teenagers with cancer. I'm not dedicating my space for discussing ""Jane Eyre"" to anything related to ""The Fault in Our Stars.""What I want to say is this: I doubt that anyone will ever remake ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" either as another Hollywood film or a TV mini-series. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is fictional ephemera: it is not going to last. In one hundred years, no one will be analyzing John Green's prose, or remaking his books into new movies, or studying his work in their academic fields. And I don't say that because of global warming and the coming environmental catastrophes in the decades ahead. For the sake of this statement, I'll assume our modern lifestyles will continue as they are in 2019. John Green and his work will fall by the wayside of forgettable art that historians remember, but not the general population.This is not the case with ""Jane Eyre."" Brontë's novel has already enjoyed 172 years of popular success. It's still sold in every bookstore I shop in. It continues to be adapted, studied, retold, and beloved. I ask you, Dear Reader, to keep that in mind as I share some quotes from John Green's video essay about ""Jane Eyre,"" and rebut them.**********Green opens his essay by warning his readers that if they ever find themselves in Jane Eyre's position, at the moment when Edward Rochester proposes marriage, that they should ""take a walk up to the attic."" Green is obviously beginning his Crash Course by implying that Jane Eyre never visited the uppermost floor of Thornfield Hall before agreeing to marry Rochester. To emphasize this point, Green later states: ""While Jane is a feisty and very appealing heroine, she is *no* Sherlock."" Green uses his essay to paint Jane Eyre as a rather foolish and dull-witted heroine, a young woman who is surrounded by strange situations and occurrences, but who never questions or investigates her surroundings.Most damning of all, Green summarizes Jane Eyre's supposedly oblivious, incurious mindset by stating: ""If you've ever been in love, you have an astonishing ability to ignore red flags."" The text of ""Jane Eyre"" does not support Green's conclusions whatsoever. Long before Edward Rochester proposes marriage, Jane Eyre has, in fact, visited ""the attic"" of Thornfield Hall, and she has done so more than once, both before and after she has met Edward Rochester. Long before Jane Eyre has fallen in love with her employer, she has investigated the entire building and its eerie uppermost floor, stopping only at the locked door that leads into Bertha's quarters (Rochester's deranged wife), and is guarded by Grace Poole (a servant employed by Rochester). It is Grace Poole's duty to stop anyone from entering. Along with her investigations, Jane Eyre has also asked pointed questions about the curious and frightening things she has witnessed in the house, questions the staff and Edward Rochester both repeatedly answer with lies and omissions. I read the Penguin Random House/Penguin Classics edition of the novel, published in 2006, and here are some page citations that feature Jane Eyre investigating ""the attic"" and asking pointed questions about the strange incidents she has witnessed in the uppermost floor long before Edward Rochester proposes marriage:pages 125-127, pages 129-130, page 150, pages 173-174, page 176, pages 178-182.I can only surmise that Green's statements about Jane Eyre's lack of curiosity must actually stem from his own position as an upper-middle-class male living in the modern United States. Green is a man who has never endured the poverty and deprivation that Charlotte Brontë experienced in her youth and young adulthood, experiences that she wrote into the character of Jane Eyre, and Green has never had to work in an employer's house under the brutal class and caste system that was in place in England in the 1830s and 1840s, as Brontë herself did before penning her novel. For Jane Eyre to have discovered Bertha in the attic, she would have needed to physically overpower Grace Poole and break into a room that was off-limits to her. Anyone who has ever worked a job before will understand the difference between ""behaving in a way to keep one's job"" and ""behaving in a way to get fired, as well as arrested"" while at the workplace. Jane Eyre would have needed to risk her job as well as criminal prosecution in order to ""be a Sherlock"" in John Green's estimation. In my opinion, Green is the one who sounds oblivious and clueless about Jane Eyre's situation, not Jane Eyre.Green goes on in his essay to make this statement, which is so long and full of falsehoods that it will take some time to go through it:""In the middle of the novel, Jane's education is still ongoing. She hasn't yet achieved financial independence, or independent thought; she hasn't yet found the strength to give up Mr. Rochester when he proposes that she live with him as his mistress; and by the end of the novel, she is much better at reading clues, like when she hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling out to her from clear across the country, she doesn't think, 'wow, that seems improbable' -- she goes! And when she finds him, he has lost his sight, but of course, Jane has *finally* learned how to see, to pay attention not just to what's in front of her, but also what's happening beyond and beneath the visible world.""Green's first statement, that ""in the middle of the novel, Jane's education is still ongoing,"" ties into his opinion that the novel is ""a great bildungsroman: a novel about a young person's education or coming of age."" Green states that Jane's education isn't ""complete"" until she can approach Rochester as ""an equal"" and not as ""a dependent"" at the very end of the novel.These statements are false. While part of ""Jane Eyre"" is a bildungsroman, Jane's education is actually completed in the first third of the novel. The second two-thirds of the book are not about Jane's education or coming of age; the main plot of this book is about testing that education and Jane's principles as an adult woman, and seeing Jane triumph over adversity. Structurally, here is how the text of ""Jane Eyre"" is divided into three parts, based upon my own reading and understanding of the novel:1. Part 1 (Act I): Jane's youth and time at Lowood (Chapters 1-10): Jane's formal education is begun and completed. By the end of Chapter 10, Jane has finished school at age sixteen, and has worked for two years as a teacher at Lowood, until the age of eighteen. This part of the book certainly qualifies as a bildungsroman. Jane has come of age and worked for two years into her early adulthood. She makes the decision to seek new employment, and advertises to work as a governess in order to leave Lowood and seek new, more interesting surroundings for herself. 2. Part 2 (Act II): Jane's time at Thornfield Hall (Chapters 11-27): Jane takes her new job as a governess employed by Edward Rochester, and later leaves Edward's home of her own volition. This is the longest of the three parts of the book. Soon after meeting Jane, Edward frames the main plot of the novel in direct conversation with her: ""But I tell you -- and you may mark my words -- you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer current -- as I am now"" (page 166-167). As it turns out, Edward's marriage proposal is that ""craggy pass"" he warned Jane about, and Jane does, in fact, survive it, rather than be ""dashed to atoms,"" though she does almost die right after she flees Thornfield Hall. 3. Part 3 (Act III): Jane's time at Moor House and reunion with Edward Rochester at Ferndean (Chapters 28-38): Jane triumphs over adversity, and finds the ""calmer current"" for her life after surviving the ""whirl and tumult, foam and noise"" of Edward's marriage proposal. Jane continues to take care of herself, independent of Rochester, before deciding to seek him out at Ferndean, where they are reunited. By then, Jane is independently wealthy, having unexpectedly inherited a fortune from a late family member.As a YA author, Green pens his own bildungsroman/coming-of-age novels starring teenage protagonists living in modern America. But Jane Eyre is no modern American teenager. By the age of eighteen, Jane has already worked for two years as an adult, without any family to take care of her or assist her with problems. She is completely independent and completely grown by the time she leaves Lowood. Jane is fully an adult when she takes her job at Thornfield Hall. At eighteen, Jane is not comparable to a modern upper-middle-class or middle-class American teenager with a strong family unit, as John Green himself experienced at age eighteen, an experience that is very similar to the characters Green writes about in his own novels. By the end of Part 1/Act I, Jane Eyre is no longer ""coming of age"" or relying on help from anyone, family or otherwise. Jane is also an independent thinker before she arrives at Thornfield Hall. Her independence of thought is the reason Edward Rochester finds her so attractive, and he tells her as much multiple times in the book. Furthermore, Edward Rochester always viewed Jane Eyre as his equal; he uses that very language to describe her when he proposes marriage. It is not material wealth or financial independence that make Jane Eyre Rochester's equal; it is rather her integrity, her principles, and her values. Jane possesses that integrity before taking the job as a governess, and not even Rochester's marriage proposal can take Jane's integrity away from her. Jane does not become Edward's ""equal"" at the very end of the novel; Jane was always his equal, before the two of them even meet.That is why Jane always had the strength to ""give up Mr. Rochester when he proposes that she live with him as his mistress"" -- this ability is not a ""found strength,"" but rather the testing of the strength she arrived at Thornfield Hall already possessing. Jane rejects Rochester's proposal, not in ""the middle"" of the story, as Green claims, but at the end of Part 2/Act II of the novel. Furthermore, Rochester himself knows that Jane will immediately reject his marriage proposal once she discovers the truth about his first marriage to Bertha; it is why Rochester constantly lies to Jane whenever she asks about Grace Poole and the laughter she hears in the attic.Jane does not ""finally learn how to see"" by reuniting with Rochester, either. I am honestly shocked by how utterly misogynistic that statement is. Throughout the text of ""Jane Eyre,"" Jane is attuned to knowledge and wisdom that is ""beyond and beneath the visible world"" -- even as a child. Jane is attuned to fairy wisdom, moon wisdom, and goddess wisdom throughout the entirety of the book. At one point in the text, Jane even speaks to the Moon as a personified Goddess, during a scene on page 367 in which Jane is alone and wide awake in her bedroom at Thornfield Hall:""I watched her come -- watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written in her disc. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart --'My daughter, flee temptation.''Mother, I will.'There is a *lot* of material like this in the novel. I was a religious studies major in college, and one of the reasons I love ""Jane Eyre"" so much is how radically feminist Jane's religious symbolism and spiritual belief system is, starting in her youth and following into her adulthood. Jane has three primary teachers in the book, all of them female or feminine in nature, and all three are firmly established in Part 1/Act I of the text:1. Her childhood friend, Helen Burns2. Her favorite teacher at Lowood, Miss Temple3. The Moon/divine feminine power and the wisdom of fairies/PaganismAs a quick text reference for the wisdom of fairies, even in Part I of the novel, when Jane wants to leave Lowood and isn't sure how to go about finding a job, she states: ""A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion [to advertise] on my pillow, for as I lay down it came quietly and naturally to my mind"" (page 103). Paganism, fairy wisdom, and divine feminine power appear throughout the length of this book, and it absolutely thrills me. It also delights me that it is the wisdom of the late Helen Burns that turns Jane into an independent adult. As Helen tells Jane in Part 1: ""If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends"" (page 82). Jane adopts this belief system, and she states it in her own words right before Edward Rochester proposes to her, and again when she resolves to never be his mistress. Jane's embrace of the wisdom of Helen Burns are some of the most famous lines in the book.Green later states in his essay: ""So I think you can read the novel as striking at least a soft blow for gender equality."" I want to emphatically state: this novel is no ""soft blow"" for gender equality. This book is a radically feminist text, and that is part of why this book has endured, and received such intense popularity, for 172 years and counting. The best praise that Green can muster for ""Jane Eyre"" is to state: ""Now that plot summary might not make it sound like a terribly sophisticated novel, but in fact, it's one of the most sophisticated novels of the 19th century."" That statement is the very definition of ""damning with faint praise,"" and I emphatically disagree with it. ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most sophisticated novels of all time, not just ""sophisticated for the 19th century."" The structural sophistication of ""Jane Eyre"" on every level of writing craft (prose, character, plot, setting, etc.), along with its subversive application of feminine equality and feminine power, is why this novel has endured, and will continue to endure.Given John Green's summary statements about this book, it doesn't surprise me that he adheres to the belief system of reading Bertha Mason as ""a dark mirror for Jane"" -- in other words, as a metaphor for Jane's ""repressed feelings."" As disability scholars have pointed out, we should not reduce or dehumanize disabled characters in fiction into serving as ""metaphors"" or ""dark mirrors"" for the able-bodied characters. Disabled characters are still fully characters. They are people, not mirrors or metaphors. Bertha is fully a character in ""Jane Eyre,"" and while her characterization is today acknowledged to be ableist, racist, and laden with colonialist discourse, Bertha is still a character in the story, not a metaphor or a mirror. In conclusion, I find John Green's ""Crash Course"" on the novel ""Jane Eyre"" to be highly opinionated and problematic. I also find his opinions incredibly ignorant about the actual contents of the book he is purportedly objectively analyzing for his YouTube subscribers. I believe that ""Jane Eyre"" is a masterpiece. This book stands, and will always stand, on the strength of its incredible prose and deeply affecting story. ""Jane Eyre"" will always have a wide readership, and will continue to be remade into new forms of media. The radical feminism and stellar prose in this novel are part of what make it so timeless.Five stars. Highly recommended. A book that makes life worth living. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Oct 03, 2018","Jul 14, 2019","Oct 03, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11016.Jane_Eyre

She also mentors teenagers who are trying to navigate the college admissions process, and I have nothing but good things to say about Alexa Donne as a person.This novel, however, was not a positive experience.

I purchased a first edition hardback of this book at my local indie bookstore, and as a physical piece of art, this book is quite beautiful. But the contents of the story are bizarre and rather poisonous, and I am deeply alarmed and appalled by the messaging in this novel.I'll be sharing a lot of unmarked spoilers ahead, so if you have not yet read this book and plan to, please do not read anymore of this . Thanks!**spoilers**“Brightly Burning” is set in an unspecified future, but what I took to be about 300 years from now. At some point, maybe around the year 2118, humankind has developed the technology to build huge spaceships to support a comfortable life in space. If you saw the movie trailer for the 2016 film, ""Passengers,"" starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, you might have a good visual for what I assumed the spaceships looked like in this book. Not all of the ships in this novel are quite that enormous and swanky, but the vast majority of them are.Also around one hundred years from now, a supervolcano erupts on earth and begins a new ice age. Every spaceship on earth is launched into space. The government ships take aboard as many people as they can. The private ships take aboard the family and friends of their owners. Any person who does not get on a ship perishes on earth in the frozen wasteland of death.When ""Brightly Burning"" begins, 210 years have passed since the supervolcano erupted, and there are still a large number of ships successfully orbiting Planet Earth with their human populations onboard. Society, for unexplained reasons, has regressed back to the Victorian era for fashion and a number of gender roles, despite a complete egalitarianism existing in the work force between women and men. Women all have to wear uncomfortable long dresses from Victorian England, no matter what work they are doing onboard their ships, such as repairing engines, farming, running a hospital ward, or navigating a transport vessel. The two principal characters -- Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester -- are renamed Stella Ainsley (age 17) and Hugo Fairfax (age 19). Hugo was born into an upper-class family aboard one of his family’s privately-owned, gargantuan, luxurious ships. Hugo's family actively hates the poor and seeks to kill all the poor using biological warfare. In this future world, poor people either work as servants aboard the wealthy, private ships, or they live in dehumanizing, impoverished segregation aboard the decrepit, and slowly failing, government ships. Hugo's family does not believe any poor people should still be alive, and seeks to murder them all. Hugo’s father created a deadly virus to kill the poor in mass numbers, a virus he successfully used as a weapon on a number of ships orbiting the planet when Hugo was 14 years old. The virus killed hundreds, perhaps thousands of people before the death toll could be stopped (page 28).Hugo’s mother tried to stop her husband from committing mass murder. But Hugo’s father gave her a drug that made her psychotic instead (page 279), to stop her from meddling with his plans. Too late to save the lives of the poor, Hugo’s deranged mother ended up murdering her husband after his mass-murdering spree. She opened an airlock and killed him in the vacuum of space. For the next five years, Hugo’s mother has wandered around loose on her family’s ship, trying to kill Hugo because she is psychotic. Hugo does not lock her up at all, he just permits her to wander around attempting to murder him. At face value, I don’t have a problem with this material, either the eugenics material or the mentally-ill-killer onboard Hugo’s ship. Here is why: while eugenics was *not* a field of study in 1847, and would not be invented until after “On the Origin of Species” was published in 1859, there was a pre-Darwinian form of eugenics that did exist at the time that Charlotte Brontë wrote “Jane Eyre.” In the original novel, there is never any mention of the English policy of rounding up poor people to be shipped off to colonies, or forced into the military or navy, or hung to death in public squares for the sole offense of being poor. But the ruling class did, in fact, do these things, even if it’s not featured in the novel.Also in the novel: the first wife of Edward Rochester is a highly racist and ableist archetype. She is a dark-skinned “madwoman” who tries to kill Edward, as well as her own brother, and she is described more than once as a “vampire” because of her frightening appearance, as well as the fact that she bites her brother’s neck and draws blood. Largely because of this racist and ableist character, “Jane Eyre” is certainly not a perfect book, but the novel is so much more than any of its flaws. The narrative in “Jane Eyre” is *not* about eugenics at all, and it’s also not really about mental illness or mental disability at all, which is why Edward’s first wife is so problematic. A modern retelling of “Jane Eyre” set in space could certainly feature this problematic material in a way that brings as much attention to these issues as Charlotte Brontë brought to women’s equality and class oppression in her original work. And there is plenty of reason that a modern author *would* want to tackle eugenics and ableism in a retelling of “Jane Eyre.” While Alexa Donne’s book is a self-described “American story” with “American characters” (Stella and Hugo are descended from U.S. citizens, not British citizens), America’s history with eugenics and ableism remains a current element in modern culture. Alexa Donne lives in California, and the state of California was still legalizing the forced sterilization of prison inmates until 2014. These sterilization laws are all rooted in eugenics, which many people have wanted to extend beyond forced sterilization. For example, in 1903, one Michigan legislator proposed that the state should simply “kill off” the unfit, and mass-murder the poor and disabled in a way that matches the behavior of Hugo Fairfax’s father in “Brightly Burning.”We also live at a time in 2018 in which the continued demonization of people with mental illness and mental disability has become problematic with current gun legislation and mass shooters. Data on these matters show, over and over, that people with mental illness and mental disabilities are more likely to be the victims of crime rather than the mass killers shooting schoolchildren, church members, and audiences at concerts and films, and yet many people in American society continue to call murderers “crazy” or “psychotic,” even though the vast majority of mass killers are neurotypical. Sadly, “Brightly Burning” makes use of eugenics and ableism in their most poisonous, normalizing ways. This retelling of “Jane Eyre” does not speak out against eugenics or ableism at all, but simply uses both as thoughtless plot devices and stand-ins for the chaotic force of Evil that is featured so often in YA fiction. This plot-device form of Evil is the deus ex machina that introduces difficulties into the main characters’ lives, and nothing more. Alexa Donne does not spend any time examining why Hugo’s father became a eugenicist, or how much of Hugo’s current worldview is that of a eugenicist, or why “the government” in this novel supports eugenics and the mass-murdering of the poor. By the very end of the book, all of the chaotic Evil unleashed in the story is focused into the single body of a government worker named Mason, and the reader is meant to understand that as long as Mason is “stopped” from killing more people (i.e. put in jail), then the Evil in the novel has been contained.I don’t have the words to describe how deeply upsetting this book felt to read. At every turn, this novel operated in a Logic Free Zone, but it was the normalization of eugenics and ableism that hurt me the most. Rather than the story challenging cultural norms, the way “Jane Eyre” did in 1847, this YA retelling simply regurgitates storytelling tropes in thoughtless and cruel ways. Here is a short list of some of the most notable message-tropes employed by this novel:1. “The government” is a force of Evil.2. Psychotic people are murderers.3. Stopping Evil always means stopping the behavior of One Evil Person.4. Rich people naturally want to kill poor people. 5. Eugenics is natural and timeless, and will gain widespread acceptance in the future.Nothing on that list has ANYTHING to do with the original “Jane Eyre.” Edward Rochester is not a member of the government, his family is not part of the government, and his first wife does not kill anyone in the book. While characters do die in “Jane Eyre,” they do not die at the hands of “psychotic” people, such as Edward's first wife, but due to the cruelty and ineptitude of rational people with power, such as happens at Lowood, the school Jane attends before becoming a governess. Charlotte Brontë was not examining the nature of evil, eugenics, or government mass murder anywhere in her story, and no member of the upper class in her novel was a murderer or a eugenicist, either. Hugo Fairfax, on the other hand, is an alcoholic and a eugenicist. After he unleashes a new virus to kill the poor, he does not try to help Stella save the poor at all, and after Stella reports the virus and the plot to mass murder the poor, Hugo leaves Stella to be executed “for treason” by the government. Hugo saves himself, his family, and his own crew, but leaves Stella to face Mason and the chaotic, murderous Evil Mason contains in his person alone. After 453 poor people have died from the newest eugenicist virus (page 383), and after Hugo's mother has set fire to her room and died in the flames (page 329), Hugo leaves space to live on earth, which is habitable once again. Stella, in a show of how much she loves Hugo, forgives him for completely abandoning her and spreading a mass-murdering virus. After she narrowly escapes being murdered by Mason, Stella finds Hugo on earth, and marries him.For the record: Edward Rochester is not an alcoholic, or a murderer, or a eugenicist, nor would he ever leave Jane Eyre to fend for herself against a murderous government or a murdering eugenicist. There is a bit of a love square in “Brightly Burning” between Stella and three teenage boys: George, Hugo, and Jon. Honestly, Stella and Jon were the only two characters who possessed any romantic chemistry together, and their love story would have made the most sense, but Jon's love for Stella remained unrequited. I cannot explain why Stella persisted in loving an alcoholic murderer who left her to die rather than loving Jon, who protected her and saved her life more than once in this book. But such was the case in “Brightly Burning.”In the end, I don't know what I was meant to gain from this retelling of ""Jane Eyre."" I would not call this a sci-fi novel because there is no actual science on display in this story. At least, not where life in space is concerned. Supervolcanoes can certainly affect climate, but this book is not about supervolcanoes and climate, it's about life in space. More specifically, it's about an American society of the future in space. Apparently, the class divide will become so terrible that the rich will actively promote eugenics and mass-murder of the poor once again, but as long as The One Evil Person is stopped with a jail cell, the depravity of the Evil Government will be held in check. Stella forgives Hugo in ways that echo Jane's forgiveness of Edward in ""Jane Eyre,"" but it honestly makes no sense that Stella thinks or behaves as she does in this book. Certain lines of dialogue and ideas are lifted straight off the pages of ""Jane Eyre"" and placed into ""Brightly Burning,"" but since the characters of Hugo and Stella are nothing like Edward and Jane, the use of the original text was deeply upsetting to me, and sometimes enraging. I would only recommend this book to YA readers who enjoy the type of deus ex machinas featured in ""Brightly Burning."" If you are seeking romantic chemistry, space science, or a plot that makes any sense, I would suggest you read something else....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Sep 28, 2018","Sep 30, 2018","Sep 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35721194-brightly-burning

I can never say enough good things about bell hooks. Her work is a gift.""The Will to Change"" is a short book written in highly accessible prose, but the content is so difficult to take in and grapple with that it took me as long to read this book as Jackson Katz's ""The Macho Paradox"" (which I also highly recommend). ""The Will to Change"" did not repeat material I have read elsewhere. Everything in this book stood on its own. It's a gut-wrenching read. ""The Will to Change"" made me cry. But the purpose of the book is to share a message of empowerment, and it certainly succeeds. I would recommend this book to *anyone* to read. While the text focuses on the impacts of patriarchy on boys and men, this is a book intended for a gender-inclusive audience. As a female reader, ""The Will to Change"" spoke to me deeply and profoundly. I'm incredibly grateful this book exists. *****""We show our love for maleness, for men, by working to heal the wounds of men who suffer and those of us who bear witness with them. Many of us have lived the truth that recognizing the ways we are wounded is often a simpler process than finding and sustaining a practice of healing. We live in a culture where it has been accepted and even encouraged that women wholeheartedly stand by men when they are doing the work of destruction. Yet we have yet to create a world that asks us to stand by a man when he is seeking healing, when he is seeking recovery, when he is working to be a creator.The work of male relational recovery, of reconnection, of forming intimacy and making community can never be done alone. In a world where boys and men are daily losing their way we must create guides, signposts, new paths. A culture of healing that empowers males to change is in the making. Healing does not take place in isolation. Men who love and men who long to love know this. We need to stand by them, with open hearts and open arms. We need to stand ready to hold them, offering a love than can shelter their wounded spirits as they seed to find their way home, as they exercise the will to change.""(pages 187-188; the closing passage)...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 19, 2018","Nov 26, 2018","Sep 24, 2018",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17601.The_Will_to_Change

It is the most toxically ableist and misogynistic book I have ever read. Th""The Killjoy,"" by Anne Fine, is an adult novel that was published in 1986. It is the most toxically ableist and misogynistic book I have ever read. The ableism in this book is far, far beyond the ableism in the uber-popular adult novel, ""Me Before You,"" with its ""live boldly, unless you're disabled, and then we will support your choice to commit suicide"" message. That was horrible. But this novel is much, much worse. ""The Killjoy"" presents physical deformity, and by extension, all disability and physical difference, as an outward sign of internal evil, and the book punishes women who engage in ""loveless sex"" (sex for the sheer sake of orgasm) with severe physical abuse and death.I read a hardback first edition of ""The Killjoy,"" and this copy is signed ""with *very* best love"" by the author to my friend Mary, who asked me to read it. Mary is good friends with Anne Fine, and Mary believed I would enjoy this novel.Anne Fine is quite famous in certain social circles. She has done well for herself. Her YA novel, ""Madame Doubtfire,"" published in 1987, was turned into the film ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" starring Robin Williams. Anne Fine has won many, many prestigious awards. The vast majority of her work is written for children of varying age groups, but she has a number of adult novels as well. ""The Killjoy"" was her first published work for adults.Here is some data I can share with you about Anne Fine, which comes from her author bio on the book jacket and her Wikipedia page. This author is:1. Able-bodied2. Neurotypical3. White4. Cisgender5. Heterosexual6. Upper-middle class7. Has no physical deformities or illnesses8. Attended university9. Gave birth to two able-bodied, neurotypical children while married10. Began her writing career after the birth of her first child11. Does not know anyone who is physically disabled or facially scarred in real life""The Killjoy"" is written with a strong awareness that literature has a long, long history of featuring deformed and disabled protagonists as monsters. In clear adherence of that literary tradition, the physically ""monstrous"" protagonist of this novel is evil inside and out. He is completely morally depraved, and that moral depravity is marked on his face as a warning to all the people he encounters to keep their distance or suffer the consequences of his contagion, extreme violence, and death at his hands.This protagonist has a name, and you can find his name in the book description. I refuse to use it, because this book is so ableist that he was never a human being. He was only ever a story trope: the trope of the Evil Deformed Beast who menaces polite, able-bodied, physically-undamaged society. Since the protagonist refers to himself more than once as a ""Beast,"" that is what I will call him in this .The Beast is able-bodied and described more than once as a handsome man, if a person only looks at one half of his face: the side that is physically perfect. The other half is mottled with scar tissue. That scar tissue does not impair his vision, hearing, or breathing at all, and his nose is undamaged. His hairline is unaffected. But the scar tissue on his cheek and jaw make him ""ugly,"" and that ""ugliness"" is referred to over and over again in the narrative. At the beginning of the novel, the protagonist begins narrating his tale to an unseen character as well as to the reader, and states that he acquired the scar tissue at age five, after being mauled by a dog.By the end of the book, the reader learns that the Beast is speaking to a police officer who has come to arrest him, and the Beast admits that the dog mauled him because he had been ""tormenting"" the dog for days. ""The Killjoy"" upholds the belief that animals only attack people when they are provoked or mistreated, and that anyone who has ever been attacked by an animal deserved to be bitten, mauled, kicked, or otherwise harmed by that animal.That alone is psychologically painful to me. Not all animal attacks are provoked. I have witnessed dogs, for instance, run up to people and tear into them -- adults and small children alike. These were not people who were invading the attacking dog's space, hurting their owners or anyone else, or tormenting the animal at all. These were not rabid dogs, either, but beloved domestic pets. Animals do not attack people because they sense ""the inner moral depravity"" or ""the inner evil"" of a person. And yet I frequently encounter that belief system in people I meet, and it is on full display in ""The Killjoy.""My sister was attacked by a stranger's pet dog while walking down the street in broad daylight. A child I taught in first grade was attacked by a neighbor's dog at age 4 -- the child had been sitting on his own porch playing with toys when the neighbor first brought the dog to her house. There was no history between the dog or the child, but the dog dashed onto the child's porch and attacked him.I have suffered many arguments with people who try to insist that my sister must be morally depraved and that this 4-year-old child must have been morally depraved to warrant such vicious attacks from a dog, attacks that left both of them scarred and forever scared to be around barking dogs.It is obvious to me that Anne Fine must agree with these people that dogs only attack their tormentors and the morally depraved, because she could never have written ""The Killjoy"" without believing such things herself. The Beast in this book is born bad, and he was also born to a physically beautiful, handsome body. At age five, he enjoys tormenting a dog, and the dog mauls his face, marking him with a physical deformity to warn people of the evil that lurks inside of him.The Beast is completely able-bodied and neurotypical, free of disease and all ailments but for the scars on his face, and he is able to have a typical, independent modern life: he graduates high school and college, gets a good job teaching at the university, and he marries a young woman when he is still a young man himself, age 19 or 20 or so. But he is seething with anger that his facial scarring kept him from having sex before marriage. He resents that he was still a virgin when he got married. He feels deprived of an active sex life before marriage (and perhaps illicit affairs after marriage, as well, given what an asshole he is) because his facial scarring, in his view, drives women away.The Beast takes care to describe his active, but very dull sex life with his wife, who stayed married to him for sixteen years. The Beast says that his wife ""willed herself not to see the ugly side of me,"" and that they were only ""half married"" because his wife ignored his ugliness and refused to dwell on it (page 16). Then she divorced him and married a richer man, a work colleague of the Beast's who has published acclaimed books in their field of study. By the time the story begins, the Beast has been single again for some time. He is 49 years old, and he is a valued college professor who is the head of his department. He teaches political science and government. The year is 1983 or 1984. And then into his classroom one day arrives a teenage girl who is sexually liberated. Armed with birth control and no fear of sexually transmitted diseases, this character is no longer a human being, either. She is a fantasy porn star, a college freshman with no morals and an endless sexual appetite. This teenage girl knows far more about sexual pleasure and pleasing men sexually than the Beast has ever dreamed of, and because she is a young woman with an unchecked sexual appetite, she has the basest of instincts regarding sex.Behold: the Manic Pixie Dream Slut. The Manic Pixie Dream Slut, or the MPDS for short, is the first person to gaze upon the Beast and realize that he is ""a man,"" by which the Beast means: he is a sexual predator with the power to rape her. This is how the narrative frames manhood, and what it means to be a full man. Men not only possess sexual prowess, but the threat of rape. Enjoying her fear, the Beast stalks the MPDS after class to the street she lives on. He threatens to rape her. He also shakes her, yells at her, bruises her wrists, and throws her library books into a wet gutter, ruining them.Rape is a turn-on for the MPDS. So is being physically bound and beaten. Apparently, a woman who is sexually liberated seeks to be tied up, beaten, and raped in order to achieve orgasm. She also wants to have sex with ""a hideous animal,"" tying female sexuality to bestiality and necrophilia, because the word ""ghoul"" and ""corpse"" are also used to describe the Beast's facial appearance.Because the MPDS has been awakened to her own sexual pleasure, and can have sex without love or marriage, the MPDS knows she needs someone who is ""ugly"" in order to get her off. The Beast does not rape her on their first encounter alone, but he does ruin her books. He writes a check to pay for her ruined library books, and tells the MPDS to come to his house to pick it up. She does. She has dinner with him. Then she leads him into his bedroom, strips off his clothes, and proceeds to give him sexual pleasure. The MPDS is sexually bold and knowledgeable, to the point that the Beast claims that she basically ""raped him,"" because she ignored all of his protests that he was old enough to be her father, and instead forced him to lie back on his bed and enjoy her attentions.In the narrative worldview of this novel, Sluts are Whores, and Whores deserve death, because this novel begins after the MPDS has been murdered. But at this earlier point in the narrative, after this first sexual encounter, the Beast and the MPDS begin to have a secret love affair, which takes up the bulk of the pages in this novel. As their love affair stretches into weeks and then months, the Beast changes from passive recipient of pleasure into sexual sadist. The Beast admits that he frequently slaps and hits the MPDS while they have sex. He frequently takes off his belt and lashes her. He ties her up. He lashes her until she screams in agony.When the Beast fears that the MPDS will go home for the summer, and possibly end their affair, he beats her especially hard, leaves her tied up for a time and goes to a pub for a drink. Then he returns to his bedroom, lashes her again with a belt, and then suffocates her to death with a pillow. He leaves her corpse on the bed, closes the door to the room, and spends the night on the couch. He says that he sleeps very well that night, and awakes to the sound of the MPDS's cat meowing for food. He gets up, takes the cat into the bathroom, and drowns the cat in the tub. Then he puts the cat in a trash bag and dumps it into a garbage container outside.Days pass. The corpse rots and the odor is reported to the police. The police come for the Beast, and they find him in his university office. The police are extremely polite to him because of his facial deformity. The Beast hates their cold politeness and sneers at their deferential behavior. He tells the reader and the police that only the MPDS saw the truth, the truth that people with scars and deformities are monsters inside and out:""No one ever guessed, before her. No one. Why should they? No one begins to try to guess at what's behind deformities and scars. We people are a race apart. It is the fault of people like you. You keep us that way, after all. You stay behind your bulwarks of unfailing politeness. You don't engage. And so we are habitually permitted, encouraged one might even say, to use our various hideous blemishes as scapegoats to save ourselves from having to admit to other weaknesses. What other weaknesses? Who knows? Shallowness? Spite? All manner of emotional disablement. All sorts of failings."" (page 183)Since there are only 189 pages in this book, this announcement is part of the final statement linking physical deformity with moral depravity.The Beast goes on to state of the MPDS, speaking of their love affair and the night that he killed her:""She'd let the ugly side of me loose. I beat down on the cringing and whimpering [the crying body of the MPDS, as she weeps on the bed as the Beast lashes her with his belt], and felt the stiff, stiff gristle of scar tissue [on his face] giving, as muscles I hadn't even known my face possessed began to stir. I was, I realized in some shock, grinning. Whole at last, I was thinking. Whole at last. What won't I now be free to show her? And it was anger. Bursting from me, the adder ready for release after a wait of over forty years. Anger, the gift I gave her, felt with a force I never could have believed would be mine. [...] I let it go. I felt as if I were exploding, as if the meretricious little bitch had somehow sprung some secret catch in me, exposing my core as I now raised a sweat exposing hers, laying bare all that lay hidden for years under the cover of my scar patch just as I now laid bare for her all that lay hidden under that soft, red and bloody puddle of skin."" (page 184)[Side note 1: ""bloody puddle"" = her skin has been split open by the lashes from his belt] (Side note 2: the word 'meretricious' means ""apparently attractive but having in reality no value or integrity"" -- this is how the Beast views the pretty college freshman who gave him the sexual pleasure he was delighted to receive. The term 'meretricious' also has an archaic meaning: ""relating to or characteristic of a prostitute."" Since the MPDS did not ask for money in return for the sexual pleasure she gave the Beast, and allowed him to physically assault her over and over again, she was viewed as being even lower than a prostitute in this text, another reason that the Beast does what he does to her.) The Beast goes on to kill her, and continues his narration of the physical violence he delivered to her before death to the officer:""I will not tell you all I did to her [before she died]. I doubt if she, if she were here, would want it told. I have no reason to confess 'the worst' to you. [...] I loved her and I killed her. That should be clear enough."" (page 184)The Beast then goes on to tell the police officer that if the officer wants to understand the Beast's level of physical and sexual violence, the officer should ""ask his wife,"" because the female sexual mind will ""come up with some explanation for all I felt and all I did. But stay away from me with your facile conclusions. I'm a whole man, and will not be diminished by any glib psychology of yours. I loved her and I killed her."" (page 184)Because this is an ableist text in all ways, the novel closes with the cure-or-kill ending that frequently connects to the logic of eugenics, where disabled people who cannot be cured represent a soon-to-be eradicated group whose promised erasure -- whether in death or being locked up out of sight -- will better society. As the Beast states:""The affair, I knew from the start, could not end in marriage; and if not in marriage, then what else can an affair ever end in, except pain and disaster, loss and tears? Life is no fairy tale, and this was not a story of Beauty and Beast, with their eventual triumph over ugliness. [...] How happy and relieved I was, standing and staring through this window here [his office window at the university], to see you and your henchmen [the police] walk this way across the lawns, and know that it was over, all over. [...] Can we go now? I'm very tired.""Those are the final lines of the book. (pages 188-189)The Beast is ""happy and relieved"" to be taken to prison for murder. Why? Because there was no cure for his facial scars, no cure for his internal and external ugliness. The Beast will now be locked up out of sight, and possibly executed, for the crime of murder.Here, then, is the overt messaging in this book:1. Women achieve sexual pleasure and orgasm through violence2. Men who are not violent with their female lovers never give their lovers an orgasm3. Women who are sexually liberated, and seek out sex for pleasure alone, are depraved whores4. Depraved whores are garbage who are frequently killed5. People with scars and deformities are angry, internally ugly, and evil6. Able-bodied men with facial scarring are all assumed to be impotent, which adds to their anger7. Getting close to people with scars and deformities might result in death8. Ugly people should be killed or locked up to protect society9. Ugly people are happy and relieved to be killed or locked up10. Animals only attack evil people*****As I finished typing that list, I thought it important to note that this book is *not* written as satire.On the book jacket, the publisher wrote: ""In 'The Killjoy,' Anne Fine has created an unforgettable portrait of a life scarred beyond redemption. This is a disturbing, thought-provoking and utterly compelling novel.""Please allow me to clarify, and rephrase that blurb so it's more accurate: ""In 'The Killjoy,' Anne Fine has created an ableist thought experiment about the inner life of a facially scarred man. This novel is a eugenics narrative that also hates women, and especially hates sexually liberated women who have sex for pleasure rather than love, marriage, and procreation."" If you enjoy eugenics narratives, which support killing or locking up people with any deformity or disability that cannot be cured, then this book is for you.If you are a disabilities studies scholar, then you probably already know this book exists, and what a Hate Fest it is.I do not recommend this book to anyone to read. I would actually recommend people just stay away from this book. It is the most toxically ableist novel I have ever read.One star.And all the f*ck you's I can ever give to ableism and eugenics, I scream them all at this book....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 23, 2018","Sep 26, 2018","Sep 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17735865-killjoy

The story picks up with the two main characters and point-of-view protagonists, Kestrel and Arin, and their struggles to keep the land of Herran free from the Empire.I am bitterly disappointed with this book. After binge-reading and 5-starring the first two books in this series, I expected ""The Winner's Kiss"" to be as delightful and absorbing as its predecessors. But I hit a wall of absurdity and ableism on page 390, and I could not continue. I had to DNF this at 81%.I feel like this book betrayed me, and was nothing more than a gigantic waste of my time. I feel *so* angry about that. I wish I had never read this. I wish I could take back those hours of my life and use them on something productive. So here is my speed- of ""The Winner's Kiss,"" so I can take this book back to the library tomorrow and try to pretend this never happened.Stuff I liked:1. Everything in the book up until the final big battle on the beach. I read every page carefully, absorbing all the minute setting details. The prose in this book is excellent.2. I was even okay with the amnesia plotline -- at least, I thought I was. Before I reached page 390, I assumed everything had been fine. I could understand why the author made this choice, to give Kestrel amnesia: to keep Kestrel and Arin from being together. 3. I thought Kestrel's drug addiction was well done. I disagree with other readers who claim there was a ""lack of science"" on display here. She was forced to take drugs and became addicted to them, and this read as being very true to real life. Regarding her amnesia, I didn't enjoy having to re-read all the major plot points from books 1 and 2, but I understood why the author felt that was necessary. *****Stuff I hated, to the point that I had to DNF:1. The set-up for the final battle was inconsistent with the story, and just f*cking ridiculous. Kestrel and Arin know the Valorians will arrive on a particular beach and launch an attack. Yet the Dracan-Herrani army makes NO preparations for this. Were there docks to burn? Who knows. High ground to position artillery? Never mentioned. Why didn't they build fortifications for their gunners? I have no idea.It's like Kestrel and Arin just lost their brains, and the story said, ""Hey, reader. You know all that cool historical fiction stuff you've been reading about, concerning military strategy and how clever the main characters are planning battles? Well, guess what -- JOKE'S ON YOU!! These people are actually *incompetent* and nothing you read about artillery and gun weaponry in this book even matters! It was just there for funsies! lolz!""Moments like this are called plot holes. This was a gaping, hideous, book-size plot hole. This scene should have been like the YA version of D-Day. It loomed like D-Day in my mind, especially since the story spent so much time on the development of personal firearms for the Dracan-Herrani soldiers to use. Much earlier in the book, Kestrel is even the one who realizes that conical bullets would be more accurate to fire than musket balls. By the time this beach scene arrived, I was eager and ready for some story payoff.But the Dracan-Herrani army makes no significant use of their ranged weapons -- no archers firing, no personal firearms being shot at the incoming troops, no boats loaded with explosives being detonated. They make no preparations for battle -- no fortifications to protect their own troops, who knows if there were docks to be burned, etc. And they do everything in their power to make it easy to be slaughtered -- EVEN THOUGH THE ADVANTAGE IS THEIRS. The beach is theirs, they are there first, and the initial bloodbath should have come down the hardest on the Valorians. Once the Valorians finally show up in their ships, the Dracan-Herrani forces are waiting for them RIGHT ON the beach -- on the WET SAND, including ALL OF THEIR INFANTRY, which allows the Valorians to fire their ship cannons through their cavalry (!!!), which Kestrel and Arin have positioned in front (!!!!), with their foot soldiers RIGHT BEHIND THEM (!!!) in the direct line of cannon fire -- and the battle is a massacre, in which the Dracan-Herrani forces quickly end up in a full retreat.But that's not even the worst. This battle is completely f*cking absurd, but it's actually not why I DNF'd.That honor goes to this point --2. Arin suffers a severe concussion in the battle, from taking a direct blow to the head from a sword pommel. He blacks out, and when he wakes up, he pukes and blacks out again. Kestrel has to get him up on a horse, and ride with him while he's unconscious for at least a full day, maybe longer, until they are in a safe place where Arin can be placed on a cot in a tent. All of that riding would slow down Arin's healing time. All of that jostling from being on horseback for that long with a concussion that severe would add to the strength of his brain damage. But the author didn't care about that. All sense of reality has now vanished from this novel.Arin is placed on a cot, and the book has the ""don't let him sleep, it's bad for a head injury"" medical advice in the dialogue, which is not accurate in real life, and it irritated me that the author wrote this crap into the book. The amnesia and drug addiction stuff had been so much more well-researched, I didn't want to see the author drop the ball here. But she did.Anyway, Kestrel does her best to ""keep Arin awake"" on the cot by telling him stories. Kestrel talks to him for hours, but sometime after midnight, Arin finally does pass out. He sleeps for a few hours, wakes up early the next morning, and... HE'S FINE. He's totally fine. While Kestrel is still asleep, he leaves the tent to walk outside to a campfire and make some tea. So now we are in the realm of an ableist plot device. And oh, what an ableist plot device this really is.When Arin first received the concussion, and was lying unconscious on the beach -- in the midst of the bloodbath in which his troops were being slaughtered -- Kestrel finally found the courage to tell Arin she loved him, before she gets him up on a horse and saves his life. After Arin wakes up and he's COMPLETELY FINE, Kestrel leaves the tent to find him, and she is upset with him for making tea, taking a bath, and behaving independently even though he suffered major head trauma and should, in her view, still be lying on a cot, awake but not moving. Which, given that he is fine, is absurd. But there follows a bunch of Teen Relationship Angst as they bicker, in which Kestrel is still terrified of her feelings, but finally, she tells Arin that she loves him, and now he is conscious and he can hear her.And then they immediately have sex. It's not an explicit sex scene, and it's not even sexy. More like the opposite. The last thing I felt as I read this brief scene was passion. Kestrel and Arin lie on ""the bed"" together in the tent, drop their clothes on the floor, and here is the *entirety* of the sex scene, a scene that readers had been waiting three books for: ""Words had fallen away. Maybe the words lay on the earth, nestled among clothes, curled into the undone dagger belt. Maybe later, language would be recovered and pieced together. Made to make sense. But not now. Now there was touch and taste and sound. When he eased into her, she was glad for the burning lamp, the fuzzy glow of it on his skin. The way it showed the black fall of his wet hair, the flesh and scars that made him. She didn't look away."" (page 387)*end scene*That's it. No foreplay. No passionate kissing. She tells him she loves him. They strip and lie down. He ""eases into her"" in the lamplight, and that's it.Ableist. Plot. Device. For. The. Win.And finally --3. The Valorians don't leave the beach and attack the retreating Dracan-Herrani army because the Valorians are ""recovering"" (page 390) from the battle. A battle that was a rout in their favor.Just to be clear: the Valorians would not stay on the beach ""to recover."" They would CHASE DOWN the retreating army and SLAUGHTER THEM ALL. The Valorians don't do this because the author wanted Arin and Kestrel to be able to have sex. So we get: the Valorians chose to stay at the beach because Reasons.*****The f*ckery in this book reached a point I could no longer tolerate. The entire substructure of this book runs on ableism and the plot machinations of the author, and once that became clear, the characters no longer felt real. Nothing felt real. It all became pointless. Illness and disability are used in the narrative when it serves the author's purposes, and become damaging plot devices when the author assumes she can get away with it. And I'm done. Done with this book. Done with the series. I will never read these books again. ""The Winner's Kiss"" uses illness and disability for so much of its plot. A lot of it was well done. But this concussion was an ableist plot device. The final battle scene on the beach was completely ridiculous. There was no payoff in the narrative for the invention of guns that started in book 2 and received a lot more development in book 3. The romance was incredibly disappointing. So much of this trilogy centers on the romance, and it just fell flat. There was more passion and heat in book 2 than anywhere in the pages of the finale.Someone told me that, in the remaining chapters, Kestrel kills the emperor with poison. POISON. Not her dagger. Not a gun with one of the bullets she helped create. Nope. Because we all know poison is ""a woman's"" favorite weapon of choice. >_<I'm so glad I DNF'd before I got to that point. I would only recommend ""The Winner's Kiss"" if you want to read a lot of Teen Relationship Angst in which war and ableist plot devices are used as stand-ins for modern high school drama that keep the two lovers apart....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 22, 2018","Sep 25, 2018","Sep 22, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20443235-the-winner-s-kiss

Snyder, because this book is so well-loved and lauded as something of a masterpiece. ""Poison Study"" is frequently featured on ""my favorite books of all time"" lists for many ers. If you feel that way about this novel, then please skip this . And if you are someone who is planning to read this book at some point, and do not want this book spoiled, then please be warned that there are unmarked spoilers throughout this .**spoilers**I never thought I would read a book with a higher level of porn culture and normalized misogyny than the 2015 YA fantasy, ""The Wrath and the Dawn,"" or the 2015 YA/adult fantasy, ""Uprooted,"" or the 2017 adult literary novel, ""My Absolute Darling."" All three of these novels feature such a high amount of porn culture and normalized misogyny that I never thought I could read anything worse. And now I have read ""Poison Study."" And I can say without question, this book has more porn culture and more normalized misogyny than all of those three books combined. If you enjoy abusive love stories, and if you are someone who found Christian Grey in ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" to be the epitome of everything you could ever want in a lover, then you might really enjoy ""Poison Study."" Just be warned that the male love interest in ""Poison Study"" makes Christian Grey look like the sweetest, kindest, cuddliest teddy bear of a snuggle-bug to ever stride across the page of a romance. Abusive male lovers are a popular trope in fiction. Abusive men who attempt to kill their female partners are the realm of ""The Wrath of the Dawn"" and ""My Absolute Darling."" And that is the focus of ""Poison Study"": the novel holds up a woman's daily poisoner and attempted murderer as her True Love, and gives these two a Happily Ever After at the end.There is a lot of gratuitous sexual violence in this novel. A rape scene in which the protagonist is the rape victim is written in direct scene as backstory. I definitely think a book like this deserves a trigger warning, since the violence is used for its entertainment value and as a spectacle, the same way rape and attempted rape is treated in ""My Absolute Darling"" and ""Uprooted.""The main character of ""Poison Study,"" a young woman named Yelena, is described as a person of ""southern"" heritage who has slightly darker-than-white skin, green eyes, and dark/black hair. I think the book cover engaged in some obvious white-washing, and I can't remember anyone else being described in this novel as a person of color. Reading ""Poison Study"" felt like reading a typical all-white medieval-Europe-esque fantasy.The overall world-building in this novel is flimsy and weak, but the details that the reader *is* given are pretty sickening. Yelena lives in a fantasy version of the U.S.S.R., a militaristic dystopia with a command economy, which is run by a hateful and murderous transgender character named the Commander. In a brief moment of backstory, the reader is told that the Commander began life as a young woman, suffered the extreme misogyny of this extremely dystopian world, transformed herself into a man, and then proceeded to slaughter the ruling king and take over the land with bloodshed and violence. The Commander divided the kingdom into a number of military districts that would each be overseen by a general, and gave himself absolute control over everyone as the totalitarian ruler. The Commander is at least twice as old as Yelena, and his rule of law is draconian, cruel, and inhumane. He also regularly oversees the murder of innocent children who are born with any form of “magic” in their bodies.The depiction of the Commander as such a murderous, hateful piece of sh*t, combined with the fact that he is the only transgender character in the book, and the only LGBTQIA+ character I came across in the story, led to me calling this character Transgender Stalin. “Poison Study” has a lot of terrible misogyny in it, but the character of Transgender Stalin occupies a unique category of “Shit I Really Hate In Fiction.”When Yelena was six years old, a man kidnapped her and gave her to one of Transgender Stalin’s generals, a man named General Brazell. General Brazell runs an “orphanage” that abuses, tortures, and murders children of various ages, especially girl children. Brazell focuses on populating his “orphanage” with children who have innate magic in their bodies, which doesn’t become manifest until the age of sixteen.After Yelena was severely abused for ten years in this “orphanage,” General Brazell planned to place her in a room with the other “graduates” of his training program at his orphan school: she would be chained to the floor in a circle, and spend the rest of her life as a semi-conscious zombie, having her magical energy drained by General Brazell for his own uses, in a plot to destroy Transgender Stalin with magic and take over the land as the new Commander. But by the time Yelena is sixteen, her “willfulness” is too strong to allow her to become one of these manacled zombies. General Brazell gives Yelena to his grown son, Reyad, to dispose of her as he likes. Reyad has spent years creating a journal listing all of the detailed ways he will torture and rape Yelena, repeatedly, and using the entire arsenal of his medieval torture devices, before he finally kills her, and replaces her with another girl orphan at his father’s “orphan school.”It is well-known by everyone in the story that the children of Brazell’s “orphanage” never leave his school. They just “disappear” once they “graduate,” and are never heard from again. No one ever investigates this, or wonders what is happening at Brazell’s torture-and-murder ring, because Transgender Stalin runs the world, and the entire society is laden with misogyny, sadism, terror, and murder.At sixteen, Yelena submits to being tortured and raped by Reyad. She is fully resigned to her fate, including when he shows her his journal of all the ways he will continue to torture and rape her until she is dead. Then Reyad tells Yelena that after she dies, he will replace her with one of her orphan friends at the school. At this point, Yelena decides to fight back. With blood still flowing out of her vagina and all of her other wounds from being beaten and raped, Yelena finds the strength to slice Reyad’s throat. For some unexplained reason, General Brazell hands Yelena over to Transgender Stalin to be executed for murder, rather than just killing Yelena in vengeance himself. Though anyone looking at Yelena could have known in an instant that she was a torture and rape victim, especially since the text makes it clear that blood was “pooling” on her thighs from being raped, Transgender Stalin’s men claim they have absolutely no idea why Yelena murdered Reyad. They simply put her in a filthy prison cell, where they keep her for a year in the most barbaric form of solitary confinement, until the day of her execution arrives. In the opening pages of Chapter One, Yelena is dragged in chains out of her cell and taken to the office of a man named Valek. Valek is at least ten years older than Yelena, and he serves as Transgender Stalin’s chief assassin and food-taster. Valek says he doesn’t know why Yelena killed Reyad, but he is willing to offer her a choice: either she can be executed for murder, as the law demands, or she can become a new food-taster for Transgender Stalin. Choosing to stay alive, Yelena takes the job. Valek then gives Yelena a lethal poison called Butterfly’s Dust. Though the reader learns by the end of the book that this was “a fictitious poison,” Yelena drinks what she is given, and makes no attempt to purge the poison at all. She just accepts that she has been lethally poisoned. Valek then tells Yelena that she has to take a daily dose of “an antidote” for Butterfly’s Dust or she will die. This “antidote,” is, in fact, a lethal poison, which kills its victims with severe stomach cramps and vomiting if they stop taking the poison for more than a day. Near the very end of the book, Valek gives Yelena the ability to survive dying from this lethal poison after she misses her daily dose of it, but from Chapter Two until almost the last page of the novel, Valek is administering lethal poison to Yelena every day. He is in full awareness of what he is doing; in fact, this entire set-up is his own creation. The daily poison forces Yelena to stay close to Valek and not run away from the castle. She becomes an unpaid slave for Valek and Transgender Stalin, and will face an extremely painful death by poison if she chooses to run away.When I read the opening chapters, it made NO sense to me why Yelena didn’t immediately try to throw up the Butterfly’s Dust. This is the kind of bullsh*t that only really bad novelists write into books. The author knows this substance won’t kill the main character, so the main character acts in accordance with the plot, not with reality at all. I resent this mightily. This scene is one of the very first in the book, and was the first episode in a long list of Logic Free Zone moments that fill these 361 pages.I also want to add that solitary confinement has immediate and severe impacts on prisoners, none of which appear anywhere in this book. Authors who do not understand anything about imprisonment or the effects of solitary confinement write material like this, wherein Yelena has no psychological damage or trauma from her year of being alone in a prison cell underground, living in the most abject of conditions, on the constant brink of starvation, in chains and filth. It really sickens me and angers me to see such thoughtless portrayals like this in novels. But I guess to a lot of readers, “being in prison” is as much an “unreal fantasy” as everything else in this book, and why should the author be expected to apply Logic or Reasoning here when it exists nowhere else. Anyway, moving on. Soon after Yelena has started to learn the job of being a food-taster, working as a slave under Valek’s direct command, Valek gives Yelena another lethal poison named “My Love.” Yelena willingly drinks this lethal poison knowing that it will probably kill her. Valek expects it to kill her, too. Yelena makes no attempt to purge the poison from her body before she falls on the floor.Again: this is another moment of complete bullsh*t in this book. Yelena willingly drinks lethal poison because Valek tells her to. The author has this happen because the author knows Yelena won’t die. Nothing in this book runs on logic, least of all Yelena. She is only a plot puppet, not a real person. Unsurprisingly, Yelena is horribly, horribly sick for days, but she survives her lethal dose of My Love. Valek is surprised by her survival, and he continues his cruel and abusive training so Yelena can take over his work as the food-taster.The bulk of this novel is about Yelena’s trials and tribulations in the castle as various people show up to beat the sh*t out of her and try to kill her. Sometimes, these violent assassins are people sent by General Brazell, who is desperate for the vengeance he feels he has been denied. Other times, these violent assassins are people from the surrounding kingdoms: magicians who have realized that Yelena has a powerful amount of magic in her body, a magic that Valek and Transgender Stalin have not yet detected. These magicians see Yelena as a threat to their power and a threat to all magic if she stays alive, and their solution is to destroy her. So, to sum up, Yelena faces constant brutality and the threat of murder in this book. Magicians from foreign lands want Yelena dead, Brazell and everyone who works with Brazell want Yelena dead, and if Valek and Transgender Stalin knew that Yelena has magic, they would murder her. Yelena must swallow a dose of lethal poison each day to avoid immediate execution, and she is enslaved as a food-taster, a job that also carries the constant threat of death.Everyone who interacts with Yelena in “Poison Study” operates with viciousness. If anyone is nice to Yelena at first, these people are simply more vicious than the others, and later betray her. Only the people who first abuse her, disrespect her, or attempt to kill her are later worthy of earning the status of being her “friend.” After hundreds of pages in which Yelena survives all of her poisons, beatings, and murder attempts, Yelena also succeeds in risking her own life numerous times to save the lives of Valek and Transgender Stalin, who are threatened with death from their enemies. Yelena is fully aware that both men would immediately kill her if they knew she had magic, but, much like drinking lethal poison, Yelena accepts and embraces that inevitable fate. In addition to her loyalty and care for her slavemasters, Yelena falls hopelessly in love with Valek, who has also, inexplicably, fallen hopelessly in love with her. The two finally reveal their feelings for each other during the big action scene near the very end of the book, while they lay on some filthy straw together, hiding from the men who are hunting them. Valek broaches the difficult subject of his feelings for Yelena in this way: “Yelena, you’ve driven me crazy. You’ve caused me considerable trouble and I’ve contemplated ending your life twice since I’ve known you” (page 335). I think it is important to note here that Valek is not speaking of any of the poisons he has given her when he refers to “ending her life” in this dialogue; he is referring to his other shitty, abusive behavior in the hundreds of pages of this book.Valek goes on to say that he couldn’t murder Yelena by telling her, “You’ve slipped under my skin, invaded my blood and seized my heart.” (page 335)Yelena tells the reader that she is “shocked and thrilled” by Valek’s “confession.” Aloud, she tells Valek, in regards to her effect upon him, “That sounds more like a poison than a person.” (page 335)""'Exactly,' Valek replied. 'You have poisoned me.' He rolled me over to face him. Before I could make another sound, he kissed me."" (page 336)Typical of every other kiss-and-f*ck scene in every other porn culture book, Valek and Yelena kiss and then immediately f*ck on the dirty straw, a scene that Yelena describes as being joyful and transcendent: “We had merged, our minds had become one. Our souls bonded.” (page 336)There are a few pages in the book after the main plot ends, in which it’s made clear that Transgender Stalin is still in charge, and Yelena is now at risk of immediate execution, since Transgender Stalin knows she has magic. Even though Yelena risked her life to save him from being killed by General Braskell and the magicians working for Braskell, Transgender Stalin is certain she must die. Transgender Stalin orders Valek to kill her, but Valek tells Yelena to flee, promising that they will be reunited one day. Valek stays loyal to Transgender Stalin, and Yelena flees for her life.For those eager to continue reading about Yelena’s journey to survive this world of nonstop depravity, “Poison Study” is the first of a trilogy. The two sequels were published in 2006 and 2008.**********The entire plot and thematic messaging in this novel align with porn culture, toxic masculinity, and misogyny. As academics have pointed out, porn and porn culture “teaches men how to make hate to women,” and that sums up the content of this book. In the world of “Poison Study,” power and violence are positive traits, while emotions and feelings are synonymous with death. The most lethal poison in the story is literally called “My Love,” and falling in love with someone is compared to “being poisoned.” The entire novel reads like the most violent kind of pornography, with the additional threat of turning into a snuff film. The female main character is kidnapped as a small child, abused for ten years in an “orphanage,” tortured and raped by a man who promises to torture and rape her to death, she murders her would-be killer only so that he will not rape her best friend, and then she is further traumatized by her society by being imprisoned in solitary confinement for a year. She is chained up in a filthy cell where she faces a daily threat of starvation. And all of this has happened to the main character before page one. The events of the novel detail Yelena’s daily poisoning and enslavement by two powerful men who force her to work a deadly job as a food-taster or they will execute her. Despite her complete dehumanization and victimization, Yelena falls in love with one of her slavers: the man who poisons her each day and would be her executioner. She survives all of this brutality, and is rewarded in the story by the man she has fallen in love with admitting she has “poisoned” him with feelings and the desire to f*ck her. The two of them immediately f*ck on some dirty straw, which is elevated in the narrative as a moment of transcendence, when their souls bond together. I would like to compare “Poison Study” to “Fifty Shades of Grey” for a moment. I feel it necessary to point out that Christian Grey never enslaves Anastasia Steele. He never feeds her lethal poison each day to keep her trapped at his side. He never holds the threat of execution over her to keep her working for him as his slave.A lot of ers of “Poison Study” have one-starred “Fifty Shades of Grey” for portraying “an abusive relationship,” but these same ers have five-starred “Poison Study” with gushing s that this book has a “powerful love story” and features an “excellent romance.” I honestly cannot fathom how much I would have to hate myself to ever call the relationship in this book a romance, or say that anything in these pages is love.Negative stars. Not recommended for anyone. This book is terrible....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Sep 16, 2018","Oct 18, 2018","Sep 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1192365.Poison_Study

This is a powerhouse read. It's brilliant, and I The 2018 YA contemporary debut novel, ""The Poet X,"" by Elizabeth Acevedo, is absolutely outstanding. This is a powerhouse read. It's brilliant, and I loved it.The beginning, however, was such a difficult slog that I wanted to put the book down and give up. Here's why:1. This story is utterly realistic, which means the setup and opening pages are very grim, very sad, and overall just depressing. Whenever I seek out content like this, I usually prefer nonfiction.2. There isn't an inkling of a plot in this book until page 69, when the love interest finally appears on the page. Before that, ""The Poet X"" reads like a rather depressing character study of a young woman's life. While I do enjoy character studies, I prefer to read them in literary fiction, poetry, and nonfiction. If I have to wallow in grim reality, I typically need the prose to be fiercer or the payoff of reading real life instead of fiction.3. Even after the love interest appears on page 69, I had to read more than 100 pages (maybe 130 pages or so) before I felt any kind of investment in this story. The main character and first-person protagonist, Xiomara, is a realistic teenage woman: she is rather beaten-down, submissive, emotionally stunted and broken. She is also quite mean, a physical fighter who prides herself on hurting people with her fists. It's totally understandable. But it did not make her likeable or very sympathetic, and I really struggled to care, for the additional reasons I pointed out in points #1 and 2 on this list. *****For as off-putting as the first third of this novel was, once I was invested, I was completely absorbed by this book. Pages flew by. I didn't want to put it down. I did come to care for Xiomara a great deal, and I kept having to force myself to slow down as I read, because I found her journey so compelling that I wanted to speed-read. This is a novel told in verse, and many of the poems are quite short. While some people might be fast poetry readers, ""The Poet X"" took me as long to read as a typical YA contemporary would. By the time I reached page 311, titled: ""Other Things You Think About in the Split Second Your Notebook Is Burning,"" I was starting to fight some tears. It's astonishing to me that a YA contemporary can bring me to tears, but this book did. There are 357 pages in this book, and from page 311 on, I admit that I suffered some ugly-crying. Not because the book was sad, but the opposite: I felt triumph and joy. There is real grace in this story. It is a rare book that makes me feel that. Also in this novel: generosity of spirit; acceptance of humanity; the healing power of community; the limits of love; the restorative power of love. The Acknowledgements for this book (pages 359-361) made me cry as well. Page 361 was particularly beautiful and deeply moving. There is plenty of untranslated Spanish in this novel, but the story is certainly written to be understood by a white, monolingual English-speaking audience. For instance, take these lines on page 289:""Noche Buena, the Good Night,has always been one of my favorite holidays.On TV white familiesalways open gifts on Christmas Day,but most Latinos celebrate the night before.""That passage illustrates how the text frequently weaves in translations and cultural information for a white, monolingual English-speaking reader who might not have much exposure to Spanish language or Latinx culture. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone to read. I've added ""The Poet X"" to my ""books that make life worth living"" Goodreads shelf, because it really hit me with all the feels.

I would have given this 5-stars if not for the sudden ""plot twist"" that occurred on page 275, very close to the end of the book.

I was really unhappy about that, mostly because putting Officer Leger/Aspen into the palace required an act of profound ignorance and willful self-destruction on behalf of the kingdom's security. The palace is frequently under attack by rebel forces, and yet, the royal family is allowing brand-new soldiers who might have rebel ties into their palace with only a few weeks of training, and no form of security clearance. Plotting like this is so ridiculous that I just lose the will to keep reading. I forced myself to skim-read to the end, but I was deeply upset that this book shifted into a logic-free-zone so close to the finish. If Aspen turns out to be a rebel fighter who has infiltrated the palace, I would not be surprised. Honestly, any royal family with palace security this incompetent deserves to lose their throne.I think anyone who picks up this book expecting standard YA fantasy, in which the romance is perceived to be a sub-plot rather than the main plot, will be extremely disappointed. I read this book as a YA contemporary with fantasy elements, and it worked for me that way. Technically, ""The Selection"" is meant to take place in a dystopian future United States, but the book excels at presenting the present-day United States with its increasingly fixed class system in a dystopian future in which each modern economic class is renamed a ""Caste"" with a number system: homeless people are in Caste 8, the lowest, royals are born into Caste 1, the highest, and America Singer, the first-person protagonist of this novel, is born into Caste 5. Caste 5 perfectly matches the modern lower-middle class in the present-day United States.I really, really loved this. Kiera Cass did something brilliant with this book when she chose to write honestly about the rigid class system in the United States, and I commend her for it. Bella Swan in ""Twilight"" was also a member of the lower-middle class, and it's so rare that YA authors write class realities into their books that I cannot help but cheer with joy when I find it. Because many people want to believe in a perfect myth of equality and meritocracy in the modern U.S., rather than face the realities of the impacts of being born into specific socioeconomic classes through nothing more than sheer luck, I can see why many readers thought the world-building was ""terrible"" in this book. Personally, I thought it was brilliant.Modern gender roles are also a big part of this novel. I thought this was extremely well done, and I enjoyed how gender roles had negative impacts on all the main characters, and influenced the plot.The prose in this novel is a great fit for Young Adult. The writing flows well. It's not overly lyrical or nonsensical. Words are not misused. The author understands basic vocabulary and grammar. The sentences are not stuffed with ridiculous metaphors or terrible similes. This is a straightforward book told in a straightforward style, and I found the writing enjoyable. ""The Selection"" also excels in the same way that ""Twilight"" excels: the romance is very engaging. America Singer and Prince Maxon have real chemistry together. They are friends who have honest conversations and express vulnerability with each other. Their honesty ends on page 275, however, when America chooses to start lying to Prince Maxon. Once Aspen is reintroduced as a contender for America's heart, and she starts lying to the man I have identified as her True Love (Prince Maxon), my interest in finishing the book fell off a cliff. I would have gladly read the entire trilogy had the author kept the focus on America and Prince Maxon and their relationship drama. I did not like Aspen, I was already ""over"" him, and seeing the world-building fall apart just so he could be placed in the palace with America made me want to DNF.I would recommend this book to fans of contemporary YA, YA romance, and anyone who enjoys Love Triangles. It saddens me that the author and her agent behaved badly and attacked Wendy Darling for her . I think there was a lot of er backlash against this book because it is more like ""Twilight"" than ""The Hunger Games,"" and the book's publisher recommended this novel for fans of ""The Hunger Games,"" simply because that franchise was so much more popular at the time. The publisher stopped comparing this book to ""The Hunger Games"" once it was clear that this was inviting an intense amount of backlash against ""The Selection,"" but the damage was already done. If you are a fan of ""Twilight,"" I would definitely recommend ""The Selection"" if you enjoy YA fantasy. Personally, I enjoyed ""Twilight"" a lot more because it is set in the contemporary world and its world-building doesn't suffer the kind of major flaw that made ""The Selection"" fall apart for me. 3 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 12, 2018","Sep 22, 2018","Sep 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10507293-the-selection

Pearson, is the first book in a YA fantasy trilogy, first published in 2014. I picked this up hoping I might be pleasantly surprised by a good book. Some ers I trust have given ""The Kiss of Deception"" 5-star rave s, and I hoped I might be one of them.Alas, that was not the case. I thought this book was terrible. Sadly, all I want to do is complain about how bad it was, and vent my frustration. On the sliding scale of ""bad YA,"" this book is not the worst I have read. The main characters do not commit acts of evil in the name of ""moral righteousness"" and then collect a hero's reward after committing atrocities. The three main characters in this book are very foolish, but not evil. Hence, why I give this book 2 stars instead of only one.The main plot of this book is a love triangle between a princess named Lia and two mysterious (and completely gorgeous) young men. If you enjoy romance-heavy books that feature main characters and entire kingdoms who make Derek Zoolander look like a genius, you might forgive the unending inanity in the plot, setting, and characters of this book, and just enjoy the romance ride.I was prepared to enjoy this book as Fantasy Lite, the same way I recently read the entirety of ""Twilight"" and gave that book 5 stars as a romance book with a side of fantasy. Given the s I had read of ""The Kiss of Deception,"" I knew the love triangle in this book might need to be read and enjoyed the same way I read ""Twilight,"" and I picked this book up preparing to do that.But ""The Kiss of Deception"" is not set in the contemporary world, starring modern high school students. This is a standard medieval fantasy kingdom, with standard fantasy worldbuilding, and yet the silliness and melodrama is so high, I felt like this story should have been set in a high school classroom. The book would have made a lot more sense as a YA contemporary romance. The book begins right before seventeen-year-old Princess Lia runs away from her family on her wedding day. Lia is supposed to wed the prince of another kingdom in order to form a military alliance to protect the realm, but Lia wants to marry for love, so she chooses to flee. It is clear in the text that this will infuriate her family and she will be hunted down as a traitor, should she not go through with this wedding. I do not mind that Lia still chose to disobey her family and leave. It was everything that came after that fell apart for me, and made me feel like I was reading the medieval fantasy version of Derek Zoolander. Lia and one of her teenage maids named Pauline flee the castle on two beautiful royal horses. They travel a short distance across the kingdom -- staying in the woods the first night, but then they travel on the main roads of the kingdom for a couple of days. They stay in their kingdom, and stop in a pretty seaside town. There, they move into a cottage owned by a friend of Pauline's, an older woman who also gives the girls work as barmaids and cleaning women at her inn and tavern. Pauline and Lia continue to wear the ""heavy clothing"" of the capital city they fled, called Civica, once they settle into this new town of Terravin. Many, many pages of this novel go by (representing weeks in the story) before the two girls change their clothing, and start wearing the looser, skimpier clothing of the residents of Terravin. The girls continue to use their real names, too. Lia continues to call herself Lia, and Pauline continues to call herself Pauline. Sometimes, they have heated conversations about how Lia is the princess, and random people passing by can overhear them. Since the book is told from multiple points of view, the reader knows that passersby do, in fact, overhear them. As soon as the girls are in Terravin, Lia saunters around in public places, serving food and drink to the guests at the tavern. At one point, she mouths off to a group of royal soldiers passing through Terravin, and she even dumps a drink in one soldier's lap to further insult him, and does this in a roomful of people who all turn to stare at her. This is all happening while Lia's family has hired people to track her down, her father has alerted the kingdom that she is missing, and has put a bounty on her head to guarantee her return to the castle. Around 130 or 150 pages into the book, the reader learns that Lia also stole something very precious from two powerful men in the castle, and left behind a note so these scary men would know that she was the thief. These men have hired their own assassins to track Lia down, kill her, and retrieve the items she stole from them. Lia also left behind an obvious trail when she fled the castle. She and Pauline were traveling on fine horses from the royal stables. Lia makes only one pathetic attempt to hide their trail by doubling back through a creek shortly after leaving the castle. After that, no mention is made of hiding their trail, and the girls use the main roads instead. On day 2 or 3 of their ride, they trade their fine horses for three donkeys, and ride those donkeys into Terravin. The girls leave the castle in broad daylight and travel across the kingdom in broad daylight. They make no attempt to disguise themselves. They use the jewels from Lia's clothing for money. They discard items randomly as they travel, in the woods and on the roads, leaving further evidence behind for trackers to follow them.While reading this book, Lia basically wore a giant sign over her head that flashed, I'M THE PRINCESS, EVERYONE, and somehow the reader is just meant to roll with it. She successfully ""hides out"" as a barmaid in Terravin for the bulk of this novel, until she chooses to leave the town on her own. During one big festival in Terravin, Lia enters a blade-throwing contest and uses her diamond-encrusted royal dagger instead of the standard-issue blade for the tournament. Illegally using her own dagger in this contest gets Lia disqualified, but no one bats an eye at a barmaid using a bejeweled dagger she could never have afforded or even been in possession of.I could go on with such details, but I want to return to Lia's flight from the castle, and say this: for anyone trained in tracking, it is EASY to track two people on horseback. Horse hooves leave heavy sign (sign = marks the human eye can detect or scents that a dog can follow). Running horses through water does not ""hide"" that sign. Trackers can follow horses being walked through creeks and stream beds. Only a swimming horse would be impossible to follow, and Lia and Pauline never swim with their horses. Unshod horses can sometimes be difficult to track across large sections of flat rock, but these girls were traveling on shod horses, and they weren't traveling across large sections of flat rock, but through the woods and across loose rock and fields. These were also horses that stand out -- they came from the royal stables. People notice horses like that. Also, people recognize royals. That's one of the things about being a royal: people remember your face. In 1791, King Louis XVI of France tried to flee Paris at night, and at a stop in Sainte-Menehould, he was recognized and caught, and sent back to the capital. There wasn't even a bounty for anyone to collect for him. There weren't assassins and bounty hunters tracking him, either. He was just recognized, the authorities were alerted, people were sent after him, they caught up to him, and then he was seized and returned.The people in this kingdom have plenty of reasons to return Lia to the castle. There is not only the threat of war and the need to gain the military alliance, but there is a financial reward to be gained by returning her. Lia isn't disguising herself, or trying to stay in hiding at all. She is using her own name and mouthing off to royal soldiers. She is also still with Pauline, the same maidservant who fled the castle with her. I can hear someone saying, ""But this girl was only a princess, not the ruling monarch in power, people might not recognize her face, as you claim."" Yes, I understand that point. But in this story, Lia is so strikingly beautiful that men are instantly attracted to her, to the point that one of the assassins sent to kill her is so smitten that he chooses not to kill her on sight, and falls in love with her instead. Lia's face is not the kind of face that would just blend in with a crowd or be easily forgotten by anyone who has seen her before. This book is 486 pages long. It was incredibly boring and frustrating to read. By page 346, my internal organs were shutting down due to boredom, and I was losing my will to live if it meant I had to keep reading. I skimmed the rest of the book, since many ers said the story ""picked up"" and ""got a lot better"" in the second half. But everything I skim-read was just as inane and nonsensical as the first 346 pages of the book. For instance, there is a scene near the very end of the novel in which a failing horse must be killed. There are a lot of hungry mouths to feed, the people in this scene are traveling across a wasteland and surviving on one daily snake kill that is split between multiple adults and one ten-year-old child. The horse is killed and just left for the buzzards. The reality is, that horse would have been butchered and eaten. For some readers, details like that do not matter. For me, details like that served as a constant reminder that this book would have made a lot more sense if the story took place in a modern high school, where the melodrama and silliness would have been tolerable, and not in a medieval fantasy world populated by Derek Zoolanders. Even if I forgave all of the worldbuilding absurdity in this tale, I still think the romance itself was lacking. Part of this was because I disliked Lia so much. While I admired her for having agency (choosing to flee the palace, wanting to marry for love and marry a man of her own choosing), her behavior was always so juvenile and ridiculous -- the opposite of anyone who is trying to stay alive in her situation -- that I found myself more and more aggravated with her with every page that went by. But even if I had adored Lia, the romance between her and her love triangle beaus -- Rafe and Kaden -- was also very flat for me. Because it was clear that none of these three people are ever being honest with each other, I could never forget that their attraction and desire to be with each other was based solely on appearance and their public behavior. There was no real intimacy here. In ""Twilight,"" within the first third of the novel, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan discuss Edward's secret together: that he is a vampire in hiding in Forks. In ""The Kiss of Deception,"" no such conversations ever take place. Lia is physically gorgeous and lusted after by two men: a prince and an assassin. She must decide which man she loves without ever knowing who those men really are. The men know her secret identity, but she has no idea who these men are, and all of their ""romancing"" with each other takes place in that bubble of Lia's cluelessness. I do not find dishonesty intimate or romantic at all. None of these characters was ever truly vulnerable with each other, and the few kissing and touching scenes in the book just weren't enjoyable to me for that reason.Lastly, I must say that I didn't enjoy the prose. The author frequently chose to skip over important scenes, jump the timeline, and then have the characters relate the skipped scene as backstory. This always reads as a drag. The prose read slowly to me overall, with a plodding style I didn't enjoy. The story is told from three points of view, and I sometimes confused Lia's point of view with Rafe's or Kaden's, and had to reread entire pages once I realized my mistake. All three main characters had the same narrative voice. I would recommend this book for fans of Extreme Fantasy Lite and love triangles.

""The Winner's Crime"" didn't have the number of jarring plot hole moments the way the first book did. The pacing felt even better in this one, though there were fewer action scenes (scenes of fighting or other heart-pounding activity) and no battle scenes, which saddened me. I really enjoyed that material in the first book, and missed it here.Kestrel and Arin, the main characters, remain delightful to read. By this second book, they have lost their morally grey attributes and now read as heroes with clearly defined goals and integrity. The tension between them is wonderful and keeps the pages turning. There is far less romance in this book -- the tenderness on display in this book is extremely limited -- but that keeps the stakes high in the story, and filled me with all kinds of angst as a reader, which is just a lot of good fun, honestly, even though I hate being all angsty. This was just the right kind of angst to be feeling: the kind I was *meant* to feel by a good story hitting its marks. Marie Rutkoski definitely knows how to write an excellent ending! Both books in this series have ended in tense moments that leave the reader anxious to pick up the next book. These aren't endings that abruptly halt in the middle of a high-action scene (which always feels like lazy writing to me). These are endings that wrap up the main action of the book, but then introduce a new twist that sets the scene for the next book. It's pretty brilliant and I love it.I confess that I really dislike these book covers because the artwork doesn't match the story content. I avoided reading these books for so long because I thought this series was like ""Throne of Glass,"" but with even more prom dresses and candy. But the writing and content in these books is nothing like ""Throne of Glass."" I know that these covers have done a good job selling this trilogy, and I've heard these covers praised by other fans many times, so my opinion is definitely in the minority. But I can't help but look at these covers and just feel completely baffled by them. Kestrel has red-gold hair (not bright blonde) and she doesn't wear the dresses being featured (in color or style). Nor does she ever fight with a sword. She carries a dagger and it mostly stays belted to her waist. These covers were chosen to sell the books -- and they *do* sell these books -- but as a reader, I find this artwork misleading and frustrating. Sadly, my library does not own a copy of the third book in this trilogy, ""The Winner's Kiss."" I put in a request for a loan from another library before I had even finished the second book. My local bookstore doesn't stock the third book, either. These first two books have left me feeling like a crack addict who can't score my next fix. I hate that feeling, but that's definitely the price people have to pay for book love. Damn it all. The highest high and then that total crash when the story is over or the next part of the story is nowhere to be had. Ugh.I'm definitely going to read the third book when I can get my hands on it.Five stars for this sequel.

I almost DNF'd this a couple of times, even though I read it in one day. I'm glad I didn't put it down in frustration, because the ending was worth it.Does this book always make logical sense? No. This is YA, and flights of fancy are sometimes taken. But the storyline is so delightfully complicated, and strengthened with such great warfare details, it kept pulling me back into its thrall. If you've ever read about 17th, 18th, or early-19th century battle tactics, you'll see that the author flexes her plot muscle in this regard very well, and damn it all, I am so into this. Napoleon Bonaparte, Peter the Great, George Washington -- there are echoes of all of them and more in this book. There is no fantasy-magic, or ""fantastical powers"" in this novel; all of the military operations read as historical fiction, rather than fantasy. This ends up being book heroin for me, and is the reason I cannot help but give this book 5 full stars. I also feel that thing I hardly ever feel with YA fantasy: I want to finish the entire trilogy.There is great use of artillery in this book, though the story-world removes muskets, rifles, pistols, and all other personal firearms from the setting. Like most YA fantasy, guns are anathema to the story-world in this book. So, we get cannons, but no personal firearms. This does aggravate me. And yet, the artillery details in this book were so enjoyable, I forgive the lack of guns. And here is why I forgive it: because the author doesn't make explicit use of a real-life culture in this book to bring her story-world to life. There is no lazy use of Spanish or another language in this novel, no lazy use of vocabulary terms lifted from a distinct nation or ethnic group to build a ""fantasy culture,"" no lazy use of borrowed history to disguise a lack of imagination on the author's part. For that reason, I accept that the author made a fantasy world in which characters fight with swords and crossbows and heavy artillery, but don't possess personal firearms. When authors authentically create their own worlds with their own story-rules, I can follow and accept the world-building I enter into, so long as the author doesn't counter that world-building for the sake of an arbitrary plot point. In ""The Winner's Curse,"" the story set up its own logic and adhered to it, at least so far as battle strategy and warfare was concerned. Hence, the reason I give this 5 stars, and want to keep reading.Another reason I wanted to DNF at certain points was due to the fact that the two main characters in this book (Kestrel and Arin) **really are** morally grey characters. It's actually very difficult to consume novels with morally grey characters. Many YA authors falsely claim that their heroic, morally-good protagonists are ""morally grey"" -- but ""The Winner's Curse"" is the rare instance when that is a factually correct statement to make. I have a deep-rooted patriotism that kept surfacing as I read this book, and that patriotism held the main POV character, Kestrel, in severe judgment for her acts of betrayal. Kestrel is brutal, selfish, and highly unlikeable at many points in the story. But at other points, Kestrel reads more like a Hayao Miyazaki heroine, a character who sympathizes with her enemies as much as her own people, and Kestrel's empathy kept overriding my antipathy toward her behavior and pulling me back to her side. This book is often repulsive. The warfare is so much more realistic than other YA fantasy warfare, and that makes certain scenes even more awful to read. This is the stuff that won me over, though. This is the stuff that hooked me and kept me hooked.One thing I really hate in this book is that an attempted rape is set up in the narrative as being worse than the horrific scenes of slaughter that came before. This attempted rape is also set up as being worse than Kestrel's betrayal of an entire people. My big moment of DNF came in the aftermath of this attempted rape scene (which takes place well into the second half of the book). That was when the book screamed ""this is a YA fantasy"" and broke the spell I was under. Rape is certainly a serious crime, but only in a YA fantasy would the attempted rape of the heroine be given even more traumatic weight in the story than the wholesale slaughter of an entire city of people, which had happened just days before. Yes, rape is terrible. But what Kestrel had just participated in was equally terrible. For the story to claim that she starts having nightmares because she was almost raped, rather than any of that other horror she had just witnessed and participated in, is YA fantasy writing, not reality.Parts of the book's beginning also seemed highly unrealistic, when Arin is allowed to be openly defiant and hostile in his brand new role as Kestrel's slave. I kept shaking my head at his brazenness, thinking he would realistically be whipped or possibly even killed for talking back to his master like that, given the details that had been outlined about this slavery system in the opening chapters. That was another moment that screamed ""this is a YA fantasy"" and broke the spell of the story for me. But there are so many other good things in this book. Kestrel is, for the most part, not as physically strong as the male warriors in the book. I loved how much the narrative kept subverting my expectations and forcing Kestrel to rely on her wits rather than physical strength. This remained true up until the very end of the book, when she is able to magically survive three days sailing alone across the sea with no food and no water, using sailing skills that came out of nowhere and were completely inexplicable and baffling. She also suddenly possessed an extraordinary amount of physical stamina and strength that read like Magic Mary Sue Skillz and broke the spell of the story again. The rage I felt at that scene was my final ""DNF this ridiculous book!"" moment for me. Had I DNF'd there, I would have missed the best part, which is when the book shines the most with imperial strategy, morally grey characterizations, and people in power with mixed motives. This book eschews straw men Big Bads and cardboard Evil for the Sake of Evil villains. It's so rare that a YA fantasy does that. And once again, ""The Winner's Curse"" became book heroin for me, to the point that I happily give this novel 5 stars.Recommended.

Published in 1995, Cathleen Schine's adult contemporary novel examines the summer romance of a 41 (or perhaps 42?) -year-old woman named Helen who owns and operates an indie bookstore and becomes the object of affection of one of her young employees, a 20-year-old college student named Johnny. The book is about a lot more than this romance, though I enjoyed the love story enormously. Helen and Johnny are both fascinating characters, with big interior lives and emotional depth. Helen is especially prickly and delightfully wicked, and I was shocked by how much I adored Johnny. How could Helen ever find her equal among mere mortal men, especially a man who is basically still a boy? That was what I wondered when I picked up this book. I was extremely doubtful that any boy was going to satisfy a grown woman. But it turns out I had no need to worry; this story delivered. Johnny is spectacular. Yes, he is young, but he reads a lot, he loves history, and when he chooses Helen to love, he becomes a man on a mission, and I could not get enough. He was such a wonderful character, and the chemistry in this book is superb. There is a lot of buildup in the story before these two come together. That growing anticipation makes the book even more fun to read. I guessed the plot twist at the end before the midway point of the book, but that didn't make it any less fun to read. I laughed out loud at the reveal. There is a lot of comedy in this book. And some very barbed satire that not many authors can pull off. Cathleen Schine is a really great writer. I tore through this book and I would absolutely reread it.Five full stars. Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys good writing, fast plots, delightful characters, and great love stories.

My local library doesn't own any of Dworkin's work, so in order to get my hands on her prose, I purchased a used copy of this book on Amazon. I am proud to say that this paperback edition of ""Pornography"" is going on my ""own forever"" shelf at home. After reading the first fifty pages, I immediately purchased copies of two more of Dworkin's books. This woman is amazing. I want to read her entire oeuvre. My one great regret is that I came to this book so late in my life. I wish I'd had this book when I was in middle school. It would have helped me so much to have read this book when I was ten, eleven, or twelve. I'm incredibly grateful to have finally read it at all, at age 39. But it saddens me to know how much this book would have helped me as a child growing up. In July of 2019, when my copy came in the mail, I read this book in about three days. This book healed broken things inside of me. Every page of this book washed over me like healing water poured over my oldest, deepest wounds.Dworkin's insights, wisdom, moral rectitude, solidarity, and global acumen will certainly be utilized in my own work as an author of fiction. The clarity and strength I have already drawn from this book is profound.Andrea Dworkin died in 2005. I'm so very sad that she's gone. I'm so very grateful for her life, and the truth she left behind.All the stars. All the praise for this incredible gift of a book.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jul 19, 2019","Jul 30, 2019","Aug 31, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/163256.Pornography

If you do not want to be spoiled for the film or the novel, please stop reading here. But if you're familiar with both or do not care to be spoiled, then here we go:I loved the first half of this novel. All of the details surrounding the characters, plot, and setting of the world in this novel are brilliant. The writing is beautiful, crafted with care and delightful to read. The pages turn with alacrity.The second part of this book became a chore for me to push through. I was expecting the main character, Sophie, to have more of an interior life. She develops her own magical powers in this story, and I wanted her to analyze why Wizard Howl was able to go to sorcery school, but a girl like Sophie was not, or did not. I wanted to know if Sophie was ever going to earn the title of Witch, but this was never brought up or even hinted at in the book. That upset me, and felt very disappointing. On the one hand, as a love story, this book gives the reader that heteronormative high of seeing the breeding pair united at the end, and I cannot deny that the last chapter was deeply satisfying to me for that reason. Like so many readers, I love a fun story that ends with the breeding pair holding hands and gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. But the action scenes that built to that moment were extremely chaotic. Wizard Howl randomly transforms into any number of magical animals, and he stars in a lot of action scenes that Sophie watches from afar. The final battle with the Witch of the Waste in the book was beyond anti-climactic. Just thinking of all the loud, jarring, nonsensical action scenes in the second half of this book makes me long to forget I even read this. But then I think of the final three pages, which describe the breeding pair giddily united at the very end, and that inescapable euphoria of heteronormative happiness overwhelms me, and my fingers itch to flip the book open to that final moment just to read it again.That means that I really bought into these characters. I loved Sophie and Wizard Howl and Calcifer and Michael. I really loved seeing them happy and safe and heterosexually paired off at the end. (Well, all except for Calcifer, who simply decides to stay with them after gaining his freedom.)I watched the movie again right after I finished the book. Of course, a lot was changed in the adaptation. In the novel, Sophie has two sisters who play important roles in the story. In the movie, Sophie only has one sister who is dropped from the story shortly after the film begins. In the book, Sophie's stepmother and two sisters are good people. In the movie, Sophie's *mother* betrays her to Wizard Suliman, and her one sister is loving but is never seen or heard from again after the opening.In the book, Wizard Suliman is a good wizard. He and Prince Justin are both missing, and are mentioned throughout the story (although this adds to the general sense of chaos in the second half of the book, all these missing characters who were never introduced in scene, and are therefore difficult to care about or remember). In the movie, Wizard Suliman is female and evil. She is also the only person in the film who uses a wheelchair, giving her the heavy ableist trope of a disability as a sign of maliciousness: when the sole disabled person in a story is sinister, evil, and criminal.It is also not lost upon me that the movie chose the Arabic-named character, Wizard Suliman, to be female, disabled, and evil. As many people know, Suliman is the Arabic form of the name Solomon. The novel does not present this male person as evil at all. When I watched the movie again, and I saw how Wizard Suliman is made out to be female, disabled, and malicious, along with the Witch of the Waste, the misogyny hit an even higher register than I had ever realized.Critics praise the movie for being ""incredibly feminist."" But that's only because the misogyny level in the film is so high and so commonly accepted in popular culture that the film's misogyny goes unnoticed. It's ""normal misogyny"" and is all the more horrifying to me for that reason. In the book, the Witch of the Waste has been corrupted and taken over by a fire demon, a fire demon like Calcifer, and the book makes it clear that Calcifer could become evil like the fire demon who has taken over the Witch of the Waste. For Wizard Howl and Calcifer in the novel, the Witch of the Waste is a harbinger of the future lying in wait for themselves if they don't break the spell that binds them together. In the movie, the Witch of the Waste is evil because of her unrequited love for Howl. This is a misogynist trope. And I hate it. The movie traffics in far more misogyny than the book ever does. In the movie, the Witch of the Waste is also fat (as well as old), and the movie fat-shames her to an incredibly high degree. The fat-shaming in this movie always appalled me, and the older I get, the more I feel like I need to vomit when the scene of the Witch of the Waste climbing the stairs begins. It's honestly disgusting enough to make me physically ill.What the movie gets right, and what the movie adds to the original story to its benefit, is that the stakes are much higher, the plot is much more steamlined and clear, the love story is *much* more developed and clear, and no one is killed at the end. Hayao Miyazaki eschews the idea that ""evil must be destroyed"" in storytelling, especially children's storytelling, and so, whereas Wizard Howl kills the Witch of the Waste in the book, she is not killed in the movie. Neither is Wizard Suliman.But this is where I, again, have problems with the movie. Wizard Suliman in the film is a stand-in for United States militarism: specifically, the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. I understand that in real life, no one responsible for the U.S. invasion of Iraq ever went to prison. But in the movie, Wizard Suliman tries to kill Howl with a spear; she was clearly a villain who deserved to go to prison. Maybe, because Wizard Suliman punishes the Witch of the Waste in the movie, and strips her of her powers, this is supposed to be seen as Suliman's ""good"" quality. But Wizard Suliman did not ""punish"" the Witch of the Waste in the movie because she cursed Sophie; in the movie, Wizard Suliman is just eliminating her own competition by taking out other sorcerers. She is a totally sh*t person and deserved to be imprisoned. Suliman is the character who ends the ""silly war"" in the movie though, and speaks for Hayao Miyazaki that militarism is ignorant and destructive. The audience is meant to forgive her villainy for that reason.The characters in the movie are much more noble than the characters in the book. Howl is much more attractive in the film. The movie shows Howl suffering the consequence of slowly turning into a monster due to the kind of magic he is using, whereas in the book, Howl never suffers anything like that. The addition of a war in the film (there is no war or militarism in the book) also made the movie much more dramatic and compelling to watch than the random clashes between Wizard Howl and the Witch of the Waste in the book. In the end, reading the novel and watching the movie again illuminated a lot of hegemonic discourse in the film that I didn't realize had been added into the movie. Misogyny, ableism, fat-shaming, and orientalism that does not exist in the book was pumped into the movie to a startling and disgusting degree.But the movie raised the stakes and made the story much more streamlined and coherent. The movie also drew more attention to Sophie's internal thoughts and feelings. Howl was given more internal thoughts and feelings as well, which he voices at points through the film. This added an emotional depth to the movie that went unspoken and unrealized in the book. In the book, the characters are childish and throw tantrums rather than share their true feelings with the reader or with each other. It was a big part of why the second half of the novel felt like such a chore for me to read. There are positive qualities in both pieces of art. I definitely enjoy the film more than the book. I know I won't want to reread this novel. The movie delights me visually. I also love Hayao Miyazaki'sfocus on nature; the film features his thematic celebration of the natural world, and the book does not have that theme at all. I came away from this reading experience deeply aware that the movie is far more problematic than I ever realized. Huge props to Diana Wynne Jones for not having any ableism, fat-shaming, or orientalism in her book. The book's murderous villain is a woman who is vanquished by the male hero, but she wasn't a fat or a disabled villainous woman, and she wasn't motivated to hurt or kill people due to unrequited love. I have nothing more to say in summary other than sh*t be problematic in both the book and the movie. It's just different kinds of problems....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 24, 2018","Sep 02, 2018","Aug 24, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2294528.Howl_s_Moving_Castle

This book is a disjointed set of essays written about Matthiessen's various trips to Africa over a decade or more. There are no timelines given for any of these different trips. They are also presented without any chronological order. Dates are mentioned haphazardly throughout the chapters, which are themselves mash-ups of various trips over various years. While some of the essays focus on nature writing and conservation biology, a large number of pages are focused on describing different African tribes, as Matthiessen searches to learn ""the heart of the African"" or the ""essential mind of the African"" on his journeys. The entire book is written with a deeply racist narrative lens that made the chapters increasingly painful to read. This is not a long book, but the incredibly high racism and astoundingly high sexism of Matthiessen's narrative voice took a major psychological toll on me. ""The Tree Where Man Was Born"" is a slim volume of text, but required almost an entire year to finish. Much of this book concerns anthropological data and evolutionary data that is extremely dated and is no longer accurate. Slogging through pages and pages of outdated historical material slowed down my reading a lot.But much worse than that, Matthiessen's prose is dense and insular, to the point that I never felt like this book was actually trying to teach me anything about Africa. I have never visited the continent, and while I would like to visit, it's very, very expensive to travel abroad. Financially, a trip to Africa is well out of my reach, which is why I pick up books like this one. But this book didn't welcome me into a greater understanding of Africa, or the individual countries Matthiessen visited. Place names, foreign words, and tribal terms were almost entirely presented without description or definition. The book read as Matthiessen showing off how smart he is, not like he wanted to include me on a journey. ""The Tree Where Man Was Born"" isn't really travel writing at all -- it's Matthiessen displaying his own erudition, and promising to find ""the essential mind of the African"" to present to his white North American readers. His entire racist framework is extremely painful to me. There is no denying that Matthiessen (who died in 2014) was a great naturalist, and where this book really shines is when he is not describing the African people at all, but focused solely on nature, and describing his observations of nature as objectively as he can. Matthiessen, like many male naturalists past and present, glorifies and romanticizes the predator, and disdains the herd animal. That narrative framework provides a highly subjective schema for his writing about nature, and greatly detracted from my enjoyment of his prose. But when Matthiessen removes that subjectivity and writes more objectively, as he sometimes does in this book, the prose becomes exceptionally powerful, evocative, and haunting. There are individual passages describing the natural world in this book that are truly amazing and superb, so good that I wish I could give the entire book 5 full stars. Alas. I feel like this book should come with a content warning of misogyny and misogynoir instead. In the first half of the book, Matthiessen expresses intense pathos and grief over watching a single diseased, dehydrated lion struggle and die, its life finally ended by a mercy kill when Matthiessen's companion takes pity on the creature and shoots it. Later, Matthiessen presents the story of an African girl who was speared in the back by two drunken tribesmen who came upon her at night. The young girl ran for help before she collapsed on the ground. Another (fully grown, adult) drunken man found the girl lying there, gasping in pain, pleading for help, and he raped her as she lay dying, getting the girl's blood all over himself. The next morning, the hungover man was found covered in the dead girl's blood, and was accused of murder. Matthiessen expresses great sorrow that this man was put into jail, and was accused of a crime he ""didn't commit."" I cannot express how horrifying it is to read that a man like Matthiessen would express pity and grief for a rapist who raped an adolescent girl as she lay dying, literally f*cking her until she was dead, rather than tending to her wounds and saving her life, or calling to someone else who could render aid. The men who speared the girl were not caught, and Matthiessen is sad that another, ""innocent"" man is in jail for her murder.I had to close the book at that point, and put it down for a long, long time before I could pick it up again to finish it. Matthiessen gives more humanity to the lions in this book than he gave to that adolescent girl. Writing like this crosses the line from sexism into misogyny, and specifically here, misogynoir: racist misogyny. This is rape culture on steroids, and I would never want another woman to pick up this book and read it without first warning her that it contains content like this.When I reflect on all of the racism in this book, I deeply regret that I read it.When I reflect on the objective naturalist prose in this book, when Matthiessen is not romanticizing the predator and writing as objectively as he can, I'm glad that I read and finished this book.To no one's surprise, Matthiessen never ""finds"" the ""essential heart of the African"" in these essays. The one heart he could have illuminated -- his own -- is not the purpose of this book. Unlike ""The Snow Leopard,"" these essays on Africa do not contain any memoir material. Matthiessen's personal life is never the focus of this text. And the book is much weaker for it.I would still recommend ""The Snow Leopard"" to anyone who loves literary prose. But ""The Tree Where Man Was Born"" was highly problematic and painful for me to read. I wouldn't recommend it, outside of a history class about the evolution of nonfiction writing, or studying the transmission of racism and misogyny through narrative voice....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 20, 2018","Jul 30, 2019","Aug 20, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9218907-the-tree-where-man-was-born

The story begins with “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” published in 2009, and that title is frequently used as the name of this series. I didn’t enjoy the final installment as much as I enjoyed the first two books, but I still give “We’ll Always Have Summer” five full stars. My private disappointments aside, the story feels very true to these characters, even if I found the analysis offered up in the narrative to explain their behavior to be incredibly insufficient. Many of the negative s for this book focus on the idea that the three main characters seem to “suddenly change for no reason” in the finale. Personally, I understood why these characters behaved as they did, but their true motivations were never made explicit in the text, and that made me profoundly sad. That lack of explanation does not change how I feel about the events that took place. I believe that the story Jenny Han wrote in this series is excellent. The material in this book is very heavy, and felt as dense to me as adult literary fiction. I can understand why some readers felt betrayed by this book. I can also see why many other readers were satisfied with the ending.What follows is my own analysis about what happens in this novel and why. There are plenty of spoilers ahead, so please stop reading here if you don’t want to be spoiled. **********By the end of the second book in this series, the story’s protagonist, Belly (a nickname for Isabel), is on the verge of turning seventeen, and she has chosen to start a relationship with the younger of the two Fisher brothers, Jeremiah. Belly makes this choice not because she has stopped loving Jeremiah’s older brother, Conrad, but because Conrad has broken up with her. Belly aches for intimacy and affection, and when it is clear that Conrad is incapable of giving her what she wants, Belly begins a relationship with Jeremiah, who does not have the emotional walls that Conrad does. Here is a short list of things that contributed to Conrad’s inability to be Belly’s boyfriend: 1. The death of his beloved mother when he was 18, near the end of his freshman year in college. 2. The rules of masculinity, also known as the script of “How to Be a Man” in modern American culture. (This script goes *largely* unacknowledged within the novel itself, but I could read it all over Conrad in each book in this trilogy. He satisfies part of the script, but clashes with other parts of it, and this creates internal conflict for him.)3. His difficult relationship with his adulterous father, which further complicated Conrad’s ideas about manhood and how to be a man in the world.***It is certainly true that Jeremiah, who is only a year younger than Conrad, faces the same list of struggles. But Jeremiah and Conrad are vastly different people. Conrad is intellectually and athletically gifted to a much higher degree than Jeremiah; Conrad is also one of those strong, quiet types capable of great tenderness and prescience. His mind is constantly observing every tiny detail around him. Conrad is a truly fascinating character, a wise child who struggles with who he should be in the world. Jeremiah, on the other hand, is more like a typical person. He doesn’t examine himself overmuch, he doesn’t want to question the meaning of life, he doesn’t stress overlong about existential angst. Jeremiah knows the script of “How to Be a Man” and he doesn’t mind following it. He’s not going to give himself an ulcer over his dad’s marital choices, or why his mother died of cancer, or pretty much anything that is terrible in the world. Jeremiah’s life motto is basically: don’t dwell and all is well. Conrad, however, is the opposite. Conrad *does* ponder the nature of the universe, his identity, and how to best serve his life’s purpose, and it gives him a significant amount of gravitational force in these books. For me personally, I will always choose a Conrad over a Jeremiah. As a reader, I am attracted to Conrad. The fact that Belly is identical to me in this regard is one of the reasons I love Belly so much. “We’ll Always Have Summer” begins roughly two years after the end of the second book. Belly and Jeremiah have been dating for almost two full years. Jeremiah is an extremely sweet boyfriend; he is the Wish Fulfillment Boyfriend du jour. When I was a teenager myself, and pictured the Most Perfect Boyfriend Ever in my mind, Jeremiah’s boyfriend behavior in “We’ll Always Have Summer” is every fantasy I ever had come to life.Jeremiah also never lays hands on Belly, or pushes her for sexual behavior she isn’t ready for. The two kiss a lot, they frequently sleep/physically rest in the same bed together, but Jeremiah never forces Belly to give him more than that. For me, what keeps Belly’s virginity believable is the fact that Belly slut-shames other girls, the same way many girls do in real life. Belly has her own script to follow, and a big part of a girl’s script, even in modern America, is to know that Good Girls Don’t. Jeremiah knows this as well. Jeremiah slut-shames to an equal (or perhaps greater) degree, and because he views Belly as Marriage Material, he does not push her for sex, allowing her to keep her virginity intact. Jeremiah also knows that Belly loved Conrad first, and he suspects that she still loves Conrad. This is a deeper conflict within him than following his How to Be a Man script. Starting in the first book in this trilogy, it is made clear that Belly’s heart *always* belonged to Conrad. In college, even when she is dating Jeremiah, even when she has chosen to be with the boy who can give her the relationship that she wants, Belly still loves Conrad more. This is actually why Belly never has sex with Jeremiah: if Good Girls Don’t, and if Good Girls only have sex with their husbands, then Belly is saving herself for Conrad. And Jeremiah knows it. But this emotional material is the narrative exposition that was never made explicit in the story. The reader is forced to infer all of this, even by the end of the book. I know it feels very reductive for me to equate sex with love. As thoughtful readers, we all know that sex is not love; sex is a physical act, and love is an emotional feeling. They can overlap or not (i.e. sex can be loving, or sex can have nothing to do with love). For Belly, who is hopelessly in love with Conrad, sex and love are not two separate things. Sex and love are the same for Belly. But again, this is never made explicit in the story. The reader is forced to infer this, but I believe that Belly’s internal motivation for maintaining her virginity is obvious in her behavior. Belly actually reminded me a lot of the main character, Esch, in Jesmyn Ward’s award-winning 2011 debut adult literary novel, “Salvage the Bones.” Fourteen and pregnant, Esch has grown up in poverty and has suffered a tremendous amount of physical and emotional abuse. In her interior monologue, Esch frequently refers to her vagina as her “girl-heart” – the place on her body she can choose to give to a boy to win his love in return, even if his “love” only lasts a few minutes. Esch’s narration is as true to life as it is tragic, and the language that Jesmyn Ward uses to characterize Esch’s interior monologue could just as easily characterize Belly in “We’ll Always Have Summer.” Belly has a girl-heart that belongs to Conrad. And by girl-heart, I mean her vagina as well as the romantic feelings in her actual heart.In the first two books, Belly is quite fierce as a character. She is sharp and witty, sometimes reckless, sometimes cruel, sometimes incredibly selfless and loving, sometimes brazen. Overall, she feels utterly real, and that makes her delightful to read.After dating Jeremiah for two years, however, Belly has changed. Jeremiah seems to be the same rowdy, fun-loving person he has always been. But Belly has lost all of her bold recklessness and ferocity, and has become weak, hesitant, and extremely childish. At college, Belly is shy, nervous, withdrawn, and no longer the girl full of moxie she was at fifteen. Emotionally, she is not the same person she was in the first two books. She has stopped being true to herself, and has lost herself in that process. In adult literary works, I have seen lines like this that explain changes like Belly’s: “men make women weak,” or “sloppy,” or “a mess.” Belly made me sad in this third book. She did feel weak, and sloppy, and a mess. She made me wish she had stayed single. But, had I been in her shoes, I would have done the same thing. I would have chosen Jeremiah, and taken the Wish Fulfillment Boyfriend on offer, even if he wasn’t the boy I truly loved. Unrequited love for an ex-boyfriend is just torture, and nothing is more useless than torture. Something else that goes completely unspoken is the fact that Jeremiah, as a fraternity-loving dude-bro, feels a lot of pressure to have sex. Many readers know that “scoring with chicks” is part of the “How to Be a Man” script, after all, especially for the type of fraternity Jeremiah belongs to. He has also been an incredibly wonderful boyfriend for two years, and he probably feels he deserves to have sex with Belly, in addition to all of the social pressure he faces to “score.”And it is actually that social script that kicks the novel’s entire plot into gear. Right before spring break of Belly’s freshman year, the two get into a fight and Jeremiah breaks up with Belly. He spends his week of spring break in Cabo with his fraternity and their partner-sorority on campus. Jeremiah hooks up with one of those sorority sisters in Cabo, and the two have hot, wild sex. The sorority sister makes a lot of noise during intercourse, and she is loud enough that Jeremiah’s fraternity brothers can hear her. After the trip, Jeremiah does not tell Belly what happened. He makes peace with Belly and the two immediately start dating again. Jeremiah returns to being an incredibly loving and incredibly loyal boyfriend. Two months later, in May, Belly finds out about the hookup and (understandably) flips out on Jeremiah. They break up. Jeremiah is devastated. He is deeply ashamed that sex that “meant nothing” to him has destroyed the relationship that matters the most to him. He works very hard to make up with Belly, and to prove his abiding love for her, Jeremiah proposes. Belly says yes. They decide to get married that August. “We’ll Always Have Summer” follows Belly for the months in between the proposal and the wedding day. Many readers struggled to understand why Belly would say “yes” to getting married at age almost-19, and why Jeremiah would want to propose to her when he is only almost-20, and why both of them would want to marry after only a three-month engagement.To which I say: there are a lot of reasons. They go unexplained in the text, but here is my own list:1. Grief. Grief smashes people apart in unpredictable ways, and coping with grief can inspire very odd or atypical behavior. Belly and Jeremiah are both grieving the death of Jeremiah’s mother. His mother was very close to both of them, and very much beloved. To people who have never suffered a loss like that at such a young age, the teenagers in this series can seem very confusing. But I suffered multiple losses like that as a teenager, and I think Jenny Han wrote grief into this book in a masterful way. 2. Sex. Jeremiah really wants to have sex with Belly. He knows that marriage might be the only way he’ll ever get it.3. Love. Belly knows that if she has sex with Jeremiah, then he’ll have her heart, too: her emotional heart and her girl-heart, because the two are linked for her. Marriage means Belly will finally give up on Conrad and commit to Jeremiah, and her soul will finally have some peace.4. Jeremiah wants Belly’s full love. He wants all of her, her full heart as well as her girl-heart. He knows that marriage will be the act that will make Belly fully his.***These characters were human and flawed, utterly gross and therefore, compelling. This book is a beautiful mess, and if there were twenty more books in this series, I would be reading them right now. Most of the plot of this book involves the drama surrounding Belly and Jeremiah as they prepare for their wedding day. The two of them are rather sheltered, middle-class teenagers trying to figure out how to be adults, and they fumble along with their finances and their life plans. The book lacks sexual tension between Belly and Jeremiah due to the fact that Belly is not marrying the man she really wants to marry, and her true feelings for Conrad keep surfacing at inopportune moments.Two days before the wedding, at the bachelor party, Conrad overhears Jeremiah’s fraternity members bragging about how Jeremiah had sex with a sorority sister in Cabo. The boys go on to say how Jeremiah will finally be able to have sex with Belly now that they are getting married.The news stuns Conrad, and he suddenly realizes that Belly has been holding out on Jeremiah because she doesn’t love him as much as she loves Conrad. Conrad understands that Belly’s girl-heart and her actual heart are also the same, and – most importantly for Conrad — he now knows they both still belong to him. Conrad reacts to this news by immediately confessing his true feelings for Belly, and asking her to call off the wedding to be with him instead. Belly, enraged by Conrad’s poor choice in timing, tells him no. More drama ensues. On the day of the wedding, at the very last second, the wedding is finally called off. Conrad goes back to Stanford alone. Jeremiah and Belly split up. Belly, now single and free of boy drama, becomes much more focused on her studies. She throws herself into school, and goes to Spain to study abroad for a year, like a badass. Studying abroad is something I would have expected Belly to do all along, and to me, this behavior signaled that she had returned to herself. She was once again the girl full of moxie I met in the first book, and I was glad for it.Conrad is also older now, much more emotionally stable, and finally able to accept that Belly is the only girl he ever wants to commit to. She is also a girl he can “chase” because she is now “hard to get” – both because she is in Spain and because she seems quite happy to be single. The novel ends with Conrad writing long letters to Belly, letters in which he starts to open his heart to her. He also sends her gifts. Over time, Belly gives him another chance, after she returns from her study abroad. The book closes with Belly letting the reader know they did end up together; they are married and living in a house they have lovingly decorated.Does it seem reductive and brutish of me to keep bringing up a girl’s vagina in relation to her love story? Yes, of course it does. But in modern American culture, which features pornographic material passing as “pop culture” even for our youngest children, the labels of Good Girl/Marriage Material and Dirty Girl/Worthless Whore are as obvious and destructive as they’ve ever been. What a modern teenage girl does or doesn’t do with her vagina has a big impact on her life, whether she wants that to be the case or not. To return to poor Esch for a moment in “Salvage the Bones”: Esch is fourteen and pregnant, a Dirty Girl/Worthless Whore with no one to love her outside of her family; Esch has no boyfriend and no hope for a husband. The fate of Esch in that novel is the reason why Belly and so many modern teen girls strive to let the world know they understand that Good Girls Don’t. And not just teenage girls, either. For many adult women searching for Mr. Right, there is talk of “having standards,” and how men want “a woman who has standards.” It’s all code for sex, of course. A woman with “no standards” is a Whore, and men do not marry Whores. All of the motivating factors of the plot in this novel have to do with genitalia, and how the choices people make concerning their genitalia impact their emotions and the course of their lives. Because the book doesn’t make porn culture, gender roles, or the impact of sexual choices explicit, it might be easy to miss these plot links. Here is a brief summary—Early in the novel, Jeremiah puts his penis into another girl’s vagina. This leads to emotional drama with Belly, and as a result, Jeremiah asks Belly to marry him. Belly says yes, knowing that after marriage, Jeremiah will be able to put his penis into her vagina. Two days before the wedding, Conrad discovers that Jeremiah’s penis has never entered Belly’s vagina. This immediately leads to more emotional drama, and as a result, Conrad asks Belly to leave Jeremiah and be with him instead.For as much as porn culture has saturated modern America and the YA market, the genre of YA contemporary is still largely seen as the realm of “light romance” and “fluff.” And yet the final book in this trilogy is dead serious about how strongly many people root their emotions and identities in their physical bodies, and the impact that can have on the romantic relationships that shape our lives. In real life, a lot of people deny their bodies, and much popular fiction stars main characters who deny their bodies as well. Jenny Han eschewed that choice. The love story in “We’ll Always Have Summer” is certainly emotional, but all of that emotion is rooted in the bodies and psychology of the three main characters. These characters are grappling with grief, modern American culture, and each other. I also wonder if perhaps none of this is made explicit in the text because the teenage characters don’t understand it themselves. Would I recommend this series to teenage readers? Yes, absolutely. Belly might make what many people consider to be “poor choices” in this story, but she makes good choices, too. And it’s not like I fault her for her “poor” choices, since I can identify with her in all ways. If I could have had a Jeremiah at nineteen, I would have taken him. I certainly wanted love and affection more than anything else at that age. But I also wanted college, and once I got to college, I realized I also wanted to study abroad. And Belly wants those things as much as I did. She goes and gets them.And right after college, I met the man I married, and I am still married to him. I could never throw stones at Belly unless I am also hurling those same stones at myself. For me personally, I would have enjoyed “We’ll Always Have Summer” a lot more if Conrad had gotten more time on the page than Jeremiah. As stated, I enjoy Conrad’s character much more, and all of my reader-interest is really focused on Conrad and Belly together, rather than Jeremiah.I also wish Belly’s emphasis on her girl-heart had been made clear in the text. But I do not fault the book for leaving it out. Real life is full of people who behave like Belly and the Fisher brothers. Finding characters who reflect real life in fiction gives me joy. I have never forgotten how confusing and difficult it felt to be a teenager, how prone to melodrama I often was, and this trilogy features teen characters who are very confused and melodramatic. The main characters all felt so real to me, so flawed and understandable and so human. For readers who prefer lighter, happier romance stories in their YA contemporary, this trilogy will most likely be very frustrating and unenjoyable. But for me, I wanted to devour all of these books in one sitting. I found myself completely addicted to this beautiful mess.

As I type this , I am *still* waiting for the third book to arrive at the bookshop. I have been waiting for that third book for three days and it's been agonizing. I just want to finish reading the story so badly.There are many reasons why I love this trilogy. Here is a short list:1. The teenage characters all think and sound like actual teenagers. They are confused, passionate, melodramatic, childish, wise, and full of angst. This series is real, and I am so here for it. 2. Nostalgia is the primary emotion in these books. Many novels try to inspire nostalgia in the reader; few are ever as successful as this trilogy. 3. I am hopelessly addicted to stories about fraternal love, and I adore complicated love triangles involving fraternal love. Whether it is King Arthur and Lancelot, or the Epic of Gilgamesh, or something more tragic like A Separate Peace, I cannot escape the siren song these stories have over me. Jenny Han's ""The Summer I Turned Pretty"" trilogy features two biological brothers who are both in love with the story's protagonist. Their biological relationship intensifies the power this storytelling device has over me. This is book-heroin to me. 4. The older of the two brothers, Conrad, is a boy with a lot of emotional depth and perspicacity. His memory is long, his observations are careful, his feelings run deep as the Grand Canyon. Characters like this might as well be a riptide sweeping me right into their infinite sea; I will fall hard for this character type every time. Every. Time.5. The main character of this series, a teenage girl named Belly (short for Isabel), is just the best. Belly is as flawed as everyone else in this story, and I love her so much. I find her narrative voice authentic and fascinating. She intoxicates me. I never want to stop reading her. It's why I'm in agony waiting on that third book.6. The portrayal of grief in these books is stellar. Jenny Han captures emotional pain with an accuracy few authors ever accomplish. These books are so honest and true about pain and suffering. The prose is stunning. 7. Love, like grief, is incredibly messy. The romantic and familial love in this book is as messy as grief. People make both good and bad choices. This is a series full of messy people, and messy people are book-heroin to me.**********I could go on, but I promised a short list. And seven is a lucky number and all. :)Five full stars. I couldn't love this trilogy anymore than I do. It's a torturous love.

If you are familiar with the HBO series, ""Game of Thrones,"" you will know that Sansa is the uber-feminine young lady of House Stark who often lacks agency. Sansa suffers all kinds of pain and abuse in her powerless situation, including being brutally raped on her wedding night. Ms. Sebastian has stated that she wanted to write a book wherein a character like Sansa Stark was finally given some agency. And so, she created this royal teenager, Theo, the Ash Princess of the title.And I tell you, I was *so* here for that. Slytherin Sansa Stark? Yes, please. Sansa finally gets to do something badass? Yes, please. I don't even watch Game of Thrones anymore -- I gave up somewhere in Season 4 -- but I would still really like to see Sansa be redeemed. The nonstop abuse-fest is truly unwelcome. Like Sansa in Season One, Theo has become a completely powerless captive trapped in a palace. Theo is the unmarried daughter of the dead former Astrean queen, a woman whose people were slaughtered and enslaved after the Kalovaxians took over their country. The Kalovaxians are like, Germanic genocidal a-holes who Live to Pillage. Theo's kingdom of Astrea was just the latest place on a long list that the Kalovaxians have conquered and will one day completely destroy. Theo was six when all of this happened. For the past ten years, she has lived as a figurehead in the palace, a focus of Kalovaxian vitriol and violence. The Kaiser constantly whips Theo in public (her back is a mutilated mess of scar tissue); he and his henchmen humiliate her every day, and the Kaiser forces her to wear a crown made of ash to all important events, so the ash will rain over her and cover her in filth. The novel sets Theo up as a victim in all ways, and then asks the question: what will she do now? Will Theo finally act? Or will she keep doing nothing? Bum, bum, bum... read on to find out. It's a very dark book. For its level of violence, this is like a YA Game of Thrones. But that is the only comparison I would make to Game of Thrones. On a prose level, this novel is well-written. These sentences are clean and adhere to principles of good grammar and vocabulary use. For a modern YA fantasy, this was impressive to me. But, halfway through the novel, Theo's interior monologue becomes far too repetitive, to the point that it really dragged the story for me and became cumbersome. I expect some repetition in YA, but this book went over ideas that slowed the middle of the book far too much.Theo repeats herself so much because she is an inveterate waffler: she doesn't know what she wants, what she believes, or how she should act. She is certain of only one thing: that, after she dies, she wants to see her late mother in heaven. But other than wanting that celestial reunion, Theo is a whole lot of nothing, as far as convictions go. Theo will say one thing, and then counter it with the opposite. She often says she believes something, and then her actions refute her dialogue and interior monologue. Theo promises to do something, and then immediately breaks the promise. If your word is your bond, then Theo is a lot of disconnected rubble on the ground, bonded to no one and nothing.Which I thought was okay in the first half of the book. I mean, I understand she is young, and I understand she has to learn things about life, the same way Sansa Stark has to Learn Lessons in Game of Thrones. The problem is, in order for Theo to have agency (as the author intended), a character must have convictions -- either from the beginning of the book, or from a source of integrity they have gained during the course of the story. This kind of growth creates a character arc. But Theo had no character arc. She never grew. She never gained any convictions. She never said ""I will do this"" and then did it. Every promise she makes in this book, she either breaks outright, or finds someone else to do it for her, after promising to do it herself. This book is dark, and it's also very sad. I can only recall one page that made me laugh, and only one other page when I cracked a smile. There is a lot of gratuitous violence in this book. The violence is always present, and it never lets up, building to the most horrifying violence that takes place near the end. Theo is supposed to poison two people. She promises that she will, and then breaks that promise. Theo tells a 13-year-old slave girl to do the poisoning for her instead. Theo wants to keep her hands clean of the murder, so she has a slave child kill on her behalf. The aftermath of this scene was too horrific for me to even want to describe it. I read it all, though. And forcing a slave child to kill on your behalf? This was not agency. This was not a Slytherin Sansa Stark. This was Theo being a spineless, disgusting person. I revile this character with every cell in my body.Theo could have insisted all along that the poison be used on the Kaiser: the main enemy, the man responsible for genocide. Theo never makes that suggestion, of course. She listens to No-Thinking-Blaise tell her that the poison should be used on the Kaiser's henchman and his innocent daughter instead. Because reasons. Hell, Theo could have gone ahead and married the Kaiser, poisoned him on their wedding night, and fled the palace. Or married Prinz Soren, killed the Kaiser, and then ruled alongside Kaiser Soren. Or killed Soren once she had the throne. Where was the thinking, though? It didn't exist. Theo just never thinks for herself in this book, and that stays the one constant to the last bitter page. Also: Theo is a captive, but she has spent ten years of her life living in a room with a big, secret tunnel that leads straight to the harbor. She sneaks out of this tunnel with Prinz Soren at one point, in the middle of the night, and they go for a joy ride in his boat. But Theo's people could never get her out of the Kaiser's palace because reasons. I know Theo's three ""Shadows"" were always silently watching her -- but after a couple of kids killed them off and replaced them so easily, I just felt like sections of this book's plot strayed too far into ""Spaceballs"" territory. My favorite part of these 433 pages arrived on pages 172-173, and featured Theo and three other characters discussing their Astrean religion and the religious ableism involved in their magical system. That was EXCELLENT. I still love those pages a great deal.There is a love triangle in this book, and I have to say, I never liked Blaise. Right from the start, he was condescending and dismissive of Theo. He treated his suffering as so much worse than hers, he belittled her, and only when he saw her whipped in scene -- late in the book -- did he realize that Theo ""really has"" suffered a lot. I really didn't like this guy. Ugh, ugh, ugh. I hate that Blaise and Theo even kiss in this book. I know by the end of the book that Blaise has a terminal condition -- he has contracted ""mine madness"" from his work in the mines -- but that was thrown into the final pages. And even if his condition had been introduced earlier, he still wasn't a likeable character. He wanted Theo to do dangerous, pointless things. He behaved in sexist ways. Blaise was more horrified to see the Kaiser put a hand on Theo's waist than he was to see all the scars on her back. Ugh. He just wasn't a ship I was ever going to ship.On the other hand, I loved Prinz Soren. He remained the one character I still loved at the end of this book. If this novel had been about Soren, I would definitely want to read the sequel.But I had to DNF ""Ash Princess"" on page 386, after 89% of the novel. I skimmed the last pages to see how it ended, but I was done reading and done caring about Theo. I skimmed the rest of the book only because I knew I would write this . I also know it's a very popular technique to throw 52 curve balls at the reader on the last pages of a YA fantasy novel, and I wanted to see if the author followed that trend. This novel did not disappoint, as far as the last-second plot twists were concerned.By the time I reached the last page, I thought that the Astrean people were a bunch of obnoxious fools, people I have no desire to read about. The bravest Astrean character in this book was tortured to death in scene, a death that should never have happened, and I just don't find Theo to be worthy of a crown or a kingdom. I don't want her to become a Queen. Ever. Also? Her greedy, narcissistic, lying pirate aunt is gross. That woman disgusts me in all ways. Theo clearly didn't need enemies when she had a woman like that for a family member. I do hope that Prinz Soren survives. He is the last good person left alive in this book; I definitely ship him and want him to be okay. Unfortunately, he is not the main character, and the story is told solely from Theo's point of view. And I just can't suffer reading any more of her to find out what happens to Soren.The sequel to ""Ash Princess"" is titled ""Lady Smoke,"" and it is scheduled to be out in Spring 2019, but my journey with this series ends with book one....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 22, 2018","Jul 14, 2018","Jun 22, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32505753-ash-princess

As an author of literary fiction, and as a person. I enjoyed reading his novels ""Five Skies"" and ""The Signal."" I have enjoyed his short stories. But the 2013 literary novel, ""Return to Oakpine,"" threw up too many red flags in the opening pages for me to continue.The plot of this book is pretty straightforward: four able-bodied white middle-class men in their fifties reconvene in the small white town of Oakpine, Wyoming, where they attended high school together. These aging men reflect on their lackluster lives for a while, and then they reform their high school garage band and make some music again, performing songs that are probably as lackluster as their lives, but so be it. I fully admit that this premise does nothing for me. In a world of overwhelming problems to deal with, such as systemic poverty, racism, climate change, the mass death of plankton currently underway, ocean acidification, the ascendancy of porn culture in mainstream media, child sex trafficking, and pretty much NAME THE ISSUE of real life drama with the highest stakes possible, then I must admit that reading about some slouchy middle-class guys in their fifties who sigh and harrumph about their cushioned, privileged American lives is at the absolute bottom of my priority list. But the glory of literary authors is that an insightful viewpoint and clean, crafted prose can turn any plot premise into the most gripping, high-stakes drama possible.Herein lies the problem: the storytelling in ""Return to Oakpine"" is sloppy, and the prose is not crafted or clean. The novel starts from the point of view of Craig Ralston, one of the four slouchy white men who will be reconvening in Wyoming. His opening pages are dull and unmemorable, but I was thinking, ""Okay, whatever, boring white guy is just boring, I'll keep pushing on."" Because readers do things like that for authors they love. Then page 4 arrives, and the narrative shifts into the point of view of Craig's 17-year-old son, Larry. Larry speaks in dialogue that no teenage boy would ever speak in, because only an alien from Planet Xenon would ever talk this way:(Larry talking to himself outside the house after a run): ""I ran around the town. That town is captured in its entirety."" (page 4 and 5)(Larry speaking to his mother after he walks into the kitchen): ""You going to get a tattoo? I'm sorry for asking, because your son is not a smartass but is dislocated by your behavior, but what's the answer: is a tattoo next?"" (page 6)(Larry talking to himself in the empty kitchen): ""I ran around the town."" (page 6)(Larry talking to his father again in the living room): ""Then I ran around the whole town."" (page 6)Ron Carlson usually writes lean, careful prose, but this novel is already repetitive as well as nonsensical. ""Your son is dislocated by your behavior"" would mean that Larry had to leave the kitchen where his mother is, which does not happen. His mother walks out of the room, so Larry ""dislocates"" her with his question. He is annoyed that his mother is washing dishes in a black sports bra without wearing a shirt, so Larry's tattoo question is meant to be off-putting snark to drive his mother out of the kitchen, and it succeeds. So, not only does Larry's dialogue sound inhuman, it's not even accurate within the story.And then there are sentences like this one:""Larry found his burger under the bun in the cast iron frying pan on the stove and scooped it up with his left hand, dripping grease along his palm, which he licked away while opening the fridge with his right hand and grabbing the glass bottle of milk, half full, setting it down to pull the top off, and lifting it in a long cold drink."" (page 6)I'm not opposed to multiple modifiers, multiple prepositional phrases all using multiple modifiers, or the kind of run-on-ish expository sentence that many literary authors favor. My problem is the use of detail that does not matter, is inherently useless, and should have been struck. In that sentence, ""with his right hand"" is useless. The reader can infer that if the burger is in his left hand, then his right hand is the one opening the fridge and grabbing the milk. Whether the bottle is ""half full"" or not also does not make a bit of difference. This information is not signifying anything about this family or their lives, it's just useless detail. Literary prose has too high a standard to meet for drag like this to appear in a sentence. Ron Carlson knows better, too. I just don't understand the verbosity. Was this not edited? Did an editor just assume Ron Carlson didn't need a red pen anymore, just because he's Ron Carlson? I can't explain this. The worst offense is that the story is following Larry, giving Larry an intense level of detail about what he is holding in his left hand and in his right hand, how he enjoys running around town and snarking his mother -- when this novel is NOT about Larry. It's about his aging father, Craig, and his father's three aging friends reconvening in Oakpine: Frank Gunderson, Mason Kirby, and Jimmy Brand. This is a novel that will be packed with minutia about these four boring men and their high school lives, told from their points of view. I sure as hell don't need to be spending time watching Larry drink milk and eat a burger his mother cooked for him. I was hoping to sink into this novel the same way I have with Ron Carlson's other work, enjoying his lean prose and careful observations of life. But ""Return to Oakpine"" is too poorly written and frustrating. I still love Ron Carlson, but I can't even finish this book, much less recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Jun 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16158537-return-to-oakpine

Due to the age of this first-person narrator, ""Uprooted"" is frequently sold as Young Adult/YA. Personally, I would categorize this novel as adult fantasy due to the writing style and the highly erratic plotline. The dense, often verbose writing style read more as adult fantasy to me than YA.When I picked this book up, I truly expected to love it. ""Uprooted"" is a Beauty and the Beast/Hades and Persephone kind of storyline mixed with the author's Polish fairy tale knowledge and setting details. The writing in Chapter One is streamlined, beautifully descriptive, and highly engaging. Of the 435 pages in this novel, I read the first 213 pages with alacrity, even for as problematic as I found many of the character details to be.In this case, a virginal Mary Sue born with super-special magical powers (Agnieszka) is chosen to fulfill ten years of slavery to a wealthy, powerful, 150-year-old wizard named Sarkan. Sarkan lives in an extravagant mansion shaped like a tower, and every ten years, he picks an uneducated, poor 17-year-old village girl to live in the tower with him and be his slave. This slave girl is cut off from all contact with the outside world, and spends her days cooking Sarkan meals and keeping the place clean. After her ten years of slavery, the young woman is given a decent sum of money and the ability to move away to a city, attend university, buy a house, whatever. Who knows and who cares. Off they go, far away forever, it's Chapter One now, a new choosing season is here, and Sarkan needs to pick a new slave girl to live in his tower. Of course, he picks Agnieszka, the Mary Sue superstar of this book.Personally, I can sometimes get behind a self-sacrificing, clumsily-lovable, super-powered, super special, virginal and innocent Mary Sue. As a character archetype of fiction, it's hard to escape the endearingly innocent ingénue. She pops up everywhere: in YA and adult literature, in Hollywood movies, in Disney films. She performs a starring role as a literal Chosen One in ""Uprooted."" Since this is a love story, it must be said that pairing up a 17-year-old virgin with a 150-year-old, sexually experienced male wizard sets off a lot of ick-alarms. It certainly would have been better for me if Agnieszka had been 18 in this book. The author chose not to do that, probably because she wanted to emphasize Agnieszka's innocence and virginity with the fact that she is not yet a legal adult. At 17, I thought Agnieszka was close enough to legal for me to keep reading the book without constantly thinking of her as a child, despite her stock character being that of a classic ingénue. The book is divided into three parts. In the engaging first section of the book (the first 213 pages), Agnieszka moves into the tower, learns that she is capable of casting spells and using magic, and she and Sarkan learn how to combine their magic to cast spells together. I liked this part. It was fun to read. Then a rapist named Prince Marek demands that Agnieszka and Sarkan travel into the super-scary and completely deadly Wood with him. The Wood is a malevolent and malignant forest under the control of a fairy tale version of a female Satan. Like Satan, the Wood is immortal and a force of pure evil. She inflicts mental and physical disabilities upon people, constantly murders people and animals, and ""feeds"" people to the trees by putting their bodies into tree trunks. The trees then suck down their life force over years while they are trapped in the trunk. The Wood is constantly expanding and trying to take over the world, spreading evil and death. The rapist Prince Marek demands that Sarkan and Agnieszka help him retrieve his dead mother, who has been buried in a tree trunk for 20 years. Agnieszka and Sarkan agree to do this. The rescue mission is extremely graphic and horrifying, and they make it out of the Wood with the rapist and his mother intact. The rapist's mother ought to be dead, but magically, she is alive. She is basically a walking zombie at this point in a perfectly-preserved human body, and this ought to send up about 52 million warning flags that something about this situation is Wrong and Double-Plus Ungood, but everyone just keeps going along with the plot like a bunch of sheeple because reasons. This was when the book fell apart for me. This was when all sense of logic fell off a giant cliff, or maybe went over Niagara Falls along with my brain, and I dropped straight into the nonsensical Hell known as trying to finish a highly problematic and nonsensical book. I finished reading ""Uprooted"" more than a week ago, and I *still* feel so much anger that the story was so bad. It didn't *need* to be this bad. The author is capable of lovely sentences and nice prose. A Mary Sue hooking up with an old wizard doesn't need to be an abusive skeeze-fest. Rapists don't need to get so much page-time and narrative glorification. Things can make SENSE in a fantasy novel. Even more importantly: magical systems can make sense!! Some authors are capable of this. There can be organizing principles for the magic, and spells can follow a logical trajectory between power level and skill level.But an organized magical system is *not* what the reader will find in ""Uprooted."" Every storyline-train that could possibly wreck in this book did, in fact, slam the reader into a head-on collision, page after page. If you enjoy trainwreck adult fantasy, you might love this novel. ""Uprooted"" certainly worked for a lot of other readers. But for me, every time a new plot hole opened up, or a new magical who-the-hell-knows spell was instantly invented, or the randomness kept spinning ever-increasingly out of control, I wanted to curl up in the fetal position, and hoped I never had to pick up a book again for the rest of my life. I love books like air, but this one was so painful to read that it made me hate everything. I'll start with an obvious gripe, that the novel normalizes and romanticizes verbal and emotional abuse. ""Uprooted"" features an unusually high level of verbal and emotional abuse. Sarkan begins his relationship with Agnieszka by repeatedly calling her ableist slurs, using names such as ""stupid,"" ""idiot,"" and ""lunatic."" He also calls her ugly, useless, and worthless. He mocks and belittles her appearance as well as her behavior. Once Sarkan starts to teach Agnieszka magic, his verbal abuse becomes physical. He forces spells upon her body without consent and without any explanation as to what he is doing. The spells leave her fatigued to the point that she collapses on the ground, unable to move, and then Sarken verbally abuses her again. Agnieszka quickly falls in love with Sarkan regardless, an emotion that is never named on the page and just comes out of nowhere, inspired by what I assume to be a raw sexual force beyond her control. When the two share their first passionate kiss, which comes right after Sarkan calls Agnieszka a lunatic, she immediately opens up the stitching on his shirt and trousers with her magic, to show that she is ready for intercourse. They do not have sex. Sarkan quickly buttons up and tells her to get out. She runs away. Every interaction these two had in the book was the complete opposite of ""sexy"" to me. As a ""Beast"" fairy tale character, Sarkan is made ""monstrous"" by his choice to be verbally and physically abusive, not by any kind of physical deformity or magically-cursed appearance. Sarkan is handsome, looks very young for his age, is tremendously wealthy, highly educated, lives in a mansion, is the most powerful wizard in the land, is nicknamed the Dragon, and Agnieszka's ""love"" for him is never explained in the text. Instead, it is just assumed that she ""loves"" him and ""wants"" him because the power difference between them is enormous. Power, in this case, is an unspoken code word for ""it must be true love.""An abusive romantic relationship based solely on power like this is not showcasing love. This is not love. This is the way sex is portrayed in the pornographic imaginary, in which women are abused by men while faking nonstop orgasms. In the pornographic imaginary, violence is sexualized. In psychological terms, it is a point of fact that sexualized violence renders the violence invisible. A lot of readers didn't see Sarkan's abuse in this novel because his abuse is romanticized and sexualized in the story. Porn culture has become so habitual that it's not even recognized for what it is. But I could tell in Chapter One that ""Uprooted's"" supposed love story is straight-up porn culture, which is the same kind of ""love story"" popularized in ""50 Shades of Grey."" Enter the trope of True Love Cures the Monster. ""Uprooted"" runs on the engine of this trope, the same way ""50 Shades"" does.Why didn't I DNF in Chapter One, then? If I could tell that this novel was porn culture, why did I keep reading? The answer is that *so many novels* feature porn culture as ""a love story"" that I just hold my nose against the stink and try to keep going. In the case of ""Uprooted,"" the stink never went away, but I can say that the brief, two-page sex scene with Sarkan and Agnieszka was well-written and tasteful. They only have sex once in the book. True to porn culture, there is no romantic build-up or intimacy before this hookup. Agnieszka just decides to walk into Sarkan's bedroom one night and wake him up with a booty-call. If you're familiar with the modern hookup scene in America, in which people who aren't even friends with each other can have completely emotionless sex, or emotionless ""hate-sex"" like porn stars, then you'll understand how the sex scene in this novel fits in with modern American culture.Unlike the abusive sex scenes in many other books, Agnieszka is not forced to give Sarkan a blow job before intercourse, and Sarkan does not force Agnieszka to have unprotected vaginal intercourse. Instead, Sarkan gently uses his fingers to give Agnieszka an orgasm, and then she climbs atop Sarkan to initiate intercourse, with absolutely no pressure to do so from Sarkan. The author chose nice language to describe all of this, and nothing on these two pages read like erotica or stilted porn talk. It was a respectful sex scene initiated by the female protagonist, which I liked. A two-page sex scene is not a relationship, though. That's a hookup, not a romance, and the ""romance"" between Agnieszka and Sarkan is nonexistent. If you enjoy Beauty and the Beast retellings that are porn culture with the words ""fairy tale"" slapped over them, you will probably adore this novel.The antagonist in ""Uprooted"" is a fantasy-standard supernatural force of Pure Evil that is endlessly expanding and incapable of being destroyed. The Wood, aka Female Satan who inhabits the malevolent forest, ""corrupts"" people with her evil magic, causing some people to have mental breakdowns, mutilate themselves, and the evil magic can also force them to mutilate and murder other people. The only mental and physical disabilities portrayed in this novel are the result of the Wood's ""evil corruption"" of people with her magic. To stop the spread of the Wood, human laws require that anyone who is corrupted is ordered to be slain, and a lot of the plot of this novel centers on slaying the corrupted people before the Wood can use them to spread more death and destruction.The entire storyline around the Wood in this novel is ableist as f*ck. Which I will repeat because it needs to be emphasized: the entire central plot of this novel is ABLEIST AS F*CK.Physical and mental disability are not caused by evil, or supernatural evil, or Satanic deities spreading disability and death in a forest. We do not need to promote killing people with mental and physical disabilities in our novels unless we are trying to emulate Hitler. Ableism this toxic in novels is often as unrecognized and unnamed as the violence that has been sexualized in porn. It makes me depressed that ""Uprooted"" is not only chock-full of porn culture, but runs entirely on the plot-engine of ableism.This is gross. This book is gross. Everything about this is gross. After the rapist Prince Marek gets his dead mother out of the Wood, the second part of this book describes Agnieszka's trip to the capital with the rapist and his zombie mother. Sarkan stays behind at his tower, helping villagers fight against the continued spread of the Wood.The third part of the book features Agnieszka reunited with Sarkan at his tower. A long, long battle scene commences as the rapist Prince Marek and his Wood-possessed dead mother try to kill Agnieszka and Sarkan with the help of 6,000 soldiers in the rapist Prince Marek's army. Between the nonsensical magic, the plot holes, and the Over The Top Mary Sue-ism of Agnieszka, I felt my organs shutting down as I tried to push myself through these pages. I think I went comatose for a while. I may have lain unconscious on the floor for a few days, trying to find my will to keep living. Reading this book made me feel like one of those corpses trapped in a tree, having the life sucked out of me.I did a lot of skimming, and I still felt this way. Agnieszka and Sarkan survive the onslaught of the 6,000 soldiers. The rapist Prince Marek is finally slain by his Wood-possessed dead Mother. I was praying to God to please just let the story end. But the story-train had more trainwrecks in store.Agnieszka and Sarkan immediately head into the Wood to save the world from all evil. Magical Satan gets a backstory, because Mary Sue's empathy and super skillz reveals all. The backstory is nonsense upon nonsense. Here is a summary of how the Wood came to be: a human woman in some kind of ancient times (like hundreds of years before the time of the novel, but who the hell really knows) had her sister taken away from her by... uh, a king, or something? The book never compared this ""taking"" with Sarkan's slavery of teenage girls, but whatever, no one is supposed to have a brain left this far into a nonstop trainwreck.But back to the ancient-times woman. In hatred and bitterness over the loss of her sister, this human woman transformed herself and a bunch of people she was traveling through the woods with into trees. They ate a golden fruit or drank a special drink that came out of nowhere and went into nowhere, and then they became immortal trees. (???) The woman with a heart full of hatred turned herself into an immortal deity in some unnamed process. (???) Once she had transformed herself into an earthly Satan, she became obsessed with mutilation and destruction and spreading death across the entire planet. If this sounds like great worldbuilding to you, then ""Uprooted"" is here for you. The backstory of the Wood drags on for pages. The Wood cannot ever be destroyed. After a long, long battle scene, she is finally put into a slumber, and then Agnieszka and Sarkan separate, and go about trying to clean up the forest and continue to stop it from spreading. The very last page shows Sarkan returning to a village to see Agnieszka. No emotions or romantic feelings are ever verbalized by either character. But the last page is meant to show that they are a couple now and have achieved a Happily Ever After. One-star. Not recommended. Even skimming this novel produced a terrible antipathy toward reading in me. This book had a strong opening, but turned into nonstop torture....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jun 04, 2018","Jun 16, 2018","Jun 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26117888-uprooted

I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a crash course in modern social justice activism. It's a very quick read, something you can finish in a day or two. I'm glad that I read this book, but there were parts that made me really angry. I needed a few weeks to let my anger calm before I could type up this .When I picked up this book, I didn't know who Franchesca Ramsey was, so I had to go online and look up the YouTube video she filmed that made her a star. It's titled, ""Shit White Girls Say... to Black Girls."" The video is a remake of a misogynistic comedy video titled ""Shit Girls Say"" -- a video I did *not* watch, because I don't need the extra misogyny in my life. Franchesca Ramsey's remake video dealt with misogynoir: the combined racism and sexism that black women face. I will note that Franchesca Ramsey has never made a video titled, ""Shit White Boys Say... to Black Girls."" Or a video titled, ""Shit White Boys Say... to Black Boys."" Without the comedic engine of misogyny to run on, those videos would never be popular enough to go viral, of course, which certainly dampens the appeal. Don't mess with the Almighty Patriarchy, and all of that. White Boys are king, but go ahead and mock ""dumb blondes"" all you like, which is what Franchesca Ramsey does in ""Shit White Girls Say... to Black Girls."" She puts on a blonde wig and talks like a vapid sorority sister, or like those clueless rich women that people make fun of in movies like ""Pretty Woman"" (like those snooty sales ladies who won't let Julia Roberts shop in their store). You can certainly laugh at the video, because its real comedic heart is running on the ""dumb blonde"" jokes people can't ever seem to get enough of. (To the blonde-haired women of the world: I am truly, truly sorry. Please be warned about that blonde wig before you click on the video.) As to the misogynoir in the video, Franchesca Ramsey used comments people have said to her in real life for her script, and her video shed light on the fact that a lot of white women (and probably white men, too) treat black women like animals. (And I'm sure those women -- and men -- had hair of all different colors.) The video made Franchesca Ramsey internet famous, and she was interviewed on shows like Anderson Cooper 360 to talk about it. Her fame ended up launching her career in online and television media and social justice activism.I'm glad that she made this video and shed light on this problem. I just wish she had called out the white boys along with the white girls. I'm a white woman, and I've never asked a stranger if I could pet their hair like a goat, or spoken any of the lines used in the video. I have certainly cuddled up with black people in bed before, and have touched my share of black hair, but being in bed with someone is not the same as meeting someone at a cocktail party and immediately grabbing at them like they're a sweater on a sales rack. It's extremely sad and sh*tty to me that white people do this crap to black people.Franchesca Ramsey isn't the first writer or activist to shed light on this problem, but her video was a great step forward in educating white people to please knock this sh*t off. The first seven chapters of the book are focused on memoir material, and Franchesca Ramsey uses sentences with ""I"" to narrate this section in the first person.But starting with Chapter Eight (page 119), the book shifts into a second-person narrative, and Franchesca Ramsey begins to address the reader as ""you."" Her tone changes from a person struggling to learn about social justice activism into the voice of a teacher or expert, and this is where the book ran into problems for me. Once Franchesca Ramsey takes the stance of a teacher or activism guide/expert, then the content of her book suddenly becomes problematic. This is a woman who is trying to teach the reader about racism, ableism, misogynoir, and other forms of oppression -- she even includes an extensive glossary of terms at the end of this book -- and yet she wrote ableist language throughout the text of this book, and neither she nor her editor thought to remove it. It makes me sad and upset. If this had been solely a memoir, I would have taken the ableist slurs in the text the way I do most ableism I encounter in books: it's pretty much everywhere, and people are clueless, and it is what it is.But. This book is a teaching manual. And you shouldn't act like you're teaching someone about ableism and put ableist slurs in your social justice activism book. I just don't understand why this EVER passed as okay.For example, on page 62, Franchesca Ramsey is educating the reader about why the term ""spirit animal"" should not be used by anyone who is not Native American. Above that paragraph of text, she is describing the difference between calling in and calling out offensive behavior and speech: ""The call-in voice is like the stupid airplane noises you make when you're feeding your nephew a spoonful of veggies."" The word ""stupid"" is an ableist slur that appears again on page 98 and page 215. She also has this line on page 74: ""I've often joked that 'The Relaxer' sounds like a crappy horror movie in which a maniacal killer tortures natural-haired women with scorching-hot chemical ooze and then forces them to pay money for it.""Linguistic ableism like this is very common. I can understand why Franchesca Ramsey used terms like ""stupid"" and ""maniacal"" this way. But for an activism manual that addresses the reader as ""you,"" and specifically talks about disability activism, these slurs should have been removed from the text. But the part of this book that actually hurt me arrived on page 150, when Franchesca Ramsey is teaching the reader why using the word ""spaz"" is not okay. Within this page of text is a story about how she and her theater friends in eighth grade used to go out in public together, and one friend would pretend to be ""a mentally disabled character she called Sylvia."" Sylvia would do obnoxious things in the store, while the other theater kids would all pretend to be her inept caretakers. Sylvia would ask ridiculous, embarrassing questions of the staff (such as holding up a box of feminine hygiene products and asking, ""Can I try these on?"") and then Sylvia would sometimes trash the store by knocking ""a row of adult diapers off a shelf,"" before everyone in their group would run out of the store. This was, by far, the *sh*ttiest* thing that takes place in this whole book. A group of eighth graders who are out mocking people with mental disabilities and cerebral palsy by behaving obnoxiously and knocking over store product and damaging property is worse than any other behavior described in this book, including Franchesca Ramsey's transphobic sidewalk comedy routine that she discusses later. (A comedy routine she abandoned once she realized it was transphobic).Franchesca Ramsey also seems to believe that every able-bodied person goes through some kind of ""phase"" of hating on people like this when they're young. ""If this sounds 'so high school,' that's because high school is where you learn this kind of behavior"" (page 121/122). I'm sorry, but no. No, Franchesca Ramsey. You're wrong. Not everyone learns this behavior in high school. Franchesca Ramsey repeats in this book that she did not grow up ""rich."" And what she means by that is actually this: ""I have a lot of class privilege that I refuse to acknowledge in the same way that I have a lot of able-bodied privilege that I refuse to acknowledge. But you should still listen to me because I am smarter and more #woke than you and here's my glossary of terms to prove how educated I am.""Franchesca Ramsey is like a *lot* of people who grow up middle-class or upper-middle class: they get *very* upset when anyone calls them ""rich"" because they refuse to see how many people are a lot lower on the socioeconomic scale than they are. These people only want to consider those who are financially equal to them or people who they financially aspire to be, not any of the millions of people who are economically beneath them.I want to tell Franchesca Ramsey this: I grew up in poverty, and when you grow up in poverty, your friends are whoever will take you. You don't get to hate on people with disabilities, the way affluent, able-bodied kids can be ableist assholes like you and your friends were in eighth grade. You *did* grow up with class privilege, Franchesca Ramsey. And you can whine and whine all you want about how ""not rich"" you are, but I can tell you right now, you were a lot better off than me, and in my world, you DID qualify as ""rich."" I would have definitely used that word for you growing up. And if I'd seen you performing your ableist comedy show in a store with your friends, my friends and I would have definitely been disgusted by you and your rich friends. We would have certainly known you were assholes. Reading about Franchesca Ramsey's sh*tty behavior, coupled with all of her ""I am *not* rich"" commentary, plunged me into a dark night of the soul. Bad memories from my own years in high school and junior high resurfaced, and I thought of all my friends growing up who had physical and mental disabilities. Some had dyslexia so severe they never learned how to read; some friends had autism but we didn't know what it was at the time; my brother's best friend in high school was legally blind and impoverished, and he spent a lot of time at our house; my mother was mentally ill and had a number of mental breakdowns that required time spent in a psychiatric ward; my best friend in childhood couldn't even graduate high school because it was easier for the school to expel her than to give her the assistance she needed. She had suffered brain damage from a car accident when she was a small child, and her family lived in poverty, and some school systems just ""get rid"" of people like that, instead of helping them.And then here is Franchesca Ramsey. Assuming that all of us learn how to hate and mock people ""beneath us"" just because we're able-bodied and attending high school.No. No, we don't all learn this. Privilege allows for that bullshit. Privilege teaches this level of hatred. But grow up on the bottom, and there's no one beneath you to hate on. When you're on the bottom, you can't ""avoid"" people with disabilities because you're too busy mocking them in comedy routines with your theater friends. And you don't understand that, Franchesca Ramsey. You still haven't learned that lesson. Or you wouldn't write so much ableist class privilege into your book. Despite how angry and upset parts of this book made me, I would still recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about modern social justice activism. I would not give this book to anyone who grew up in poverty or has a physical or mental disability without first warning them that there are some ableist slurs on the page and a lot of unacknowledged class privilege. Reading this book helped me have an epiphany about how microaggressions are often erased in fiction (novels, short stories, Hollywood films) for the simple reason that microaggressions are how ""good people"" uphold oppression today. As a fiction writer, I frequently turn to nonfiction like this memoir to learn more about how people think and behave, and Franchesca Ramsey has a lot of great material to share about modern online activism and the dangers that lurk there. She also shares a lot of wonderful material about growing up with natural black hair and learning how to appreciate the beauty in her natural hair. There is a great deal of educational material in this book, and there is far more good in this book than the few parts that deeply upset me. Books written by the middle class for the middle class are the norm in publishing. It just hurt that I could see places in this book when the author basically says, ""I'm not talking to you."" Maybe she'll make a video titled, ""Shit People Say... to Disabled People"" as a public service for her activist causes. Or ""Shit People Say... to Poor People."" Which could also be useful. And she won't have the blonde wig anymore, because she'll be done with the ""dumb blonde"" jokes, having recognized that jokes that run on ableist misogyny are ""punching down,"" and are therefore not helping. A girl can hope, anyway.3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 07, 2018","Jul 30, 2018","May 26, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36204890-well-that-escalated-quickly

Blow, is a black man who grew up poor in Louisiana. He went to college in Louisiana and has been a columnist at ""The New York Times"" since 2008. He has appeared on TV, but I have yet to watch one of his TV clips online. If you're a regular viewer of CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, etc., you may have seen him already.The first part of this book recounts his early childhood. His prose is beautiful, engaging, and easy to read. After a little over half of the book, he reaches the seventh grade. I started to worry that the entire book would be taken up with childhood matters. There is nothing wrong with memoirs that do that, but I prefer reading about adolescence and adulthood in memoir, rather than childhood. Since this book doesn't have the wisecracking grit in the prose that ""The Liars' Club"" made use of, it took me a *very* long time to read this memoir because so much of it is concerned with the author's childhood. But by Chapter 8 (after roughly the first two-thirds of the book), the author arrives at college. And then I tore through the rest of this book. The last five chapters (Chapters 8-12) were a phenomenal read. I didn't want to put the book down. I highly recommend this book, especially for those last five chapters. Those chapters were everything I love most in memoir.Below, I will share some thoughts as to why the beginning of this book was such a struggle for me, but those thoughts contain spoilers, and I really don't want to spoil this book. It deserves to be read without preconceived notions of what is or is not in this memoir. **spoilers**When the author was a young boy (age 6 or 8), a male cousin close to his own age touched him inappropriately. This cousin sexually molested the author. There was no oral or anal penetration involved, but the event was emotionally scarring and a source of great trauma well into the author's adulthood. The author grew up among girls who were being raped by their family members, and he also listened to audio recordings of these family rapes as a child. At no point does the author state that these girls were in fact being raped, or state that he was very fortunate that no adults in his immediate family ever raped him. The male cousin was not someone the author interacted with in his immediate household. This cousin did not live in the same home with the author. But a number of girls the author grew up with were clearly being raped by their immediate family members.The author's depression as a young adult was certainly linked to the molestation he suffered as a child, and he makes that clear in his narrative. One source of comfort he continually returned to was the fact that no penetration had occurred, with the understanding that his moral degradation and sense of worthlessness (manifestations of his emotional trauma) would have been far greater if he had been penetrated as well as sexually touched against his will.As a female reader who was raped as a child near the same age that the author was molested by his cousin (for me, it was age seven), I was painfully aware of how much male privilege Charles Blow expressed in his narrative. The penetrated bodies of the women and girls around him were often just set decoration around his own narrative. The point that he keeps returning to in order to rescue himself out of the worst depths of his trauma -- that he wasn't penetrated -- served to keep reinforcing how much I could never, as a child or adolescent or young adult -- use that same safety valve to ease off the pressure of my own sense of being turned into total garbage, a whore, a filthy person, a stain on the earth, completely worthless, etc. etc., because my body had been permanently tainted by rape.For other readers, the author's account will read, or could read, as blistering honesty surrounding a traumatic event, rather than a constant reminder that the author had the good fortune to escape something that many of the girls and women around him did not escape, and that their rapists were fathers and uncles as well as cousins and neighborhood boys.I know that the author did not mean to do this on purpose. He is dealing with homophobia and his own journey to accept his body and his infrequent erotic desires for other men. I respect that and honor him for writing this memoir. But this is not a memoir I will want to reread simply because, as a reader, I felt like I was left behind by the narrative. The homophobia that the author found aimed at him so frequently is all rooted in misogyny; men lose their status as men when they ""act like pussies"" or ""act like women,"" and the author makes that clear in his text. To be raped and molested as a woman or as a man comes with equally damning emotional consequences -- but I never had the sense that Charles Blow understood that. His fear of public shame and internal worthlessness was always male-focused and rooted in his perceptions of masculinity. Nowhere does he extend the heights of his own trauma into the emotional lives of the female rape victims around him. Some readers will believe this is not his job, and that it his right to keep his book solely focused on his own male-centered trauma. But for me personally, all I could keep thinking as I read was, ""I'm glad you were lucky, Charles Blow. Those girls you grew up with weren't that lucky at all.""I still award this book five full stars. The last five chapters are absolutely gorgeous and I loved them. I felt deeply rewarded by the author's account of pledging his fraternity, and everything he did to earn a job at ""The New York Times.""

Thanks!The 2018 contemporary romance, ""The Wedding Date,"" is the debut novel of Jasmine Guillory. This novel comes highly praised by author Roxane Gay, who has a large blurb on the front cover, which is why I picked it up. ""The Wedding Date"" was also chosen for the Target Diverse Book Club, which I didn't know was a thing, but kudos to Target for making that happen. I admit that I was *thrilled* to see a ""short, curvy, black woman"" starring in a romance novel with a smokin' hot white male love interest. I expected the interracial love story in this book to make it very different from a typical, formulaic romance novel. I honestly expected true vulnerability, sexiness, risk, and insightful cultural commentary.God, do I ever have buyer's remorse. I should have just stayed the f*ck away from this book. The cover is really misleading, and so is the blurb by Roxane Gay. I was totally duped by that cover and that blurb. Had I not been fooled by the slick packaging, I would have known not to bother with this, because the romance genre and I have *never* gotten along. I feel like I lose brain cells whenever I pick up one of these books, and just thinking about ""The Wedding Date"" long enough to write a  makes me feel like I'm inflicting more brain damage on myself. If you enjoy traditional, formulaic romance novels, then this book is here for you, and I would certainly recommend it to romance fans. My one-star is due to: 1.) unmet expectations, and 2.) reading a genre I generally hate and avoid. Lovers of romance probably won't pick up this book with false expectations, and the tropes of the genre are enjoyable, rather than loathed. The novel starts off just fine, if a bit bland, and I had fun reading the opening pages. The leading characters, Alexa and Drew, have a chance meeting in a hotel elevator in San Francisco, and end up agreeing to attend a wedding together as ""a fake couple."" The wedding is for Drew's ex-girlfriend, who is marrying Drew's best friend from medical school. Drew is single and doesn't want to go alone, so he asks Alexa if she'll go with him. They spend the weekend pretending to be dating, with the idea that they will probably never see each other again. This occupies the first 80 pages in this 310-page book. And that is pretty much where the story ends. What begins as an interesting premise and a fun/light/fluffy story quickly devolves into extreme boredom, complete predictability, and the eye-rolling levels of wish fulfillment that only serve to remind me why the romance genre and I have never gotten along.  Before meeting Alexa, it is made clear in the novel that Drew has never dated a black woman. Drew's tastes run toward women who are white, tall, blonde, thin, and have ""fake boobs."" Alexa is none of those things.Before meeting Drew, Alexa has been worried about her body size around men, especially how her body looks naked, her cellulite and dimples, and whether or not her long curly hair looks pretty enough. Alexa is also quickly informed that her body type and skin color are not the norm for Drew's girlfriends. Now, I expected there to be some friction over these two things: Alexa's body issues and Drew's sudden insta-lust/insta-love for a curvy black woman, when he has only ever dated thin white women before. The emphasis on race is made during the wedding weekend, when Alexa points out that she is the only black woman attending the celebration, and she spends a lot of the night talking to an Asian woman, who is made to seem like the only other woman of color at the reception. Everyone else, Alexa points out, is white. The wedding guests are all affluent/upper-middle class/power-career types. But other than one lascivious man who makes an overt racist comment at the reception (his name is Bill, and the other characters all make it clear that he is gross), there is no racial tension or even body-issue tension in this book. Alexa simply feels amazing and perfect every moment she is with Drew, a man with a totally gorgeous body and impeccable manners. And Drew never reflects on any of the many ways in which Alexa is physically different from every other woman he has ever had sex with or dated.Alexa always feels beautiful around Drew, and Drew always sees her as beautiful. These two just click with insta-lust and fall into insta-love over the two-day wedding weekend. They go on to have a wonderful, satisfying relationship and wonderful, satisfying sex. (My inner fifth-grader might have been happy to read this sappy, sweet, PG-level book; adult-me is just salty af and feels her brain melting.) The sex is blandly described, or just simply skipped over when the scene cuts away. Most of the intimate scenes are vague and lacking in detail. There is no graphic language ever used in this book, other than brief mentions that Drew always wears a condom before intercourse. The ""sexiest"" material in the book is all contained in the first 100 pages. If you're looking for erotica, or even ""a steamy romance"" that turns up the heat a little, ""The Wedding Date"" will not deliver. Drew and Alexa both have high-powered, well-paid jobs in career fields they are passionate about. Drew is a pediatric surgeon who lives in L.A., and Alexa is chief of staff for the mayor of San Francisco. After the initial wedding weekend, they have a long-distance relationship for 210 pages, and everything turns out perfectly for them, of course. Just think of the most predictable and #woke HEA for this situation, and you'll know how this book ends. The chapters unfold like this: Drew and Alexa eat yummy food, they have sex for hours, they separately visit a bathroom to pee and/or take a quick shower before they go out to eat yummy food again, have more sex for hours, and then separately visit a bathroom again for more freshening up. They work their jobs during the week and see each other on weekends. Life is wonderful. Repeat, repeat, repeat.Alexa is trying to convince the city of San Francisco to fund a creative arts program for at-risk teenagers. Her enthusiasm for this project causes a brief rift (a moment of reckoning that lasts all of two seconds) between her and Drew, as Drew is forced to confront his white privilege. No commentary about class or any other kind of privilege is made in this novel; the at-risk teenagers are all portrayed as people of color, and Drew's white privilege is noted in regard to the fact that had he gotten into any kind of serious trouble as a teenager (such as robbing a store after hours, as Alexa's black teenage sister did), then his criminal acts would have been easily forgiven/dismissed and carried no prison time. Sure, it's nice to see privilege commentary appear in a romance novel. I just happen to find this particular privilege check extremely lacking and unsatisfying. On the one hand, Drew is #woke enough to perfectly love a curvy black woman and have ZERO conflicts while dating and marrying her -- no trouble from his family, friends, work colleagues; everyone is just totally accepting and awesome. (Except for that one racist wedding guest named Bill who appears in the book only briefly, and never again.)So Drew is all #woke and lovin' on Alexa, and I have no problem with that; it's honestly great to see a smokin' hot white man quickly fall in love with a curvy black woman. But then the reader discovers that he's never questioned the criminal justice system before, and has *no* awareness that black youth and white youth are treated differently by the courts and police. Um, what? How can Drew be so race-aware/race-conscious and *always* be the perfect gentleman with Alexa, but then have *no* awareness of the racism in the criminal justice system? Uhhh... no. Just no.This tension lasts for all of two seconds, though. Blink and you'll miss it. Alexa schools Drew, and then he gets behind her arts program and supports her like the Wish Fulfillment Hunk he truly is.I loved that ""The Wedding Date"" starred a successful, upper-middle class black woman and featured an interracial love story. Insert those details into a traditional romance novel that stars two white leads, and that is this book. ""The Wedding Date"" is light, happy, and fun for those who enjoy the romance genre, and want romance novels that never get anywhere close to crossing the line into erotica. I am just not the market for this kind of book. The cover didn't scream ""traditional Harlequin romance,"" and with that Roxane Gay blurb, I assumed this story would be insightful and have some bite, like reading ""The Nanny Diaries"" of modern interracial romance.

But this book is not really a novel. It's a long **unmarked spoilers ahead**The 2017 YA contemporary, ""Dear Martin,"" is the debut novel of Nic Stone. But this book is not really a novel. It's a long list of facts and figures describing the ugly realities of modern racism against anyone with black skin in America. Topics directly addressed in this book include racial profiling, police brutality, and the socioeconomic impacts of Othering anyone with black skin. There is no story here. There are no characters here. There is only the voice of the author and her agenda. This is a book that was written in support of #BlackLivesMatter, a movement which I am *all* for, but this is a book that preaches to the choir. If you enjoy being preached to, then you might enjoy this book. Personally, I would prefer to read nonfiction on these topics, rather than pedagogy that has been labeled a ""novel."" I would certainly prefer to reread ""Between the World and Me"" by Ta-Nehisi Coates or ""Just Mercy"" by Bryan Stevenson than suffer through a moralizing screed like this book. I *hate* being preached at in a work of fiction. I *hate* preachy books. But ""Dear Martin"" is just one long soapbox of moralizing propaganda. If you like propaganda, then this novel is here for you. A lot of ers have suggested this book be ""taught"" in high schools, and I absolutely disagree. Books that preach to the choir turn off a lot of teenagers as quickly as they turn off adult readers. I cannot stress enough that nothing feels worse to me than a preachy, moralizing ""novel"" that is nothing more than the author soapboxing facts and figures she's drawn from long-form journalism. I love long-form journalism and creative nonfiction. But ""Dear Martin"" is 100% fiction and 100% didactic. The main character of ""Dear Martin,"" Justyce McAllister, is a seventeen-year-old black boy attending his senior year at a majority-white prep school in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. Justyce is an empty vessel of a character. He has no interior space, no ambition, and no thoughts that the author didn't rubber-stamp as agenda-approved for him to share with the reader. Justyce watches his best friend at his prep school, another black boy named Manny, have his head blown off/be shot to death by an off-duty white police officer. The two are taking a ride in Manny's vehicle together, and the off-duty officer shoots them both while they're stopped at a red light. Justyce suffers no psychological or emotional trauma from this. The event has all the emotional drama of pausing on a street corner to tie a shoe. It's not even described on the page. In real life, an event like this is so traumatic, some people never recover. At only seventeen, Justyce goes on with his life and simply feels some angst several weeks later about having to go to court over the incident, to testify against the murderer. Justyce was also shot in the shoulder and arm when Manny had his head blown off, but Justyce heals completely within four months after the shooting, and no more mention is made of any lingering disability.I cannot stress enough that Justyce isn't really a character. He's an empty vessel. He's a mouthpiece for the author to make her points and preach to the choir that #BlackLivesMatter and that racism is real and that black boys suffer because of it.What about the black girls? you might ask. What about black transgender teens? you might be wondering. I can only warn you: don't look for any kind of intersectionality here because there is a *lot* of unchecked misogyny in this book. In the pages of ""Dear Martin,"" it's the black boys who suffer racism, it's the black men and boys who are seen as the ""toilet"" for America's bullshit and hatred. Black girls? Racist misogyny? Racist transgender hatred? Sorry, that wasn't the purpose of this moralizing screed titled ""Dear Martin,"" so look elsewhere for that.After Manny's murder, Justyce considers joining a gang, but his relationship with a classmate named Sarah-Jane saves him from that horrible fate. Sarah-Jane is white, but she is also Jewish, a point that is made more than once in this book. It is also pointed out more than once that, because Jews have suffered, Sarah-Jane's people have suffered and she is therefore a victim of discrimination and anti-Semitism and hatred, regardless of having white skin. Sarah-Jane is a highly opinionated, highly educated Righteous White Girl who openly challenges the extreme forms of racism taking place at her prep school and in the surrounding environs of Atlanta, Georgia and the United States. As a Righteous White Girl, Sarah-Jane spouts off the vast majority of the long-form journalism statistics cited in this book. Sarah-Jane constantly stands up against the rich, racist white boys at her privileged prep school, boys who dress up as KKK members for Halloween (in 2016) and consider themselves naturally ""smarter"" than black boys who need ""affirmative action"" to get into college. Affluent white boys are bad news in this book, so it's a really good thing Sarah-Jane is there to Speak Truth and Lay Down The Word of #Woke Social Justice. 'Cause this girl dishes up facts like the know-it-all Righteous White Girl she is. She is a girl so good and so white and so perfect that the black boy Justyce can't help but fall in love with her, even though his 'hood mama is telling him he can never date a white girl. When Justyce finally defies his mother and starts dating Sarah-Jane, Justyce's 'hood mama only gets angrier, and never forgives or accepts Justyce for making this choice. Justyce goes on to attend Yale University a few months after Manny's murder. At the end of the book, a few months into his freshman year at college, Justyce is standing at Manny's gravesite with one of the affluent racist white boys he went to high school with. They are trying to be friends again. Justyce jokes to the boy about his girlfriend Sarah-Jane, ""That girl is gonna have my babies one day, dawg."" (page 208) The two snicker and promise not to repeat that around Sarah-Jane. All is well in the patriarchy.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be preached to and doesn't mind unchecked misogyny in their reading material. If you hate being preached to and you desire novels that actually function as novels, with an actual story, then I would not recommend this at all.One star. I fully support Black Lives Matter.

I read this book while visiting the monument this weekend, and these pages definitely contain more information than what you will find in the park/monument brochure, or in the introductory video that plays in the Visitor Center. That video is pretty detailed, and has a longer running time than other park videos I have seen (like the intro videos at Arches National Park or Yellowstone), and even this longer White Sands video barely scratches the surface of the information you will find in this book. The content of ""White Sands National Monument"" will enhance your understanding of the monument's map/brochure and Visitor Center video, as well as the various informational signs you can read on a boardwalk trail that leads partway into a dune. This is a general book that broadly lays out a variety of different topics, such as the geological formation of the sands, the Mescalero Apache who lived here when the Spanish colonists arrived, the Trinity/first nuclear bomb test site to the north of the monument, how this monument came into the national registry, and many other topics vital to understanding this remarkable and beautiful landscape. I would also just like to say that the history of the Mescalero Apache and their dealings with the U.S. Army is much more heartbreaking than anything this book can politely discuss in its pages. As an overview book, these pages don't delve into much of the real history involved in forcibly removing the Apache from this land and putting them on reservations. The information that is included is good, but it is a glossed-over introduction to the history and avoids any of the real horror of what took place here between 1848 and 1945. Speaking of 1945, the nuclear era is also glossed over. The information shared in these pages is useful and interesting, but there is a lot of horror left out of these pages concerning fallout and the environmental effects of the nuclear testing done in this region of New Mexico. The majority of these pages are spent describing the geological creation of the dunes, the main types of dunes found in White Sands, and the different plants, animals, fungi, and cyanobacteria that thrive here.

Maas, is marketed to the teenage Young Adult audience. The copy I borrowed from my library even has the word TEEN featured prominently across the book's spine. At 624 pages, finishing this novel is a commitment. I listened to the first half on audio, so I would know how to pronounce all the names, and then I read the second half in hardback. ""A Court of Mist and Fury"" is the sequel to the first book in this series, ""A Court of Thorns and Roses,"" a book that I hated, and still hate, and would never recommend. Frequently shortened to ACOTAR by the booktube community, the first book in this series features extreme graphic violence coupled with softcore erotica. This sequel (frequently shortened to ACOMAF) is just straight-up adult erotica. There is a *lot* less violence in ""A Court of Mist and Fury,"" and zero horrific scenes like the ones found in ACOTAR. I appreciated that ACOMAF was nowhere near as gory or disturbing to read. Instead, this book is a long, long novel centered on foreplay. The story follows the sexual and romantic tension between the two leads, Feyre and Rhysand. Feyre is a white, body-typical, gorgeous YA heroine, and Rhysand is a white, body-typical/fully-ripped romantic stud. If you enjoy adult erotica, and if you are longing to read some really steamy, really smutty foreplay that builds and builds to a climactic scene of heterosexual intercourse, then ACOMAF is here for you. Since YA fantasy is largely read by adults, many people have no problem with adult erotica being marketed to teen readers. Had ACOMAF been adult fantasy, I wouldn't have cared how much erotica was in this book. But since this is a YA book, it grosses me out that this is marketed so heavily to a teen audience. I would never 4 or 5-star this book for that reason. Had this *not* been a YA novel, but adult erotica, I would have easily given this book 3 stars. And if ACOTAR had never existed, and I never knew that Rhysand had once tortured Feyre by twisting the broken bone sticking up out of her arm and chuckling about it, then I could have ignored how much I dislike both of these characters, and could have given this 5 stars as an adult erotic fantasy. Here is a short list of examples to prove what I mean when I call this material erotica. (This contains graphic language, please be warned.)1. The first explicit sex scene in the book appears on page 21 and 22, as Feyre gets busy with her lover/husband-type fae ""male"" partner from the first book, Tamlin. Feyre tells the reader, ""I bit my bottom lip as he removed his pants, along with his undergarments, revealing the proud, thick length of him."" [...] ""His tongue swept my mouth again, in time to the finger that he slipped inside of me. My hips undulated, demanding more, craving the fullness of him, and his growl reverberated in my chest as he added another finger."" After ""palming"" a breast and ""flicking"" a nipple, Tamlin ""buries"" himself in Feyre with ""a mighty stroke"" and ""slams"" into her ""again and again.""2. Later in the story, after Feyre has left Tamlin's house and moved in with Rhysand, she must sit down to dinner with her two human sisters (page 254). The sisters are appalled that Feyre is no longer human, but a fae ""female"" who is in need of their help. One sister angrily asks Feyre, ""So you can't eat normal food anymore--or are you too good for it?"" Feyre responds by saying, ""I can eat, drink, f*ck, and fight just as well as I did before. Better, even."" 3. As the scenes of foreplay start really heating up between Feyre and Rhysand, the two attend a lavish fae royal party at which Rhysand must make the audience think he is a cruel and incredibly lusty High Lord (pages 415 and 416). Feyre is dressed in the same extremely skimpy outfit she wore at the end of Book 1, and she sits on Rhysand's lap on a dais in front of the crowd. As they grope and rub all over each other, the crowd watches on. Rhysand gets an erection, and Feyre says she ""writhed along that impressive length."" She ""licked up the column of his throat,"" and then tells the reader, I ""shifted against the hardness pushing into me, insistent and dominating. Precisely as his hand slid a bit too high on my inner thigh. I felt the predatory focus go right to the slickness he'd felt there. Proof of my traitorous body.""4. Later in the story, as the foreplay continues to build, Feyre and Rhysand end up alone together one night at an inn. No longer stopped by eyes of a crowd, Rhysand is finally able to give Feyre more of what she wants (pages 474 and 475). Feyre begs him to finger her, and she tells the reader, I ""ground my ass against him for emphasis."" Shortly after, Feyre tells the reader, ""His fingers plunged in and out, slow and hard,"" but Rhysand refuses to do more than finger her. ""'I have no intention of doing it all in one night,' he says to her. 'Or in a room where I can't even f*ck you against the wall.'""5. Many pages later in the book, when the foreplay finally reaches its inevitable climax of sexual intercourse, there are a lot of ""faster, deeper"" sentences, and lines like this one: ""Rhys shuddered, and I watched his cock twitch."" (page 532) The vaginal penetration is put into a much more melodramatic, YA-fantasy context with sentences like this one, which appears as Rhysand is ""thrusting"" into Feyre: ""I felt it then, the [magical fae mating] bond between us, like an unbreakable chain, like an undimmable ray of light."" (page 533) When Rhysand finally ejaculates into Feyre for the first time, ""Rhys roared as he came, slamming in to the hilt. Outside, the mountains trembled, the remaining snow rushing from them in a cascade of glittering white"" (page 533).*****In my opinion, when the lead romantic couple in a novel talk about ""f*cking"" each other, when they flirt by talking about ""licking"" each other, and words like ""cock"" and ""ass"" are on the page during intimate scenes, this is adult erotica territory, not YA. And I'm fine with adult erotica as a genre. A lot of people get their rocks off to erotica, and that's great. Feyre and Rhysand flirt with mega-intensity until about 88% of the way through the book, when they finally have sexual intercourse, and I'm glad this novel is so sexually satisfying to so many readers. It doesn't erase the fact that I find it immoral publishers can write TEEN all over this book and market it as YA fantasy. But then again, Colleen Hoover's books are also marketed as YA fiction, even when the protagonists are in their twenties, and her work is largely erotica, too. In ACOMAF, I think Sarah J. Maas does a good job writing erotica. Rhysand and Feyre are very sexy together, and since the entire book is focused on their relationship, this is a satisfying read for people who enjoy romance and erotica. I also appreciate that Feyre's clitoris is given a lot of attention, though that word never appears in the book. Feyre refers to it as ""that spot at the apex of my thighs."" I guess Sarah J. Maas never considered inventing a pretty fae word for clitoris Feyre could have used, which is a shame. But at least Rhysand is a considerate and dedicated lover, and he knows that women enjoy having their clitoris touched, and Feyre has a lot of orgasms in this book. Unlike the dull slog I felt reading ACOTAR, I thought the pacing was a *lot* better in this book, and the plot elements involving the Bone Carver, the Weaver, and all of the little heists the main characters complete to try to stop Hybern were all woven together very well. In craft terms, this story was the most sophisticated work I've read by this author. The prose suffers from needless repetition of story details, as if the author assumed I couldn't remember great swaths of material from one chapter to the next. The pacing always slowed when plot details and character development sentences were being repeated. Individual words are also repeated far too much. Feyre calls Rhysand a ""prick"" countless times throughout the novel, so when she speaks the word in hate against Hybern at the end of the book, I was shaking my head, because the word was a term of endearment by then, not an insult. Characters in this book frequently give each other a ""vulgar gesture,"" a gesture which is never described beyond being called ""vulgar,"" but the term ""vulgar gesture"" still appears in almost every chapter. The words ""brutal"" and ""cruel"" are overused, as are many others.The first 125 pages/20% of this book deal with the suffocating affects of a bad marriage. Feyre's relationship with Tamlin has the story deal with the heavy issues of conformity, gender frustration, hypocrisy, and the stifling impacts of trying to fulfill society's expectations. Tamlin's lavish home has become Feyre's prison, and her life has become so constricted that she is withering away. Rhysand is the only one who notices, and his attentions and love provide Feyre with the tools to escape. Part of what makes ACOMAF so enjoyable to readers is that those first 125 pages are the YA fantasy version of reading the 1961 debut novel, ""Revolutionary Road,"" by Richard Yates. I didn't read that book, but I saw the 2008 award-winning film starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. I enjoyed that movie, and reading/listening to the beginning of ACOMAF was like watching that movie again.On page 126, the novel shifts tone, moving from ""Revolutionary Road"" territory into a standard Harlequin romance/erotica novel. The foreplay is hot and heavy, every scene in the book is laced with sexual tension, and if you are looking for some great adult erotica with some lite YA fantasy, I would definitely recommend this book.Overall, the fae and human cultures in this book are *highly* patriarchal. This novel gives readers a ""brutal"" world that is incredibly base/animalistic and gender conformist. Men are called ""males,"" women are called ""females,"" fae have ""mating"" bonds that are more important/more primal than marriage, and the characters talk about how much they enjoy ""f*cking and fighting"" a lot. If you would prefer to think of having sex as rutting, like watching two lions overcome with an urge to mate and reproduce, then ACOMAF will be even more satisfying to you. All of the graphic rutting/mating scenes in the book end by page 547 (after 88%). Rhysand is successful in his attempts to build Feyre back up after her stifling marriage/living arrangement with Tamlin. With Rhysand's careful support and constant ministrations (including the fact that he gives Feyre a job and lets her live in his house), Feyre comes into her fae powers, learns how to fight, and helps Rhysand and his friends battle Hybern (sort of -- they confront him, at least) at the end of this book.Some ers call Rhysand ""a feminist icon"" for the way he so patiently and persistently helps Feyre throughout the book. Rhysand, however, knows all along that Feyre is his ""magical fae mate"" and therefore, he has his own agenda regarding his kindness. He is loving, yes, but he has strong motivations to be that way. The ending of this book really bored me. The scene with the cauldron felt so anti-climactic. Feyre saves the day right after her sisters are changed into fae, because *reasons*. So much of the plot of this book is just the author pulling strings, making sure things happen because they were meant to, not because the story makes logical sense. Why didn't Feyre burn out Hybern's wards before her sisters were put into the cauldron? Um, because the author wanted the sisters changed first. Silly stuff like that just annoys me. Rhysand's ableist comment at the end of the book made me super angry. On page 618, he says that if his warrior-friend Cassian lost his fae wings, then Cassian would ""prefer death"" to staying alive without wings. This line appears soooo close to the end of the book, I just wailed, ""Why? Why?? WHY??"" These two men have been brothers and soldiers for centuries, and they have also tortured and mutilated other fae soldiers together. Soldiers lose limbs all the time and life goes on for them. Why is this novel trying to tell me that wounded warriors just prefer being dead? WHY?? Guhhhhhhh. Whatever. I'm done. I give this book one star for being a vast improvement over ACOTAR, and one star for being high-level adult erotica. If you like romance/erotica with a small side of lite YA fantasy, you will probably enjoy this book a lot more than I did....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 22, 2018","Apr 24, 2018","Apr 22, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26073150-a-court-of-mist-and-fury

Written in a prose style frequently found in Young Adult, “Circe” does not qualify as adult literature. I certainly disagree that it qualifies as a feminist story.This novel is actually the patriarchy presenting itself on Olympian-powered steroids. Misogyny and rape culture are the engines of this book. To qualify as “feminist literature,” “Circe” demands that the reader be ignorant of the original myths selected to be altered and retold in this Forrest Gump-style romp through Greek mythology. Madeline Miller manages to take the misogyny and rape culture at the foundation of the original myths and intensify the unchecked reign of the patriarchy by a drastic amount. The patriarchy is the star of this book.

Rupi Kaur rocketed to like-and-follow fame as an ""Instapoet"" on Instagram. Her Instapoems and accompanying artwork are retweeted by celebrities like the Kardashians and other important people who star on TV. It was only after Rupi Kaur's work hit all the bookstores, even the little bookshelves at places like Walmart, that I realized she was *everywhere*. Her 2014 collection of poetry, ""Milk and Honey,"" is most often sold alongside her second collection of poems, the 2017 follow-up, ""The Sun and Her Flowers.""So I picked up ""Milk and Honey"" and gave it a read.This book made me so angry. Never in my life have I yelled in rage at a collection of poetry. But these instapoems inspired my fury.And *not* simply because these poems are completely juvenile works penned by someone who is not an actual juvenile. If a twenty-year-old wants to write poetry on the craft level of a fifth-grader in middle school, that is their right, and the work can still be called poetry.My problem was the *content* of the poems. The content is so narcissistic, ego-driven, and juvenile, but is passing itself off to the reader as ""profound,"" ""wise,"" and ""healing."" *This* is what had me flipping my cookies and yelling ""wtf wtf wtf"" for a good long hour. As an example, here is a narcissistic, ego-driven poem that appears on page 88 --the woman who comes after me will be a bootlegversion of who i am. she will try and write poemsfor you to erase the ones i've left memorized onyour lips but her lines could never punch you inthe stomach the way mind did. she will then try tomake love to your body. but she will never lick, caress, or suck like me. she will be a sadreplacement of the woman you let slip. nothing shedoes will excite you and this will break her. when she is tired of falling apart for a man that doesn'tgive back what he takes she will recognize me in your eyelids staring at her with pity and it'll hit her.how can she love a man who is busy lovingsomeone he can never get his hands on again.**********Poems like this lash-out full of post-rejection rage read like an angry teenager dumping their whinging and angst in a diary, not like words penned for a reader to gain any insight about the human condition. Many of the poems in ""Milk and Honey"" feature such delusions of grandeur. While reading this collection, I kept hearing a parade of drunken women I've encountered in bar bathrooms over the years, women sobbing with rejection rage, mascara pouring down their faces, ready to share their post-breakup ""no woman will ever be as good as me"" message to anyone who will listen. And then there are poems like this one found in ""the loving"" section of the book, on page 75 --you move my handbetween my legsand whisper*make those pretty little fingers dance for me*--*solo performance***********A picture of a ballerina dancing in a leotard is featured under this poem.**********This is just face-palm territory for me. Imagine, for a moment, a woman taking her male partner's hand, wrapping his fingers around his own penis, and telling him, ""make those pretty little fingers dance for me."" Or, better yet, ""make those pretty little fingers stroke your monkey for me."" Or perhaps, ""make those pretty little fingers jack your salami for me."" While I sit here and watch. Because sexy.Women masturbating for men's visual pleasure... while the guy sits there and does nothing... uh, tell me again why this poem is in ""the loving"" again? Because that sounds more like watching porn to me, videos which sure have a lot to say about power, but f*ck-all nothing to say about love.You might be wondering why it matters. Rupi Kaur is a feminist, you might say, and these poems are all about ""feminism"" and ""female empowerment.""Well, I guess if the important people on TV all say so, it must be true. If anyone would like to read more about Rupi Kaur, her work, and her rise to fame, there is plenty to choose from. This profile piece by Molly Fischer is definitely the most scathing (and the most entertaining) --https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/profil...Titled ""The Instagram Poet Outselling Homer Ten to One: Meet Rupi Kaur, author of the ubiquitous Milk and Honey."" -- that profile made my jaw drop with how savage it is, but I also laughed and laughed and laughed. This essay about the ethical problems of Rupi Kaur's work and rise to fame is much more serious, balanced, and damning --""The Problem with Rupi Kaur's Poetry""https://www.buzzfeed.com/chiaragiovan...And then here are two useful essays about Rupi Kaur that have appeared in ""The New York Times"" --""Rupi Kaur Is Kicking Down the Doors of Publishing""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/fa... ""Why Rupi Kaur and Her Peers Are the Most Popular Poets in the World""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/bo... **********I could have happily lived the rest of my life without ever learning that Instapoets exist, and that so many people are delighted to read a book of poems that could have been titled ""Aphorisms from the Twitter Verse"" or ""Poems I Sorta Stole from Other Poems I Read on Tumblr"" or ""Twitter Poems That Read Like Facebook Memes But With Extra Spaces.""The final section of ""Milk and Honey"" is titled ""the healing"" and focuses on themes such as ""the power of sisterhood"" and ""loving all women"" and other such ""uplifting"" messages that the first three sections of the book do not speak to at all. Here is a poem that appears on page 187 --my heart aches for sisters more than anythingit aches for women helping womenlike flowers ache for spring**********A picture of twenty identical flowers in bloom is featured under this poem.**********Women helping women, you say. Hmm. I'm assuming you're excluding all the women who now love the men who have dumped you? The women who ""lick"" and ""suck"" the men who will never get over dumping you? And what is with flowers aching for spring? If flowers are in bloom, it must already be spring. Flower *seeds* ache for spring. Flowers in bloom ache for their pollen to be spread, so they can get busy making next year's flowers... but I guess no one important on TV is pointing this out, so flowers aching for spring makes perfect sense. ((Again with the juvenile craft level tho...)) If you want to read instapoems that make your inner adolescent feel a major ego-boost of continued relevance now that you've birthday'd your way into adulthood, this book is here for you.

I bought a very notated, very worn hardback copy and reread it, finding as much truth in these pages as I did as an aspiring writer more than a decade ago.I have kept track of Donald Maass over the years. I also enjoy reading his posts about writing craft on the website Writer Unboxed, where he is a frequent contributor. I would love to meet him at a writers' conference or other such literary event. He has so much wisdom and industry expertise about how and why stories work. It honestly saddens me that so many people have given this book such scathing s here on Goodreads. There are plenty of craft books on the market, but very few are as good as this one.The bones of what makes a good story are all here: raising stakes, transformation, resolution. All the big plot elements are broken down into the simplest language. So are thornier subjects, like theme and voice. Donald Maass knows the market, and what readers crave from their books, and he knows how to distill that knowledge into the fewest words possible. I have learned some uglier truths about publishing since the first time I read this book, truths Donald Maass doesn't ever mention. And I don't blame him for it -- he probably was unaware of such things, then and now. But those truths are still there. Most people who aspire to call themselves authors come from a particular socioeconomic background, and the publishing market favors stories told from the viewpoint of that particular socioeconomic background. The market also favors stories that feature people from bad circumstances falling on hard times through their own poor choices and/or addictions, and then overcoming their internal demons rather than facing or changing external forces of oppression. White savior tales remain as popular as they ever were for a reason. So do popular tropes like the Magical Negro character, which has morphed into another popular trope of ""diversity checkboxing"" to soothe the sting of a modified/slightly exoticized white savior tale on an audience that claims to be progressive and #woke/aware of oppression.Donald Maass doesn't speak to these things. But all of that hegemonic discourse exists in novels: in the stories that are chosen for publication, and certainly in the stories that become ""breakout novels"" that sell well in the marketplace. Privilege does not like to be seen, or heard. Privilege definitely does not want to be changed. As a white, able-bodied, upper-middle class, neurotypical, heterosexual man, Donald Maass has found success in an industry that seeks to reward what he is and how he thinks. None of that, however, means that his wisdom about the craft of storytelling isn't useful or true. Quite the opposite. I love this book, and highly recommend it to any novelist. But there are a great many truths I would add to these pages, if I could. For aspiring ""breakout novel"" authors, there are a lot of ugly things that should be taken into consideration before writing ""for the market,"" or writing a book that might perform well in the market. Donald Maass is a member of the inner circle, so he can't speak to those things. For any aspiring ""breakout"" novelist who was born and raised in the same inner circle, sharing those truths would also be unnecessary. Those truths are often a birthright, inherited through the osmosis of one's upbringing. For people outside of the circle, the worldview of the publishing industry and successful novelists must be learned, as the mores and codes of conduct of any different class in society must be learned. Donald Maass did not write an ethnography book about the publishing industry; he was simply focused on the craft of storytelling, as if writing exists in a void beyond the strictures of culture and power. That is the void that most books about writing exist in; as if stories are not the most powerful form of the hegemony, but some kind of artistic pursuit that finds success based solely on merit. But I digress. As a book about storytelling, the information about plot, characters, setting, and other basic elements of structure presented in this book are as solid and useful now as they were when Donald Maass first published this book.

Sounds awesome, yeah? I admit I was intrigued to be reading about a female captain crewing an all-female ship.Except that this awesome girl-power ship appears only briefly in Chapter 1, and very briefly again in the final two chapters (20 and 21). Which is to say, this ship is present for only about 2 percent of the book. The bulk of this story is set on a (traditional, and highly trope-heavy) all-male pirate ship crewed by a diabolical captain named Draxen. Draxen's brother, Riden, is Alosa's love interest. Riden appears in Chapter One and it is clear by how much physical description and attention he is paid by Alosa that the romance of this novel will center on him.Why does Alosa spend almost the entirety of this novel on Draxen's ship? She is searching for a treasure map that is hidden aboard, a map that she must fetch for her powerful father, the Pirate King. Instead of, say, hiring on as one of the crew, Alosa arranges to have herself taken prisoner for a number of weeks, so she can sneak out of her cell at night and search the ship.I fully admit that I found this plot point completely ridiculous, especially when I later learned that Alosa has the magical power to alter her appearance around men. Why didn't she simply disguise herself as a man, hire herself out as a crew member, and search the entirety of Draxen's ship without all of the silliness of the ""prisoner"" story line?Well, because reasons. Reason #1: beautiful white teenage girls who are taken prisoner by their handsome male love interests is a popular trope in the YA fantasy genre. So, the author made that happen, because the market is the market, and readers want what they want. (Which is: primarily heterosexual love stories featuring able-bodied white people having adventures, which this novel most certainly is.)If things like ridiculous plot points frustrate you, you may want to steer clear of this novel. The premise is clearly meant to be taken as silly and zany, and the book is full of the vibe of ""girl power is awesome and boy pirates are goofy and easy to mock lolz because men omg I can't even.""Given how much misogyny teenage girls are hit with in real life on a daily basis, I don't think the boy-mockery in this novel is such a bad thing. It was off-putting for me as an adult reader, but for actual teen girls, I don't think the flippant (and often belittling) tone Alosa takes against boys and men is necessarily wrong. This novel features the classic, patriarchy-heavy fantasy setting that most YA fantasies use, and Alosa has a snarky, girl-power voice a lot of teen girls will find engaging. This book also reads more like middle grade fiction than most modern YA novels. Which is to say, ""Daughter of the Pirate King"" reads like it was written for the *actual* intended audience of young adults between the ages of 12 and 18.Shocker, I know. YA has been so colonized and taken over by adult female readers, it seems bizarre to read a teen book that has the vocabulary and simple sentences appropriate for an actual teen reader. Which I do not mean as an insult to teen readers, but as an acknowledgment that ""reading levels"" are an actual thing that can be measured and labeled by various groups of people. I am technically not one of those professionals but I can certainly state that I wouldn't hesitate to give ""Daughter of the Pirate King"" to a girl in 6th, 7th, 8th grade, or high school, and trust that she'll be able to understand it and enjoy the story.If you are looking for a girl-power YA fantasy novel to give to a teen reader in your life, I think ""Daughter of the Pirate King"" would be a good choice. The majority of the chapters in this book focus on the interactions between Riden and Alosa as she goes about her business of breaking out of her prison cell to hunt for the treasure map aboard Draxen's ship. And I honestly liked Riden, mostly because he is *so* different from the typical alpha-male a-hole who stars in so many other YA fantasy books. Riden is an extremely respectful and upstanding young man. He is kind to Alosa, and he takes great pains to help her in this book. I give major props to the author for penning a book with such a decent male love interest.For an actual teen reader, I think this book is a 5-star read.For me, it's a 2.5-star rounded up to 3. It's not a bad book. I found a lot of the plot details frustrating, and I was often bored by the redundancies -- but again, had I been 12 or 13 when I read this, the prose level would have probably been fine. The sequel to this book, ""Daughter of the Siren Queen,"" was published in February 2018.

Another mark of literary fiction at its finest: when there is no hero's reward for being unreflective, emotionally cold, and psychologically average. In a novel like ""Evening,"" there is no heroic philosophical fulfillment to be had for shunning a life of the mind or a life of great passion in favor of chasing material status, which is far more mundane and requires a very different kind of ambition. Authors like Susan Minot understand that economic material rewards and philosophical perspicacity are not often found existing together, and the story doesn't falsely substitute profundity with the size of one's bank account, marital status, or number of grandchildren. And I am so here for that. *So* here for that. Books like this one make me feel glad to be alive. A great literary novel like ""Evening"" sometimes feels like the only thing that keeps my heart beating, stories that explode with the dark, ugly truths that have no place in polite company, civil society, or all the moments when I am expected to smile and pretend life is wonderful.This is not a book to read for people who like to smile and pretend. If you need heroic tales about good people who persevere to attain their hero's reward, then ""Evening"" will not be a satisfying experience.But if you enjoy beautiful prose, elliptical stories, and dark truths about the world as it is: patriarchal, gender conforming, focused on outer appearances, harshly judgmental, often cruel, and full of suffering -- well, you might love this novel as much as I do. The protagonist -- a young woman named Ann Grant (at age 25) and Ann Lord (her married name at age 65) -- has not spent her lifetime examining her interior depths. Ann Grant/Ann Lord has a fine memory and a very sharp eye, but she has put those skills to use in the world of outward success. She has ""performed"" her life according to the dictates of luxury, status, and taste. She married three different times, suffered through various hardships and attained all the big status symbols of a successful life, like a beautiful home, trips to France and Italy, and her grown children now have beautiful children of their own. Author Susan Minot is a careful observer of life, and ""Evening"" is full of the status-relevant details that surround any member of the white upper-middle class. Ann Grant/Ann Lord is a member of that class, and she is so carefully drawn as to be instantly recognizable as an archetype of her class.But emotional truth has eluded Ann Grant/Ann Lord until the very end of her life, when she lies on a bed slowly dying of cancer. In the scattered thoughts of her morphine-addled mind, memories and emotion surface to reveal a new order, an order that could only be seen after all of the material trappings of life have fallen away. Alone inside her body, Ann Grant/Ann Lord turns that sharp eye on herself, and the result is this extraordinarily stunning novel. I first read ""Evening"" in 2007, and then reread the book this year, in 2018. I loved it even more the second time. It's a haunting story that has stayed with me in the very best way. This time, reading ""Evening"" reminded me of the work of Andre Dubus, especially his ""Selected Stories."" In particular, his short story, ""The Pretty Girl,"" holds a similar place in my heart. That story's central protagonist, Polly, has much in common with Ann Grant/Ann Lord, even though they occupy two different socioeconomic classes; Polly is a white middle-class woman, rather than inhabiting the higher economic advantages of the upper-middle class. Andre Dubus and Susan Minot have an equal dedication to telling the truth, and capturing something true about human nature on the page. I delight in their work and their precise, restrained, and incredibly evocative prose.Reading ""Evening"" makes me feel so much. On the one hand, it is the smallest story imaginable, just the story of this one mundane woman and her common, rather loveless, unremarkable life. But that is why the novel feels so sweeping, and so grand. Even the hard-hitting New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani gave this novel a rave . I don't often agree with Ms. Kakutani, but on this book, I think she is absolutely correct.

After**unmarked spoilers ahead**I was late to the Reading Party for the much-hyped, much-anticipated 2016 YA fantasy, ""Truthwitch,"" by Susan Dennard. After struggling to finish this book, I cannot understand why there was ever so much hype for this novel. The content felt poorly conceived and poorly described, the characters lacked goals and interior life, the storytelling was scattered over four different points of view, and the prose was full of grammar errors and awkward sentences.Take this sentence, on page 167:""Safi lurched to her feet, stumbling off a second pallet and almost sprawling flat from the blood roaring across her vision.""How does blood ""roar""? Blood does not make noise. Blood cannot ""roar"" across someone's ""vision.""Verb choices matter, and so do conjunctions, commas, metaphors and similes... basic sentence stuff that writers should know. If you are an aspiring line editor, and want a good book to practice your work on, ""Truthwitch"" would be an excellent choice.Here is another sentence featuring the main character, the truth-detecting witch Safi, on page 33, as she puts on ""a golden gown"" early in the story:""It was then, as Safi fastened the ten million wooden buttons and Iseult tied a pale gray scarf around her head, that a knocking burst out through the shop.""Were there really ten million buttons on Safi's gown? I honestly wondered, because these two magic-wielding witches have done an astonishing number of high-action feats by page 33 of this book, and the descriptive writing up to that point was straight, not loaded with hyperbole. Every time I encountered more of these hyperbolic zingers, they read as awkwardly as trying to imagine ""roaring"" blood in my vision. Or how a character's breath could ""scrape"" someone's skin. And on and on with the awkward prose choices that fill this book.The setting of this story is a fictional place called ""the Witchlands,"" which is basically a slightly-modified map of Europe with a couple of large, homogeneous kingdoms dominating the landscape. Instead of these political entities being called kingdoms, however, they are called ""empires."" The word ""empire"" seems to have been chosen with the same amount of thought that went into ""roaring"" blood across vision and breath that can ""scrape"" skin.If you like to read prose that makes you constantly wonder, ""What are words??"" then this book is for you.In the Witchlands, there is the Empire of Cartorra and the Empire of Marstok, but the emperors/empresses who rule these lands think and act like high school students agonizing over their SAT scores and prom dates. If you enjoy that kind of thing, this book is here for you.The main character in this story was born with a special type of ""witch power"" -- Safi can use her ""witchery"" to tell if someone is lying or not. As a human lie detector, Safi is easily fooled. She begins the book in Chapter One by telling the reader she has been duped in a card game by someone she calls the ""Chiseled Cheater,"" a handsome rogue who took off with all of her money and successfully lied to her about an entourage she could rob the next morning. The reader never meets the Chiseled Cheater, but his lies and tricks set the entire plot of this book into motion. Safi's heist goes awry, and she meets a Bloodwitch in the carriage she is planning to rob, instead of the person she thought she would find. The Bloodwitch spends the rest of the novel savagely tracking Safi down, hunting her to the ends of the earth... or the ends of the Empire... or something.Why does the Bloodwitch want Safi? Because the story says so, that's why. In this fictional Europe, every Emperer/Empress in the land wants a Truthwitch. Because reasons.Imagine emperors and empresses who are all desperate to acquire a faulty lie detector to keep in their palaces. A lie detector that is waiting to be put to the test on... I don't even know. Criminals, I guess? Would having a Truthwitch under imperial control help royal judges assess guilt and innocence during trials? I honestly have no effing idea why Safi was so vital to every Empire in this world. Which is why the plot of this book did not work for me. Because the entire story is this: Safi must flee! And flee again! And keep fleeing! Because the Bloodwitch found out Safi is a Truthwitch! And now the Bloodwitch is hunting her! Which means now even MORE people will hunt her! Safi, the unreliable human lie detector, can never be safe!Run, Safi, run!! That's the entire plot of this book.The story begins in Veñaza City, which is basically a fictional Venice, Italy. Safi is a noblewoman, a ""Domna"" who has learned how to fight -- which surprises the other characters in this book, because it's so atypical for noblewomen to have callused hands and carry swords in this story world.Safi's best friend is an impoverished Threadwitch named Iseult. Iseult's witch power is to see the ""threads"" of other people: she sees their auras and emotions as distinct colors, and this can often overwhelm Iseult with headaches, psychological chaos, and exhaustion. Her emotional sensitivity to people honestly seemed like a curse, a terrible burden I certainly wouldn't want, like suffering from chronic pain or migraines or tinnitus. Every time I was in Iseult's POV pages, I just thanked my lucky stars I wasn't born a Threadwitch. Because eesh, this witch power just seemed pointless and useless.Even though there are all kinds of people born with various witch powers in this book, the only racism in the world is against people with fair/pale ""moon skin"" and black ""midnight hair"" (page 12) -- which is the skin type and hair color Iseult has. She was born to a tribe of people who are hated in the Empire of Cartorra. Iseult spends a lot of the book trying to hide her face and skin from people, so they cannot see what she looks like and immediately hate her. I don't know why there was such intense racism against her and her whole tribe but then again, ""What are words??"" I don't know.I carefully read the first 43 pages of this novel, and then I just couldn't suffer anymore, and skimmed the rest of the book, skipping entire pages of Action! Fleeing! Safi Creating Drama Because Drama! More Action! Safi Causing More Problems! Run, Safi, run!!All of the conflict in this book is external -- Safi is being hunted, and Iseult suffers Because Racism. There is a prince named Merik who needs a ""trade deal"" to ""feed his people."" Early in the novel, Merik dances with Safi at a royal ball, and becomes interested in her. Some ers have called their romance a case of insta-love, but I disagree. I cannot call this lusty-dance a setup for insta-love because Merik later threatens to kill Safi (he holds a knife to her throat and verbally threatens to kill her), he physically assaults her (grabs her arms and ties her up), and at one point he shackles her (ties her up in chains) on a ship deck and leaves her exposed to the weather, to suffer through an icy rainstorm at sea. This is NOT how you talk to someone you love, and this is NOT how you treat someone you love. Sure, this behavior qualifies as ""sexy"" in the pornographic imaginary, which features men brutalizing women who are moaning in ecstasy, overcome with orgasmic bliss while men physically and verbally hurt them -- but I don't give a sh*t about the pornographic imaginary. I refuse to call the love story in ""Truthwitch"" a case of insta-love, or even insta-lust. I just found Prince Merik gross and I do not ship him at all. I understand that Safi's behavior was thoughtless and that Merik believed she deserved to be punished. But as the love interest of a YA novel, Merik did nothing for me. In typical YA fantasy fashion, Merik and Safi *almost* have sex (page 350), but Sudden Danger Interrupts Them before they can get naked. Safi is a virgin, and as many YA authors know, it's important to reassure the reader that Good Girls Don't. A girl can get hot and heavy with a guy, rub up against him with her clothes on and pant pretty hard so the guy can see her ""chest heaving"" (page 351), but it's best to keep the nipples safely hidden, and the erect penis definitely needs to stay out of the vagina. Unless, of course, the girl is certain the guy wants to marry her, or she has been given an oath that he is feeling True Love. In that case, the penis may entire her vagina. But NOT without a declaration of true love FIRST. Because Sex without True Love is slutty and wrong. Safi even makes sure to tell Merik, ""I'm not that sort of girl."" (page 349)I give this book one star. I certainly have no interest in reading the sequels....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Mar 11, 2018","Mar 12, 2018","Mar 11, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/21414439-truthwitch

Though I am one-starring this book, I can completely understand why this bestselling novel is so beloved, has such an active fan base, and why Leigh Bardugo is such a powerhouse author in the YA industry.""Six of Crows"" gets a lot of things right. Here is a short list of things that are excellent about this book:1. The writing is superb. On a sentence level, this book is gorgeous. 2. The world-building detail and setting description are outstanding.3. The plot is so tightly woven that the reader forgives the flashback interruptions, i.e. the long sections of backstory sprinkled through the middle and end of the book, because the pacing is so quick and so strong. Well, the pacing is quick up until the last three chapters. Labeled ""44: Jesper,"" 45: Kaz,"" and ""46: Pekka,"" these final three chapters all dragged for me, to the point that instead of 2-starring this book for great writing, I could not justify the extra star. The extent that the ending of ""Six of Crows"" was so slow and anti-climactic, compounded with all the problematic elements of this book, served only to tell me that I had put something poisonous into my brain by reading this novel. There is nothing like a slow, dragging ending to a fast-paced book to remind me how much I hated this novel, and how toxic the content of this book really is.Because as nice as the writing, the world-building, and the plotting of this book really is, I actively hated ""Six of Crows"" as I read it. And now that I have finished it, I hate ""Six of Crows"" even more.This book is a wish-fulfillment trope-fest packed with ableism and misogyny. The setting of ""Six of Crows"" is a modern pornographic imaginary that equates death with sex, feelings with weakness, and ignores basic human psychology in favor of a James Bond-level action tale. If you enjoy modern/gonzo pornography, James Bond movies, and ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" you will probably love ""Six of Crows.""And that is perfectly fine. The fan base for this book is as intense as the fan base of those other works. We love what we love. And, of course, we hate what we hate. And I hate ""Six of Crows."" Hate it with an infinite rage that burns deep in my gut and spits acid all over the ableism and misogyny that goes unchecked through this novel. I curse this book. Curse it with every bit of emotional poison that this book tried to feed me. Here is an incomplete list of vile garbage a reader will find in this novel:1. The Disability That Was Never There Trope.** Seen in the main character of Kaz Brekker, who is portrayed as a human teenager with a damaged leg, in need of a cane when he walks. But Kaz Brekker actually has the physical prowess of a U.S. Navy Seal/U.S. Green Beret all throughout this book, and the cane even disappears from the page around the mid-point of this book.**This trope is ABLEIST AF. This is NOT ""good disability rep."" Literary ableism this severe and egregious is not doing anyone any favors. In real life, people with disabilities already face a lot of contempt from able-bodied people who believe they are ""not really disabled"" and could ""be able-bodied"" if they just ""tried harder."" Characters like Kaz Brekker, who uses a cane only as a story-prop, reinforce that harmful attitude to a startling degree, and I really just can't with this sh*t. 2. Teenage characters who are NOT really teenagers. Kaz Brekker, and everyone else in his ""gang,"" play the role of James Bond in this book. These ""teenagers"" all have adult mindsets, adult power bases/adult abilities/adult experience levels, and everyone in ""Kaz's gang"" behaves as an adult. Kaz Brekker reads like he is 35 or 43 years old, not seventeen. Inej should be at least 28 or 33 years old, not sixteen/almost-seventeen (her age is given on page 20, stating that she is almost seventeen). The same is true for Nina, Matthias (who is the oldest of the group, portrayed as 18 years old when he reads more like Kaz's 35 or 40), and Jesper. (I exclude Wylan from this list since he is not part of the ""gang,"" but is taken on as insurance for the heist, and chooses to join Kaz's gang of his own accord, because Wylan's wealthy merchant father wishes him dead and he has nowhere else to go.) 3. Adults who are disgusting sh*tbags devoid of all morals, while teenagers still possess a moral compass and the capacity to do good. 4. Every adult institution is rife with corruption and moral depravity, and teenagers have no choice but to embrace a ruthlessly selfish mentality in order to survive in a world that actively hates them and seeks their destruction.5. NO ONE is innocent, morally clean, or good in this book, and because every adult is completely morally rotten, the teenage boys are all permanently emotionally damaged, and the teenage girls (and homosexual boys, who are coded as feminine by society) are the sole vessels of any humanity left in the world, the life rafts that the permanently-damaged boys must cling to in order to survive their emotional trauma.6. Boys are damaged and become unfeeling, murdering monsters, but girls are damaged to an equal or worse extent but still possess feelings and maintain their humanity. IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF SEXISM IN YOUR BOOKS, THEN ""SIX OF CROWS"" IS FOR YOU. Nina and Inej are both shackled as young teens, sold into slavery/made into slaves, put in cages, beaten and tortured, both are forced to work in brothels, Inej is raped every day for years in a brothel, Nina is almost tortured to death numerous times in the story... but it is Kaz and Matthias who are the most super f*cked-up characters in this story, the characters with the highest levels of psychological and emotional trauma. Not Nina. Not Inej. Nina and Inej still have ethical purpose, psychological fortitude, humanity, and feelings. Because why? Because girls. And that leads into the next SUPER TROPE of this book --7. True Love Cures the Monster. ""Six of Crows"" has a double-whammy of this powerful trope. Nina and Inej both fall in love with emotionally unavailable men, men who can torture and kill people and don't feel bad about it or regret their behavior at all, a.k.a. sociopaths. Matthias is a member of the fantasy version of Hitler's SS, and he imprisons Nina (who is viewed as a Grisha ""witch"" in the twisted religion Matthias belongs to, witches his ""pure"" male warrior group must exterminate), and Matthias tries to kill Nina numerous times in this story. The most erotic lines in this book are in Matthias's dreams about Nina, in which he fantasizes about killing her and f*cking her in equal measure (pages 103-104). He wakes from one of these dreams and immediately starts choking her, smashing her head on the floor, and telling her, ""Beg me. Beg me for your life."" (page 105) Following the worldview of the pornographic imaginary, as this novel most certainly does, it should come as no surprise that Nina is in love with Matthias, and Inej is in love with Kaz, and these men struggle to access their feelings and love their ""girls"" in return.8. The author researched 17th-century Netherlands and Dutch culture in order to center this book on the historical Amsterdam, historical Prussia, historical Russia, etc. White colonialist discourse informs this novel, on a character level, a world-building level, and a central plot-level. There are cultural and nationalistic stereotypes in this book. That is not necessarily a bad thing, because stereotypes are real and authors do need to speak to them in their art, but the representations in this book personally left a bad taste in my mouth. The fact that every adult in this book is a corrupt, morally bankrupt sh*tbag certainly didn't do the racial and cultural representation in this book any favors.*****I cannot in good conscience recommend ""Six of Crows"" to anyone. I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to any teen reader. This is an adult fantasy with an unrealistic cast of teens, teens who were ""made teens"" in name only, so the book could be marketed and sold as YA. If this book were an adult fantasy, I would understand that it is tapping into the same pornographic imaginary as ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" in order to cater to the adult pornographic mindset. I would hate the book less than I currently do, but I would still not recommend it, for the same reason that I don't recommend ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" Porn-culture books are just NOT MY THING. At all.My one-star rating is full of contempt. I see the poison of ableism and misogyny dripping all over this story -- and I hate it. I hate that we are putting stories like this into the hands of our teenagers. I hate that we are holding up ableism and misogyny this toxic and celebrating it, making money off of it, and perpetuating it in our culture.This book makes me sick. Sick at heart, sick in my gut, sick in my brain. The author bell hooks frequently examines the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy that is most often featured in American artwork, works of art like this novel. If you enjoy books that support the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, then ""Six of Crows"" is here for you.

These nine stories are trenchant, bitterly uplifting, and focused on various themes surrounding Native American identity in the United States after September 11, 2001.The phrase ""bitterly sarcastic"" appears in this book, and while the author's ruthless wit can certainly deliver an abundance of cutting zingers, these stories are also extremely generous and compassionate. Alexie's clean, concise prose traffics in the ugly truth, but the stories in ""Ten Little Indians"" always reaffirm life. In the worldview of Alexie's fiction, the human spirit is profoundly flawed, but still worth the absurdity and pain that come with being alive.I love reading Alexie because he makes me feel less alone.

Published in 2015, the dystopian/slightly-futuristic novel, ""The Heart Goes Last,"" by I am struggling to understand what the point of this novel was. Published in 2015, the dystopian/slightly-futuristic novel, ""The Heart Goes Last,"" by Margaret Atwood, is clearly meant to be satirizing the white, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, middle-class citizens of America. I don't think I have ever read another novel with an entire cast of such vacuous characters before. I definitely had the impression that Margaret Atwood believes no one in America possesses a brain. The entire U.S. population is presented here as a mass of ineffectual, ridiculous losers who have nothing better to do than throw pointless tantrums on Facebook and prop up injustice, such as killing infants for their blood-healing properties and murdering people for their organs. This book is 306 pages long, but it felt like reading 30,000 pages of meaningless detail in a story starring horrible people. It was so painful. I had to start skimming by page 169.The characters in this book all have very low I.Q.s and suffer from the most childish levels of self-imposed helplessness and narcissism. Even worse, every character in this book operates with such a pornified worldview that they might as well all be former porn addicts as well as high school dropouts and murderers. I spent the entire novel hoping that all of these people would die. Alas, that did not happen.This book felt extremely classist. Does Margaret Atwood hate poor people? Because it seriously felt that way to me. The story hates on the middle class in this book, and is certainly very scathing toward them, but the blows land even harder on the poor and the impoverished. The biggest plot feature of this book is that Margaret Atwood satirizes the for-profit prison system in the United States. Okay, fair enough. I am totally game for that. But she does this without ever acknowledging that this prison system largely targets black people and poor people. Since the current U.S. prison inmates are all the first people to be mindlessly slaughtered in this dystopian almost-future, I thought the least Margaret Atwood could do would be to point out the racism and classism involved in the white middle class slaughtering prison inmates for organ replacements. She didn't do this because she really wanted to show the reader that white suburbia *feels* like living in prison to all of the vacuous white people who inhabit those bland suburban homes. And I'm sorry, Margaret Atwood, but I can't laugh at your joke. As a girl who grew up in poverty and had to witness police violence and visit my dad numerous times behind bars, I can guarantee that the people in prison would trade life in the clink for life in a white, middle-class suburb in a goddamn heartbeat. And why must I read a book in which women are shown, over and over, to sexually enjoy -- to the point of orgasm -- their psychological debasement and physical abuse at the hands of men? The story certainly mocks Charmaine and Jocelyn and every other female character in this book, so I suppose that Margaret Atwood could be said to be mocking all pornified women. But not every woman in the U.S. is a complete victim of pornography. Not every woman in the U.S. possesses a pornified, misogynistic sexuality. I absolutely *hate* all of the sex in this book. And there is a lot of sex in this book. There are also sex dolls in this novel. Another topic I would enjoy reading as satire. But Margaret Atwood didn't utilize these dolls enough or even do her research that well. She relied on absurdity and slapstick comedy with these dolls, and it felt very lazy. I know more about sex dolls just by reading some BBC news articles over the past few years and reading Gail Dines. The sex doll representation in this novel was lacking and frustrating, nonsensical and bizarre. You might ask: what are the lessons and takeaways of this novel? Here's a list --1. Americans are brainless and ridiculous. 2. Nothing matters. Nothing.3. No one cares.4. It's a dog-eat-dog world, and everyone will f*ck you over the first chance they get, especially if they are poor people. Poor people will f*ck you over the fastest and the hardest. 5. There is nothing wrong with porn culture. It's normal and fine and we can all have a nice chuckle over it. Women like to be slapped around and controlled by men. Especially brainless white women. Ha, ha. Ha, ha.6. Now let's all go back to throwing pointless tantrums on Facebook because nothing matters, anyway. *****You would think, after reading this book, that there are no oppressive systems in America. No ableism, no racism, no classism. You would think that American people are just a bunch of fools who cause all of their own problems, and human nature really is full of Original Sin, base and selfish.I thought that satirizing the for-profit prison system in this novel would lead to some startling, insightful commentary. Or that showing *all* of the people in a novel with such a pornified worldview would lead to startling, insightful commentary about porn culture. And so on and so forth, with every plot point in this dystopian near-future.No, sadly, it did not.One star. Not recommended.Unless you really, really hate everyone. If you are a reader who hates the world entire, and you long to drop 50 million atomic bombs on the cesspool known as America and wipe us all off the map, then this is your read.

This book came**unmarked spoilers ahead**I fully expected to love the 2017 YA contemporary, ""At the Edge of the Universe,"" by Shaun David Hutchinson. This book came highly recommended to me, and a friend sent me her ARC (Advanced Reader's Copy) in December 2016, after enjoying a 5-star reading experience with this novel.Because I read the ARC, I will respect the publisher's wishes (Simon Pulse is an imprint of Simon & Schuster), and I will not quote from the unpublished text. My library does not own a copy of this book, so all I have available to me is the ARC.The story follows the senior year of a high school student named Ozzie. Ozzie is a white, physically able, affluent suburban teen boy. He is a highly unlikeable protagonist, a student who is deeply ungrateful and often cruel in his observations of everyone around him and life in general, but the prose in the beginning of the book is very well-written and engaging. I found myself drawn in and compelled by Ozzie's life.But it is also clear, right away, that Ozzie is having some kind of psychotic episode. He is suffering from some kind of mental illness or mental disorder that began before the novel begins. When the reader meets Ozzie, he is searching for his missing boyfriend, another high school student named Thomas. Ozzie embellishes his search with incoherent ramblings about his fear that the universe is shrinking -- and this theory of a shrinking universe frames the chapter headings as well as Ozzie's senior year. Ozzie is not only an unlikeable protagonist -- he is a highly unreliable narrator as well. In this case, he is unreliable due to some kind of psychotic state brought on by trauma. The trauma goes unnamed in the novel until the very end of the book.As a reader, this kind of writing makes me very anxious. It forces me to stay on the reader-version of high alert, watching every small detail so I can find the pattern of the narrator's psychosis. I also think it is very difficult to execute this type of storytelling, in which the story is centered on an unreliable narrator. Authors often fail to make sure the story details add up at the end. In my personal life, I grew up with people suffering from mental illness, mental disorders, and the type of dissociative psychotic state Ozzie seems to have throughout the length of this novel, a psychotic state that magically ends in the final few pages of the book.I wish this level of mental illness or mental disorder could simply ""magically end"" as Ozzie's does in this book. In the novel's final pages, Ozzie realizes that his ""missing"" boyfriend was never really missing at all. With the help of a crumpled page ripped out of his journal, which ""magically"" appears on the floor of his bedroom, Ozzie picks up the crumpled page from his diary, reads it, and suddenly remembers the truth. He remembers that his boyfriend broke up with him, and the pain of that rejection caused Ozzie to create an alternate reality for himself, in which all of his conversations, interactions, and life experiences were changed and manipulated by his mind to suit his mind's chosen version of reality: that Thomas never dumped him, but went ""missing"" instead.All of the events in this novel are, therefore, not reality. ""At the Edge of the Universe"" is similar to reading a book that ends with the words, ""It was all just a dream."" Except Ozzie wasn't dreaming. The author gave his main character some kind of psychotic, dissociative state triggered by the trauma of being dumped by his boyfriend, but the author never labels that mental illness or puts Ozzie's mental state into the real-life terms for what has just happened to him. The reader never learns what actually caused the mental breakdown that lasted for the duration of Ozzie's senior year.Instead, this unnamed psychosis is magically healed by reading a journal page, and Ozzie switches back to being the person he was before the novel begins: a boy with a neurotypical state of mental health.Rather than discuss Ozzie's mental health, the author chose to use the psychotic state as an avenue to discuss ""science fiction"" and entertain bizarre theories. Ozzie frequently rambles on about the possibility of a multi-verse with alternate realities people can fall into or out of at any given instant. He does this to explain the conflicts between his dissociative mental state and reality, as his mind struggles to reinterpret his reality to suit his chosen alternate reality that Thomas is missing and no one knows where he went. As I have stated, I grew up with people with severe mental illness. I understand that psychotic ramblings about alternate realities is a common feature of mental illness. What I have never seen before is a neurotypical person like Ozzie who suddenly suffers a psychotic breakdown at 17 or 18, out of nowhere, because he cannot handle the emotional pain of being dumped. The author chose to use this traumatized individual as a way to share Star Trek fandom theories about a shrinking universe and alternate realities, and then the author magically heals his main character at the end of the book, without discussing the real-world mental health situation featured in this novel at all.If this sounds like an appropriate use of fiction to you, then you might love this novel and have a great reading experience with this book. For me, this book completely dismissed how very real, and very frightening, a mental health breakdown can be. Someone who has gone an entire year in a psychotic, dissociative state is not magically healed in one moment of reading a crumpled page in their diary. Mental health isn't like science fiction, in which characters teleport into and out of psychotic states. To portray psychosis like that is extremely irresponsible. I've never seen someone ""snap out of"" a dissociative state. What I've experienced in real life is that this is often a mental disability, a constant feature of that person's life, and it is a daily struggle the individual must deal with, whether they take medication or not, and whether they receive counseling or not. I understand that mental disabilities are often treated as ""jokes"" -- in novels and in Hollywood movies. Authors and screenwriters often use disability as a plot point to entertain and mock the real world. I believe Shaun David Hutchinson wrote ""At the Edge of the Universe"" in a similar way. But Ozzie's alternate reality isn't science fiction to me. I grew up with someone like Ozzie. This isn't ""a thought experiment"" to me, but something very real, something that had devastating consequences to my entire family, and something my family still struggles to deal with, now that my siblings are all grown and we're adults.Ozzie has an older brother in this novel who joins the U.S. Army. Ozzie frequently states that his brother is ""stupid"" for wanting to join the Army, and that the whole idea of going off to learn how to ""kill"" people is ""stupid."" While in basic training, Ozzie's brother is kicked in the face by a hateful and angry training partner, which causes Ozzie's brother to fall, break his spine, and become paralyzed. This novel portrays soldiers and the U.S. Army in a very negative way. As someone who almost joined the U.S. Army right out of high school, every time the book called my choice to do this ""stupid,"" I felt it like a slap in the face. I am incredibly proud of the people who choose to serve in the military. I don't think anyone should be called ""stupid"" for joining the Army. I'm sorry that this author thinks so little of U.S. soldiers. Their portrayal in this book felt very hateful.Ozzie's brother remains paralyzed at the end of this book, but his paralysis is viewed as a gift. Now that Ozzie's brother can no longer walk, he is happier and more confident than he was as an able-bodied young man. He is thinking about going to college, and he finally has a girlfriend, his first girlfriend ever and the love of his life. In a period of a few weeks between his paralysis and the end of the book, Ozzie's brother has ""magically healed"" his emotional and psychological pain, in the same way Ozzie has been healed of his psychotic breakdown.As someone who read this book very carefully, in an anxious state of high-alert, I can state that the details between Ozzie's alternate reality and the explanation at the end of the book do not add up. The overall plot of this book is extremely sloppy. The ending might as well have said, ""It was all just a dream,"" for as much as the details added up and made sense.The biggest draw of this book is to read a YA novel with a gay main character. Ozzie's best friend is a transgender person named Lua, and Lua is described in a highly positive way. This book has a lot of wish-fulfillment LGBTQIA+ representation, and readers who want queer-positive stories will probably enjoy the wish fulfillment aspects of this novel a lot more than I did. Personally, I would call this book highly ableist, due to the plot's emphasis on Ozzie's mental state as an avenue to explore science fiction/Star Trek theories, and the ableist representation of Ozzie's disabled brother. I really wish I had loved this book. But I absolutely did not. I don't think I will pick up any other books by this author....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 05, 2018","Feb 19, 2018","Feb 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35297559-at-the-edge-of-the-universe

In an author's note titled ""On Writing in the Rain"" at the end of the book, Leslye Walton tells the reader, ""the secret to magical realism, or so I've been told, is to write in a way that your reader will believe the real as much as the magic, to weave the two worlds -- the mundane and the magic -- together seamlessly. I had a collection of peculiar characters -- a woman who turns herself into a canary, another who disappears into a pile of blue ash, a young girl born with wings -- and I needed to give them some historical context and a setting that was true to life. I needed to counter the weird, so to speak.""This novel is certainly full of ""the weird."" If you enjoy disjointed novels that strive to be generational sagas -- if you are hungering for a shorter, YA version of ""The Thorn Birds"" or ""The Shell Seekers,"" but would prefer a lot of pointless (and nonsensical) magical stuff on the page, a gratuitous rape-and-mutilation scene, followed by a scene of ""bad guy gets served eternal justice by some kind of otherworldly beings that come out of nowhere and return into nowhere"" that reminded me of the ending of that 1990 Demi Moore/Patrick Swayze movie, ""Ghost"" -- well then, this book is for you.""The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender"" is a trope fest. The ""born special"" trope and the ""not like other girls"" trope take center stage, along with many others. If you hunger for story tropes, this might be a great read. The protagonist of this book is a young teenage girl named Ava Lavender. Her birth is described in the Prologue (date of birth: March 1, 1944), and then the story goes further back in time, to the life of Ava's great-grandmother, circa 1900 or something. The first half of the book is the generational saga of the matriarchs of this family. Supposedly, Ava Lavender has collected all of this data about her ancestors' lives, but there is no way any of these personal details would have been communicated to Ava unless she had communed with their ghosts. Which is probably what happened. The story ends as if Ava Lavender commits suicide on the last page, so if you reread the novel with that in mind, then all of this personal information from her dead ancestors would be known via ghost conversation.But in the prose of the Prologue, Ava is addressing the reader in a letter dated ""March 2014,"" and she states that this novel is ""the story of my young life as I lived it. What started out as a simple personal research project as a young woman -- a weekend in 1974 spent at the Seattle Central Library compiling information about my birth -- led me down a road that took me from one coast to another. I have traveled through continents, languages, and time trying to understand all that I am and all that has made me such.""Which sounds exciting. But this novel features such a disjointed timeline, so much heavy-handed (and absolutely dull) exposition, and the magical details were so entirely pointless to the plot -- a plot which was simply a repeated tale of young teen girls falling in love with young teen boys and having their hearts repeatedly broken -- the combination was anything but exciting to me.By page 127, less than halfway into the book, I had to start skimming. I was too frustrated by the author's constant shifts into needless backstory, shifts that were focused on exposition starring pointless side characters -- I just couldn't force myself to keep reading this book. Also, this ""I have traveled through continents"" stuff is complete bullshit. Ava's great-grandmother was born in France, and after a brief description of her life there, the story shifts to the United States. Ava's great-grandmother moved to Manhattan in 1912 as a young woman with a husband and children. Her sole surviving daughter (Ava's grandmother) moved to Seattle, Washington, as a young woman with a husband and child on the way. The great bulk of this novel takes place in a single neighborhood in Seattle.If you think you're going to be reading a book about world travel and cultural immersion through non-English language, look elsewhere.If you think you're reading a tale about matriarchs and their daughters finding their strength and their agency in the face of a brutal, relentless patriarchy -- then please, for the love of good literature, pick up ""The Joy Luck Club"" instead. Or watch the 1993 film adaptation of that book. That movie is phenomenal.""The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender"" is not about women struggling with their agency because they must overcome cultural misogyny to find their self-worth. This is a book about girls who are unlucky in love becoming lucky in love. Ava's mother becomes lucky in love (spending the rest of her life with a handsome, spectacularly loving man named Gabe). If the reader has faith in the Prologue, and believes Ava does not commit suicide at the end of this book, then Ava also goes on in life (after her mutilation and rape) lucky in love with a wonderful man her own age named Rowe (who she meets as a young teen girl, at the same time she meets her rapist, a Christian/religious fanatic who rapes Ava because he wants to have sex with an angel). The novel structures itself as Ava's identity search by the Prologue's revelation that Ava was born with wings. Though the author claims this book is magical realism, the actual prose of this story states otherwise. As Ava tells the reader in the Prologue, ""Until then, no human being on record had ever been born with animal parts -- avian or otherwise."" Ava's bird wings at birth cause an uproar. ""When the religious masses gathered below my mother's hospital room window with their fevered prayers and flickering candles, for once the doctors considered the devout with jealousy, rather than with pity or disdain.""The world of this novel is NOT a world in which the fantastical is observed every day. The world of this book is the known historical world, a world in which a single human girl born with wings is marked by society as different and Other. Despite the fact Ava's impoverished ancestors did things no one ever actually witnessed (one turned into a canary, and one turned into a pile of blue ash) -- the observed ""magic"" of this book belongs solely to Ava's wings.Oh, and there is also magic observed near the very end of the book, after the young man who rapes Ava and cuts off her wings with an axe (a very non-magical incident that happens on page 260), is later ""engulfed"" in flames created by some kind of grotesque and magical beings in the middle of a random street in Seattle (page 266). ""Translucent and pale, they shimmered in the truck's headlights. Their eyes were opaque and blind; water poured over their monstrous gray skin. One figure cradled a baby over the place where her heart should have been. The other flashed from canary to girl, reaching out an arm in rage to grab at the man [who had just raped Ava less than an hour before]."" (page 265/266)""Viviane [Ava's mother] watched in terror as the translucent figures engulfed him. His screams, hoarse and inhuman, filled the night."" ""With a sudden flash, the street burst into flames. The heat scorched the glass of the windshield.""""And then, just as suddenly, the fire and its victim were gone, leaving only the heavy stench of singed skin."" (page 266)Maybe the two magical figures in this scene are meant to be the ghosts of Ava's great-grandmother and baby grand-aunt, ghosts who suddenly leave Ava's house to wander into the street and flame-kill Ava's rapist. I honestly have no f*cking idea what went on in this scene, and I think I've already spent far more brainpower thinking about it than the author spent writing it.If you think I might have missed the explanation of this scene due to my skim-reading, I would just like to state: I skimmed exposition scenes starring pointless side characters and all of the meaningless descriptions of food in this book. There is so much food description in this book, the novel honestly reads like the author cribbed entire passages and all of her story themes from the 1989 novel, ""Like Water for Chocolate."" Based on how much emphasis food has in this book, I think author Leslye Walton probably set out to write the YA version of ""Like Water for Chocolate,"" but then decided the star of this book would be a teen girl with wings marked by the story as Other, and everything got all confused and unbalanced and turned into this unwieldy hulk of a novel instead.""Like Water for Chocolate"" is authentic magical realism. It's not my favorite book, but it's interesting and worth a read. I cannot say the same for ""The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender.""The only thematic aftermath of the rape and mutilation appears months after the incident, when Ava finally comes home from the hospital. Having her wings hacked off with an axe almost killed her. As Ava tells the reader, ""The gauze hid my sutures well enough, so she [Ava's grandmother] didn't have to stare at the stitchery holding my frail body together. But the bruises would not be hidden. They seeped down my sides, across my arms and hips, down the backs of my legs. And the color -- so dark they weren't purple, but red. The very color of violence."" (page 279)I admit I hoped something would come of this description.But the very next paragraph put this novel into absolute rage-territory for me, and proved that this author plunged into the literary deep-end of content she had no business swimming in; she should have stayed in the kiddie pool with some arm floaties on.As so often happens in this book, Ava slips into another character's point of view to narrate her story. In this case, she shifts into her grandmother Emilienne's POV in order to deliver the thematic importance of her bruises and tie them into the overall plot of the book.(And before sharing this quote, I must first explain: Ava's mother, Viviane, fell in love with a cad named Jack. Their love story is described at length in the first third of the book. Emilienne also lost her brother (René) in a case of mistaken identity, after René was shot in the face by a man who thought René was the adulterer having sex with his wife.)And now here is the quote --""Those deep-red bruises called to mind the faint brown mark Jack's kiss had left on her daughter Viviane's neck so many years ago. They also made her think of René's lovely face after William Peyton shot it off, of the hole in Margaux's chest where her heart once beat, and of all the scars love's victims carry."" (page 280)That is how Ava's bruises from having her wings hacked off are labeled in this book: as one of the many ""scars love's victims carry.""Ava's bruises mark her as a victim of love.Which means I must now make this clear --Because the author apparently doesn't understand the truth about rape --Rape isn't driven by love.RAPE. ISN'T DRIVEN. BY LOVE.Rape is driven by a sense of power and entitlement. Rape is driven by a need for aggression and dominance. Rape is driven by a need for power and control.RAPE. ISN'T DRIVEN. BY LOVE.I may have only skimmed the final two-thirds of this book, but I slowed down and read carefully when the story stopped giving me food description and backstory and whimsy, and focused on its central themes. No one ever discusses what happened to Ava's rapist, who Viviane saw engulfed in flames before he disappeared, never to be seen or heard from again.Because, just like in the real world, rape makes people uncomfortable and polite society would rather not discuss rape or the roots of why people rape. It's easier for everyone if some magical ghosts just show up and deliver justice to rapists, so we don't have to examine why rape happens, and why innocent girls find themselves being attacked by rapists wielding axes, men who are hoping to murder their powerless rape victims. Let's call this a sad scar of love instead. A scar of love.For God f*cking sake. I just can't with this book.Author bell hooks writes often about the ""white supremacist capitalist patriarchy"" that dominates modern American culture. That is what I believe ""The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender"" is part of -- the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy that shows up so often in gangsta rap, Hollywood movies, and novels like this one. Here is a great essay published in 1994 by bell hooks -- I highly recommend you read this essay instead of this book --http://challengingmalesupremacy.org/w...I give negative stars to this book. I have nothing but an infinity of f-bombs and invective for any story that claims the bruises and violence of rape and axe-wielding, murderous assholes are ever motivated by love, or have any place being compared to or explained as ""scars made by love.""

As a fiction writer, this is a major problem for me, to say nothing of the impact of the situation on the general public.So I read ""Dream Hoarders: How the American Upper Middle Class Is Leaving Everyone Else in the Dust, Why That Is a Problem, and What To Do About It"" (2017) and then found myself reading ""The Sum of Small Things.""The data in both of these books is horrifying. Both books deal with the increasing lack of social mobility within the United States: what is causing it, and why. America's class system is becoming more and more rigid and fixed, as the upper-middle class keeps favoring legislation and racist/classist/legacy programs that benefit their own children at the expense of everyone else. In ""Democracy in America,"" published in 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, ""The surface of American society is covered with a layer of democratic paint, but from time to time one can see the old aristocratic colours breaking through."" ""The Sum of Small Things"" provides an extensive examination of the current ""power elite"" that inherited that ""old"" aristocracy -- and are now the upper-middle class in America. In these pages, the reader can learn more about what they spend their money on, the values they uphold, and the industries they control. It is an incredibly sobering book.The first three chapters are kind of a slog, and feature a lot of needless repetition that should have been culled. But the content is always excellent, even if the reading is a bit cumbersome.By Chapter 4, the repetitive, academic language takes a backseat, and the rest of the book reads like other mainstream nonfiction, with a prose style that keeps a good pace and continually provides fresh information.This book isn't focused on the publishing world, though I felt like I learned a LOT about the publishing world as a result of reading this book. ""The Sum of Small Things"" examines the worldview, behavior, and history of the modern upper-middle class of America, and I found plenty of information in this book (and in ""Dream Hoarders"") to help me understand the trends I have noticed in fiction publishing, especially as concerns two genres: Young Adult and upmarket/book club women's fiction.""The cultural elites (let alone the economic elite) in this country are so removed from the day-to-day hardships of the middle-and lower-income classes, that they may become unable to imagine (let alone solve) the pervasive problems of their poorer fellow citizens."" (page 190)Quotes like that one make this book extremely chilling -- and extremely useful -- to read. Cultural elites (and perhaps anyone making $112,000.00 or more in yearly income -- which is the figure marking the top fifth/20 percent of the country in 2014) who want to maintain a self-righteous position that America is a pure meritocracy, and that people have what they have because they have ""pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps,"" rather than benefiting from an economic and cultural system that continues to favor a white colonialist power structure, would do well to stay far away from this book. The information and data charts in ""The Sum of Small Things"" will simply enrage you and make you defensive.For my part, I don't care where the truth leads me, or how personally damning the data is, I just want access to the truth. In truth, I now know that economically, I am very close to being part of the elite power class in America, a class that is increasingly segregated and discriminatory toward everyone underneath it. Financially, I don't qualify as a member of the upper-middle class, but by virtue of being a white, liberal, college graduate, I certainly belong to this aspirational class.For anyone who hungers for truth, I highly recommend this book. For anyone involved in a career that requires a high amount of creativity and innovation, I highly recommend this book. And for anyone who is an aspiring author, with high hopes of getting a literary agent one day, I think you would do well to read this book to understand the class that is in charge of publishing, as well as the class that has the discretionary money to shop in bookstores. (As in: you would do well to understand the worldview of the book-buyers as well as the producers of books.) The current trends in bookselling (and the work of literary agents and marketing teams) are a direct reflection of the disturbing data shared in this book.Five full stars....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 29, 2018","Feb 05, 2018","Jan 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32889395-the-sum-of-small-things

Structurally, this book was a mess, with a central plotline that was overrun with so many sub-plots that this novel felt like reading an ""everything PLUS the kitchen sink"" manual. The sub-plots were all as unsatisfactorily tied up with a Happily Ever After bow at the end as the main romance plot.Despite the disorganization, there were charming things about this book. The main character, a beautiful blonde teenager named Bailey, has moved across country to spend the summer before her senior year living with her father. The father lives in a fictionalized version of Santa Cruz, California. In the novel, the town is called Coronado Cove. Bailey quickly meets a super hot surfer boy named Porter Roth, and the romantic hate-to-love trope is the main event for the first third of this novel. The trope is clumsily handled, and felt very forced; the two romantic leads quickly stop ""hating"" each other and spend the rest of the novel engaged in dating drama as a couple. Despite the clumsy trope execution, there is some wonderful wish fulfillment in ""Alex, Approximately."" I loved the setting of Santa Cruz for this novel, and I thought the author did a great job bringing this fictional Santa Cruz/Coronado Cove to life. I also loved the vacation rental house Bailey lives in, the gorgeous vintage scooter she drives around town, and the classic surfer van Porter drives. Other wish fulfillment highlights include Bailey's super-sweet and attentive father, and how Bailey does her hair up to look like iconic film-legend Lana Turner's various updo's every day. Porter Roth is the most ripped and amazing surfer boy to ever stroll down a boardwalk, and I *really* loved the fact that he takes Bailey on a date to Monterey (one hour south of Santa Cruz/fictional Coronado Cove) and they chat for a hot moment about the work of John Steinbeck. I wish I could 5-star this book just for that one-page mention of John Steinbeck, Cannery Row, and the fact that Porter Roth loves discussing marine science, natural history, and weather patterns as much as he loves to surf.But I would have to ignore the many flaws of this book to 5-star it for a John Steinbeck and Cannery Row mention, however much that thrilled me to see in a YA novel. This story features the most random action sequences I've read in a long time -- violence that comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere, and exists for the sole purpose of making this love story ""more exciting."" At one point, Bailey and Porter are held at gunpoint in a store robbery. The novel demonizes drug addicts as violent criminals to a startling and very awful degree. The most annoying thing about this book is the fact that Bailey has the thinking capacity of a lump of tofu. The last quarter of this novel made me wish another random act of violence would occur, and she might die from a stray bullet so someone with a functioning cerebral cortex could show up in the story and date Porter.""Alex, Approximately"" was marketed and sold to a publishing house as ""a YA retelling of the 1998 film 'You've Got Mail'"" starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. I saw that film once, around the time it came out, and I pray I never have to see it again, even though I love writer/director Nora Ephron and it hurts me that I thought this movie of hers was sappy, flat, and as satisfying to watch as eating a lump of cold tofu. This novel is nowhere near as coherent or as intelligent as ""You've Got Mail."" The ending is just as saccharine, and the overall book is just as flat, but if you believe you're going to read a lot of witty banter between the online and IRL/in-real-life romantic leads, as happens in the film, then you will be highly disappointed. Most of ""Alex, Approximately"" focuses on the IRL coupledom of Bailey and Porter. The main plot of figuring out ""who is Bailey's online friend Alex in real life?"" is dropped pretty quickly, and the story focuses on a lot of random tangents and side characters instead. When Bailey finally learns of Porter's online alias at the very end of the book, I thought, ""wow, I haven't encountered a main character this brainless in a long time... or maybe ever."" If you enjoy *really* clueless, and really naïve, female protagonists, then this novel will be an enjoyable reading experience.The plot of this book is a one-star mess. The wish fulfillment aspects of spending a summer in Santa Cruz dating a hot surfer boy are worth five full stars. But the negative aspects of this novel are too egregious to be ignored. Bailey becomes insufferable by the end of this novel, and her characterization, along with the constant tangents (including the biggest tangent of all in the final pages), became painful to read. I wish I could give this book 3 stars for its excellent choices of wish-fulfillment and story setting. But the ending left too bad a taste in my mouth for anything more than 2 stars. Recommended for anyone who loves YA romantic contemporaries, and wants to read about two teenagers involved in a relationship full of bizarre drama.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 03, 2018","May 06, 2018","Jan 28, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34927042-alex-approximately

I thought that Sari Wilson's 2016 literary novel, ""Girl Through Glass,"" would deliver both in spades. I expected to read the literary version of one of my favorite movies: the 2003 Robert Altman indie film/almost-docu-drama, ""The Company,"" about an aspiring ballerina performing with the renowned Joffrey Ballet in Chicago.That film was based on a large amount of documentary research about the lived experiences of modern ballet dancers, and I love the screenplay and the framing of each scene. I love that movie so much. Also important to note: the stage itself is a character in the story. The scratched, dirty surface of the stage, the backstage the dancers move through, the industrial metal structures holding the lights up, the heat and glare of the lights, the threat of lightning and rain hitting the stage when it is located outside. It's thrilling to watch the structure itself come to life in a film, and have the full respect of the audience and everyone else in the movie. The novel ""Girl Through Glass"" isn't really focused on the world of ballet, and after 38 pages, that fact is so clear to me that I must DNF.While I do love literary prose, the writing in this book didn't satisfy me enough to overcome my dashed content hopes. The prose style in ""Girl Through Glass"" reminded me a lot of Amanda Coplin's prose in her 2012 novel, ""The Orchardist."" I would characterize her sentences as stolid and staid. That writing style works for a great many readers, but I just need more pizazz and poetry to stay interested. There is a fine line between poetic impression and inference, and communicating the hard facts of a story. Sari Wilson's prose achieves poetic impression by scene cutaway and withholding information from the reader -- which is fine, a lot of books I love also do that -- but Ms. Wilson doesn't write with the level of pyrotechnic language-fireworks that I've come to expect from elliptical timelines. I'm afraid other authors have spoiled me for life, and I just can't ship this heavier, unemotional style of writers like Amanda Coplin and Sari Wilson.The content of ""Girl Through Glass"" is mostly focused on the main character, Mira (which is the main character's name as a child in the 1970s) and Kate (which is the main character's name as an adult decades later), experiencing and surviving being raped as a child by a ballet aficionado, a man named Maurice. When 11-year-old Mira first meets Maurice, he is a 47-year-old man ""stricken with polio."" Another Goodreads er summarized the plot of Mira and Maurice in ""Girl Through Glass"" this way: ""He eventually rapes her, she becomes pregnant and gives the baby up for adoption, and later in her 40s her son finds her and they establish a relationship.""Another Goodreads er described Maurice as ""a creepy old man.""If author Sari Wilson is writing about an experience she actually had as a child in ballet school, then I truly apologize for DNF'ing this book. I don't know if this is memoir-ish fiction or not, but if it were billed as a memoir about surviving pedophilia and rape, set within the far-less-important competitive and callous world of ballet, my content expectations would not have clashed with this book.Had I known that this novel was focused on pedophilia and the trauma and aftermath of being raped as a child, I would have preferred to reread Alison Espach's stunning debut novel, ""The Adults."" The characters in that book are much more bold and compelling, and the prose style in that novel features the language-pyrotechnics I crave.The two narratives of ""Girl Through Glass"" (child-Mira's and adult-Kate's) are both sad and gray. In content and tone, every page I read of this book was washed in a cumbersome shade of pewter. I'm not opposed to this style, or the content of this novel. It's just completely at odds with what I thought I'd signed up for.In the movie ""The Company,"" the grimdark world of ballet is juxtaposed at all times with its glorious (false) veil of color and beauty. The film's audience sees the bright costumes and movement that the privileged ticket-holders consume, and then bears witness to the cruelties and purse-strings behind all those fluttering bodies. In ""Girl Through Glass,"" the first 38 pages featured no strident colors or electrified bodies. Everything is grimdark and sad. The story takes pains to elaborate on themes of ruination and failed struggle. The gray tone of the prose is as dull as the voices of Mira and Kate. Reading these pages, I felt like I was sitting in front of a windowpane on a drizzling day, trapped inside and staring at a colorless sky.Though I did not finish this book, and did not meet Maurice on the page, I must also say that it makes me deeply uncomfortable that the pedophile rapist in this book has polio. Using physical disability, disease, and deformity as an attribute of a malevolent character is a common feature of literary ableism, and I confess that learning about Maurice's condition in other Goodreads s made me far more certain I should stop reading this book.I would give ""Girl Through Glass"" a one-star rating for following such a terrible ableist trope, but if author Sari Wilson really was raped as a child by an adult man with polio, then my discomfort with the ableism in Maurice's character is highly unfair.I'm going to leave this  unrated, since my biggest problem with this book is simply that it failed to live up to my expectations. Punishing the book with a one-star  for that reason feels profoundly unfair. But I would like to add this final note: if author Sari Wilson simply added polio to Maurice to make him more menacing, creepy, and gross, thereby using physical disability and disease as a shorthand for ""moral bankruptcy,"" then I would like to state that this kind of writing is ableist af and authors need to STOP. DOING. THIS. Because that kind of ableist trope is far more morally bankrupt than anyone surviving polio will ever be. The United States elected FDR President, for f*ck sake. Noble, amazing, wonderful people survive diseases. No one is less intrinsically good or possesses less moral integrity simply because they are less physically able. So please, authors of the world: for the love of all that is holy, knock this sh*t off....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 27, 2018","Feb 03, 2018","Jan 11, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25817032-girl-through-glass

Because I feel like this book saved my life.I needed the words in this book. All my life, I've needed the words in this book. And now I have them.

This book is a triumph of justice and reason. This book is America at its best. Unfortunately, I am not as hopeful as the author is, concerning the future of the United States. I would agree more with economist Angus Deaton, who is quoted near the end of the book --""Commenting on the 'grotesque expansions in inequality of the past 30 years,' Princeton economist Angus Deaton makes a pessimistic prediction: 'Those who are doing well will organize to protect what they have, including in ways that benefit them at the expense of the majority.'"" (page 152)Author Richard V. Reeves shares a concise list of steps the upper middle class can take to make the United States a more equitable place -- a place that is fair and impartial, and rewards people based on merit rather than whether or not they are lucky enough to be born to affluent parents.These steps are straightforward and achievable, and would simply come down to a question of political will. Personally, I don't believe there is any political will to complete these steps. But that doesn't stop me from wanting to scream, ""I LOVE THIS BOOK I LOVE THIS BOOK!!""

Dhoni**unmarked spoilers ahead**The 2018 YA fantasy, ""The Belles,"" by Dhonielle Clayton, is one of the most-hyped and ARC-ed books of the year. Dhonielle Clayton is a cofounder of CAKE Literary (a company that features diverse books) and she is COO of the nonprofit We Need Diverse Books. She is a beautiful young black woman who grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. (""on the Maryland side,"" she specifies in her author bio) and she has said in author interviews that she wants to be ""the Beyoncé"" of YA fiction.Before I begin my , I just want to say: I ship ALL of that. Yes, we need diverse books. Yes, we need novels that feature black women prominently on the covers, as this one does. Yes, Beyoncé is awesome and I'm glad Dhonielle Clayton loves her so much. And yes, we need books that tackle the topic of ""ideal beauty types"" and what that does to the psyches of young women and girls.But I did not enjoy reading ""The Belles."" While this novel seems to have everything I would love in a YA novel, I look at this cover now, and I just feel revulsion.So what the f*ck happened? I'll start with the premise. Anyone paying attention to modern American culture (the culture Dhonielle Clayton grew up in, and which she states in her ""Dear Reader"" note at the end of this novel inspired this story) -- we all know that modern American culture is informed by, and dominated by, a power structure bell hooks pointedly calls ""the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy."" When modern Americans see picture after picture of a blonde, blue-eyed, slender, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, cisgender, upper-middle-class, heavily-made-up and air-brushed young woman portrayed in mainstream media as ""the ideal body type"" of beauty, we understand that the power structure of white colonialism is still with us. We also know that capitalism, with its continuous drive to sell people more useless sh*t that they probably don't need, creates a constant stream of advertising that tells people they must attain a certain ""look"" to achieve happiness. We know that this ""look"" is actually attained by our genetics, but the dieting industry, makeup industry, hair product industry, and fashion industry is constantly cranking out ads full of messaging that says otherwise. And we know that patriarchy, as a force, strips women of power and gives power to men. We know that women compete with each other for male attention because there is significant economic power and status behind attracting a wealthy, powerful male mate. Author Dhonielle Clayton has stated in interviews that her world-building for ""The Belles"" was to strip her fantasy world of white colonialism, thereby disrupting the idea that ""the white body"" was the ideal version of beauty.She also chose to disrupt ""the patriarchy"" by having her fantasy world ruled by a matriarchy.And rather than capitalism being the driving force of this fantasy world, the kingdom of Orléans in ""The Belles"" is an aristocracy ruled by a monarchy. There is a Minister of Beauty in this monarchy who writes Beauty Laws all the people must follow. You might assume, as I did, that the world of ""The Belles"" is vastly different from the modern American world.Except no. It isn't. This matriarchal, non-colonialist aristocratic monarchy reads just like modern America. Well, a mix of modern America and ""Game of Thrones,"" to be honest. Instead of the torture-loving, sadistic Prince Joffrey in ""Game of Thrones,"" ""The Belles"" features a torture-loving, sadistic Princess Sophia. Princess Sophia wants to be Queen, and she physically abuses people, poisons people, and tortures them to death in front of her court. It should come as no surprise that Princess Sophia is capable of killing her own mother and older sister in order to become Queen. She wants to rule over the cesspit of nonsense that is the Kingdom of Orléans. I can hear people saying, ""But this book is so feminist! Because it shows that women are just as vicious as men!"" Look, I really don't need this ""lesson."" Most Disney villains are white women. Evil women are a standard of storytelling, and no good misogynist tale can exist without an evil white woman. Even ""Game of Thrones"" has Cersei Lannister, who outlives her sadistic son Joffrey. The patriarchy is more than happy to ship female evil-doers as the source of Betrayal and Great Sin in this world. I can point at the story of Adam and Eve as proof positive that women are CONSTANTLY held up as the nastiest of the nasty in this world, from ye olden times of prehistory to today. Meanwhile, over 90% of serial killers in America are white men (according to the FBI). Almost all mass shooters in America are white men (according to the FBI). White men hold the majority of the positions of power in the United States -- chiefs of police, members of Congress (state and national), lobbyists, CEOs of multinational corporations, etc. etc.But we love to show how nasty women are, don't we? From the Bible to Hollywood movies to YA fiction, oh boy do we love to revel in the vile, traitorous cesspool that is the female body. That's what ""The Belles"" is all about. It's all about how nasty women are. How they compete with each other, how they tear each other down, how they live to betray one another and treat everyone like sh*t -- because, as the old story goes: a woman can have love, or she can have power, but she can't have both.""The Belles"" says as much on page 50:""Don't be fools. You can't have both. Who wants love when one can be powerful?"" Amber says.Oh boy do we love to hate on the vagina, the vulva, the clitoris, and all of the child-bearing anatomy that goes with a womb. If you love books that hold up women as vicious, disgusting creatures who will do anything for power, because a woman always has to choose between Beauty or Strength, between Love or Power -- then you will most likely love ""The Belles.""The Kingdom of Orléans is much like the world of the Capitol in ""The Hunger Games"" -- which is most often described as ""a tyrannical dictatorship, led by President Snow (before his death), and holds total political and economic dominance over Panem, enforcing its rule through an army of Peacekeepers, capital punishment, propaganda, and the fear of nuclear devastation.""Dhonielle Clayton took note. Except in Orléans, there is no political dominance, no Peacekeepers, and no threat of nuclear weaponry. This world is a mix of magic, like the Harry Potter-verse, and some kind of undefined high tech (e.g. blimps that project digital imagery in the sky), but no one has cell phones, there is no Wi-Fi, and overall the world feels like the typical European medieval setting popular in most YA fantasy.When I compare Orléans to the Capitol, I focus most on the images in the first book and movie of ""The Hunger Games,"" which portrays a bunch of affluent assholes who are obsessed with status, appearance, and celebrity culture. They wear ridiculous clothing, have even more ridiculous makeup and hairstyles, and they behave in ridiculous ways. They are hated by every District they control, and they enjoy watching children kill children for fun.THAT is the world of ""The Belles."" In the opening pages, the main character, a 16-year-old girl named Camellia Beauregard, tortures an unwilling 7-year-old girl in front of a large, cheering crowd. Camellia and her five Belle sisters are gifted with a magical power called ""arcana,"" and the arcana can transform the human body into any shape and any color the wielder of the arcana imagines in her mind. Just imagine what kind of sh*tshow you'd be reading about if those foppish assholes in the Capitol of ""The Hunger Games"" had a power like this. To transform a person with arcana involves breaking bones, stretching the body, changing blood vessels and skin structure, etc, etc. -- and it is extremely painful. So painful, people can die from the process.Camellia spends the book torturing people to make them ""beautiful"" -- and she does so with no thought as to whether she should even be doing this or not. She never wonders whether torturing unwilling people is wrong. Not only does she transform the unwilling child in the opening pages, but an unwilling five-year-old girl is her first assignment as an official Belle of the kingdom. She even tortures to death a grown woman who tried to help her, and while this scene goes down as the much-hated ""Kill Your Gays"" trope in the book, it was so vile to read, the fact that this tortured woman was attracted to other women was the least of my problems. My biggest problem with this book was the fact that NO ONE in this book was a good person, and the main character was as villainous as the main villain. Camellia is an egotistical narcissist, she is completely incurious about the world she lives in, and she is in no way comparable to Katniss Everdeen. Camellia cares only about herself, her ambition, and her desire for celebrity status, fame, and power. Camellia reads as a selfish teenager raised in the Hunger Games Capitol, a girl who drank every drop of the Capitol's kool-aid. In ""The Belles,"" Camellia makes one bad decision after another. Her cluelessness is so profound, she has to be physically harmed before she realizes there is something even a little bit wrong with the kingdom she lives in. I can't enjoy a book with a main character who is this foolish and this cruel, and is still held up as The Hero of the story. No f*cking way. If a character talks like a villain, and acts like a villain, then the story ought to hold that character up as a villain. Does Camellia save herself at the end? No, a man rescues her. Out of nowhere. Because the author keeps insisting that Camellia is The Hero and Morally Good because she was Born Beautiful and Born Special, so a man has to save her, because reasons. Look, I understand the Cult of Beauty in the real world, and I understand girl-on-girl hate in the real world as well. Girls *do* compete for the attentions of men, and there are real prizes to be ""won"" for earning the gaze (and marriage proposal) of a chosen man. But ""The Belles"" took away the male gaze, and the economic survival strategy of beauty, and replaced it with ""women are just competing for the gaze of other women, and there is no other prize to be won than to be seen as beautiful by other women."" Why? Why did the author make this substitution? Because women are evil and vile, for the sake of nothing more than being evil and vile.(Oh, goody! It's just like reading Genesis! Except with magic and high-tech blimps instead of the Garden of Eden! I bet the sequel to ""The Belles"" will make sure to remind me why women suffer physical pain during childbirth -- I love these lessons about how bad women are! So awesome. Thank you, Western culture, for hating on my vagina so much! It's truly been a joy growing up female in this world.)And even though Dhonielle Clayton removed all history of white colonialism from her fantasy kingdom of Orléans, the book still overwhelming reads as white supremacist. The main character has ""golden brown"" skin and ""russet"" hair, which frequently codes as white. (For example, the white love interest in the popular YA fantasy ""Caraval"" also had ""golden brown"" skin. Julian was very much a white man in that book. ""Golden brown"" skin color codes heavily as white in YA books.) A large majority of the characters in ""The Belles"" have white skin, from the palace attendants, to the other Belles, to the mothers of the Belles, to the moneyed elite. Black skin is rarely mentioned in this book. I didn't count the number of times white skin came up as the primary descriptor in this book -- but if any er does a thorough, methodical count of skin color in this book, the count will skew heavily white.And the world of ""The Belles"" is still a fat-shaming world that prioritizes the slender body as the ideal form of beauty. Overeating is tied to fatness in this story, and characters talk about having a Belle slim them down in order to indulge their appetites and still be beautiful.In her ""Dear Reader"" note at the end of this book, Dhonielle Clayton states:""As uncomfortable as it might be, I hope this book pushes us to talk about the commodification of women's body parts and the media messages we send young people about the value of their exterior selves, what is considered beautiful, and the forces causing those things to shift into disgusting shapes.""How can we have that conversation, when this book removed all of the ""forces"" that have not only led to the creation of ""an ideal body type,"" but continue to dominate the landscape of beauty? This book doesn't teach girls and young women to analyze the ""white supremacist capitalist patriarchy"" that continues to dish up a mainstream media overflowing with misogyny.This book just teaches the same misogynist messages that the patriarchy is more than happy to spew: women are inherently backstabbing and malicious, and girls are easily swayed by celebrity culture and advertising that teaches females to hate themselves if they weren't ""born beautiful"" with the ""ideal body type"" of the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy. This novel is highly praised for its ""outstanding prose"" and ""great writing,"" but this book is overloaded with unnecessary setting details that dramatically slowed the pacing. There are useless food descriptions on every page, as well as frivolous details about dresses every five seconds, constant mention of jewels and perfume scents, unneeded descriptions of what the furniture and wallpaper looks like in every room Camellia enters, etc. etc. The Belles wear their hair in ""Belle-buns,"" and I got so tired of reading this word, I was ready to stab my eyes out.The word ""sweat"" also becomes overused in the story, and starts appearing on every page or every other page. Characters' brows and lips ""bead with sweat"" or Camellia becomes ""soaked with sweat,"" or someone is dabbing at sweat, or Camellia ""feels"" sweat. It was obnoxious to read, but those freaking ""Belle-buns"" and the incessant paragraphs of dessert foods, jewels, and perfume were MUCH more obnoxious than all of the repetitive sweating. Of the 434 pages of this novel, the pacing was SO slow that I gave up reading this book on page 154. I skipped the next 200 pages altogether, and picked up reading again on page 356, at Chapter 43. I hate that I even read the end of this book. I should have just DNF'd after the first two chapters. What is the point of having 434 pages of text if your reader can skip half of them and miss nothing? That is not my definition of strong prose, but the opposite.The story begins with a bit of religious text from this fantasy kingdom, stating that the people of Orléans have been ""cursed"" by a god with ugliness. They are born with gray skin, red eyes, ""hair the texture of rotten straw,"" and with ""a deep sadness that quickly turned to madness."" The Belles are a gift from a goddess to this world, ""to bring beauty back to the damned world, as the sun brings light."" (text appears before page 1)I just want to state, for the record, that linking physical beauty/outward appearance with mental health and spiritual worth is THE VERY DEFINITION OF ABLEISM. The entire world of ""The Belles"" is built upon a foundation of ableism. And no, it is never called out or labeled ANYWHERE in this book.Sure, there will be a sequel, and ableism might come up in the next book.But I would assume that ableism is one of the big driving ""forces"" of ""ideal beauty"" that the author was hoping this book would lead her readers to talk about. But how can anyone talk about it if it's not even named on the page? Camellia isn't aware of ableism, or her horrid levels of ableism in everything she thinks and does. So how the hell is the *reader* supposed to magically be aware of these things? I honestly found the 7-year-old girl's ""ugly"" body in Chapter 2 to be the most beautiful part of this book. Camellia names this girl Holly, and in her natural state, she is a fearsome and wondrous sight. As a Gris (a cursed person with gray skin and red eyes), I thought she was the most beautiful person in this book:""Her hair and skin are as gray as a stormy sky, and wizened like a raisin. Red eyes stare back at me like embers burning in the dark."" (page 12)Holly is adamant that she doesn't want to be changed, and she tells Camellia that she doesn't ""care"" about ""being beautiful."" (page 14)Camellia changes her anyway, and never wonders whether she should have. The story never questions whether the Gris might be beautiful in their natural state, and I thought this was a massive flaw in the plot of this book. An author can't assume that the ""payoff"" for a scene like this can come in Book 2 or 3 of a series. Your reader might not read Book 2 or 3. There needs to be some payoff in Book 1. But there is no payoff for this scene in ""The Belles."" Camellia simply learns that Princess Sophia is a torture-loving asshole, and when Princess Sophia attempts to imprison Camellia in the palace dungeons, a big, strong warrior named Rémy saves Camellia and smuggles her out of the palace. I bought a copy of ""The Belles"" expecting to love it. I expected to fall in love with a story penned by an author who champions diverse books.What I found was a book that hates women, and writing that needed a much stronger editor to cull the useless description and give this story a plot. If anyone wants to discuss the intersections of pain, beauty, and misogyny, I would recommend watching the 2008 period drama, ""The Duchess,"" about the real life of the Duchess of Devonshire (played by Keira Knightley), or the 2006 period drama, ""Marie Antionette,"" directed by Sofia Coppola (starring Kirsten Dunst) instead of reading ""The Belles."" Both of those films tackle the issues ""The Belles"" strove to confront, but the movies do not disregard the real world, or the very real economic and cultural forces that drive our conception of ""ideal beauty,"" and why having ""ideal beauty"" matters so much.Sadly, I give ""The Belles"" one star. It's not worth the hype....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Feb 23, 2018","Feb 25, 2018","Jan 09, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23197837-the-belles

I found nothing thrilling about this novel, and I think ""TwiThe 2017 YA fantasy, ""Warcross,"" is advertised on the book jacket as a ""sci-fi thriller."" I found nothing thrilling about this novel, and I think ""Twilight"" might have more scientific information than this book.The story centers on a virtual reality game called Warcross that has ""five hundred and twenty million"" viewers for the opening ceremony (page 24). The game ""is officially the biggest event in the world"" (page 24), and the reader is told that ""everyone -- *everyone* -- played Warcross"" (page 32). Well, everyone except all the people who can't afford the VR glasses people put on in order to enter the world of the game. Or people who have to do pesky activities like work a job or care for children instead of zoning out in a virtual reality. People like me, who just don't have any attraction to playing video games, don't even exist in this story. While people are playing Warcross, in real life, they sit on their butts while their able-bodied, immortal, super-powered avatars run around in the Warcross VR game world completing stunts and chasing after glittering gems in team competitions. The main character, an 18-year-old girl named Emika Chen, types on a computer keyboard while she plays, because she is always ""running hacks,"" ""hacking,"" and ""typing code,"" in order to steal VR objects from other players and keep her identity secret. Everything about the book's premise bothered me so much, I found myself complaining about this story a lot. ""Where is the logic in ANY of this??"" I kept shouting. Sure, I understand people play games like Candy Crush, become gambling addicts, would rather ""escape"" into a fantasy world, etc. etc. But this Warcross game just seemed boring af, and I couldn't see why in the hell so many millions of people would sit around WATCHING people SIT on their butts to play this game unless the game itself was addictive. My sister overhead one of these rants, and said, ""This book sounds like that episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation called 'The Game.' The episode with Ashley Judd."" We watched the episode together, and not only was my sister absolutely correct, but I think watching that episode from Season 5 is far more exciting than reading this book.The novel is a mash-up of Cinderella and a non-lethal version of The Hunger Games, since the avatars in the VR world of Warcross do not have a real-world impact on the bodies of the players. A lot of fans of this novel loved that one of the players uses a wheelchair in real life. But this player's disability is completely erased in the VR world, and since most of his scenes involve his able-bodied avatar, I just don't see why this book qualifies as ""great representation"" of a disabled character. It's more like a ""disability that was never there"" story trope which is annoying and ableist, not great representation. In one of the rare scenes in the book in which this character (Asher) is using his wheelchair, he is using it like a battering ram. Emika tells the reader, ""The morning of our first official game begins with Asher ramming his wheelchair repeatedly against my door."" (page 205) This is not the only time Asher does this. Later, Emika states, ""On Friday morning, the familiar sound of Asher ramming his wheelchair into my door stirs me out of my restless sleep in my dorm room."" (page 274)Lines like that lead me to believe that author Marie Lu has never known anyone with a permanent disability. Personalized wheelchairs are expensive; fixing them because you were ramming them into doors is also expensive. No one would ram their Mac notebook against a door repeatedly to wake someone up, and wheelchairs are often far more expensive than laptops. Being disabled also doesn't mean you automatically act like a toddler throwing a tantrum, which is all that comes to mind when I try to picture an adult repeatedly ramming their wheelchair into a door to wake people up. It makes me feel ill that anyone would point to Asher as ""great representation"" of physical disability in fiction. If this is great representation, then excuse me while I mentally vomit in disgust, because I really just can't with this nonsense. My biggest problem with this book, however, was with the main character, Emika Chen. Emika is a bully, and I found her behavior reprehensible. In high school, Emika witnessed a girl named Annie being bullied. Emika did nothing. Then a nude photo of Annie goes viral through the school, and Emika decides ""to hit back,"" to ""hit fast and hard and furious"" (page 73/74). Emika breaks into the phones and computers of everyone who shared the nude picture of Annie, as well as all of the phones and computers of the parents of the students who shared the photo. Emika downloads all of their personal data -- ""credit card data, Social Security numbers, phone numbers, all the hateful emails and texts they'd sent anonymously to Annie, and, of course, most incriminating, their private photos."" Then Emika ""posted all of it online"" (page 73). This had nothing to do with helping Annie, and everything to do with Emika wanting to prove to all of the bullies at school that she was actually a bigger, better bully than everyone else. Emika stands aside while the police arrest Annie for her crime. Emika has ""the memory of sirens"" and ""walking into the principal's office where the cops were gathered,"" and seeing ""Annie's cuffed wrists, her tear-streaked face looking up at me in shock"" (page 171). Emika's moment of ""kindness"" (if you can even call it that) comes when she confesses to the police that she hacked all of that personal data, not Annie, and turns herself in for the crime of posting all of that personal information online (page 171). I find this entire situation massively horrifying. Emika wanted to stroke her own ego, prove to everyone at her school that she was the most dominant bully, and ended up compounding a victim's trauma as a result. Emika wasn't Annie's friend, and Emika didn't stand in solidarity with Annie at all -- Emika just used Annie, the same way everyone else at school was already using her. Look, I understand that Donald Trump is the current President of the United States because people love displays of dominance, aggression, and inflicting power over ""lesser"" people. I understand that Emika Chen is displaying all of the characteristics of aggression and dominance by out-bullying all of the bullies at her school. I don't admire or condone this behavior, and I certainly don't find Emika in any way likeable just because the story holds up this behavior as magnanimous and worthy of love.Turning yourself in for a crime YOU committed because the police arrested an innocent victim instead does *not* make you noble. Yet the love interest in this novel is won over by Emika's heartless personality in large part because he learns that she turned herself in, rather than let Annie go to prison instead (page 171).What. In the Actual. F*ck.I read to the end of the book. None of the plot twists surprised me. Part of this was just because trope-fest stories like this one are super predictable to begin with, and part of this was just because there weren't enough characters in the story to lead the reader anywhere else. Of course the reveals were these reveals. The end of the book introduced rationality back into the story, but it was way too little, way too late. This is a novel that invites skimming. Since nothing is at stake during the VR gaming scenes, I found them incredibly boring and just skimmed or skipped them. Jumping off buildings, throwing dynamite sticks, and riding dragons has no thrill and no urgency when people are sitting in a room, safe from all harm. If you crave access to a billionaire lifestyle and worldwide celebrity, this book will probably be a lot of fun, because Emika becomes globally famous and lives a very plush lifestyle for most of this book. Recommended for lovers of fairy tales, Cinderella romance, and stories that contain little to no science in them....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jan 05, 2018","Jan 25, 2018","Jan 05, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29385546-warcross

I've wanted to read this book since it hit bookstore shelves.I was surprised by how little I actually enjoyed this book, and the problem seems to be that the book's intended audience is all over the place. On one hand, Mary Karr is hyper-aware she is being read by masterful authors like George Saunders, Don DeLillo, Richard Ford, Toni Morrison, etc. etc. etc. A large chunk of this book -- the middle third, especially -- seems to have been written for literary masters to read.Since I'm no literary master, the middle third of the book let me down. That middle third turned this craft book on writing into something I could never push on other people to read. Most of us are not the literary elite, and I personally do not orbit circles amongst the literary elite. My friends are far more humble than that. The aspiring memoirists I know are people who barely read one book a year -- and I mean commercial fiction here, not even the literary work of the masters. The aspiring memoirists I know sure as hell aren't reading Don DeLillo. And if they pick up Toni Morrison, they get angry and yell about how obscure and difficult her prose is. What I'm saying is, modern scribblers come in all types. As much as I love literary fiction, it has the smallest readership of any genre, and I have plenty of lived experience interacting with other writers to know just how small that readership is.The middle third of this book would make little to no sense to the aspiring memoirists I know in real life. The first third of the book is also written for insiders -- for MFA students and graduates of MFA programs. Mary Karr's prose in the first third would make sense to people who follow the publishing industry and are seriously committed to publishing the next ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" ""Wild,"" ""The Glass Castle,"" etc. etc. But to the aspiring memoirists I know in real life, who do not even read other memoirs (if they read books at all), the first third of this book would still be difficult to comprehend, and perhaps even pointless to read. The final third of this book is where Mary Karr turns her attention away from the MFA grads and the literary masters, and addresses a third audience: the humble aspiring memoirist who comes to this book as a manual to help them write that blockbuster film of their life. On page 216 of this 218-page book (two pages away from the very last page!), Mary Karr delivers the most BASIC piece of writing advice, the level of writing advice I myself give to people a lot: that good writing is rewriting, and writers have to learn how to ""cut out the dull parts. Even the smallest towns have coffee shop bulletin boards or community centers with a writer's workshop now. Even the less good groups can help you by speaking for your potential reader -- they're way better than the echo chamber of your own head."" This information would have been fine in the first third of the book, had the book established that ""The Art of Memoir"" was a writing manual for the most inexperienced novice of memoir. Which is to say, the people like the friendly folks I meet in real life, who do not read books at all, but would love to see their life turned into a Hollywood movie, so they're now writing a memoir and in need of some writing tips.That wasn't the established audience, however. Mary Karr began the book by addressing literary insiders (MFA students and grads), and then moved on to speaking to her fellow literary greats in the business (the lofty middle third of this book), before she turned her attention to making this book a toolbox-type craft book for the genre. There is no one in my personal life who I can recommend this book to. Primarily because I felt deeply insulted by the end of this book. Mary Karr, if you are assuming I'm familiar with all the elite circles you run in, and that I understand history to the level you do, because you're addressing me in your most literary prose that made ""The Liars' Club"" famous, and I can tell how much you've polished each sentence in this book because each one of them feels so careful and belabored -- then *why* do you then believe I need to be told revision is important, and that I should seek out critique partners?? Isn't it obvious I ALREADY F*CKING KNOW I need to do this, if I've made it to the last third of your MFA-level book?Her writing advice in the final third of this book is so basic. So basic. It just doesn't add up with what came before. If I'm reading a craft book for insiders, then the advice should be more advanced than the writing advice this book delivers. I would one-star this book because of the last chapter, which felt absolutely insulting. That last chapter made this book feel like a giant mess. One part money-grab, one part ego-stroke, all parts pretentious. It also made me feel like Mary Karr is so high up the literary-elite ladder, she's totally forgotten how to interact with anyone who isn't already standing on the highest rungs. Despite the length of this rant, I must make clear that I love reading craft books, whether I write in a particular genre or not. Just because I don't intend to write memoir (EVER), does not mean I cannot learn craft tips from the genre. I like learning and re-learning basic information, and I reread craft books on writing all the time. But I do not appreciate being spoken to as an insider, then stretching myself to pretend I'm Don DeLillo or Amy Tan having a friendly chat with Mary Karr, and then -- after all of that -- being given the most basic writing tips I've already read in oodles of other craft books. The structure of this book did not work for me. The final third of this book should have come first, and should have been titled something like 'Part I: Basic Craft.' The first and second thirds of this book were another kettle of fish altogether, and should have been titled 'Part II: MFA students and published authors' or 'MFA grads and masters of craft.'If you are looking for a how-to book about literary craft, I believe Roger Rosenblatt's ""Unless It Moves the Human Heart: The Craft and Art of Writing"" is a far better read than ""The Art of Memoir."" And for the aspiring writer who doesn't read any books, and doesn't frequent bookstores at all, but longs to pick up a few tips in the hope of turning their life story into a Hollywood movie, then Stephen King's ""On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft"" remains the gold standard of how-to books. Stephen King's prose is so much more accessible than Mary Karr's prose in this book. King's writing tips are far more useful as well. He gives his readers a number of tools to place in their toolbox of craft. Mary Karr is focused more on general guidelines than gritty specifics. I've never felt insulted when reading or rereading King's book, but Mary Karr managed to offend me a great deal. I still love Mary Karr, and so I'm giving this book 3 full stars. But ""The Art of Memoir"" inspired a lot of aggravation, especially once I read the final chapter, when I was plunged into rage territory. This is not a writing book I would personally recommend. If you already love Mary Karr, you may want to pick this up. Just be warned that as a how-to manual, this book is a mess....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 04, 2018","Jan 27, 2018","Jan 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28218823-the-art-of-memoir

A collection of Middle Eastern folk takes compiled sometime before the 13th century, ""A Thousand and One Nights"" follows the story of a cuckholded Sasanian king who murders his unfaithful wife, and then decides to murder as many young female virgins as he can. To achieve his heart's desire and soothe his wounded male ego, the king marries a succession of virgins and executes each one of his wives the next morning. Because asshole. Eventually, the king's vizier runs out of virgins to supply to this shitbag king for his killing spree, so the vizier's daughter offers to be the next bride, and her complete tool of a father agrees. This young woman's name is Scheherazade, and on the night of her marriage, she begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. Curious to hear more, the king postpones her execution a day in order to let her finish the story. Scheherazade repeats the same trick, over and over, for 1,001 nights, during which time the king falls in love with Scheherazade, decides never to kill her, and makes her his queen.""The Wrath and the Dawn"" certainly follows this premise. The main character, a teenage girl named Shahrzad, does marry a king bent on murdering young female virgins, and when the novel begins, the king has already executed between ""sixty"" or ""seventy-five"" virginal wives in ""the past three months"" (page 90).The exact number of victims is never made clear in this book. Which is no small fact in a novel that runs on the engine of rape culture. The serial killer sitting the throne in this story is an eighteen-year-old boy named Khalid, and since he is the love interest of a teen romance novel, he is physically gorgeous and in possession of exotically colorful eyes. In this case, Khalid's eyes are ""so pale a shade of brown they appeared amber in certain flashes of light, like those of a tiger"" (page 10). His beautiful ""tiger-eyes"" are referenced a number of times in this story. Khalid is also a master swordsman, looks smoking hot in all types of lighting, and, of course, he is rich af because he is a king.The setting is a fictional kind of ""mystical Persia,"" in which the author borrows cultural details from historical Persia to make her setting exotic, but in no way adheres to any kind of realistic creation of a historical place. For the first two nights of their marriage, Shahrzad does tell Khalid some rather uninteresting tales to postpone her execution. But on the third morning of the marriage, Khalid decides the stories just aren't working for him, or the sex, and he sends his guards to execute her. Because in addition to hearing Shahrzad's stories, Khalid has had passionless, emotionless sex with her twice. I pictured Khalid thrusting his erection into Shahrzad's vagina until he climaxed, an action which she endured in stoic and uncomfortable silence, both times, given the complete lack of description for these sexual encounters. I felt sad for her, and I kept waiting for her to do as she'd promised at the beginning of the story: kill this murdering king for executing her beloved cousin.But no. Shahrzad has already caught feelings for the king and his smoking hot tiger-eyes, and she was really hoping that her own smoking hot body would make him catch some feels back. Shahrzad is dragged from her room, strung up with a silk cord around her neck, and starts to hang, but Khalid appears at the last second, cuts her down, and despite the bruises on her neck, a dislocated shoulder, and all of her trauma, Shahrzad soon forgives Khalid -- like, within hours -- and the romance carries on at full speed. Only the first 100 pages of this 388-page novel are a fairy tale retelling of ""A Thousand and One Nights."" After that, the story reverts into a fairy tale retelling of the French folktale, ""Bluebeard,"" in which the love of a good woman cures a man's inner monster/stops him from being a serial killer. Although ""The Wrath and the Dawn"" contains no BDSM, this novel also reads like a YA retelling of ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" in which Khalid is transformed from an emotionally unavailable man with serious commitment issues into a Knight in Shining Armor and the main character's loyal husband.  If you enjoy the popular storytelling trope of ""true love cures the monster,"" then you will probably love ""The Wrath and the Dawn.""Other tropes employed by this story:1. Insta-lust/insta-love2. Love interest is a Bad Boy with a heart of gold3. Love Triangle4. Main Character is the Ultimate Cool Girl5. Hate to Love relationship6. Everyone immediately loves the heroine (because she's sassy & gorgeous)7. Romantic Tragedy/lovers are suddenly parted ending (because there is a sequel to this book, go figure)Tropes are not inherently bad. They are just storytelling devices, and reading ""The Wrath and the Dawn"" helped me to appreciate their attraction in ways I'd never considered before. In this novel, the emotional allure of these tropes end up providing the reader an excuse to forget Shahrzad has quickly fallen in love with a serial killer, a man who has murdered her own beloved cousin, a man she has decided is worthy of sacrificing her own life for because he has beautiful tiger-eyes and is rich af. This novel also made me appreciate ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" in ways I never thought possible. Many ers have pointed out that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is rape culture dressed up as romance, or porn culture dressed up as love, which I totally agree with. But for all his many flaws, and for all the book's problems, at least Christian Grey isn't a serial killer of teenage women. Khalid makes Christian Grey look like an incredibly honorable guy, a guy worthy of starring in a romance novel. And that, to me, is really saying something. ""The Wrath and the Dawn"" is rape culture on steroids. The relationship between Shahrzad and Khalid reads like a play-by-play of modern hookup culture, in which two people have emotionless sexual intercourse on two different occasions, and then proceed to follow a fairy tale storyline in which they catch feelings for each other and end up in love. Khalid, like Christian Grey, is pretty to look at and dripping in gold. But this fairy tale hookup story doesn't star your typical modern-day asshole with a porn addiction and a Tinder account; Khalid is a king and a serial killer who even attempts to kill the girl he is currently hooking up with.Since the modern world is also rape culture on steroids, and men who kill women are a nonstop fact of life, I find it immoral that a love story like this was written for teenage girls. On average, three men each day murder their wives, girlfriends, or exes, and every few weeks, police somewhere find the mutilated body of a new victim of a serial killer. There is nothing romantic about this. And there is nothing romantic about a novel that dresses up a serial killer as a young woman's true love.Readers who love this novel will cite the fact Khalid had ""a reason"" to kill all those young women -- he believed his kingdom was cursed, and only by murdering 100 women could he stop the curse. But men have *always* had ""fantasy reasons"" to murder young women. Here is an incomplete list of ""justifications for murder"" that real-life serial killers have used:1. My god told me to2. The spirits said so3. The crops will grow better4. Rain will fall from the sky5. Because I can6. Because f*ck women, they're garbage7. The fairies promised me gold8. I had a bad dream9. Felt like a good idea at the time10. I was saving their souls11. The devil made meI'm sorry, but I can't turn off my brain when I read a book. Khalid is a serial killer and nothing about this love story is okay. Yes, I know he suffers headaches and insomnia over these executions, and tells Shahrzad he regrets what he's done. I know he wrote letters to the families of his dead wives, letters of apology HE NEVER SENT. We don't even know how many women he's killed. He faces NO CONSEQUENCES for his behavior. NONE.Here are some common consequences for serial killers: trial and imprisonment, and/or execution. Since I'm not a supporter of capital punishment, I think Khalid should be imprisoned. But that would be such a blow to the rape culture this book runs on, of course Khalid never faces prison time or any personal consequences for the young women he's killed.Yes, lightning strikes his palace at the end of this book, damaging parts of the building, and his capital city goes up in flames. But that is called life, not a personal consequence. Cities are destroyed in this world every day: by earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, avalanches, etc. etc. etc. Do I think Khalid's palace being struck by lightning was part of a curse? No. Because all the innocent people who die from unexpected tragedy in this world are just that: tragedies, not moral judgements. Khalid faces no personal consequence for the women he's murdered. Watching his capital city burn is *not* a personal consequence. Also, I guarantee the poor people losing their homes are going to suffer a whole lot more than Khalid ever will.I'll end this  by saying I find the original story of ""Bluebeard"" much more compelling than ""The Wrath and the Dawn."" While Shahrzad does tell Khalid the story of Bluebeard late in this novel, as her way of begging Khalid to make himself emotionally available to her so they can have an honest conversation for once, I only felt more repulsed. ""The Wrath and the Dawn"" wanted me to ship Bluebeard/Khalid and his young wife, but I can't get behind rape culture enough to say, ""yeah, even though men murder women in this world every day, let's make sure women know they can still fall in love with serial killers, too, and be loved in return by those murderers, because even monsters need love, and we all know women are the best people to show monsters love."" I just can't with this sh*t. I recommend this book to no one. I find this novel immoral. I would never put this book into the hands of a young teenage girl. F*ck rape culture. And f*ck Bluebeard. There are good men in this world -- women do not need to fall in love with serial killers. Please read ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" if you're hungering for a True Love Cures the Monster tale that is also full of rape culture, because at least ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is far less damaging than this book....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Dec 20, 2017","Dec 30, 2017","Dec 20, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18798983-the-wrath-and-the-dawn

It took me a long time to finish these pages. Jackson Katz is a good writer and his book is packed with insight and information. The content was just so emotionally challenging, and made me reflect on my own lack of awareness so much, that reading this book was like taking an entire course study on how little I really understand about the world, how little I understand about how language works, how culture works, and how much ""the patriarchy"" and the embedded hatred of women have been entrenched in modern culture in ever more powerful ways.Jackson Katz grew up with all the trappings of ""traditional manhood"" -- as a popular athlete in high school, Mr. Katz was a proud member of the ""jockocracy"" that ran his school. He lived with an elite status within a powerful peer-group as a young man. His interest in feminism came in college, when he went through a transformation that made him a powerhouse human being -- the human being who committed his life to calling attention to men's violence against women, and trying to stop that violence from happening.I cannot state enough how much Jackson Katz moved me with this book, or how compelling and noble I find him to be. As I read his book, I would often take breaks to watch clips of him online, giving interviews or presentations or speaking in documentaries. He has a wealth of material available, including an educational video titled, ""Tough Guise: Violence, Media, and the Crisis in Masculinity."" As much as I love all of this additional material, nothing compares to reading the text of this book. For the sheer volume of information and the emotional impact the data had on me, ""The Macho Paradox"" was a heart-wrenching book in every way.Having finished this book in February 2018, I can state that in the twelve years since this book was first published, it remains as relevant, important, and necessary as the day it debuted. This is one nonfiction title that has -- tragically -- aged extremely well. The pop culture references Jackson Katz used for a book that debuted in 2006 are from the same pornographic pop culture of the America I live in today. I think the relevance of his pop culture references was something else that made this book even more horrifying to read.""The Macho Paradox"" is a feminist book: a book that treats all human beings with dignity and respect, regardless of genitalia or gender. It pains me to say how radical it is to read a book that was written by a man that respects all people so much. This is just not an experience I am used to. Jackson Katz is one of the most relentlessly honest and justice-driven feminists I've ever met in a book, and it pains me to admit that I keep mentally asking the author, ""How can you be like this, and not be a woman?"" Reading the work of a male feminist who writes at this level was a shock. Even now that I have reached the last page, I may never get over the shock. I will quote a small portion of his acknowledgments, which made me cry --""Sadly, the woman who perhaps did more than any other individual in history to enlighten both women *and* men about men's violence against women died while I was writing this book. I never had the opportunity to thank Andrea Dworkin in person, so I do so here in recognition of her extraordinary grace and courage in the face of ruthless caricatures and dismissals of her work.""The fact that Jackson Katz penned those words in tribute to Andrea Dworkin just says it all.Five full stars. I absolutely love this painful, necessary, and important book....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 20, 2017","Feb 10, 2018","Dec 20, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/651653.The_Macho_Paradox

In “Mrs. Fletcher,” the main characters and the plot both support the use of hardcore pornography that features violence against women, such as choking, gagging, and verbally abusing female sex partners. One of the two main characters, a college freshman named Brendan Fletcher, acts out porn scenes with two different female partners, and the novel ends by having one of these abused female sex partners take the blame for Brendan’s behavior. At the end of the book, this young woman apologizes to Brendan for not speaking to him for months after his sexual violence against her, and she tells Brendan that her complicity in allowing the sexual violence to happen, in the simple fact that she innocently chose to have sex with anyone on a college campus at all, was “just as bad, if not worse.” (page 304) Then the story gives Brendan Fletcher a hero’s reward/happily-ever-after ending for being such a good person—for being the kind of guy who watches hardcore, abusive pornography and doesn’t feel bad about it, or have any desire to change his behavior.If you are the kind of reader who believes that Brock Turner, the infamous Stanford swimmer who was convicted of sexual assault in 2016, received a far too “steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action,” as his father maintained, then “Mrs. Fletcher” is exactly the novel written for you. College student Brendan Fletcher is a Brock Turner in training, a baby rapist who drops out of college after committing sexual violence against a female partner, and then receives the absolute sympathy of the author—and the story—with zero analysis as to why he committed the sexual violence, zero moral condemnation, and zero reason to change. If you are the kind of reader who believes “boys will be boys” and that it is natural for any young man to grow up masturbating to images of violence against women—if you believe that women secretly long to be sexually abused by their male partners in order to orgasm, if you believe that the rape culture of hardcore pornography is good, healthy fun, and if you support the hardcore porn industry and all of their corporate profits—then “Mrs. Fletcher” will be a novel you enjoy.I find this message intolerable, and I absolutely hated this book. I give negative stars to “Mrs. Fletcher,” and I wish this book had never been published. This novel is infinitely damaging to read. Porn culture is ableist, racist, homophobic, and promotes a misogyny so strong that women and children are tortured and raped on camera for the sexual pleasure of men—and I cannot—I will not ever—support a novel that views porn culture as an acceptable part of the white middle class. This is abhorrent. “Mrs. Fletcher” is an abhorrent book.How did Tom Perrotta manage to get this book published, and win so much praise from so many critics for penning this pro-porn-culture sh*t message? Simple. He dazzles the reader with an array of diversity-checkboxing characters, so that readers never see the forest for the trees. The plotline of “Mrs. Fletcher” is chockfull of “diverse” characters who fit the Magical Negro Trope: characters who serve to enlighten and support the white middle class characters on their Hero’s Journey to attain their Happily Ever After. Trope characters are unrealistic literary creations invented by an author to service the plot. The #ownvoices movement is one way modern readers have been pushing back against Tropeland in fiction. But a number of popular books still feature Tropeland side characters, and “Mrs. Fletcher” is one such example.The titular Mrs. Eve Fletcher is the divorced mother of the baby rapist Brendan Fletcher, and while porn culture plays a big role in this story, it is only Eve Fletcher who is shown masturbating to MILF pornography, an acronym for “Mom I’d Like to F*ck” porn which features slightly older women than the children, teens, college students, and young women of most mainstream, hardcore pornography available online. The reader never witnesses Brendan masturbating to porn. The reader never learns if Brendan pays for pornography, or if all of the abusive hardcore porn he views is free. The story’s erasure of Brendan’s porn use in scene is highly significant to the plot. In every way, the novel serves to normalize the production and use of hardcore pornography and support Brendan’s privacy in viewing and masturbating to violent hardcore porn. The story replaces Brendan’s porn use with a lot of razzle-dazzle diversity characters, to distract the reader from noticing the real message the novel is broadcasting. Here are some of the Magical Negro Trope characters Tom Perrotta employs in this book:1. Magical Transgender College Professor teaching a gender studies class. This professor teaches at the local community college Eve Fletcher attends for one semester.2. Magical Wheelchair Girl who is happily participating in modern hookup culture on Brendan’s campus. Magical Wheelchair Girl becomes the love interest of Brendan’s dude-bro roommate, a guy just like Brendan, who even starts “pushing her wheelchair all over campus” (page 202). 3. Magical Autism Child who opens up Brendan’s philandering father to unconditional love and marital commitment to his second wife, who is the biological mother of their Magical Autism Child.4. Magical Brown Boy who is the target of Brendan’s racist mockery on campus, but this character still makes sure to protect and serve Brendan throughout the story. Magical Brown Boy forgives Brendan’s dude-bro racism, understands that Brendan is actually a lonely white boy in desperate need of a friend, and goes to great lengths to care for Brendan without getting anything in return—not friendship, not gratitude, not even an acknowledgment of his humanity. Because white middle class dude-bros will be dude-bros, you know. There is also: 1. a Magical Negro who falls in love with the transgender professor; 2. an extremely lonely and super-pathetic white feminist who uses Tinder (an online site that facilitates finding sex partners who are strangers); 3. a white male victim of bullying (he was locked in a port-a-potty for a few minutes) who now suffers from PTSD; 4. and plenty of other side characters meant to showcase and highlight Tom Perrotta’s cultural awareness of the modern zeitgeist of America.Every side character in this book serves the purpose of normalizing the attitudes and behavior of Brendan Fletcher. “Mrs. Fletcher” is a novel that deeply sympathizes with the plight of male privilege, and seeks to assure the white middle class that they are good and noble and wise, even if they masturbate to hardcore pornography that eroticizes every hateful message of ableism, racism, homophobia, and misogyny. “Mrs. Fletcher” communicates the message that porn isn’t hurting anyone. Tom Perrotta has adopted pornography’s corporate sales pitch that porn is good, healthy fun, and he penned an array of Magical Negro Trope characters who agree with his opinion. Everything is fine in entitled, white suburbia. The privileged kids are okay.As Brendan Fletcher would think by the end of this book: poor Brock Turner, who suffered so greatly for 20 minutes of action—if only he’d chosen to drug a girl who could blame herself for his sexual assault, then he wouldn’t have ended up in a courtroom, instead of just being a lost, lonely college dropout like Brendan, who only needed to take some time off to figure things out before he reenrolled at a different school. Then he can return to using hardcore pornography and living his white dude-bro lifestyle in peace.On a sentence level, I cannot deny that “Mrs. Fletcher” is beautifully written, full of sentences penned by a master of literary fiction. On a prose level, this novel is a work of art. But on a messaging level, this story is toxic, and so are the main characters. Even though Brendan Fletcher is the one whose porn use has caused negative effects in his life, the reader never sees Brendan use porn. Instead, the reader must witness Eve Fletcher become “addicted” to MILF porn in this book—an addiction which is as unbelievable as it is unexplained. Eve goes from having no awareness of modern online porn to becoming “addicted” to MILF porn overnight. This made no sense to me. None. It would make more sense if Eve Fletcher had been a middle-aged man. I could believe a middle-aged man could become addicted to MILF porn overnight. Seeing Eve’s spontaneous porn addiction just felt like the author pulling the strings on a puppet. Assisted by her porn addiction, Eve goes on to marry a man who calls her a MILF during sex. Eve Fletcher’s happily ever after involves a triumph of hardcore porn in the marital bed, and completes the celebration of porn culture that is the beating heart of this novel’s plot. I cannot state enough how much I hated this book. “Mrs. Fletcher” is not worth any stars in a rating, and I believe poison like the messaging found at the end of this book is immoral, and has no place in civil society. Abusive hardcore pornography is toxic, and nothing to celebrate. I give only negative stars to this book....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Nov 27, 2017","Dec 05, 2017","Nov 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33584812-mrs-fletcher

Published by Tin House Books, ""Rabbit Cake"" follows the story of Elvis Babbitt, an eleven/twelve-year-old girl whose mother has recently drowned. There is no plot, other than following Elvis and her family for a year and a half after the unexpected death of their matriarch. Everyone around Elvis struggles with grief in frustrating ways that are meant to seem humorous. This book was one of the most tiresome episodes in Nothing Happens In This Story that I have read in a long time. The characters in this novel are all able-bodied, white, affluent U.S. citizens. Everyone is quirky. There is a whole lot of quirkiness in this book. If you enjoy stories about wealthy people causing their own problems and suffering for no reason, simply because they do not go to therapy even though they have plenty of money to pay for counseling, then ""Rabbit Cake"" will be a satisfying experience. Elvis's late mother was a sleepwalker, and Elvis's older sister -- Lizzie -- is a sleepwalker as well. Lizzie is the star of this novel. She is mean and selfish and not likeable, and yet that is why the reader is supposed to love Lizzie. Vicious enough to punch her best friend in the jaw, and break the bone in four places: wow, Lizzie is awesome! Vicious enough to rip her dad's hair out: Lizzie is so strong! What a tough, sassy teenage girl Lizzie is! Her sleepwalking even gets so bad she's sent away to a psych ward! What a badass!Lizzie is meant to be a heroic, wonderful figure in this book. I honestly couldn't stand her, and when the story goes into Happily Ever After Land at the end, and the platitudes start filling the pages, I just couldn't stomach this book anymore. What is the big finale of this novel? Simply this: if you are a wealthy, white family who suddenly loses their mother, you should probably use some of your oodles of money to pay for therapy, because therapy is GREAT. Once Lizzie gets some useful counseling at the end of this book, the rainbows appear, and all is well in the world of white affluence. The prose is adequate. The sentences are clean and the grammar is proficient. This is not lyrical or poetic writing. If you want stunning literary fiction, I suggest you look elsewhere.There is a lot of rabbit imagery in this novel. Lizzie bakes a lot of cakes shaped like rabbits, and there is a white rabbit on the book cover, etc. etc. While I could talk about Elvis being a kind of Alice in Wonderland figure, moving through the nonsensical world of adults in this book in the same way Alice struggles to make her way through Wonderland -- I just can't spend anymore brain power on this book. If you love ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" and enjoy seeing the banal absurdities of the modern world portrayed in all their irrational glory, then you will likely enjoy this plotless novel a lot more than I did.Recommended for people who love Happily Ever Afters, platitudes, and plotless storylines....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Nov 26, 2017","Jan 24, 2018","Nov 26, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30304223-rabbit-cake

Wow.The 2017 YA fantasy, ""Caraval,"" by Stephanie Garber, is one of the most misogynistic books promoting rape culture I've ever read. If you appreciate how much porn culture has saturated pop culture, and you have no problem with how much pornography has been mainstreamed into our daily lives, then you'll probably love ""Caraval.""In porn culture, men abuse women and children at will, with no consequences to the men for their abusive, violent behavior, which can include the murder of the individuals the men are raping on camera. The porn industry calls these violent, abusive films ""gonzo porn,"" and they are the most common pornography available on the internet. Enter Governor Dragna, the supreme villain of ""Caraval."" He is the sadistic, purely evil father of two beautiful teenage girls named Scarlett and Donatella, the two sisters who star in this book. Governor Dragna has committed murder and extreme acts of violence for many years before the story begins -- and by the end of this book, he is not punished or brought to justice at all. He walks free, with no consequences for his behavior. His walking free is taken as a matter of course: as a natural, unquestionable fact. Just like a man in a porn film finishes choking a raped, naked woman to death, zips up his pants, and walks away. The misogyny in this novel is just off the charts. Donatella is the entire source of the plot of this book. The story begins after she has decided she will mastermind a way to ""free herself"" of her abusive father -- by committing suicide in front of him, and then being resurrected by magic a few minutes later, in a place where her father cannot see Donatella come back to life. After Governor Dragna is convinced she is dead, he will no longer stalk Donatella, beat her, or try to kill her -- because she's now just a dead, unburied corpse lying broken on the ground, and not worth the trouble of like, smashing her skull in, or whatever. Donatella comes up with her master plan in secret, and she does not tell Scarlett what her plan is, or how she will be using magic for her own resurrection. The trouble is that Donatella, once dead, cannot resurrect herself. She actually has no magic herself -- she must use the magic of an immortal and sadistic magician named Master Legend, who plays disturbing games with people before he will ""share"" his magic with them. But even once Donatella plays Legend's horrible game and gains access to his resurrection magic, Donatella cannot use the magic once she is a corpse. She needs Scarlett to initiate the magic procedure to return her to life. Scarlett, however, is enthralled to her father, and has decided to trust that the marriage he has arranged for her will give her a safe, loving home in which she and Donatella can escape their father's sadism forever. Scarlett does not want to risk her marriage in order to travel to Legend's magical island where people play games in the hope of winning a ""wish."" Donatella doesn't trust that this marriage will be safe or loving, however. Neither girl has any real options. Either marry a stranger (who turns out to be a sadistic, abusive man) or ""play the game"" of a sadistic magician. Being born female in this book means being a perpetual victim. Men have all of the power in this story. The men in this book are: manipulative, violent, wealthy, sadistic, and physically powerful. The two male love interests in this book are also immortal, and both have been alive for at least three generations.The women in this book are all caught up in a game run by men, and they manipulate and hurt each other in order to seize whatever pleasures they can. Survival itself comes at an incredibly high moral cost -- namely, in the shredding of the bonds of sisterhood that tie Scarlett and Donatella together. Donatella betrays Scarlett in every way she can in order to get Scarlett to participate in a ""game"" that ends in Donatella's real death. A game that features people being murdered in front of Scarlett, who remains completely unaware of the magical resurrections that take place at the very end of the book, when all is revealed.Donatella has Scarlett drugged and kidnapped and taken to the Island of Dreams, where the sadistic magician Master Legend runs his ""Caraval"" game. What does ""Caraval"" mean? Is it based on a traveling ""carnival"" show, or perhaps on the celebration of ""Carnival"" that takes place before Lent? The author herself doesn't know. In an interview I watched with Stephanie Garber online, in which she is answering reader questions in a bookstore, Ms. Garber told the audience she still wasn't sure what Caraval means in this book, and is hoping to answer that question in the book's sequel, ""Legendary."" I will not be reading the sequel. This book was bad enough; I don't need a Round 2. If my sister in real life betrayed me the way Donatella betrays Scarlett in this book -- if my sister used me for a sadistic game full of murder in order to ""free herself"" by faking her death in front of our father -- I would be devastated. I would still love my sister, but our bond would be shattered. I would never be able to trust her again. Donatella is full of lies in this book -- and she lies the MOST to her SISTER. Donatella lies so much in this book, I don't even believe her ""answers"" or her version of ""the truth"" when she finally ""reveals all"" to Scarlett at the end. Donatella is one of the grossest, vilest characters I've ever encountered in fiction. She was equal in vileness with her sociopath of a father. Despite Donatella's reprehensible behavior, Scarlett does initiate the magic to save her -- unwittingly, believing her sister really is dead -- and Scarlett doesn't even get to see Donatella reawaken from death. Donatella just strolls into a room later, and announces she and Scarlett need to hurry up and put on some pretty dresses because there's a big end-of-game party, and they need to go flirt with the handsome men. This book reads like Alice in Wonderland (a bizarre land in which anything goes, with a main character trying to make sense of the senseless) -- but instead of falling down a rabbit hole, the backdrop resembles a glamorous high school prom after-party set in Amsterdam. There is a lot of emphasis on outward appearance in this book, with most of the focus falling on a pop culture/porn culture view of ""female hotness"" -- especially as concerns how much skin is being shown off in these elaborate gowns the girls wear in this book. If you like a lot of Madonna/Whore messaging in your novels -- from subtle to not-so-subtle slut-shaming, as well as a main character who is considered worthy of love because she ""dresses modestly"" and is virginally ""pure"" -- then ""Caraval"" will delight you.I counted one person of color in this book. She is introduced to the reader as a ""dark-skinned girl on a unicycle"" (page 75) and she has several lines of dialogue before she admits Scarlett through the gates of Caraval. When she reappears in the book later, she is called ""the pretty dark-skinned girl"" (page 139) instead of being called ""the gatekeeper"" or ""the cyclist"" or any other term that would've made more sense to me as a reader. I hadn't latched onto her skin color as being her defining factor, but the book draws attention to it because she's the only person of color described in the text. The man who helps Donatella kidnap Scarlett and take her to Caraval is described as having ""golden-brown skin"" (page 13) and light brown eyes -- I saw this man as a tanned, muscular white man. This is not person of color territory -- and since it turns out that this man, Julian, is also Master Legend's powerful and immortal brother, he is certainly not a member of any oppressed group of people. Porn culture is a powerful vehicle of racism, so it doesn't surprise me at all that the powerful men in this book are all white, and the two main female characters are both white as well. There are a few words of Spanish sprinkled through the beginning of this book. The author uses Spanish as an easy way to add to the ""exotic allure"" of her fantasy setting. Spanish is used to ""exotically name"" things like beaches, boats, and hotels on the island where the girls live, as well as on the island home of Master Legend. The use of Spanish in this novel was a textbook definition of Orientalism/Othering, and, much like all the Madonna/Whore messaging in the story, is hardly even noticeable because the book is so saturated in a White Colonialist Patriarchy which has been hyped up on Magical Steroids. The biggest message ""Caraval"" communicates to the reader: a man's love is worth everything. His love is worth lies and betrayal. His love is worth losing your sister over. Only a man can love and protect a woman, so a woman must do everything she can in order to have the love of a man. The novel ends with Scarlett sharing hot kisses with Julian, after she has told him she has forgiven him for all of his lies and betrayal. Most telling of all is the way Julian's body is described in this scene: ""Julian drew a cool finger along her collarbone as he leaned in closer, sliding his free hand around her neck."" (page 396)Once his hand is around Scarlett's neck, the two of them kiss.My honest recommendation is to just run away from this book. Unless you really like porn culture, rape culture, and misogynist f*ckboys portrayed as the Love Interests of Virginal Heroines. In which case, ""Caraval"" will certainly deliver your deepest desires....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Nov 20, 2017","Nov 25, 2017","Nov 20, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27883214-caraval

This stunning read has earned a top spot in my heart as one of my favorite books of all time.I read this book in two days, but kept it up on my ""currently reading"" list for much longer -- just because I liked seeing the book on my Goodreads wall every day. Gail Dines has an excellent TED talk featuring various highlights from this book. There is also a short documentary video featuring one of her numerous presentations, which I was able to access through my library system. I recommend watching her TED talk and the documentary film as well.As a person and as a writer, I appreciate books that illuminate how the world works -- and this book did that in such a powerful way. In my other reading, I know there's been a tremendous (and horrifying) rise in sex trafficking in the United States -- especially in children -- and now that I've read ""Pornland,"" I know exactly *why.* It's amazing when a book can explain so many disparate facts of reality all at once. Or when a book turns on your whole brain, and makes you race through the pages because you have that potent sense of, ""here it is; here is the thing I've been looking for; here's the key to the WHY no one else can explain."" Why questions are the hardest of all, and ""Pornland"" is a nonstop illumination of *why* American culture operates as it does. This book travels into the psychological headwaters feeding the river of all of our media. Each chapter is brain food of the most powerful kind.On a side note, to discuss something that wasn't featured in this book: Gail Dines doesn't talk about ableism in ""Pornland,"" but I would like to add to her commentary, regarding ableism -- From what I can assess, regarding American culture: porn doesn't only transmit the most lethal messages of misogyny, racism, and homophobia -- mainstream porn is also the most powerful transmitter of ableism. The erasure of the disabled body in porn is the strongest form of ableism. I do not fault ""Pornland"" for leaving this out. As mentioned, the book was first published in 2010, and disability studies is still kind of nonexistent in the culture at large. The stated purpose of ""Pornland"" is to examine different types of mainstream pornography, and the messaging transmitted in that pornography. To discuss the ableism of porn is to talk about the power of erasure -- and Gail Dines trained her focus on the images and videos that people are looking at. Since mainstream porn does not feature physically disabled actors at all, it seems counter-intuitive to discuss a type of pornography that does not exist.Which is why that would be the one chapter I would add to this book, if I could: the chapter about the ableism of porn, and how incredibly powerful this complete erasure of physical disability in mainstream porn truly is.Personally, I do not watch pornography, and neither does my husband -- he's always been averse to it because he says porn is ""fake"" and he's never liked the idea of ""masturbating to pictures,"" especially ""fake pictures"" that someone has digitally enhanced on a computer. He finds porn weird and unnatural, and wonders why men want to jack off while looking at women who don't have ""pimples, scar tissue, cellulite, fatty butts, floppy boobs,"" and other attributes of ""real bodies."" My husband has always been like this, and we've been together for fifteen years.I share that as a personal commentary on a truth Gail Dines shares in her book: not all men watch porn. It is not a given that all men seek out porn, desire porn, or masturbate to pornography. I'm grateful I live with such a man. I feel incredibly lucky that mainstream pornography isn't part of my personal sex life.My life is still impacted by pornography though, even if I don't seek it out. Seeing how very *much* my life --and American culture at large -- is impacted by pornography is the focus of this book, and it is absolutely brilliant. All the stars, and all the love for the work of Gail Dines. I could not be more grateful to have this book in my life....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Nov 20, 2017","Dec 16, 2017","Nov 20, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9655642-pornland

After the local veterinarian, a middle-aged man with a mental disorder, commits suicide, the oddball inhabitants of the town of Blue Moon mourn his loss in various ways. The novel is an examination of how these people continue their lives with a lot of unspoken grief. Author Laura Pritchett doesn't follow any one resident through this story of loss and life moving on. The narrative switches into a new point of view character with each chapter, leaving some readers to call this a short story collection. The book jacket calls ""The Blue Hour"" a novel though, with the loss of this veterinarian being the central story every chapter in the book is meant to illuminate. While I am a big fan of literary fiction, and I have 5-starred many a short-story collection or loosely-connected/tangential-story novel like ""The Blue Hour,"" this one just didn't work for me. The characters didn't engage me, the prose didn't achieve enough poetic vision to enchant me, and I found myself slogging through a lot of unappealing sexual content without any uplifting payoff on behalf of my trouble. By page 96, after 40% of the novel, I had to DNF.Within the first 96 pages, every point-of-view character in this novel ruminated on sex and/or their genitals, performed sex with a partner, and one woman masturbated. Two different male characters in this novel performed cunnilingus, which is described as such:""...you glide your head between your wife's legs and slide your tongue into her as deep as it will go... you hum and lick..."" (page 4)""...the only thing I can do is hold her thighs and push my tongue in further and hum."" (page 88)Because this book was so inundated with sex scenes, genital descriptions, and reflections on sex, I kept wanting to tell these male characters that this particular cunnilingus technique is really unproductive for getting their partners off. Most women achieve climax by having their clitoris directly stimulated, which cannot be done with tongue-thrusting alone. Since none of these men were stimulating their partners' clitoris with their fingers (or anything else), the tongue-thrusting alone was meant to be pleasurable -- and I guess the humming was supposed to increase the appeal. But as a female reader, I just felt uncomfortable reading these scenes, and annoyed. This sounded like the kind of sex writing I'd expect in patriarchal-wannabe-porn erotica, circa 1995, or the all-out hardcore-porn erotica being published today. The kind of erotica that ignores the reality of women's bodies, and certainly denies the fact that the clitoris exists. One middle-aged woman presents herself to the reader as something of an expert on sex, explaining that she has always been ""fascinated"" by sex and ""paid attention to sex the way some people pay attention to race car drivers or sports teams"" (page 14). This woman then goes on to talk about orgasms with her male partner. ""Some women are not aware of their orgasmic capacity, including me, and that before him, I had thought I was unable to have more than one. I told him this was probably good for his male ego"" (page 21). While it is true that many women do not masturbate, and do not understand their orgasmic capacity, you also might immediately wonder, as I did: Does this couple engage in stimulating the woman's clitoris? The answer is: No. They have vaginal sex, and she says she likes her partner to enter from behind, even though her ""rear is dimpled with fat"" (page 12). Now, I am not going to deny that some women can orgasm from vaginal penetration alone -- but the percentage of women who can seems to be pretty small. I do know that a lot of women seem to like the doggy-style position because it puts pressure on the G-spot (and accounts of the G-spot vary -- but this is the best terminology I have, so I'm using it) -- and G-spot pressure is not achieved well at all by tongue-thrusting. Fingers (and other things) are better for that. As far as tongue-thrusting goes, most women don't get much of anything out of it, as far as orgasm stimulation or actual pleasure goes. This data comes from Daniel Bergner's excellent nonfiction book, ""What Do Women Want? Adventures in the Science of Female Desire,"" published in paperback in 2014. There are many other books about clitoral stimulation and female climax, but Daniel Bergner's book is my favorite. I really wish the characters of ""The Blue Hour"" could've read ""What Do Women Want?"" And I really wish any woman framing herself as some kind of expert on orgasm and sex could at least use the word ""clitoris"" in this novel -- either in her interior monologue, or in direct dialogue with her male lover. But no one in the pages I read of ""The Blue Hour"" ever used the word clitoris. Instead, the female sex-expert has orgasmic doggy-style sex with her partner under a tree surrounded by rotting apples and bear scat. In fact, there is so much bear scat around that they had trouble finding a clean patch of grass. This section of yard is also within view of a house where the town veterinarian's two young children live. (page 15)I don't know what was worse -- the thought of having sex surrounded by the stench of rotting apples or all the piles of bear scat -- let alone that this pungent Love Site was within view of young children. These middle-aged folks of Blue Moon have some powerful libidos to be pounding away with each other in the midst of feces and rot and possible unintended exhibitionism. The male lover of the woman who is ""fascinated"" by sex ends up having to take over the full-time care of his seven-year-old niece, when he learns that his brother-in-law is dying of cancer. This young child is named Honey, and she sleeps in diaper pull-ups because she wets the bed. The first night the man spends with his niece, she wakes in the morning and ""climbs on top"" of him. Her diaper is ""puffy and stinks with pee"" (page 82), and then she ""climbs"" on him again and ""plops the squishy diaper"" on his chest -- I guess this means she sits on his torso (page 83).He tells her they need to take off her diaper, which Honey insists is a Pull-Up. ""She pulls the not-diaper off and throws it on my floor. Her vagina, or vulva, or whatever it's officially called -- and I suppose I should know, *why don't* I know? -- is so hairless. A hairless V."" (page 83) In reflecting on Honey's nude body further, the man goes on to say, ""I never considered what a female looks like without that hair."" (page 84) There are two things I want to say, regarding this scene. And no, I don't need to point out this is pervy af, because that ought to be obvious. Here are my two things:1. This male POV character is correct, he is looking at Honey's vulva, not her vagina. It is apparent that his sex-obsessed female lover isn't doing her job, if he cannot even name basic female anatomy with any kind of assurance, even though they've been pounding away amidst the rotting apples and bear scat and talking about female orgasms. If this guy doesn't know what a vulva is, I'm 100% positive he doesn't know the word clitoris, either.2. What modern middle-aged man is completely unaware of pornography? Women in porn no longer have hair. Anywhere. Except on their heads -- the rest of the female body is waxed bare. And that's been the case for like, two decades or so. Yet this rugged mountain man who has sex amidst the bear scat seems unaware of pop culture, the internet, and like, any kind of connection to the real world. He sounds like a child in kindergarten, not a grown man. After reading about this man perving on Honey's vulva, ""The Blue Hour"" switched narrators again, and shifted into the POV of a married woman who has decided to have an affair. She sees a strange man at a livestock auction who is sporting a mustache, and decides, what the heck, that guy will do. She goes into the bathroom to freshen her makeup before introducing herself. ""In the bathroom, she tightens her face against the faint smell of urine and menstrual blood, puts a peppermint breath mint in her mouth, and leans forward over the sink to stare at her face in the mirror."" (page 94)Soon after this description, I just lost my will to keep going. ""The Blue Hour"" focuses so much on presenting human life as a nonstop grotesquery, there was simply no way I could read another 100+ pages of this. Some ers have called this book ""sexy"" because the topic of sex is so central to the narrative. While there is a lot of research that supports the idea that our erotic lives help us recover from grief, I didn't find the characters in ""The Blue Hour"" to be sexy. Some of them were downright disgusting, even when they weren't perving on children. I'm sad I had to DNF. I purchased this novel at full price: a hardback first edition. But the combination of bathroom stink and a pointless affair with a mustachioed man is too much to bear. I'm sorry, but I never found Tom Selleck attractive, and his mustache is the epitome of the ""male mustache look"" in my mind. If I have to read another tongue-thrusting cunnilingus scene starring Tom Selleck, with the lingering aroma of menstrual blood in my mind, I'm going to freaking lose it. If you are a reader who finds this sort of material ""sexy,"" and you believe you would enjoy this novel, then please message me your mailing address -- I'd be happy to mail you my copy of ""The Blue Hour"" free of charge....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 12, 2017","Nov 13, 2017","Nov 12, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30838574-the-blue-hour

People love this book, and I'm sure Kiersten White worThe rave s for Kiersten White's 2016 YA fantasy ""And I Darken"" are all over the internet. People love this book, and I'm sure Kiersten White worked really hard writing this, and kudos to her for penning lovely sentences, and creating a book that has sold so well and so many readers have enjoyed.I wanted to enjoy this book too. The setting is the mid-1400s in the Ottoman Empire. Which is totally MY JAM. I *love* Ottoman history. I love everything about the Ottoman Empire -- from its inception, to its centuries of rule, to its 20th century demise. It is my favorite empire of study.Here, then, is the problem. This novel is written as historical fiction -- but the book is so full of historical inaccuracies, anachronisms, and complete flights of fancy, the ""history"" in ""And I Darken"" is what makes the book a YA *fantasy* -- because this isn't just ""alternate history"" here -- this is ""let me make up a bunch of sh*t and call it history"" -- this entire novel is fantasy on every level. I found ""And I Darken"" to be one of the most offensive stories ever penned about the Ottoman Empire, and I'm not even Turkish or Muslim -- I'm a lover of the history and the people who created this history -- and that history is trashed so much in this book, I read ""And I Darken"" in a state of disbelief and horror, and finally DNF'd on page 421, after 89% of the book.If Kiersten White wanted to write another uber-popular ""Throne of Glass"" -- then she should've written a straight-up fantasy. Instead, she took actual, real, lived history, sh*t all over it, and presented it to the public as ""good Muslim rep."" I find this infinitely offensive. There are a lot of readers who know nothing about the Ottoman Empire, readers who have read this book thinking they're learning about history because this book is ""historical fiction."" Those readers aren't learning anything. THE ""HISTORY"" IN THIS BOOK IS BULLSHIT. Complete and utter bullshit. This is NOT how the Ottoman court operated. And since almost the entire novel is set within the Ottoman court, every event in this book is ridiculous and absurd to the point of invoking my rage. It pisses me off that modern writers believe they can treat history like a fairy tale and win awards, praise, and money for penning books like this. I call it goddamn offensive. This book offends me.And don't think for one moment that Kiersten White's representation of Romanian history is any better. Because oh my God. OH MY EFFING GOD. The bullshit in this book about Romania is even worse than the depiction of the Ottoman court.She has her two main characters, Lada and Radu, speaking ""Wallachian,"" and identifying as ""Wallachians."" ffsAnd Lada uses the word ""nation"" for ""Wallachia"" and roots her identity solely in ""language"" to self-identify as a ""Wallachian.""I JUST CANNOT EVEN WITH THIS SH*T I DON'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH F-BOMBS Romania isn't a fairy tale. It's a real country with a real history. Here is some basic information that anyone can find on f*cking Wikipedia about why Lada's ""Wallachian"" terminology is so problematic -- ""The name Wallachia, generally not used by Romanians themselves (but present in some contexts as Valahia or Vlahia), is derived from the term walhaz used by Germanic peoples to describe Celts, and later romanized Celts and all Romance-speaking people.""The key words in that sentence, of course, being that Romanians do not use the term ""Wallachians"" for themselves. Outside of, say, Romanian historians examining historical text penned by non-Romanians. Lada would not have called herself a Wallachian, nor is she speaking Wallachian. She is speaking Romanian. But that word never appears in this book. I would also like to point out that this is the time period soon after the Crusades, set in the continuing warfare that led to the Fall of Constantinople. Religious identity was a big deal. IT STILL IS. But it was a SUPER big deal in the 15th century. On every level possible, Kiersten White f*cked up her ""Romanian rep"" in this novel. ""And I Darken"" reads like the author skimmed a few history books, picked words at random because they ""sounded pretty,"" and had full faith that her readers knew so little about this time period that her ""alternate history"" would be greeted with cheers. And in general, that is exactly what happened.A short list of other stuff I found offensive af in this book:1. As an adolescent and child, Radu is portrayed as a spineless crybaby -- an overly sensitive boy who is easily overcome with tears. He is also physically handsome, a super ""pretty boy"" who needs Lada to rescue him time and again. **And then Radu turns out to be gay.** Because of course the gay boy in this story is a pretty, oversensitive crybaby. OF COURSE. 2. Lada is ""born ugly."" She is physically ugly, and therefore mean, aggressive, angry, selfish, and the masculine ideal of a warrior in this novel -- because ugly people are disconnected from social values, tend to be atheists leery of all spirituality, and enjoy being mean. This is an ableist trope and I found it as offensive as Radu's portrayal as a gay man.3. Mehmed. Everything about Mehmed's portrayal offended me. There is so much historical data about this man, and none of it mattered for the creation of his character in this book. The Mehmed presented to the reader in this story repulsed me. 4. All the Madonna/Whore moralizing in this book seriously pissed me off. In the story, Lada and Mehmed become good friends, fall in lust and in love with each other, and start sleeping in bed together. But the novel makes sure to point out in explicit terms that Lada does not let her vagina ever be violated by Mehmed's erect penis. As Lada tells the reader on page 371: ""Holding her maidenhood to herself was the only way she knew to protect herself, to keep her heart from becoming fully is."" Lada can kill Mehmed's would-be assassins in brutal fight scenes, she can lead the ""deadliest"" force of Janissaries in the Ottoman Empire, but she damn well better keep her maidenhood, because Good Girls Don't. 5. Lada's moral redemption by way of a heteronormative love story. In case the Good Girls Don't messaging in this book was too subtle (!!!), the author makes sure Lada upholds modern society's continuing enforcement of male power. Primarily by way of the male gaze and male desire. As Lada says near the end of the book, while making out with Mehmed: ""He still wanted her. And she knew now what a fleeting and precious thing it was for a woman to be wanted in any way that made her important."" (page 358) Thank you, ""And I Darken,"" for reaffirming the importance of heterosexual love.6. The portrayal of Vlad Țepeș in this book was abysmal. The man is a national Romanian hero -- but in this book, Vlad Țepeș was a complete asshole with no redeeming qualities, and I just wanted him to die. He is only in the novel for a short time in the beginning, but any reader who believes this book shows ""good Vlad Țepeș rep"" ought to check out some history books. *****If all of this sounds like a good time to you, then by all means, please read this book. But I could never in good conscience recommend ""And I Darken"" to anyone. I don't think it's right to sh*t on history to this extent, and pass it off to people like they're learning something. This book is as factual as a fairy tale. You would learn more about history by reading a fairy tale. ""And I Darken"" left me outraged and furious. If you don't mind authors sh*tting all over history and the descendants of the people who made that history, then this book is for you....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Nov 11, 2017","Nov 19, 2017","Oct 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27190613-and-i-darken

""Moxie"" is a quiet, moving story about a junior high school girl who starts a feminist movement This 2017 YA contemporary novel is an excellent book. ""Moxie"" is a quiet, moving story about a junior high school girl who starts a feminist movement at her school in order to confront the sexist bullying she and her female classmates suffer from daily.For as much as I enjoyed this book, and recommend this to readers who love YA, I still have a few things I didn't like. The novel starts out pretty slow, and I wasn't a fan of the timeline. Not only is the main character a meek little mouse in the opening chapters, with nothing at stake for herself, but the slow pacing continued to be a problem in the middle as well. In order to follow an entire school year, the story skips over weeks at a time, and then recaps the passed time as backstory. Not only does it feel like ""nothing happens"" during those skipped weeks, the quick summarizations of time passing made me feel less engaged each time I encountered one. I almost DNF'd this book a few times.I'm **so** glad I kept reading though, because the best part of this book are the final few chapters. I don't want to spoil what happens, but I was moved enough to have happy, triumphant tears in my eyes -- and it is a rare, rare YA novel that can make me feel any kind of positive emotion that strong. I *LOVE* that this YA novel uses the words ""feminist"" and ""feminism"" -- not just in the main character's interior monologue, but in her direct dialogue with other characters. Not only that, but the terms ""humanist"" and ""equalist"" are also considered and debated as possible replacements for those who are unwilling to use the word ""feminist"" -- and the novel comes down solidly in favor of using the word ""feminist"" -- and explains why.I feel like I've been waiting a long time for a YA author to be brave enough to write a book like this one -- and here it is -- a book that *actually* supports women -- a book that is *actually* a feminist book -- with characters who call themselves feminists. That said, ""Moxie"" is not a perfect novel. I could have done without the love story in this novel, though I did like the boyfriend character, and the complications he added to the feminist movement at school. I wish he and the main character had just been friends though, rather than read all the scenes describing their kisses. Because their relationship felt so fated and solid, I never doubted Seth's boyfriend-ness, so his presence as ""the safe relationship partner"" dropped the tension a lot.I also found Seth a bit too perfect. While he does add some complications in the last third of the novel, he was always such a polite, restrained gentleman -- especially during all those long make-out sessions that lasted for hours -- I just couldn't quite believe that those two spent hours upon hours alone on a couch together (or alone in a car together) and did nothing more than kiss. I also didn't like that the main character's best friend (another junior named Claudia) didn't support the Moxie movement until after Claudia became the victim of sexual harassment at school. The same was true of another pivotal character, another junior girl who plays a big role in the feminist movement *after* she is physically attacked by a classmate. While I absolutely understand that this is realistic behavior (many girls denounce ""being feminists"" until they personally suffer the horrors of misogyny), I wanted the story to draw attention to that fact -- because this is a truth that makes me frustrated and sad. It's such a minor quibble that I don't think it's worth removing a star in my rating, so I just wanted to point this out in my . Claudia didn't like feminism until she *needed* feminism -- and then she supported it. The same was true of another key character in this story -- and many people in real life -- and I just wanted ""Moxie"" to make note of that fact somewhere on the page -- but the book never did. So many important points are spelled out in detail in this novel, but the breakdown in empathy due to indoctrinated misogyny wasn't one of them.""Moxie"" is a realistic book, and the characters in this novel behave in realistic ways. This is not a story in which a group of 16-year-olds save the world or the universe because every adult in the multiverse lacks a brain, and this is not a wish-fulfillment tale about a Chosen One who is Born So Super Beautiful she skips into a Happily Ever After because her beauty made her hero's reward an automatic conclusion.If you crave a Chosen One story, a Born Beautiful story, a YA love triangle, or a tale of Wise Teens who save the world from Brainless Adults, then you should definitely be warned that ""Moxie"" won't satisfy those desires. But if you enjoy realistic settings, realistic characters, and a realistic depiction of modern-day feminism in a small-town high school, then I would definitely recommend ""Moxie."" This book made me feel really good. I closed the last page feeling triumphant and empowered. I closed the last page feeling *happy.* And if you like reading books that leave you feeling that way, then I hope you'll read ""Moxie"" and add to the love for this feminist novel. Because I *really* hope authors keep penning stories like this. ""Moxie"" is an awesome book....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 19, 2017","Oct 25, 2017","Oct 19, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33163378-moxie

The book feels vaguely mid-1700s, or perhaps mid-1800s, but none of the soldiers use guns or artillery, and there are no specifics given to ground this story in any kind of reality. The main characters in this book all inhabit a fantasy land loosely modeled on India, but spend most of the book in a separate, magical world called Naraka, a world that is also full of doors into other worlds and stranger lands than the ones visited in the book.The author drew from Buddhist mythology, Hindu scripture, Indian history, Greek myth, and what often feels like multiple LSD trips to pen this tale, since the story jumps around at random through locations and times with no central cohesion or narrative plotline for the reader to follow. If the reader is unfamiliar with the Hades and Persephone myth, or the Cupid and Psyche tale, then this novel is a punishing read. Things happen in this book because the author wants them to happen, and reading this novel made me feel like being a dandelion seed blown helter-skelter on a thoughtless wind of purple prose. The biggest problem with “The Star-Touched Queen” is that the main character, Princess Mayavati, has no ambition, no agency, and reacts to situations as her author-creator wants her to react—with no consistency or rational thought. On page 12, Maya tells the reader what her goals in life are: “I could read more. Learn more. Make new dreams.” Her statement about making “new dreams” is a fancy way of saying she likes to make up her own stories, which she shares with one of her half-sisters, another child of the harem named Gauri.A lot of other ers have faulted this novel for Maya’s apparent misogyny while at court, but I would just like to say that harem culture is—essentially and fundamentally—an extremely misogynistic culture. If Maya reads as a misogynist, the reader can hardly blame her. Her father, the king of Bharata, places no value on Maya’s life, or on any woman’s life. The king arranges a wedding for Maya, and then casually tells her that she must commit suicide on her wedding day, so that he can use her dead body as an excuse to slaughter all of the wedding guests gathered at his court. Even though Maya has (somehow) learned how to read, and places some modicum of value upon her own life (she likes to read and tell stories), she quickly and easily agrees to kill herself for her father’s ridiculous and evil plan. But at the moment Maya lifts the bottle of poison to her lips, a mysterious and exceptionally handsome man appears, swats the bottle away, and rescues Maya from the battle that erupts all around them, as her father commences the slaughter he’d planned. The beautiful masked man tells Maya that her father has asked him to save her, and that her little half-sister Gauri is safe from harm, and so Maya takes her wedding garland and tosses it over the stranger’s head—thereby marrying him—right before they flee the bloodshed and carnage.Why was the man wearing a mask? Uh, who knows. Later, he takes it off, reveals his gorgeous face to Maya, and there is no reasoning given for this behavior, other than “to make the story more interesting.” Why did the man wait so long before saving her? Again, who knows. “To make the story more exciting” would be my best guess.Why did Maya marry this guy? Uh, because he was gorgeous. Even though part of his face was hidden, she could (somehow) tell he was beautiful. His name is Amar, but for the purposes of this , I will refer to him as the Hot Guy True Love, because that is essentially how Maya treats him throughout the book. Maya and the Hot Guy True Love escape the court riding a water buffalo, and the story becomes the Hades/Persephone/Cupid/Psyche tale on a Hindu/Buddhist LSD trip. The reader soon learns Maya is a special person—she was born special, with latent magical powers, a special reincarnated soul, and her body is physically beautiful to her new husband—and once they arrive in his magical palace, they spend many days kissing (but not having sex, because hello, this is YA lit, not an adult story with sexy times) and while Maya keeps her virginity firmly intact, she learns how to start using her magic.The kissing scenes and interactions between Maya and the Hot Guy True Love are described with such hyperbolic melodrama and sentimentality, I kept feeling like my inner sixth-grader would’ve been overjoyed. As Maya says in one kissing scene with Amar on page 164, “I reached forward, my hands tangling in his hair as I kissed him. It was a kiss meant to devour, to summon war.” That overwrought description would have definitely made the junior high school version of me swoon. “Amar’s hands gripped my waist, before tracing the outline of my hips. Heat flared through my body.” (p.164)Every time these two are on the verge of doin’ the deed and consummating their marriage, something happens to stop them—a noise, a strange turn in the dialogue, or the Hot Guy True Love simply says no, they can’t, because reasons. This novel excels in giving the main character a double-whammy of traditional female worthiness: not only is she married—by her own choice, but she remains an undefiled virgin throughout the book. Only one final step remains to make Maya the pinnacle of Female Goodness, which would be for her to immaculately conceive a male child. The story doesn’t give Maya the Holy Trinity of Traditional Womanhood Power (virginity, marriage, and a male child), but two out of three ain’t bad. Even though Maya’s husband is a Hot Guy as well as her True Love, and even though he saved her life and rescued her from her asshole father’s murderous schemes, as well as the living hell that was Maya’s life in her father’s harem—and even though Maya’s husband gives her a palace to live in and starts teaching her how to use magic, Maya decides she doesn’t trust her gorgeous husband, because otherwise the book would end due to an absolute lack of a plot.So the reader is given Maya’s sudden distrust of Amar to provide the story with conflict—and therefore, a plot. This happens around page 185, about two-thirds of the way into the book, and provided enough action that I kept turning pages, waiting for some kind of payoff from this nonsensical book. Maybe Maya would gain some kind of rational thought, or the magical underpinnings of the world-building would become more coherent, or the story would take an unpredictable turn that would—I hoped—surprise and delight me.But by page 268, Maya has left her husband’s magical palace to return to her late father’s court in Bharata, and discovers ten years have passed since she left. Maya interacts with Gauri again, as well as a horrendously vicious harem woman named Mother Dhina. Maya learns some soldiers in Bharata have been captured by a rival kingdom, and she teams up with Gauri and Mother Dhina to help these men be rescued by Gauri, since Gauri is now wearing armor and carrying weapons and kicking ass.Since the story gave no explanation for the sudden Feminist Makeover that took place in Bharata, Maya’s “mortal” homeland became yet another example of the LSD-trip unreality of the rest this novel. Nothing in the story felt grounded or real, and the whimsical purple prose took the phantasmagorical setting from wild imagination into zones of sheer chaos. On page 268, as Maya is interacting with Mother Dhina, I became enraged with this book, and had to stop reading. YA literature has seen a big push to humanize and show compassion for story villains like Mother Dhina—and while I agree that increasing empathy in fiction is a worthwhile endeavor—this novel was not about Mother Dhina, nor is Mother Dhina the primary antagonist. Bharata’s harem was dropped from the novel after the first forty pages, and never heard from again. In the final third of the book, Maya should be tracking down her primary antagonist—an evil young woman who showed up in Naraka in order to kill Maya and steal her Hot Guy True Love—and by this point in time, I didn’t care about Mother Dhina, Gauri, or the nonsensical land of Bharata. I certainly didn’t care about these missing unnamed soldiers that Gauri suddenly needed to rescue.Earlier in the novel, Maya forgave her late father’s ghost for being such an asshole in this book, because reasons. When it became clear that Maya was also humanizing and forgiving Mother Dhina for the sole purpose of: Author Wants This to Happen, I couldn’t put up with all the bullshit anymore, and DNF’d this book.Look, I’m not saying that readers can’t have compassion for vicious harem women, or for fathers who kill their own children for political power. I’m saying this novel was a mess, and gave me no reason to understand Maya’s forgiveness of these people, or to care. Maya didn’t seem to understand that Mother Dhina and her father both wanted her dead, and that neither one of these assholes gave a shit about her. Maya’s insistence on humanizing the abhorrent behavior of her enemies just made her seem like a brainless pawn, the same way she acted a fool when she chose to trust the voices of strangers and enemies instead of the man who saved her life.This is what I kept wishing I could tell Maya as I read this book: if you know someone wants you dead, you should not trust them; and if someone saves your life from a bunch of murdering scumbags and also tells you he loves you, his voice should carry more weight than the words of a stranger. But Maya chose to trust strangers and scumbags instead of the Hot Guy True Love, because reasons.And if that sounds like a compelling plotline to you, then you will probably enjoy reading “The Star-Touched Queen” a lot more than I did.

For a YA debut novel, that is no small feat. Though some of the passages are repetitive, and some of the descriptions could've been culled to speed up the pacing, the descriptions are never overwrought or distracting. On a sentence level, this novel does a good job.Another big plus: the plot is clearly defined. This is a fairy tale retelling of the Evil Queen from Snow White, set in a fantasy world based on 15th-century China -- a China without any gunpowder, however. (Bummer.) Like a lot of fantasy authors, Julie C. Dao chose to skip any mention of cannons or guns in the world of this story, preferring to keep the weaponry limited to swords and spears and crossbows. Not that the reader sees much use of weaponry in this book. The main character, an 18-year-old young woman named Xifeng, wields a dagger near the end of this book, and she watches a few characters fight some assassins and demons/guardians of the Great Forest in one of the earlier chapters. If you want a story about a country ingénue who moves to the palace, transforms into a badass warrior, and kicks ass at court, Xifeng will disappoint. Xifeng (pronounced SHE-fung) is the Evil Queen of this retelling, and while she *does* transform from a sensitive, meek country girl into a thoughtless killing machine of the court, she does not act alone, and by the end of the book, it is clear her actions weren't even her own. She is only the tool of a powerful male character called ""the Serpent God""/""the dark god""/""His Dark Majesty""/""the Lord of Surjalana.""While the story uses *all* of these titles interchangeably for this powerful male character, I will simply refer to him as the Serpent God. He is an immortal being with a tremendous amount of dark magic, and he has spent thousands of years on earth, building up a secret (and totally unseen) underground army of black serpents to like, kill all the humans and some other gods in the heavens, or something. His end goal was kind of vague in the book, but suffice to say, the Serpent God is evil incarnate and hungers for absolute power on earth and in heaven, mostly because he wants revenge against some other deities who like, wronged him a few millennia ago, or something. He also likes to play twisted games with humans, trap them with his magic, and turn them into his pawns. The Serpent God did this with Xifeng's aunt Guma, a woman who tried to free herself from him as a teenager. But late in the novel, Xifeng is informed by a ""monster"" servant/human pawn of the Serpent God that Guma was never free of his manipulative power -- ""She imagined herself to be free, the silly woman. But her soul became his the first time she adopted his teachings. It wouldn't matter if she threw the cards of fortune [he'd given her] into the deepest ocean. Once he takes hold, he never lets go."" (page 325)""Taking hold"" of someone means that the Serpent God has put his ""spirit"" into a person, even if that person doesn't know he has done so. This allows him to ""manifest his thoughts and powers"" within his victims. (page 325)Xifeng is told by the ""monster"" servant/human pawn of the Serpent God that Guma unwittingly put Xifeng under his control when she raised Xifeng from infancy, and taught her how to read the cards of fortune he gave her. Xifeng is told of Guma: ""When she transmitted his teachings to you, she passed his spirit on as well, without knowing. And you allowed him to manifest his powers and thoughts within you."" (page 325)Xifeng realizes the monster servant is correct, and she tells him, ""It's true, then. I told Guma he might be controlling her... controlling *me* and my destiny all along."" (page 326)Everything Xifeng has done in the novel, she has done because her aunt Guma dictated to Xifeng that the cards of fortune told her what her future should be, and that she must do everything in her power to make this ""destiny"" come true. Xifeng also communes with ""the darkness"" within her to follow this path, a darkness that is really the spirit of the Serpent God controlling her.The monster servant sings the Serpent God's praises to Xifeng. ""He is your father, your lover, your true king, and the maker of your fate. He loves you as no one ever has or ever will. Every heart you take, every drop of lifeblood you drink, brings you closer to him. The darkness you felt inside was his protection. He will be with you always and forever."" (page 326)So Xifeng asks the monster servant, ""What would he have me do?"" (page 326)The monster servant is quick with his answer. ""Take your place as supreme Empress over all of Feng Lu. Strengthen yourself with the hearts of lesser beings and allow him to speak and act through you. And in return, you will have the whole of his power at your disposal. There is only one god, and it is him."" (page 326)With this section of dialogue, author Julie C. Dao removed all agency from Xifeng, and made her just another pawn of a powerful male character out to seize power for himself. Why does this matter? Because Xifeng is based on the real women of the world who have risen to power despite the severe disadvantage of being born female, women who have used their ambition to change the course of empires. Xifeng leaves her small town to join the Emperor's ""city of women"" who live in his harem, surrounding the Emperor's wife and two favored concubines. There have been many female lovers and concubines throughout history who have risen to power by manipulating a king or an emperor's court. Xifeng reminded me a lot of a Chinese version of Anne Boleyn. Except Anne Boleyn and the real-life women of history wanted power and status for themselves, not because an ""evil spirit"" of an immortal Serpent God is controlling their thoughts with ""dark magic."" Once Xifeng lost her agency in this book, I lost all reason to care about her. Since I know there will be a sequel to this book, I assume that good will eventually triumph over evil, and that Xifeng will simply die alongside her father/lover/evil husband god, slain by the ties of dark magic that connect them.  Given the revelations that take place in this novel, I cannot believe other ers are calling this story a ""feminist"" tale. How in the hell is it ""feminist"" to strip your main character of her agency? To dupe your readers into believing they are reading an Anne Boleyn tale, when in reality, they are reading about a silly girl under the control of a powerful male deity who is out for himself? A god who places no value upon human life -- and therefore, places no value upon Xifeng's life? She is a tool to be used, and the Serpent God carries no loyalty toward any of his pawns in this book.Xifeng is a willing victim of misogyny in all ways. She is the absolute opposite of anything ""feminist."" The plot of this book doesn't counter the patriarchy in any way, but simply upholds it. Xifeng is a misogynist in a vile, misogynistic culture, and she is also the complete pawn of a male god of dark magic. The story perpetuates the belief that Xifeng must choose between power or love, and that in choosing power, she has forsaken love, and chosen to turn herself into a monster.If you believe that this is an accurate dichotomy, and an accurate depiction of how women ""gain power"" at court -- rather than some seriously sexist bullshit used to keep women down -- then you will certainly enjoy ""Forest of a Thousand Lanterns"" a lot more than I did. Even so. My biggest problem with this book is the fact that Xifeng's choice for ""power"" wasn't really her choice at all. Xifeng wants to be Empress because the Serpent God manipulated Xifeng into believing her ""destiny"" was to become Empress -- and he used magic to manipulate and control both Guma and Xifeng into acting out his wishes.Xifeng didn't realize she was under the control of the Serpent God at first, but once she does learn how much he has manipulated her, she is his willing servant.And since the Serpent God seems to have unlimited magic at his disposal, the book reveals some massively large plot holes toward the end. Lady Sun, a shrewd and ambitious concubine, decides to follow the Serpent God's ""monster"" servant down into the tunnels under the palace -- alone -- without telling anyone where she is going -- and no one sees her leave, and no one sees the person she left with.This is like the infamous scene in those really bad horror movies when the ridiculous teen girl is like, ""I think I heard a sound in the basement, and even though I shouldn't go down to the basement right now, I think I will like, go down there alone and let someone with a chainsaw cut me to pieces.""That was Lady Sun in this book.And it gets worse when the reader finds out that the ""monster"" servant took the shape of the person Lady Sun hates almost as much as she hates Xifeng. Even though this palace has eyes and spies everywhere, and Lady Sun is way too smart to go off alone with an enemy -- much less wander off UNDERGROUND with an enemy -- the book decided none of this mattered, plot holes be damned. Then the reader learns that Lady Sun's corpse isn't rotting, her dead body is preserved in a pool of water that anyone can discover at any time -- but the palace guards never check the tunnels. Even after days and months pass, and Lady Sun is ""searched"" for -- no one looks in the tunnels for her. Meet the people of the palace: dust bunnies have more brain cells than these folks. ""Forest of a Thousand Lanterns"" is a book full of nonsensical characters, plot holes, plot twists that rely on unexplained uses of magic, and features a main character who is a victim of the patriarchy in every way. The story upholds an idea that women choose between having power or having love in life, and the main character of this novel only chooses power because she is under the control of a male deity. I am certainly aware that history is full of women who have learned how to operate within a sexist, debasing power structure in order to win status and power for themselves. I also know that a woman who learns how to ""get hers"" by exploiting the system, and adopting misogynist cultural norms in order to crush the women beneath her on the way to the top is *not* behaving in any kind of feminist way. Feminism seeks to recognize all women as human beings; feminism is not ""a license to murder"" or ""a license to abuse other women"" in an attempt to gain equal footing with men. Hurting other people in order to satisfy an ambition is *not* a tenet of feminism. And women like Xifeng, who learn how to ""get theirs"" by murdering women, and following the plans of a manipulative, controlling male deity are not following any kind of feminist storyline. This is more like the patriarchy on magical steroids, to be honest. I really wanted to love ""Forest of a Thousand Lanterns."" I wanted this to be my favorite YA read of the year.But this novel was a massive disappointment. I would not recommend this book to anyone....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Oct 22, 2017","Oct 27, 2017","Oct 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33958230-forest-of-a-thousand-lanterns

Her depression over the breakup made her like, self-destruct her own life (because sadness), and then go on a nonstop whinge-fest blaming all of her problems on her middle-class parents and unsympathetic friends (because narcissism).In search of the bragging rights of being a ""third-world"" traveler (yes, the novel uses this terminology -- and yes, I realize the author published this book in 2012), Bria signs up for a two-week tourist trip to Central America. The group will visit Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and some other places -- but Bria is shocked to discover she isn't traveling with other teenagers, and she ditches the middle-aged travelers who comprise this tour group shortly after she arrives in Guatemala (because ageism). On her first day in Guatemala, Bria is in a crowded market when her bag is stolen, and a grinning white guy appears in that instant, whisks Bria away from the scene of the crime, and then informs her the Guatemalan police don't care about her stolen bag, so she shouldn't report it, and he tells her to meet him at night at a lake place. He tells her she can leave the lake place anytime, but that is a lie -- the boats stop running at six p.m. and Bria ends up trapped there with him.This scene was sooooooo creepy and scary -- I immediately worried this white guy had been involved in the theft of her bag, and was out to do Bria harm -- but this is a YA novel, and this guy is Super Hot, so even though he lies to Bria and behaves as a villain, this Hot Backpacker Guy is the Love Interest. In the moral universe of YA fiction, the Love Interest is also the heroine's True Love (because Good Girl).Hot Guy also has a sister who is a Manic Pixie Backpacker Girl. Her name is Starling. Starling travels around the ""third-world"" helping orphans (because wow, so amazing) and she is super-wealthy and like, awesomely hip. Her clothes are described in detail, and she embodies the Backpacker Chic that Bria is so envious of possessing herself. If you believe that traveling to the ""third-world"" is done solely for bragging rights, and to provide a ""colorful backdrop"" for whingeing about First World Problems (because Hardship) -- then this is the book for you. Bria spends ten days hanging out on vacation on a small island in Belize, where she rides a bicycle around, eats ice cream, draws in her sketchbook, falls in love with her True Love, and contemplates all of her First World Problems at home. Most of the pages of this novel focus on Bria's life in suburban L.A. -- the breakup, her loving (but not loving-enough) parents, and her friends (who she blew off once she started dating). Bria throws a lot of blame at other people. But thankfully, after ten days relaxing on vacation in Belize, she realizes that her failure to send in her acceptance letter was her own fault. Thank goodness for travel, right? So magical. Nothing like colorful scenery to help break through all those indoctrinated levels of narcissism, and help Privileged White People start to take responsibility for their own behavior. Yay for the developing world! As Bria points out in the novel, the people who live in the ""third-world"" may have like, hardships in life, but Bria is adamant that it is wrong for anyone to ""only have empathy for those less fortunate"" (page 224). Bria's problems are ""real"" and just as worthy of empathy, whether from her Love Interest or from the reader (page 224). ""Wanderlove"" grows increasingly ridiculous after Bria leaves Belize, and returns to Guatemala to visit Starling before flying home to L.A. The story reached an excruciating level of unreality describing Bria's method of finding Starling in Flores, Guatemala, with the kind of serendipitous deus ex machina that can only exist in poorly plotted novels. If you enjoy wish-fulfillment books that reward their main characters for being clueless, entitled, self-absorbed, fixated on appearances, and so privileged they cannot even admit how well-off they are, then ""Wanderlove"" is the novel for you....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Sep 18, 2017","Sep 24, 2017","Sep 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9807262-wanderlove

I searched bookstore shelves for this title rigThe 2017 YA contemporary novel, ""I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,"" was a book I wanted to love. I searched bookstore shelves for this title right after the novel's release date, and when I couldn't find it in stock, I put my name on the wait list at the library, and started reading Chapter One as soon as I picked it up.The main character, however, is equal parts clueless, arrogant, cruel, and balances her character flaws with delusions of grandeur. I could not connect with this Mexican-American teenage girl, as much as I wanted to love her. She was just too selfish, entitled, and mean, even though I understood that her position in life was meant to be pitiable and elicit my sympathy. There was just nothing redeeming about her, and being in her head while reading this story felt needlessly painful.She begins the story by mocking the corpse of her sister, while attending her funeral. All of this is related in interior monologue. She goes on to make condescending statements about her weeping mother, then complains that her aunts are whispering about her. Her thoughts roam over her own life at the funeral, how she lies to her teacher about having her period to get out of swim class during gym, and how she's frequently in trouble at school and finds her mother annoying.This young woman has just lost her older sister -- who was ""smashed"" by a semi (page 8), and this is the stream of thought in her head. The funeral ends on page 11, but by page 37, I just couldn't take anymore. My organs were shutting down on me, and I felt the beginnings of brain death. I had to stop reading this. I skipped to the middle of the novel, to the part in the story when this lower-middle-class teen girl acquires a wealthy white boyfriend named Connor, and the two have sex for the first time. Julia, the main character, purchases the condoms herself, and then takes three trains to get across Chicago, to Evanston. She gets off the train and takes an unnerving walk to Connor's mansion.Once the two of them are alone in his bedroom together, Connor finds out Julia is a virgin. He asks her if she's sure she ""wants to,"" and Julia says yes, she does, (page 199) even though she worried on her walk to his house that he might think she's a slut (page 195).""After we kiss for a while, Connor pulls a condom out from under a couch cushion. I guess he was prepared. I look away as he puts it on.My body tightens, bracing itself -- it hurts more than I imagined, but I pretend it doesn't."" (page 199)""Once Connor is finished, he kisses my forehead and sighs. I rush to put on my clothes. I'm suddenly so embarrassed, I can't even look at him. I know that sex isn't evil, that it's a normal part of being a functioning mammal, so why do I feel like I've done something wrong?"" (page 200)Bravo to the author for writing a realistic teen sex scene. But I seriously can't imagine suffering through 200 pages of Julia's miserable life to arrive at this awful sex. This book just feels so punishing to read.If you want to read a YA/coming-of-age novel starring a judgmental teenager who vacillates between self-loathing and delusions of grandeur, and loses her virginity in a painful sex scene, I'd recommend Curtis Sittenfeld's novel, ""Prep."" That main character has a much keener intelligence level, and sharper powers of observation, that make tolerating her hateful attitudes much more rewarding.I'm really sorry I had to DNF ""I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter."" I had expected to love this even more than I enjoyed the YA novel ""Moxie"" this year. But I just couldn't tolerate Julia, and the prose was simply adequate in this book, without providing the poetic beauty or unique social commentary I need to care about such an unlikeable protagonist.

Kenzie was sent to Spain by her mother, who wanted to hide Kenzie's unplanned pregnancy from everyone they know in America, and give the baby away in some kind of shady adoption, because like, NO ONE CAN KNOW Kenzie was having the sexy times with her boyfriend. **The shame.** Apparently, Kenzie's mother would've been super-embarrassed in front of all her PTA friends if they ever found out her daughter was pregnant, and that would've been a real tragedy. Near the very end of ""Small Damages,"" the reader finally discovers this novel is set in 1995. But that really took me by surprise, since there's a scene early on in the book in which Kenzie calls her boyfriend from a pharmacy, right after peeing on a stick in a public restroom and finding out she was pregnant -- and Kenzie seemed to have a cell phone in that scene. So I thought this novel was set in 2006 or 2008.Regardless of my initial confusion, 1995 is a long, long way from the 1950s and '60s, when families went to great lengths to send their unwed pregnant daughters away from home to have their babies in secret. Kenzie lives a very modern, edgy lifestyle at home in Jersey, her boyfriend has been accepted to attend Yale, her friends are all cool and hip and kinda wild, her parental situation is chaotic, at best -- there is simply no way I believe this ""secret preggers journey to Spain"" could ever have happened. The story details here just didn't add up. Being ashamed in front of your PTA friends doesn't justify all the secretive scheming at work in this plot. I was hoping to read some lyrical escapism fiction packed with beautiful details of Spain. And I hoped the characters would speak Spanish, or discuss Spanish language, or reflect on Spanish history or the landscape in interesting ways.None of which happened. Of the first 133 pages of this novel, most of the scenes are backstory, describing how Kenzie came to be in southern Spain. Even though the novel introduces Kenzie in Spain, those initial pages prove to be story-hooks without substance. While Kenzie frequently points out there are oranges in southern Spain, and people say ""Buenos tardes"" about 58 times in this book, the repetition was as tiresome as the setting details were scant. Kenzie pines for her boyfriend, her friends, and the Jersey shore, as she ruminates on her life in America and how much she misses America. There are some Spanish Gypsies who appear. The description of these people felt overly exotic and Othering. Given that Kenzie isn't actively trying to improve her Spanish or learn more about Spanish culture at all, I really wish the Spanish Gypsies hadn't been in the story -- they felt like ""an exotic story detail"" to interest readers in this nonsensical plot.The true beating heart of this book is the fact that Kenzie is really, really connected to her developing fetus, and she wants to be a mother. She addresses her fetus as ""you"" throughout the novel, and Kenzie's awareness and vocabulary of pregnancy and motherhood sounded much more like a woman of thirty than a teenager in high school.The prose of ""Small Damages"" is literary, and the sentences are crafted with care, and meant to be poetic. But the problematic content really damages the entire flow of this book, as does the cumbersome repetition. The author uses a handful of Spanish words and phrases over and over, and Kenzie never translates the occasional complicated line of Spanish the Gypsies use in conversation. Since those lines of Spanish were plot-related and relevant to important characterization details, I found this highly frustrating. Kenzie tells the reader she speaks Spanish in the book, though it is only ever written in English -- except when she says, ""Buenos tardes"" -- which she and the other characters use a lot. Given what I read of Kenzie, I would say that she harnesses the strength of her inner 30-year-old who is hungering for a baby, and decides to keep her child by the end of this book.

The story is focused on a seventeen-year-old high school student named Molly who wants a boyfriend. She has a big loving family, and plenty of friends, but it's like. You know. She needs a boyfriend, because boyfriend. This is not a plot. There is nothing at stake in this book. Well, I guess there is the almighty question of WILL MOLLY GET A BOYFRIEND OR NOT?? Even though, according to Molly, feminists shouldn't want boyfriends: ""I spend a lot of time thinking about love and kissing and boyfriends and all the other stuff feminists aren't supposed to care about."" (page 91)Um, what?? Seriously. What the hell??This statement appears in a story-world in which teenage girls talk about their ""labia"" to strangers they meet in a public restroom, mothers describe pancakes as looking like ""penises"" and ""scrotums"" to their teenage daughters, and teenage girls admit aloud to boys at public parties that they've never had an orgasm before, even though they've ""had sex"" with their boyfriends -- But the main character doesn't even know what feminism is?And no, Molly's statement is NEVER corrected in the novel. Even though this book is all kinds of Diversity Checklist Bonanza of sexuality and gay moms and Molly's twin sister Cassie is supposedly some kind of fierce feminista -- this book is stuffed full of unbelievable nonsense. From the inconsistent characters, to the total lack of a plot, ""The Upside of Unrequited"" is a book full of affluent liberals who live on a version of Planet Unicorn I hope to black baby Jesus I never have to visit again. Because 264 pages of this was agonizing. Look, I'm glad this book was honest about the fact that many girls aren't having orgasms. But teenage girls don't SHARE this information in PUBLIC with teenage boys at parties. In no way do I believe this is realistic dialogue. Just. No.The two most emotional scenes in the book are when Molly is horribly fat-shamed by her grandmother at the dinner table, and then directly insulted by a somewhat-drunken teenage boy at a house party. Shy, quiet, anxiety-riddled Molly suddenly drops an f-bomb out loud, right to this guy's face -- it's the most badass moment of the entire novel, and WAY tougher than anything her twin sister Cassie says or does in this book -- and the story just lets the moment drop. Like, whatever, forget about that already, cause we're supposed to love Cassie. We're supposed to think Cassie is the brave, badass sister.Yeah, no. I know the author kept shoving that idea down my throat, via Molly's first-person interior monologue, but the more the book kept insisting I admire Cassie, the more disgusting this twin sister character became. Cassie is selfish and thoughtless and gross. I found Cassie to be a revolting person. I thought her pansexual girlfriend, Mina, was also gross -- obsessed with appearances and money and vapid ""partying"" with ""hot people"" and all that other fake bullsh*t Cassie loved so much. Those two deserved each other, for sure.The details in this book were just all over the place, and they kept piling up, to the point I just couldn't take all the randomness anymore, and had to DNF. There are SO many characters. Because: representation!! The more shout-outs the better! Sexual orientations, gay marriages, mental conditions, and Jewish characters are named on the page, sometimes only once in a brief passing mention, and it's like a big bag of confetti is supposed to drop from the sky and some cheering crowd in the margins screams, ""Yay! Diversity all up in this book!"" while someone else marks the boxes on a diversity checklist in order to collect a big prize at the end. I would have been okay with all the random book details and diversity mentions if there had been a plot. Or if the author hadn't slandered feminism with her main character. Or if these teenagers had all sounded like actual teenagers, instead of 30-year-old white women who spend all their time on social media.Because I will admit: *maybe* *some* adult women discuss their sex lives in public at parties, or discuss their lack of orgasms with their boyfriends in public at parties, or talk about their labia in public restrooms with strangers, or have the fortitude to overcome their medicated social anxiety in order to tell a fat-shaming drunken a-hole at a party: ""F*ck you."" *Maybe* this happens with *some* adult women. I have a hard time believing that any of this is prevalent or common, given everything I've witnessed in my life after 37 years of being alive on this earth -- but maybe in some super-affluent unicorn circles, adult women talk like this.But teenage girls? Teenage girls??No. Dear god, no. This book does not live on Planet Real. But if you want to visit this bizarre Planet Unicorn, and read lots and lots of text-messaging emoji descriptions while you anxiously wonder WILL MOLLY GET A BOYFRIEND OR NOT??

David Wilkerson believes in the power of prayer to create miracles, and in a number of personal anecdotes in this memoir, he shares a message about having the courage to pray in public, and to pray for specifically labeled outcomes, which he says is important for prayer to be most effective. By requesting specific outcomes from God, and by being brave enough to pray for these specific goals in public, David Wilkerson states that he was able to heal his father's terminal illness as an adolescent, and as an adult, David Wilkerson was able to miraculously receive huge amounts of funding for the Teen Challenge Center he opened in New York City in 1961. The assistance David Wilkerson provided to male and female gang members in New York City was to share with them the Biblical message of love and eternal life through Jesus Christ. Mr. Wilkerson's evangelism is grounded in a Pentecostal view of the Bible, with an emphasis on ""the baptism of the Holy Spirit"" as being a pivotal step in order to cure teenagers of their drug addictions.In 1970, ""The Cross and the Switchblade"" was turned into a Hollywood movie starring Pat Boone as David Wilkerson. By 1983, this memoir had sold more than twelve million copies.I have not seen the film, and I wouldn't have known this book existed if my mother hadn't asked me to read it. She met David Wilkerson in central Illinois in 1974 or 1975, when he visited her high school for a speaking event. For many years after ""The Cross and the Switchblade"" was published, Mr. Wilkerson traveled around the country in a bus/RV coach, hosting evangelist events like the one my mother attended at her high school gym.My mother told me she was moved by this book as a teenager, and she recently reread ""The Cross and the Switchblade"" as an adult. For evangelical Christians who believe in a God who is loving, receptive to granting the requests of specific public prayers, and offers everyone eternal life through Jesus Christ, then ""The Cross and the Switchblade"" will be a 5-star read.The prose of this book communicates some interesting history about gangs and street life in the late 1950s, but ""The Cross and the Switchblade"" isn't focused on historical record or illuminating American culture. This book is a story about the power of evangelical Christianity to lift up all people and transform their lives in positive ways. The charismatic persona of the author is the real heart of this book, and I would recommend this memoir to anyone interested in modern evangelical Christianity, either for their own personal spiritual growth as a Christian, or to anyone interested in modern American evangelical history....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 28, 2017","Oct 12, 2017","Aug 28, 2017",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/772852.The_Cross_and_the_Switchblade

The prose is beautiful, the story is gripping, the setting is unforgettable. I saw the award-winning 2010 film based on this book when the movie came out. My husband watched the film with me, and he listened to me read aloud long passages from this novel. We both recalled the film clearly, even though it's been seven years since we've seen it, and it was fun to discuss what the filmmakers changed or omitted in order to turn ""Winter's Bone"" into a movie.For as much as I enjoyed the film, the novel is far, far better. There is so much history in the book, along with powerful imagery, exposition, and dreamscapes that never made it into the movie.

Yes? Me too. Do you believe teen/YA readers are also worried about global warming, rising sea levels, and the pending migration sh*tastrophe humanity faces due to human-caused climate change?Yes? Me too.Do you like to read stories set in Mexico? Yes? Me too.I expected that the 2016 YA contemporary novel, ""Saint Death,"" would be a 5-star read for me. My worries and feelings about climate change and social justice mirror many of the worries and feelings author Marcus Sedgwick felt compelled to write about in this novel. I also loved that the story is set in Ciudad Juárez, the largest city in the Mexican state of Chihuahua—and one of the most dangerous cities along the U.S./Mexican border.If you are aware that Ciudad Juárez will not disappear underwater if/when ocean levels rise, then we have that in common. If you are wondering if any of the Mexican characters in this novel are questioning the impact of rising sea levels on Mexico and the rest of the world, the answer is no, they are not. Does that raise any red flags that the story structure of “Saint Death” might have some problems? Maybe, maybe not. Some readers enjoy omniscient narrators who insert random, tangential arguments into novels, information that wouldn’t otherwise fit into a book. But this preachy, polemical story structure definitely did not work for me. The prose in the first half of “Saint Death” is really strong—the writing here was well-crafted and a pleasure to read. The characters felt real, their situation gripped me right away, I felt invested in the plot. I loved all the details about religion and modern Mexican culture woven into the first half of the novel, and didn't want to put the book down. Marcus Sedgwick has a lot of talent and a beautiful prose style, and he’s certainly a strong writer. But in the second half of “Saint Death,” everything fell apart. The characters lost their dignity, integrity, and all believability. Reality was shunted aside, and the plot became a distant afterthought to the real point of this book: to serve as a platform for an Author Soapbox, and all the criticism and preaching that comes along with that soapbox. After finishing ""Saint Death,"" it is clear that author Marcus Sedgwick didn't write this book to allow his Mexican characters to discuss international trade laws, the impact of globalization on climate change, or disastrous immigration laws. The main characters in ""Saint Death"" are impoverished, uneducated (or barely-educated) slum dwellers, orphaned teens who are desperate to enter the U.S. These brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking teens also hope to avoid being tortured and killed, but since they live in a town run by drug lords, corrupt cops, and pretty much everyone in this book is a brainless scumbag, you can probably guess how things turn out for them. Throughout the novel, an omniscient third person narrative/authorial voice makes constant appearances, telling the reader that CORPORATIONS ARE BAD and GLOBAL WARMING IS BAD and IF SOMETHING DOESN'T CHANGE then Every City On Earth will turn into Juárez: a festering cesspool of anarchy, torture, and murder. The author repeatedly asks the reader, ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION?? with lots of random asides in the exposition as well as in authorial inserts that interrupt the story like commercial breaks. These interruptions grow in frequency until the second half of the book, when they finally hijack the novel and turn the book into a polemic against international corporations, abhorrent immigration policies, and the pending global disaster of climate change. As the omniscient narrative voice makes clear: when ocean levels rise, and the sh*tastrophe of human-caused climate change hits, everyone on earth will know what it's like to live in borderland Mexico, because this level of corruption, anarchy, and human depravity is The Future. (As in: Foregone Conclusion. As in: “Saint Death” As Prescience. There is no escape.) The poor, crushed brown people in this book are all either involved in the drug trade, illegally crossing the border, or being butchered by soulless drug lords. They die horrible deaths after leading ignorant lives of desperation. And according to the omniscient narrative voice of this novel, the senseless deaths of these impoverished brown people are all a WARNING for the affluent neighborhoods of the United States and the rest of the world. The mutilated, broken bodies on display in ""Saint Death"" are meant to serve as a warning to the wealthy, privileged reader to WAKE UP and BE SCARED because NO ONE would want their nice, safe neighborhood in the White World of Privilege to turn into Juárez.Plus, there's a lot of biblical messaging and Jesus on the cross references, with ancient seas standing in for an extra heavy-handed dose of God cleansing the earth metaphorical imagery, because why let a character ""just die"" in a book when the scene can be overdetermined and loaded with sacrificial vocabulary to make everything sound Even More Important and Super Meaningful? Everyone loves a good Christian redemption tale; “Saint Death” certainly assumes so. In case you believe that everyone in Juárez is either an impoverished slum dweller, or a depraved drug trafficker or human trafficker who has sacrificed every bit of their integrity to survive, I would like to point out that there are plenty of educated Mexican teens who could've discussed—in their own character voices—the problems in Juárez, including dehumanizing trade laws, abhorrent immigration policies, human trafficking, drug trafficking, and the threat global warming poses to Mexico and the rest of the world. I would also like to point out that the author could've *chosen* to write about Mexican characters who are fully capable of discussing these issues in their own words, rather than relying on authorial inserts to transmit his polemic through uneducated slum dwellers.I must also repeat that the writing in the first half of this book is very strong, and that this book had so much potential to be amazing. My hopes were so high that ""Saint Death"" would deliver a really powerful story. But all of the Mexican characters in “Saint Death” were the same kind of impoverished brown people and heartless brown criminals that White Society keeps holding up as representations of ""Mexico"" -- and I'm not only extremely tired of this, I don't think it's right to use uneducated brown people as story vehicles for concerns that have nothing to do with their lived realities. The main character of this book, a fourteen-year-old Mexican boy named Arturo, is not wringing his hands over rising sea levels caused by global warming. He is also not ruminating over the rapidly increasing effects of climate change due to a globalized economy that preys upon people in poverty. Arturo becomes aware of unfair trade laws in the second half of this book, after the sole white character preaches to Arturo at length about disastrous trade laws. This white man also informs Arturo that international corporations treat people like sh*t, and he brings up a lot of other stuff Arturo has never considered before. Even though Arturo knows he is hours away from being butchered and tortured to death by a soulless drug lord, he still takes time to consider the white man’s screed against corporate power. While Arturo does understand that crossing into the United States is difficult, he is not concerned with the global human migration problem, and that is not even part of the white character’s screed in this book—that is the sole domain of the omniscient narrative inserts. Arturo dreams of fish and the ocean because the author wanted to add imagery about the rising sea levels that threaten to flood so many coastal cities on earth. I kept picturing Arturo as a small, fragile donkey, a human beast of burden who is loaded down with a story-weight six times his own size: a lumpy, ungainly package stuffed full of all the philosophical, economic, and political points the author wanted to make in this book.In the second half of ""Saint Death,"" Arturo betrays himself and the established reality of the story in order to behave as the author wanted him to. Arturo attacks a young woman/teen girl without ever reflecting on the behavior of the drug traffickers and all the ""disappeared"" women repeatedly brought up in the story, even though these missing women have had such a huge impact on Arturo's own life. He never realizes that he has suddenly become what he hates, and only stops his behavior when he realizes the money to be gained from his attack isn't enough to save him, so continued effort is pointless.Then Arturo lets the reader know he had a far more selfish reason to go out of his way to help his friend Faustino. If you're looking for selfless heroes in Mexico, best look elsewhere. And most problematically, Arturo wants the reader to believe that anyone can just show up at a border crossing anytime with some money in their pocket and hire a coyote. (Goodbye, reality; I guess you really never existed in this book.) And Arturo would also like the reader to know that somehow all the details shared in the story about drug lords hunting people down was not really true, and that people who have betrayed a gang leader can still escape with their lives.Um, okay. Thanks for reminding me reality never existed in this book. Also, if a friend owns a gun, and you're facing a long and torturous gang death that you know you cannot escape, wouldn't a bullet be the preferred way to go? Wouldn’t Arturo be intelligent enough to reason that out for himself? Nothing about the book's ending made any logical sense, given the details on the page. Everyone in ""Saint Death"" does reprehensible things, and the story uses mutilation and death as the primary forms of redemption. (Because affluent white readers all love a good Christian redemption tale, of course.) There is also a LOT of cussing in Spanish, which emphasizes the impoverished, uneducated state of the main characters, but I don't think all of these curse words would ever have been printed in English. Placing so many curse words in Spanish allowed the story to have a lot more foul language than is typical in most YA novels right now.If you are in the mood to read a White Man’s Burden lashed to the skinny back of an impoverished brown boy born on the wrong side of a border, then “Saint Death” is the novel for you....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,Aug 2017,"Aug 09, 2017","Aug 01, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30177266-saint-death

That is the real hunger her book title speaks of, and the reason why this memoir is stunning.I loved her final chapters most of all. I want to quote them, but I don't want to spoil them. I want her sentences to be the found gems at the end of the journey, the way the author certainly meant them to be. Her great power in being a person of size is the constant tension she knows she lives with, framed by all the opposing opinions she holds. She recognizes she will probably always struggle with self-acceptance, and the memories of the trauma that changed her forever.

Adrian whines and whinges about his lack of a phone throughout the course of the novel, which follows the events of his life over a period of two weeks. Since Adrian has an allowance, and plenty of spending money to eat out at restaurants, purchase snacks at school or on road trips, pay for art supplies, host his own comic book website, and he even buys craft supplies to make a superhero costume, I honestly had no idea why buying a phone was such a big deal. There weren't any prices listed in the book, concerning how much a new phone would cost, so I'm guessing he needed one that was maybe $600.00 or more. In which case, why has he already broken so many, and why doesn't he have a protective case for these expensive phones? Adrian is a very clumsy boy who freaks out a lot, he frequently makes random outbursts like ""ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!"" as he fumbles his way through the story -- he seems like the kind of person whose parents would make sure he has a protective case for a phone, especially since he's already broken so many.Other drama and hardship surround Adrian in this story -- but none of it is real, and nothing comes of any of it. The biggest bully at school in the book is actually one of Adrian's secret admirers, a long-time fan of his artwork who praises Adrian on his website. Though Adrian draws a superhero art panel of this bully releasing his ""dark rage"" upon Adrian, the truth is, Adrian smashed his own nose tripping over his own feet, and this random ""dark rage"" plot thread that comes up about halfway through the book is dropped from the story.There are a lot of random plot threads in this novel. ""Draw the Line"" reads like at least four different YA storylines smashed into one, and all of them are of the adult-wish-fulfillment variety. There is the insta-love and Happily Ever After of YA romance; the bully-transformation YA storyline; the rocky-friendship redemption YA storyline; the coming-out and gay-acceptance storyline of a YA LGBT bildungsroman.The mash-up of all these different plotlines in this novel felt awkward, unbelievable, and unsatisfying. The prose style is also quite messy. Action scenes are difficult to follow, and are not this author's strength. Romantic scenes or action scenes that have a lot of build-up are frequently skipped over in the timeline, and then Adrian will relate that scene to the reader as a memory, sharing the details as backstory. Narrative choices like this are frustrating and sloppy.All of the secondary characters in this book read like stereotypes, or are outright ridiculous on their own. Adrian's two best friends are a curvy, sassy black fashionista and a tall, white Goth boy with a mom who is mentally ill and a drunk. This mother screams like a banshee whenever Adrian sees her, she calls Adrian a ""homo"" and a ""fag"" and tells him he needs to stay out of her house. She beats on doors and behaves in physically threatening ways. She also has giant paintings of Jesus in her home and makes a big deal about how she's a Christian. Though she is obviously mentally unhinged, and the scariest character in the book, she is dropped from the storyline about halfway through the novel.The ""jocks"" at school are no friends of Adrian's, and he refers to them throughout the novel as ""bubbas,"" ""pricks,"" and ""dicks."" Early in the book, a flamboyant/overly-dramatic homosexual theater student calls a boy in the hallway a ""damn cow pussy"" to insult him, and later has his face smashed in on the back of the car. The injured theater student is also told, ""God hates fags,"" by ""the bubbas,"" and this is the ""violent hate crime"" cited on the book jacket as the incident that sets Adrian on a course of action to use his art to ""combat bullying"" at school. While I support Adrian's opinion that name-calling is wrong and no one should be attacked for their sexual orientation, it bothered me that Adrian had no problem name-calling his classmates, and had no problem hearing other gay students name-call people in the hallways. I understand that victims often feel justified in lashing out against the people who bully them, and resort to using all the same tactics their bullies use to inflict harm. But that is not ""superhero"" behavior, and being angry about being called a ""fag"" while you have no problem calling someone a ""pussy"" or a ""prick"" to insult them is the height of hypocrisy. Though this story is set in Texas, no one in the book understands *any* Spanish, and Spanish is openly mocked by Adrian's friends. While Adrian is passionate about learning French, and shows obvious respect for that language, the ""Spanish dialogue"" in these pages isn't really Spanish at all, and only exists for cheap laughs. The one Hispanic character in the book is a menacing wrestling student who gives Adrian a lot of scary looks in the hallway. I assumed that this Hispanic wrestler had been put on the page to end up as a boyfriend for the only other person of color in the book, the sassy black fashionista -- and that assumption proved to be correct. Early in the book, Adrian's father is introduced as a disabled man who must be constantly cared for by Adrian and his mother. The story shows that the father is an ungrateful burden in Adrian's family, a source of hardship in Adrian's life, and the primary reason why Adrian's mother cannot afford to buy Adrian a new phone. Later, the father is walking around with a cane, Adrian no longer provides care for him, and all conflict around the father is simply removed. Adrian's parents are happy and peaceful, supportive and loving, and have no problems at all when they learn their son is gay. I'm not even going to discuss the insta-love in this book, except to say that if you really enjoy insta-love and Happily Ever After love stories in YA romance, then you should definitely read ""Draw the Line."" If you pick up this novel expecting reality, or any kind of serious examination of homophobia, then the hardcore stereotypes and randomly-dropped plot threads in this book will disappoint you. If you pick up ""Draw the Line"" expecting to read an adult wish-fulfillment tale, a story stuffed full of happiness and optimism and aggressive silliness, then you'll probably love this book.Overall, I found ""Draw the Line"" to be predictable, unrealistic, and loaded with stereotypes. The main character was a whiny hypocrite and everyone around him was gross. I enjoyed none of these characters. There was not one person I liked, and I really didn't care if Adrian ever got a new phone. The treatment of Spanish in this book was especially insulting. The disability representation was highly problematic.

Popularly known as ""the Black Lives Matter novel,"" this is an In terms of importance, the YA contemporary, ""The Hate U Give,"" is the It Book of 2017. Popularly known as ""the Black Lives Matter novel,"" this is an accurate description and a big reason why this book is relevant and important to read.The novel also portrays a certain type of inner-city black culture in highly positive ways, thereby humanizing people of color who are so often stigmatized and dehumanized in fiction as well as real life.Do I recommend this book? Well... that's complicated. As an ""important"" book, ""The Hate U Give"" is part of the conversation about race in America right now. I support Black Lives Matter, and I like to see it fictionally represented in a novel that openly endorses this movement.I also think this is a great novel for teen readers, especially all the black teens in America who need to see themselves and hear their own voices in fiction -- this book should certainly be put in their hands.For those reasons, I recommend this book. For me personally though, I had a lot of problems with this novel, which is why I'm not including a rating. I'll briefly explain what I didn't like about this book, since I'm obviously moving the wrong way through the gears of the Super Hype Machine surrounding ""The Hate U Give."" In the ocean of 5-star s for this novel, I personally can't even give this book 3 stars. I'd give it 2. First, I must say, anyone who characterizes the main character -- a sixteen-year-old high school student named Starr Carter -- as a ""poor girl"" from the ghetto, or a ""girl rising up out of poverty,"" has no idea what they're talking about. Starr was *not* raised in poverty, and she isn't poor, either. Her parents are married, her family owns a small inner-city grocery store that sells fresh produce (see more on ""unicorns"" later), they own their house, they own two cars, their oldest teenage son (a senior in high school) drives his own Mustang, they buy a house in the suburbs during the course of this book, Starr owns two laptops, a smart phone, nice clothing, this family eats out all the time (IHOP, pizza places, local eateries, etc.), Starr owns several pairs of expensive athletic shoes/basketball sneakers as fashion statements, Starr and her two siblings all attend private/prep schools their parents must pay for (Starr has some scholarship money but not her two brothers), Starr buys a fancy prom dress and shoes and other stuff in this book, and no one ever bats an eye over money; Starr's parents expect her and her brothers to go to college one day and have the means to help pay for higher education.Starr's uncle lives in a mansion in a gated community of other beautiful mansions where her rich prep school friends also live. Starr's prep school friends are all upper-middle class. Starr's family is on the high end of middle class, closer to ""upper"" than ""lower"" on that sliding scale.This is all one of the big ways the black characters ""in the ghetto"" are ""humanized"" in this story -- they're all upper-middle class or high-end middle class. As someone who grew up in poverty, and has visited friends who live in inner-city ghettos, I just shake my head at all the money these people have in this book. Some serious wish-fulfillment went into these pages. A ghetto grocery store owner and a hospital nurse are not going to fund the family lifestyle Starr has in this novel, and just thinking about how unrealistic this book is about class and material wealth makes me gnash my teeth.Then there are the characters themselves, who are all such fiercely angelic people I often wondered if I was reading about unicorns rather than human beings. There are only three ""bad guys"" in this story -- a white cop who murders a black teen boy, a black drug lord, and a white racist teen girl who gets her comeuppance when Starr punches her and kicks the crap out of her at school. The Angelic Voices of Moral Authority are embodied by every other character in this book -- most especially Starr's mother and father, her affluent uncle Carlos, and her white prep school boyfriend, Chris. All of these Angelic People are Good and Righteous and Right in this book, and their behavior made ""The Hate U Give"" read like a fairy tale, not real life. As an #ownvoices book, I can appreciate that the author had every right to pen her own wish fulfillment novel. While reading the book, I kept reminding myself that fairy tales need to exist for us all, and quickly decided that ""The Hate U Give"" was an inner-city fairy tale set in Nowhere, U.S.A. The story isn't placed in the South, East, North, or West -- the author presented ""Garden Heights"" as a generic hood neighborhood, and there are no markers as to where in the U.S.A. this city exists, other than a lot of unicorns live in this fictional place. Starr herself is pretty selfish and highly unlikeable for parts of this book. The story begins with her witnessing the death of a close friend, a cousin-ish guy who was also her first crush, and she still has some romantic feelings for him. His name is Khalil, and Starr watches a white police officer shoot Khalil in the back and kill him. Khalil is unarmed, had been doing nothing wrong when he was pulled over, and his death is a senseless murder. For a long time, Starr isn't sure how involved she should be with speaking out or testifying against this police officer. Early in the book, she tells the reader she wasn't raised to fear the police, and that when she was twelve, her parents had a talk with her ""about what to do if a cop stopped"" her (page 20). I paused when I read that, and thought it was proof that Starr hadn't grown up poor, and hadn't really grown up in the ghetto, either. By the time I was twelve, I'd seen enough police violence against my family that no one needed to sit me down for a ""talk."" Kids in my family were all raised to fear the police, adults in my world all hated and feared the police, and just seeing a police car on the street made everyone tense up and go silent, waiting for the danger to pass. The danger didn't always pass, though. We could be pulled over for anything, often for no reason at all, and we frequently were. I was pulled over and harassed as a teen, not because I was doing anything wrong but just because of who I was, and both times it happened, I went home and cried, shaking and scared, and glad no one had pulled a gun on me, because cops did aim their guns at my dad. Starr's uncle Carlos is a detective on the city's police force, and the reader is told this is why Starr doesn't fear the police. While she does watch some officers rough up her dad in the book, I was shaking my head yet again. If she'd really grown up poor in the ghetto, then she'd have seen that happen before she turned sixteen. In the story, witnessing her father's debasement is shocking to her because she's never seen law enforcement disrespect her father like that -- even though her dad spent three years in prison. My father also spent time in prison, the police in my hometown knew that, and they didn't respect my dad because of it. Police roughed him up on more than one occasion, threatening to blow his brains out for silly stuff like running a stop sign due to his vehicle sliding on ice, or being intoxicated in public, or giving someone a dirty look -- but in ""The Hate U Give,"" Starr has never seen police disrespect her dad until after Khalil is shot dead. This is unrealistic to me. And the book felt irresponsible to me for that reason.Later in the story, Starr has decided to speak out and testify on behalf of Khalil, but she wants to keep her identity secret. Her rich prep school classmates decide to participate in a protest against Khalil's death, and because they want to protest in order to skip school for the day, Starr gets pissed and stays at school, protesting the protest.This kind of selfish behavior did not sit well with me. Whatever those spoiled rich kids might be doing, Starr chose to be involved with this case, and Khalil was her FRIEND. He was her friend and he's DEAD. Dead for NO F*CKING REASON. Her school decides to protest? She ought to be there. Period. I don't care what's going on in the heads of a bunch of spoiled rich white kids. They're marching for Khalil, who is DEAD, who was MURDERED, and Starr is sitting there steaming over her sh*tty classmates ""not getting it."" You know what I don't get? How she can be Khalil's friend and act like that. If a cop shot my friend -- a boy I grew up with, a great guy I had a crush on -- I'd be out there f*cking marching. Especially if I was the star witness, and was already putting my life on the line testifying against the officer who shot my friend in the back. Starr was often very selfish and petty and acted like the world revolved around her in this book -- which is to say, she often acted like the ignorant upper-middle-class white kids around her -- and protesting Khalil's protest march was one of those moments. She wants to sit there in a snit about her petty, selfish classmates when her friend is DEAD and his KILLER WENT FREE -- and yet sitting in class is better for her to ""protest racism"" than joining the ACTUAL PROTEST for her murdered friend. Ugghhhhh.This is not my reality. Not as an adult, and sure as hell not when I was sixteen. If some racist cop shot my friend, I don't care what the motives are behind the other people joining the protest -- I'd be out there with them, howling for justice for my dead friend. The middle of this book -- Part II -- really dragged for me. Fairy tale details abound here, as well as plot holes, since I thought Starr's friends should be able to recognize her voice on a tape. The story picked up a lot in Parts III, IV, and V. I really enjoyed the final section of the book, when Starr begins to stop being so petty and take action. She starts speaking out publicly, and there is a scene with tear gas that I loved.But after that scene, the kids take refuge in Starr's family grocery store, and what followed was such unrealistic fairy tale nonsense that I couldn't finish the book, even though I only had one chapter left. I tried to force myself to finish reading the last chapter, and I just couldn't. ""The Hate U Give"" had just become too unrealistic for me to keep reading.This is an important book. It's an #ownvoices book. I still recommend people read this book for those reasons.

Specifically, undocumented immigrants from Mexico.The entire time I spent reading ""Red Lightning,"" I kept hearing current U.S. President Donald Trump in my head -- I kept hearing those infamous lines from his presidential announcement speech on June 16, 2015 --“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”If you agree with those statements (and many people do), then ""Red Lightning"" will affirm and reward these beliefs.But if you follow news media sources that have debunked these claims, researched the facts, and consistently reported that crime statistics and immigrant data do not support President Trump's words whatsoever, then ""Red Lightning"" will be a highly upsetting novel to read. I have heard award-winning literary author Laura Pritchett read aloud from her work in person, and I have heard her state, ""No one is illegal. People are not illegal."" So I know her heart is in the right place. I don't think she intended for her novel to hurt me as much as it did.But this book is severely damaging. If you are someone who is intimately involved with anyone who is an undocumented immigrant in the U.S., I suggest you avoid reading this book. I found it highly offensive, full of factual errors, and entirely racist. The protagonist of this book -- a white, cis, able-bodied, lower-middle class woman from Colorado named Tess -- works for a Mexican gang involved in *both* human trafficking and drug trafficking. (Just the fact that these two activities are combined in one gang ought to raise a lot of red flags. There are no sources cited for this book, and nothing about the Mexican drug+human trafficking gang in this book sounded accurate. From everything I have read about these two activities, they are separate, performed by separate groups of people and gangs, and are often in conflict with each other.) Tess describes herself as ""a part-time levantona"" -- which in this story, translates to something like 'a female pick-up driver of undocumented immigrants.' But in the narco-language of the human trafficking/drug trafficking world in reality, ""levanton"" has a very different meaning. It applies to a specific kind of human trafficking: kidnapping people, primarily for the purpose of murder. But don't expect realistic narco-terms to show up in this book. Tess is clueless about kidnappings and drug money. She is also clueless about the people she works for and how they operate. And she is *REALLY* clueless about gangs in general, even though they employ her, and have for some time. She doesn't even know what specific kinds of drugs her employers are trafficking, or the details about her own pickups. As she states on page 21, ""I was always on the periphery. Never that much in the know. Which gang was which gang, so on, so forth.""And yet, Tess has worked as ""a part-time levantona"" for many years, maybe as many as ten. She is the most unbelievable employee of a human trafficking/drug-trafficking gang ever, a person who could only exist in a work of fiction, because there is absolutely nothing believable about any of the illegal trafficking described in this book. Of the information Tess *does* know about her human trafficking work, she says that all undocumented immigrants are ""more or less required to carry stuff"" such as ""coca y mota"" -- (which translates to ""coke and pot"") -- before coming over the border. So if you believe that all undocumented immigrants are bringing drugs with them into the United States, then the slanderous crap Tess shares in dialogue in this book will make you want to stand up and cheer. Not only do the undocumented immigrants in this novel bring drugs with them -- but they also start forest fires. A group of Mexican immigrants in ""Red Lightning"" start ""the worst wildfire in Colorado history"" (page 72). I have lived in Colorado for decades, and I have *NEVER* heard of an undocumented immigrant starting a wildfire. My husband has worked for the Colorado Department of Transportation for almost forty years, and he's never heard of this happening, either.This wildfire premise sounds like something President Trump could have added to his presidential announcement speech: ""They're bringing drugs. They're starting wildfires. They're starting the worst wildfires in history."" Not that the wildfire in ""Red Lightning"" or the undocumented immigrants are even the main focus of this book. Both are just plot devices in a story of a White Woman Who Must Heal and Self-Actualize, also known as the story of a White Woman Who Needs a Purpose in Life. When the story begins, Tess is currently homeless, penniless, and afflicted with a number of physical ailments, including a severe tooth infection, a yeast infection, and a self-inflicted gash on her face. Her self-harming tendencies are due to her emotional/psychological problems, which have gone untreated for so long she has become suicidal. Despite what a physical and psychological mess she is in, Tess remains highly judgmental -- even scornful -- of her sister, who has successfully raised a baby Tess gave birth to and immediately abandoned. That child is now ten years old, and as Tess has hit rock-bottom in life, she has decided she would like to see her daughter before she either runs off to the Midwest or kills herself, whichever comes first. The root of Tess's psychological breakdown stems from being called ""a slut"" by her classmates, which started at age ten, and was made worse by the occasional meanness of her hardworking alcoholic mother. Tess's stepfather (who is deceased by the time the story begins) was actually a really great guy, and Tess truly loved him and remembers his words of wisdom from her years as a teen. But I guess the pain of being called ""a slut"" and her mom's drinking were simply too much. Tess decided she was born for a life of partying and fun (she actually says this somewhere in the book), and she runs around and has lots and lots of sex with guys who don't care about her (another confession), before an event in the desert finally wakes her up.Tess's wake-up call in the desert is one of the most racist scenes in the book. Five years before the story begins, Tess is working for one of her human trafficking gangs, and picks up a family of undocumented Mexican immigrants. At one point, she pulls over, leaves the vehicle to pee, and finds the corpse of a pregnant undocumented immigrant in a state of decay on the ground. Tess is shaken up by seeing the skeleton of the fetus, and reflects on how she was able to give birth to a living child she abandoned. In a moment of reconnecting with her lost sense of motherhood, Tess kneels down beside the corpse, and reaches into ""the pelvis of this woman.""""I touched this baby's skull. Wanted to pull it up, wanted to free it from the cavity, get it out in the space between ribcage and pelvis. Even if it meant all the other bones would crumble. I did that. I pulled hard. I freed the skull. I cradled it."" (page 77)The act of cradling this skull to her chest gives Tess her sense of humanity back, and makes her able ""to mother"" again. (page 78)If you are okay with treating the bodies of dead human beings like this, and see no problem with snapping off the skulls of dead fetuses from the remains of corpses you find in the desert, then by all means, ""Red Lightning"" is certainly the novel for you. I found this to be horrifying behavior, extremely disrespectful, and not at all an appropriate way to respond to a partially-decayed human corpse found in the desert. Later in the book, after Tess is reunited with her sister and daughter, the Colorado wildfire is burning, eight undocumented immigrants Tess was supposed to pick up might be dead, and in an effort to make herself feel better, Tess has painful sex with her common-law husband/lover and fellow gang employee, a white man named Slade. Slade tells Tess that the consequences of all the awful things they have done can be avoided if they just move to Mexico. ""We get to Mexico, we adopt some kids. To make up for it. Maybe not adopt them in the formal sense, but you know, take them under our wing. To make up for it."" (page 107)Like snapping the skull off a dead fetus, those statements are just taken as appropriate, normal, or understandable. As if it would be normal or understandable for anyone to talk like this or think this way. But I find this dialogue horrifying and revolting. It's one of the crudest examples of White People Using Abject Brown People to Self-Actualize. In Slade's mind, and in Tess's thoughts and behavior throughout this book, the poor Mexican children aren't worthy enough to formally adopt, but they're good enough to be nice to in order to earn White Redemption. Tess doesn't end up going to Mexico, but in a high-action climax involving a gun and a couple of bad hombres, she does earn White Redemption, and Mother Redemption, and finds her way through the Journey of Healing. On behalf of any undocumented Mexican immigrants who might read this book, I would just like to say I am sorry. I didn't write this novel, but I'm really, really sorry ""Red Lightning"" has the content it does.

Joan Didion has the most bitter, cutting prose I've ever encountered.She has a dark mood, and her ideology runs toward nihilism -- often skimming the surface of meaninglessness even when she's not plunging right in. Reading her prose is like arctic diving: jumping into small holes in the ice with an anchor rope firmly tied to reality. This type of exercise might leave one feeling refreshed or shivering with fatigue. I tend toward the latter after reading the essays in ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem.""Ms. Didion's biting prose is quite often beautiful, and I believe she is at her best when she has a tight focus. Training her lens on a single, corporeal subject, and filling her sentences with observations drawn from experience, essays like ""John Wayne: A Love Song,"" ""Marrying Absurd,"" ""The Seacoast of Despair,"" and ""Guayamas, Sonora"" achieve the sublime. Then she has other, lesser moments, when her unspoken privilege shines through. Moments when she makes sweeping generalizations that are intellectually bankrupt. Sometimes Ms. Didion shares philosophical nonsense masquerading as something profound. In ""On Morality,"" Joan Didion calls into question anyone's use of the word ""moral"" as justification for action. ""Because when we start deceiving ourselves into thinking not that we want something or need something, not that it is a pragmatic necessity for us to have it, but that it is a *moral imperative* that we have it, then is when we join the fashionable madmen, and then is when the thin whine of hysteria is heard in the land, and then is when we are in bad trouble. And I suspect we are already there.""Those are the closing words of that essay, with the date-stamp ""1965"" attached at the end.Statements like that left me feeling repulsed. Joan Didion: a white, able-bodied, neurotypical, middle class, cis, heterosexual woman, penning an essay during the Civil Rights movement, stating that any ""moral imperative"" invoked for a ""want"" or ""need"" considered to be a ""pragmatic necessity"" is actually the first sign of hysteria. Excuse me, Ms. Didion, but your privilege is showing. Some of these essays are horribly dated. ""On Morality"" is one. I found the title essay, ""Slouching Towards Bethlehem,"" to be incredibly dull, a litany of recorded details all taken at face value, presented in a hodgepodge stream of recorded conversation that didn't ever probe for deeper answers or chip away through the surface absurdity.

The first half of this collection of memoir-essays is sooooo funny. I really loved the first 40% of this book.But since the book opens with an essay about the author being a ""Tom Man,"" I must state that there is a giant disconnect in this book. I consider myself kind of feminine, but I can seriously out-tomboy/out-tom-man Jessi Klein ANY day. And since she's only a few years older than me, this isn't millennial whinging on my part. I belong to the same generational demographic, and I can tell you right now, Jessi Klein isn't nearly the tom-man she claims to be. ""Being a tomboy"" just sounds funny to her, so she runs with it, but she isn't a ""tom man,"" and she's not telling the truth. This is a woman with a huge Inner Princess and some super low-self-esteem problems. While the mash-up is funny and insightful in her youth, a change in financial status in her mid-twenties/early thirties reveals an Inner Princess rules the roost of Jessi Klein's psyche, not her much-maligned little tomboy. The author goes through a big transformation in life: from being middle class and awkward to being much-much-higher-middle-class with lots and lots of discretionary spending money. Finally, the Inner Princess can come out to play! Fancy clothes, makeup, $375.00 pieces of lingerie, boyfriend drama, more boyfriend drama, and then a wedding proposal and wedding dress shopping-- these are the subjects that dominate this memoir. Jessi Klein vacations at super-expensive celebrity resorts and self-empowerment ranches and wins an Emmy and undergoes lots of fertility treatments so she can have her first baby at age 38 (or 39, maybe? by the time she finally conceived) -- because immediately after her wedding, her husband announced he wanted a baby, and Jessi Klein realized she really wanted a baby, too. If you are a white, cis, able-bodied, hetero, upper-middle class woman who struggles with the dramas of entitlement and privilege, while busily trying to ""have it all"" and like, vacation on a yacht with movie stars and stuff, you'll probably love this book a lot more than I did. But after finishing this memoir, I don't feel satisfied or happy -- I just feel tired and aggravated. (Actually, I must admit I didn't read the whole book -- I skipped ""The Wedding Dress"" essay/chapter because reading about Jessi Klein ""the supposed tomboy"" girling-out over a wedding dress was too barf-inducing to tolerate.) If you are a woman who has spent her entire life trying to reconcile her Inner Princess with the hardships of ""having it all"" then this might be the perfect read for you. There's plenty of unexamined patriarchal norms and misogyny in this book to load up a cargo ship and sail around the globe a few times.I recommend the first 40% of this book for Jessi Klein's great writing and hilarity.

There are structural problems in the storytelling, unexplained tangents thatAs a work of fiction, the middle grade/YA novel ""Moon at Nine"" is a mess. There are structural problems in the storytelling, unexplained tangents that read as emotionless scenes, and jumps in the timeline that feel chaotic and arbitrary. The reader is also required to understand a *LOT* of historical context and cultural detail on their own -- which is fine for an adult reader. But had I been eleven, twelve, sixteen or even eighteen years old, much of this book would've gone over my head, and I probably would've DNF'd before the first fifty pages.What must be emphasized with this novel, however -- more so than any of its structural problems -- is that it's not really a novel at all. This is a work of creative nonfiction, with enough details changed that the author and publisher could slap on the label of ""fiction."" In the Author's Note, the reader learns the protagonist of this story, a fifteen-year-old Iranian named Farrin, survived the events in this book, and lived to tell the tale. Author Deborah Ellis, who has won many awards for her work in children's literature, chose to share this woman's story with the world, and the author decided that the best way to do that was to turn the real-life story of Farrin into a middle-grade/YA novel. I think that was an exceedingly unfortunate choice, but what's done is done. The novel is a rough mess, and the first half of the book has so many emotionless, disconnected scenes because the story is far more suited to the realm of adult fiction. But the real-life Farrin is definitely still here on the page, sharing her story with us. And for every structural problem that exists in this book, the dark, horrifying reality of the world still shines through in all its terror and heartbreak. Which is why ""Moon at Nine"" is still worth a 5-star rating to me, the rating of a book I wholeheartedly recommend others read. If you have ever read Marjane Satrapi's brilliant, and highly accessible, graphic autobiography, ""Persepolis,"" (which was also turned into a film), you'll be familiar with most of the story details in ""Moon at Nine."" Farrin was a child during the Islamic Revolution. Her affluent, entitled, and embittered parents were trapped in Iran after the fall of the Shah, and Farrin is fifteen by the time the Iran-Iraq War ends in 1988. This is when the plot of the book really starts, about midway through the novel. After the war, Farrin falls in love with one of her female classmates, and once the two teens are caught kissing at school, they are both severely punished for their ""crime"" of ""deviant"" behavior. The details of what happens to them is the beating heart of this novel.The rough beginning of this book has to do with the author's attempts to make Farrin and her parents more ""likeable"" to the reader, and to build sympathy for them due to the fact that they've lived through a revolution and almost a decade of war. And the truth is, these are privileged, entitled people who behave in privileged, entitled ways. Which is to say, Farrin and her parents are gross. The author goes to great lengths to keep the reader trapped in the mindset of a young, naive Farrin, but at the same time, the reader is expected to understand the historical context as an adult. There is a giant disconnect here. As an adult reader, I can clearly see Farrin is selfish, spoiled, entitled, and cold. She has grown up in a selfish, cold, and highly affluent household. Her parents are brutal people who do brutal things. No amount of ""gloss"" the author tries to give these people can cover up their abhorrent sense of entitlement, their narcissism, or the violence they are capable of to protect their own privilege.Farrin is often highly unlikeable, and her parents are more unlikeable still. Had this book been adult fiction, the author could've embraced Farrin's complicity, rather than trying to emphasize her youth in a drastic effort to portray her as an innocent victim. Farrin is certainly a victim, and all teenagers have a high degree of innocence as a result of their youth -- but Farrin isn't morally clean. By the age of fifteen, she is the near-grown product of her parents, and her mindset of privilege is burdened by all of the moral dilemmas of her worldview. Farrin is not a character of integrity -- she is already morally stained. But the teenager she falls in love with -- an amazing young woman named Sadira -- is a character who *is* morally pure, and full of integrity. The scenes with Sadira are the real joy of this book, because Sadira is the kind of protagonist who stars in most middle-grade/YA fiction. But this isn't really a novel. Farrin's tale is a narrative slice of real life. Which means Sadira -- and Sadira's moral purity -- also belong to real life. And what happens to people like Sadira, in the world of real life? You can certainly guess, I hope. I would hope anyone can predict what becomes of the innocent and the morally pure in a fascist regime. Especially a fascist regime touting itself as a religiously fundamentalist return to God's will, such as the Islamic totalitarian government in Iran. In reflecting on ""Moon at Nine,"" let me name two magnificent adult novels that also embrace the destruction of innocents in real life: ""A Separate Peace"" by John Knowles and ""The God of Small Things"" by Arundhati Roy. If you are at all familiar with the fate of the morally-pure Finny in ""A Separate Peace,"" or the fate of the astoundingly kind, beautiful, and loving Velutha in ""The God of Small Things,"" then you'll understand Sadira's role in ""Moon at Nine"" -- which, I have no doubt, is also exactly true to real life. It is the ending of this book that most perfectly functions as a novel, because only in the final third of this book does all narrative pretense fall away, and the darkness of reality takes over.I would have preferred this story as adult fiction, and I would have *much* preferred to know Farrin as an adult. The author wanted to focus the story on how lesbians are punished as ""deviants"" in fascist regimes, and I do think that's important -- but that's really not enough for me. I wanted to know what happened to Farrin after the last page of this book. What happened with the rest of her life? And how did the adult Farrin come to tell the author her story? That, to me, is the real meat of this tale. I'm always far more interested in the aftermath of damage than in the damage itself.But I also really appreciate truth, and ""Moon at Nine"" tells the truth. It's a hideous truth, and the author's attempts to sugar-coat and gloss over Farrin's moral ugliness as a teenager hinders the first half of this book. But the truth of real life is still there, exploding out of these pages. And that, to me, is worth rating this book all five stars.I recommend ""Moon at Nine"" to anyone who enjoys dark, morally-complicit novels like ""The God of Small Things"" and ""A Separate Peace."" Because Farrin is no traditional hero. While I did come to care about her, and feel tremendous sympathy for her, this is a story loaded with unexamined privilege and rampaging selfishness. And nothing can compare with the selfishness of Farrin's own parents, or the atrocities of the Iranian regime. The material in this book is horrifying, and it's absolutely worth reading. You'll know the truth when you see it. The absurdity and cruelty of Iranian officials, as well as the casual murder and torture of innocent Iranian citizens in this book is entirely gripping. This is Farrin's eyewitness account, and it's stunning....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 20, 2017","Jul 29, 2017","Jul 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18854738-moon-at-nine

Printz Award in 2011.If you enjoy action-packed YA fantasies like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Shadow and Bone,"" you'll probably love this book. ""Ship Breaker"" is especially geared toward teen boys, so if you're looking for a Christmas or birthday gift for a male teen reader, and they haven't encountered this book yet, then ""Ship Breaker"" will probably be a big hit. It's a super-popular book and plenty of people who don't know anything about how ships work or how ocean navigation works just 5-starred the hell out of this. I envy them. Because I really wish I could 5-star this book. The first third of this novel is so good, I didn't want to put this book down, and I finished ""Ship Breaker"" as fast as I could.But this book gave up reality at the halfway point, and descended into an uber-ridiculous, completely frustrating and unrealistic plotline throughout the second half of the book. It was so bad that I want nothing to do with the sequels, and there are two sequels now -- the third book in this series is scheduled to be published this October, 2017.In brief: lots of fancy, futuristic ships fill the second half of this novel. These ships of the future have solar batteries and powerful cannons, sleek missiles and sails that soar high in the atmosphere and can pull the entire giant vessel into a flying-state, so that the hull is only skimming the water. But these ships have no sonar. NO SONAR AT ALL. They have satellite tech, all kinds of futuristic navigation equipment, they can even hunt other ships across an entire ocean. But they have. No. Sonar.I call bullsh*t. I call bullsh*t on the entire ending of this book. It was beyond aggravating and it's the primary reason I'm giving this book a 2-star rating.Why did the author need this GAPING PLOT HOLE in the second half of his book? Because the teen hero must go and save the Beautiful Rich Girl who he has Fallen In Love With because this teen girl is So Gorgeous and So Rich that she is Capitalist Royalty, the daughter of a Corporate Scion of Immense Power, and did I mention her life is inherently Worth More than the lives of all her Poor Servants?Look, I get it. I understand that society wants us to know that rich people are ""worth more"" than poor people, and that poor people should sacrifice themselves to keep rich, beautiful people alive at all costs. I totally understand that even dystopian YA fantasy novels need to keep reminding us that rich, beautiful people are also Inherently Good. ""Ship Breaker"" touts that message, and takes it to a certain extreme. A lot of people appreciate hearing this message, and love books that reward them for holding this view. This novel will certainly reward you for holding that view. Teen boys love this book because a poor grubber gets to be the Prince Charming and save the Gorgeous Princess. And the boy-hero's poor, grubby, drug-addicted, and super-sadistic/flat-out-evil father is somehow the ONE PERSON the boy must defeat in hand-to-hand combat in order to save the Gorgeous Princess. Why any wealthy shipping captain ever allowed this drug-addicted, unhinged killing machine onto their boat to begin with makes no sense at all. The appearance of this evil father on such an expensive, well-heeled, and well-crewed ship was another plot hole as gaping and obvious as the lack of sonar on all these high-tech futuristic ships. But the author wanted a specific plotline to follow. Reality be damned.The first half of ""Ship Breaker"" is realistic, gripping, and absolutely compelling. The author did a lot of research about the real-life people in poverty who break down old ships to survive. The details were excellent, and I was in love with this book.And then the story left that real-life setting behind, and with it, all sense of reality. Problems like thirst, hunger, sickness, infection, and gritty survival in poverty were simply discarded for Fancy Futuristic Ships and a fairy tale plotline of saving the Princess and dealing with daddy-issues in mortal combat. On a sinking futuristic ship. Because these people have no sonar. The ridiculous ending of this book deserves negative stars. And the messaging in this novel that rich, beautiful people are worth more than poor people *certainly* deserves negative stars. In this story, the black-skinned, impoverished teen girl named Pima was far more deserving of the protagonist's love than the Gorgeous Princess dripping in gold. While this author is a very strong writer, and the sentence-level prose of this book is often excellent, there was a high overuse of the word ""feral,"" as well as the phrase ""a bright blossom of pain."" The protagonist suffers many ""blossoms of pain"" in this book. Repetition like that was annoying. But the beginning of this book is truly excellent. The first hundred pages of ""Ship Breaker"" are all 5-star glorious. I'm shocked that this novel won such a prestigious award. Even though the author heavily researched the first third of this book, the rest of the novel is so highly unrealistic, you'd have to understand nothing about how ships work in order to enjoy the entire second half of this book. Plus you have to really love Save The Gorgeous Princess tales. So if this sounds like your jam, then you'll definitely love ""Ship Breaker."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 13, 2017","Aug 14, 2017","Jul 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7095831-ship-breaker

The realities of 1870 Texas are all well-researched and deftly recorded in this book, but the story felt dry as stale toast, and failed to engage me at all.The plot begins after an aging/elderly white man agrees to transport a young girl across Texas to her relatives. To me, this premise lacked any stakes and felt overwhelmingly dull. ""News of the World"" is like reading ""True Grit,"" only without all the gruesome details of a traditional western. If you want the Disney Princess version of ""True Grit"" -- in which bad guys are dealt with and no one gets mutilated or loses any part of their soul trying to survive -- then this is the novel for you. There is some great cultural diversity in this book, and the customs and practices of the Kiowa tribe of Native Americans felt well-written and engaging, but those are only a small part of this book. The main character of this novel is the old white man, who is full of wisdom and pathos and nostalgia (of course), and has undertaken the civilizing care of a wild little white girl in need of an old man's love.The prose style is composed of a paragraph structure that is so hard to do well that I most often wince when I encounter it. In this brand of storytelling, the author employs an omniscient narrative voice, will focus a sentence or two on story detail, then drift into world-building abstraction for several sentences or a few paragraphs, before returning to the story again. I don't like tangential asides in an omniscient narrative voice. This prose style most often reads as distracting to me, an authorial indulgence that slows down a slow story.Other readers love this level of randomness in their prose, in which unnecessary details abound for the sake of narrative cleverness. Masterful authors find subtle, nuanced ways to tie these abstractions into the plot, and make them exciting and relevant. But I didn't find that to be the case here. I recommend ""News of the World"" to any reader who loves old soldier tales, set in an American West that is distantly frightening and only briefly threatening. This novel is slow, dry, and plodding, but packed with historical details about the time period and the extremely disorganized state government of Reconstruction-era Texas. I kept wishing the main character had been an aging/elderly woman, rather than a man. I'd have been much more engaged by that kind of radical storytelling. But I suppose the book wouldn't have qualified as an award-winning western without an old white man saving the day.

Ms. Demetrious has a strong prose style, uses beautiful details to bring a scene to life, and writes with compelling honesty about what an abusive relationship looks like and feels like for a victim.This book employs a specific ""you"" in its narration, and while it is technically correct to label ""Bad Romance"" as a story with a second person point of view, I would still label the narrative style as first person. The protagonist of this novel, a high school junior/senior named Grace, narrates her story in the first person, always addressing herself as “I” to the reader. Grace describes her life and her history in long passages which are often independent of the relationship of the title. This is really a story about Grace and her life, and she is the self-identified ""I"" of the prose. Grace narrates her story to a “you”—her abusive boyfriend, Gavin. Gavin is always referred to in the prose as “you.” So the reader, by extension, is also the “you” of the story—the abuser Grace must escape. For this reason, the book is labeled as having a second person point of view, but that second person (the employed ""you"" in the prose) was very much secondary to the ""I"" of Grace's first person point of view. I must state that I didn’t appreciate this narrative choice. While I often enjoy books written in first person, I didn’t like being the “you” of Grace’s story, thereby filling the shoes of the abusive boyfriend Grace must break free of. I understand the author chose this narrative style to make me feel more solidarity with Grace, but personally, the style made me wince, every time I saw a “you” on the page and understood the implied complicity between myself—the reader—and Gavin.Because the truth is, Gavin would never read this novel. The Gavin at the end of “Bad Romance” is too far gone into being a toxic human being to give a sh*t about Grace. Gavin has no respect for himself, and he certainly has no respect for Grace. So who is Grace really addressing as the “you” of her story? The answer is: me, the reader. And this hurt me, as a reader. It pains me that I’m the implied abuser reading my victim’s account of what I have done to her. If the author wanted me to believe Gavin is *the actual recipient* of this tale, then something should’ve been changed in the final chapters, or in the epilogue, to make me believe such a thing possible. Having finished the book, I don’t believe Gavin capable of reading Grace’s story. Not ever, not at all.And that is one of my biggest problems with “Bad Romance.” This novel is a long, glorious tribute to victimization, without ever addressing the root of victimization, and without ever trying to understand why abusers abuse.Grace is a toxic character. Long before Grace and Gavin begin their relationship, Grace has a toxic mindset. If readers cannot see how poisoned Grace is long before she starts her relationship with Gavin, I view that as further proof of how toxic our culture really is.This novel doesn’t ever use the word “feminism.” Nor do the terms “rape culture,” “toxic masculinity,” or “misogyny” make any appearances in this book. The entire novel is a tribute to Grace’s severe victimization, and that is all. The root of why she became such a victim is never identified or explored, and she doesn’t save herself. Grace does not wake herself up or save herself in this story. Her friends tell her what to do, and she finally does it. Her friends save her. Emotionally, psychologically, and by the sheer fact that her friends provide a safe home for Grace to come and live in—for free—Grace’s friends rescue her. Grace never has agency in this book. She is always a victim. And by the end of the book, all she can do is point a finger, and place blame. Not as an equal participant in the toxic relationship that caused her to suffer so much, but on “boys.” As Grace states at the end, “boys are the problems.” (page 326)“Bad Romance” is a trainwreck. To me, the messaging in this book felt as toxic as Grace. The biggest misogynist in this story is Grace’s mother, a woman who sacrificed her freedom and dignity to live with a violent abuser Grace calls “the Giant.” Over and over, Grace’s mother sabotages Grace’s mental, emotional, and physical health—even makes Grace miss taking her SATs for her college applications, repeatedly makes her late for work, and heaps upon Grace so many verbal, emotional, and physical punishments, abusing her throughout the entirety of this novel. This adult woman plays the strongest role in giving Grace the toxic mindset of a victim. Grace’s mother does this as the price she herself pays to live with the Giant. Grace’s mother is a completely toxic human being, even more so than Gavin. And this is never addressed in the story. Not once, not ever.Men are not the only misogynists in the world. Men are not the sole “problems” of abusive relationships. It takes two to tango. It takes two for an abusive relationship. It takes a toxic mindset for anyone to believe they need to “suffer” for love. Grace begins the novel with a toxic mindset, and she ends the book having never addressed the root of her own victimization. She is physically safe, living with her friends, but she is far from “healed”—far from being “emotionally safe” from an abuser. By the end of this book, Grace is only a victim who is momentarily safe from a single physical abuser. And she is only momentarily safe because she is living with her friends, friends who are physically protecting her, providing a physical barrier with their own house and their bodies to keep her safe from any outside harm. Why do I refuse to believe Grace has “saved herself” by the end of this book? Because the story made it quite clear how mentally and emotionally sick Grace really is. Because here is Grace, speaking to Grace, in lines that appear on page 282 --“You stupid fucking idiot girl. I hate you. You’re just staying with him because you’re a coward, a whore who’s too scared to be alone. Fuck you, Grace. Fuck. You.”As Grace speaks (in her own mental thoughts) to herself in that passage, she “grabs the skin” on the inside of her arm, and pinches it, “hard.” (page 282)Where did that voice come from, inside of Grace? Why does she self-talk this way? The book is silent on that. Grace’s self-talk is completely unexamined, unaddressed, and completely unhealed by the end of this novel.The brutal truth this novel never addresses is that Grace’s abusive self-talk did not come from Gavin. She talked to herself this way before the story even begins, before Gavin even so much as *smiled* at her for the first time. Gavin isn’t the only “poisonous drug” in Grace’s life. Nor is he the most important poison in this book. Grace’s abusive self-talk is the primary drug. Hating on yourself is a poison, a toxic drug, and an addiction. Hating on yourself is the necessary first drug one must become addicted to before the Gavins of the world step in and take advantage. Why do women so often engage in such abusive self-talk? This book doesn’t examine any of the roots of victimization, whether in the culture at large, or within the microcosm of culture on display in Grace’s family unit. Grace and her friends are highly intelligent, funny, and perceptive. But no one brings up the words patriarchy, rape culture, toxic masculinity, feminism, self-love or self-worth. No one talks about how women are sent a message, over and over, that men are worth more than women. And no one in the story talks about how this message—concerning a woman’s worth, goodness, or how women are expected to “behave” in the world—is the real root of all Grace’s problems. For as many times as the words “slut,” “whore,” and “bitch” appear in this book, no one addresses how wrong it is that these words even exist, much less that Grace continues to suffer the damage these words cause. I wish I had loved this book. I spent hours and hours reading it, because it’s a very long novel. Long and belabored. I kept expecting a big payoff by the end. I kept expecting the novel to reward me for being so patient.But “Bad Romance” had no reward for me. The reader knows at the outset that Grace succeeds in “breaking up with” Gavin—and in case the reader forgets the prose on page one, Grace reminds us, over and over, throughout the novel, that she and Gavin break up.Grace does not heal herself, or save herself, in this story. Grace is a victim whose friends have temporarily saved her by the end of this book. Grace’s unexamined abusive self-talk remains, so deep and so strong that she doesn’t even acknowledge the poison she’s really addicted to, the negative labels and self-hate Gavin recognized and used to hurt her for so long.By the end of this book, Grace is a victim who will soon encounter another abuser and become another victim again. I know this because readers like me are the real-life people who keep stepping into the burning houses of these women’s lives, and trying to save them. Like Grace’s friends in “Bad Romance,” I can physically rescue a victim, over and over again. But soon, they’re in another burning house, and then another, and another. Because the real poison is all around these women, all the time. In advertisements, in books, in movies, in bars, in their families, in the current tweet storms of the current President of the United States: the message that women are less, that women have no inherent worth without a man, that women should sacrifice everything if it means keeping a man.The biggest drug dealer of poison is society at large. We are all victims of it, and we are all complicit in the system as well. It’s a wonder any of us break free at all. Some people do break free though—women and men. But the message of victimization remains everywhere, all the time, and that poison is hard to counter if you don’t recognize it for what it is.The single biggest supporter of misogyny in “Bad Romance” is Grace’s mother. At one point, she even slaps Grace repeatedly, so hard that Grace’s head knocks against the wall. Is Grace’s mother a victim, in her own right? Of course. But her husband isn’t the worst drug Grace’s mother is addicted to. The biggest poison Grace’s mother is addicted to is her own self-hate, her own abusive self-talk. A self-hate so strong that she beats her daughter down, over and over again. She even tells her daughter to go back to Gavin, to sacrifice herself to Gavin, after Grace breaks up with Gavin the first time. After Grace’s mother sends her back into a toxic relationship with Gavin, Grace almost commits suicide. Her mother doesn’t care, doesn’t notice, and does nothing to help. Reading “Bad Romance” was an extremely negative experience for me, a toxic journey that offered no help. Society already places the blame of “staying in an abusive relationship” on women, and repeatedly tells these women they should be “strong enough to get out.” The author states in her Author’s Note that the intended purpose of this book is to tell victims of abusive relationships: “Whoever you are, know that it does get better. You just have to take the leap. You’ve got this.” And she provides an important list of resources on the next page.I support that message, wholeheartedly. I support anything that helps any victim—whether male or female—to find the help they need to live a happy, mentally healthy life, a life free of abuse. But I don’t think “Bad Romance” is a responsible book. I feel like the intended audience for this novel would be readers who have never witnessed what being a victim looks like and feels like, and want a didactic, educational illustration of what a victim goes through. Similarly, a lot of female abuse victims are praising this book for giving an authentic portrayal of what they have gone through, and have stated that this book gave them that important sense of “I’m not alone” and “I’m not the only one who has suffered this.”I’m glad those readers leave this book feeling educated about victimization, or—for surviving victims—leave this book feeling like their suffering wasn’t an isolated event. For me though, I expected a lot more. I expected the main character to have some agency, and to at least ACKNOWLEDGE the deepest root source of her victimization, even if she couldn’t completely heal herself by the end of the story. Damage takes a long time to repair, and I’d have found Grace’s continued brokenness believable, as long as she had at least recognized her greatest poison.But this story only existed as a spectacle of suffering. Grace’s suffering is offered up as the experience I’m meant to gawk at, shake my head at, bear witness to, and then cheer for her that she had friends to save her.Sorry, but no. This story did not work for me. “Bad Romance” insulted and enraged me, and I can’t recommend it to anyone. If you want to read a spectacle of unexamined suffering, then this book is for you. But please know that “boys” are not “the problem.” Grace’s problem is much, much bigger than “a boy.” This novel isn’t offering up any truth, and this entire story is as blind to “the problem” as Grace is....more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Jun 27, 2017","Jul 04, 2017","Jun 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29102896-bad-romance

As an undocumented/illegal immigrant, her family is undergoing a Voluntary Removal, and must leave the country that night. Natasha is distraught, wants to stay in the United States to finish high school, and she has allowed herself to believe a lawyerly Hail Mary pass from some mystical, pro bono counsel will change the government’s mind and allow her to stay.The action-packed magic of “Speed” is that the two main characters work together to achieve the same goal, and once their mission is completed, they embrace. Reality is full of such moments. People in intense situations can and do fall in love, intensely and forever, in a short amount of time. Whether in a terrorist attack, being trapped together in an elevator all day, fleeing a war zone at the same time, surviving a plane crash together—people can connect, deeply and quickly, and commit to each other in a day. Not just for the purpose of fleeting attraction, or to temporarily alleviate fear, but with the kind of soul-deep, permanent togetherness of enduring, unconditional, true love.Why does this happen, time and again? The truth is quite simple: a terrified person has nowhere to hide. The awful thing about a crisis is the sudden exposure of our true selves: the selves that hardly ever appear in our day-to-day lives. Who *are* we, really, deep down? Under the armor we wear to survive the mundane, typical world of ordered society—who do we find in that dark, secret place? A crisis will strip every bit of that armor away. Because there’s nothing fake about terror, or the will to survive. Either your true self shows up to pull you out of a mess, or you might very well die. We all know that when the sh*t hits the fan, things get real. People get real. And in moments like this, when we’re really looking at each other, really seeing each other—we fall in love. We fall in love with abandon, with intensity, with a complete sense of grace. We fall in love with the kind of passion that can melt the reinforced steel in a space shuttle.If you’ve never encountered any of the millions of love stories that have come out of tragedy, I suggest reading more nonfiction. Consume more long-form journalism, especially pieces that examine the aftermath of a crisis. Or re-watch the movie “Speed.” Seriously. It’s spectacular. In fact, just stop reading this  and go watch that whirlwind, action-packed love story. Because I can’t say the same for this novel.To my great disappointment, “The Sun Is Also a Star” is nothing like “Speed.” While the two teenagers who star in this book do face a turning point in their lives, the focus of the novel is on the romance itself, not on achieving a specific goal. Outside of the fleeting, circumstance-driven love portrayed in this story, there are no stakes in the book. Furthermore, the entire plot serves only to condense the idea of love into coincidence: people love when life brings them together, and once they’re separated, their commitment to each other is erased. While there is a lot of truth to that statement, the main characters in this novel argue against that truth for the entirety of the book, as Natasha and Daniel strive to prove love is greater than circumstance.But all their talk is for naught. The novel ends by upholding the belief that love is dictated by circumstance. When life separates Natasha and Daniel, they are no longer a couple. Several years later, when life throws them together on an airplane, not only are they delighted to see each other again, but they are once again able to love. The pacing of this book is all wonky, and part of the novel read like erotica lite. The two main characters almost have sex in a karaoke bar around two hours after they meet, at the halfway point of the book. Natasha spends most of her day with Daniel believing she’ll get to stay in America, up until the last quarter of the novel, when she realizes the mystical legal counsel she pinned all her hopes on never got around to throwing that Hail Mary pass.There was a lot of great potential in this book that is worthy of praise. Daniel is Korean American, Natasha is Jamaican American, and their backgrounds enrich the story in significant ways, adding texture and depth to the initial crisis of Natasha’s pending deportation. The subject matter of illegal immigration is also endlessly fascinating in fiction, whether it’s the tale of Superman crash-landing his spaceship in Kansas, or the dark family saga of “The Godfather,” immigrant stories grip all of us, especially in America, the so-called melting-pot of a “nation of immigrants.” Natasha’s status as an illegal immigrant was a significant and important piece of her character.But the subject matter of illegal immigration was not the main focus of this book, nor was Natasha’s life ruined by her deportation. In their conversations throughout the novel, Natasha and Daniel often sound like two adults who’ve watched a lot of TED talks together, and they chat about different philosophical talking points between kisses. After Natasha returns to Jamaica, she leads a good life, attends college, and falls in love with her native country. Daniel decides not to attend Yale after high school, and he works full time in New York City, attending some classes at Hunter College. Years pass. Even though Daniel has the ability—as soon as he graduates high school—to move to Jamaica to be with Natasha, he doesn’t go. He stays in America and drifts around, writing poetry, trying to figure out what to do with his life.Is this realistic? Of course. Is this an example of love being greater than circumstance? No, absolutely not. For all Daniel’s enthusiasm about the power of love in this book, and for all Natasha’s adoption of Daniel’s enthusiasm about the greatness of love, both of these characters uphold the most conventional wisdom: that we fall in love with people we’re close to, when it’s easy, when it’s comfortable, and that long distance relationships never last.While “The Sun Is Also a Star” seems to have the same plot arc as “Speed,” these characters are never truly stripped down to their true selves, there are no stakes in this book, and the climax of the novel refutes every conversation Natasha and Daniel have during their single day spent together. As soon as life separates Natasha from Daniel, their love disappears, and only when life decides to bring them together again, on an airplane, are they able to recommit to their love.The album cover for Nirvana’s “Nevermind” plays a significant role in this story, and Kurt Cobain’s lyrics in the breakout song, “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” sum up how I feel about Natasha and Daniel by the end of this book – “oh well, whatever, nevermind.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 13, 2017","Jun 23, 2017","Jun 13, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28763485-the-sun-is-also-a-star

Seven years later, this work of nonfiction remains as compelling and imI first read ""Methland: The Death and Life of an American Small Town"" in 2010. Seven years later, this work of nonfiction remains as compelling and important a portrait of rural America as when the book was first published in 2009.Author Nick Reding tracks the history of meth use in America, in an attempt to study a problem that needs a solution. Starting with the first creation of meth in Japan in 1919, through the heavy use of the drug in World War II, the widespread legalized prescriptions of meth through the 1970s, and charting the enormous rise of meth labs and Mexican drug trafficking organizations that continue to plague America today, the research in this book is thorough, detailed, and incredibly well-written. While the author focuses the strongest lens of this story on the town of Oelwein, Iowa, the book also takes a broad, sweeping view of anti-union economic policies of the 1980s, government deregulation in the 1980s and '90s, corrupt immigration policies, as well as the corporate greed and malfeasance that have created the current conditions of poverty and despair in rural America. Conditions that drive more and more people to make and use meth.The problem has not gone away. Meth addiction continues to take a horrendous toll on families, communities, and small towns across America.The author penned this book as an act of compassion and hope. There is great empathy in this book, alongside the clear-eyed analysis of cause and effect, horror and tragedy. A fine read, and a beautiful book. Recommended for anyone who has been impacted by meth, or is still wondering why Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. If you are someone who still feels gobsmacked by the videos of crowds chanting, ""Build the wall!"" or ""Bring back jobs!"" and cannot comprehend the vociferous, almost biblical passion of white, rural America, I urge you to pick up ""Methland"" and immerse yourself in the dark mess of small town despair. A lot of people read ""Hillbilly Elegy"" after the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. But I think ""Methland"" does a far better job of examining how in the hell America got to this point.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"May 22, 2017Jan 2010","Jun 25, 2017not set","May 22, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6215979-methland

The book is easy to readI would like to give this book 3 stars because the author is a nice person and the sentences in this novel were often pretty. The book is easy to read and the beginning sucked me right in.But this YA contemporary had too many problems for me to feel comfortable giving ""The Serpent King"" three stars. To explain my super-harsh rating, I must spoil the plot of this book, because the story hinges upon a deus ex machina that accomplished a pivotal plot twist. So please do not keep reading this  if you do not want the book spoiled. **spoilers everywhere, please beware****stop reading here if you do not want this book spoiled, please and thank you**""The Serpent King"" features four separate storylines that never meshed well, so the novel felt disjointed and clunky and nonsensical. There are three point of view characters who each have their own storyline, and then there is a romance storyline that takes over the final third of the book, after one of the POV characters is eliminated.I will structure this  by listing the four storylines:1. Dill, high school senior, and the grandson of the Serpent King of the title. The Serpent King was a poor man whose daughter was bitten by a poisonous snake and died, and the man became unhinged and died of grief. Dill is also the son of a fundamentalist Pentecostal preacher-father who is now serving time in prison for possessing some pedophile-type pornography on his computer. The details of this porn (pictures? videos? ages of the children involved? boys, girls, both? was this free porn, did he pay for it, how much did he pay for this porn?) are never spelled out in the book. I assumed the father had a few pictures on his computer, maybe a few videos too. I found it highly unrealistic that a man would be sentenced to multiple years in prison for downloading some pedophile porn -- it seems like a sentence of this kind is reserved for the men who MAKE the porn or violate the bodies of children. The father's sentencing seemed poorly researched and unbelievable. Sorry, I digress. Dill is supposed to be the ""main character"" of this novel and his storyline is supposed to be the most important, because the book is named after his grandfather. But the grandfather never appears in scene (a piece of his history is summarized, since he is dead), and Dill only reflects on his grandfather ONE time -- very briefly -- in the entire novel. But I have bigger problems with this book than anything involving Dill alone, so I need to move on.2. Lydia, high school senior and wealthy narcissist, a character who represents some MAJOR wish fulfillment as well as a level of cruel selfishness I found super disgusting. Lydia has a fashion blog with a hundred thousand followers, celebrities follow her blog, she has been interviewed by The New York Times about her fashion ideas, she has marketing power on Twitter, vacations with a fashion friend on Nantucket, receives choice merchandise gifts to feature on her blog, she views herself as SMARTER and BETTER than EVERYONE at her school, as well as EVERYONE in her small hick town (including her parents), she mocks her classmates for being stupid and lets Dill know she never hangs out with anyone unless they are smart. Lydia is seventeen and already ruling the world. She is a princess on a power trip and NO ONE in this book takes her down. She is selfish, clueless, ensconced on a throne of privilege, and the story celebrates Lydia's behavior as heroic/noble/ideal. Yuck.3. Travis, high school senior, and the dorkiest super dork who ever dorked. I LOVED Travis, and I would have gladly read an entire book ABOUT TRAVIS and his budding romance with fellow super-dork, Amelia (who lives in another town). Travis is the only character in this book who felt like a real person to me. He is comfortable in his own skin, struggles to be brave and overcomes some huge hurdles in the book. Travis and Dill make plans to live together after high school, working in their small town together, being friends and taking classes at a community college or maybe online.But the author wanted Dill to become Lydia's boyfriend, and Lydia wanted Dill to leave home and go away to a four-year university somewhere. So the author created a deus ex machina in the form of ""two asshole idiot meth heads"" (page 255) who show up at the rural roadside location where Travis is selling some firewood from the back of a pickup. The two ""meth heads"" rob Travis, shoot him, and leave. The ""meth heads"" are caught by the police (page 255), but they are never named in the book, never discussed in the book, and are never heard from again. The first and last time the word ""meth"" ever appears in ""The Serpent King"" is on page 255. One page. ONE. PAGE. There is never any discussion of drugs or drug addiction anywhere in this book, and never any mention that this small town in Tennessee has a drug problem. Two unnamed ""meth heads"" show up out of nowhere, kill a teen, and are never heard from again, even though they were caught by the police. Were they prosecuted? Were they convicted? What kind of sentence were they given? Who the hell knows, and who the hell cares. Certainly not Dill or Lydia, even though these three high school seniors are supposedly ""best friends"" and hang out together all the time before Travis is killed. Why would Dill and Lydia care about what becomes of Travis's murderers? That would be something only real people would worry about, not fictional characters who need to start falling in love, kissing each other, and going to prom. The two ""meth heads"" in this novel were simply the deus ex machina the author needed to remove Travis from the book. 4. Now that Travis has been killed, the main storyline of the book can begin: Dill and Lydia attend Travis's funeral together, Dill realizes Lydia is right about his future and that he should go away to college, Dill applies to college with Lydia's help, and the two of them start kissing, make out for hours, and the rest of the book is a romance novel about dating someone in the last months of senior year. Dill and Lydia attend prom together, and then they have to tell each other goodbye in the summer in order to start university. The end. Now that I have listed the four storylines, I just need to randomly vent some frustrations. Why do I dislike Lydia so much? Because she just uses people, and she is mean. She keeps Travis and Dill a secret from her blog followers, because she doesn't want to be ""embarrassed"" by them. But when it's useful to her, she claims them as friends, such as on her college essay for her application to NYU. When she wants sympathy for being a sh*tty person, she tells her blog followers that Travis was her friend -- right after he is murdered, so her blog followers will see how much she has suffered, and blow up her blog with comments expressing their sympathy and reassuring her how awesome she is. She doesn't use Dill's name on her blog, she calls him ""Dearly"" so no one will know who he is. When they start dating, she keeps their relationship secret -- until they're at Dill's new college campus, and another girl smiles at Dill. Then Lydia feels some instant competition, and decides she and Dill should immediately start kissing in public (and they do).Lydia's father tries to help her understand that Dill and Travis are poor, and that Lydia has had life handed to her on a silver platter. Does she do nice things for Dill and Travis? No, she does things that service herself. Things that show off her money and power. The novel starts with Lydia taking Dill back-to-school shopping. She scores $100.00 worth of free clothes for Dill (nice!) but then the real purpose of the trip becomes clear -- Lydia scores $300.00 worth of free clothes for HERSELF at the same store. Lydia who is rich and drives a super nice car and has 3 bedrooms to herself (in her large & beautiful home) and she gets free stuff ALL THE TIME, including a brand new Mac notebook because ""yay, senior year,"" and her two loving parents buy her EVERYTHING she wants. Lydia makes sure to take home $300.00 in free clothing from the same place she took ""poor"" Dill to go shopping. Um, okay.Does she give Dill her old laptop, after this heartening chat with her father? The chat that is meant to open Lydia's eyes to the poverty her friends live in? No, Lydia doesn't immediately hand over her unused laptop, not until months later, when Dill must come groveling to her with an apology for not jumping at her idea that he should ditch his mom and leave for college somewhere. Once Dill makes it clear that Lydia's outlandish condescension toward him was good and noble, then Lydia is like, okay, you've groveled enough, now you can have this old laptop of mine, which I haven't used for months.Does Lydia, who is SO SMART and amazing with books, ever bother to read Travis's favorite Bloodfall book? No, but she does use her money, fame, and connections to bring the author to town for a few hours, in order to show off how awesome she is. How awesome and rich and badass, with her hundred thousand blog followers and her ability to act like a 35-year-old instead of a teenager. After Travis is shot, Lydia might have read Bloodfall as a show of grief -- perhaps to prove to the reader she really did care about him. Or maybe it was just one of Travis's short stories that Lydia read. All I know for sure is, she never bothered to read Bloodfall while Travis was alive, but she did bring the author to town to meet Travis, because the bulk of this book is The Lydia Show.When Dill and Lydia attend Travis's funeral, that did not feel real to me. Not how they think and behave at the funeral, and not the immediate aftermath. Dill, especially, should have been way more messed up by that murder. His level of trauma and grief felt insufficient. Dill grew up idolizing his preacher father, and yearning to have the same level of faith his father had, to the point that he could also take hold of poisonous snakes. But by halfway through the book, Dill's point of view felt entirely secular. He even mocks Christianity, plays up his faith in order to lie to his mom, saying ""we need to go full Bible"" so he can stay at Lydia's house (page 298), and he uses expressions like ""witnessing for Jesus"" as code for ""making out"" (page 308). The Dill at the beginning of the book is a conflicted, fragile young man who is struggling to make sense of his life. The Dill who is mocking his entire upbringing with phrases like ""we need to go full Bible"" in order to lie to his mother is not the same person at all. This is post-deus ex machina Dill here. A Dill who had a secular upbringing, not a fundamentalist Pentecostal one.In my personal life, some of my friends and family members have become addicted to meth. In this book, the two drug addicts were just labeled as ""asshole idiot meth heads"" who murdered someone for drug money. While I am not about to defend this behavior, I would like to point out that not all people addicted to meth are murderers, and I have a ton of sympathy for drug addicts. Some people I love have done horrible things while addicted to drugs, and I still love them. I wish this novel had discussed the ramifications of meth addiction a bit more, and not just dismissed the two murderers as ""asshole idiots"" before dropping them from the story.In my personal life, I testified against my own father in court as a child, a child even younger than Dill. It was an awful experience, one that left some horribly deep scars, and I still loved my father, I never stopped loving my father. Perhaps my love got even deeper after I hurt him so much, because there was a lot of manipulation going on; I was manipulated by the adults around me, much like the adults around Dill try to manipulate him. Dill, being older, does a much better job in court than I managed to do at age twelve or thirteen. My emotional and psychological state as a teenager was pretty messed up, and I wish the author had spent more time with Dill, so I could understand how he went from 100% adulation to Zero Love for his father due to some kind of pornography found on his computer. I just didn't see how Dill could go from All to Nothing in the space of a few weeks over this. This felt as unrealistic to me as Dill having a fundamentalist upbringing and shifting into a purely secular mindset halfway through the story.I felt like this novel picked a lot of low-hanging fruit in the stereotypes chosen to build reader sympathy for the characters in this book: snake-handling Pentecostals, a father in prison, rural meth addiction, poverty, wealthy bullies at school, small town racism (in which towns are named after important KKK members, and people enjoy the sight of Confederate flags, but no actual people of color exist anywhere in the story, and the characters never have a conversation about racism, Lydia just points out -- for the reader -- that KKK members and Confederate flags are racist).A lot of readers 5-starred this book for its message to young people to go to college and follow their dreams, and for its depiction of these three teenagers doing their best to survive their circumstances. I applaud the author for giving so many readers a book they can love and cherish. But this novel didn't feel realistic to me, and the only character I felt attached to was killed as a plot device, and none of that sat well with me....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 22, 2017","May 27, 2017","May 22, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22752127-the-serpent-king

Titled ""Meditations from a Moveable Chair,"" the essays were all written after the author started using a wheelchair, but not all of the essays are about his disability, or his life as a disabled person. Some of the essays focus on other people, or events unrelated to the car accident that damaged his body so greatly. Some essays focus on his childhood, and different moments from his adult life as an able-bodied man.I loved reading this book. I especially loved reading it so soon after finishing one of his collections of short stories: ""Selected Stories."" Andre Dubus II is a marvelous writer, and his memoir-essays give a fascinating illumination and depth to his fiction.This book was also a balm for my soul. I love the prose of his son, Andre Dubus III, and I loved seeing Andre Dubus III appear in these personal essays. I loved seeing all of the family members in these pages. I also just loved having Andre Dubus II alive again. Even more than reading his fiction, when I read these essays, I feel like he lives again, while I sit absorbing these words.As a white, neurotypical, able-bodied, cis, hetero, middle-class American male, Andre Dubus II had a life that changed quite dramatically when he became a disabled man. The beauty of these essays is how humbly and brutally honest he is, at all times. In some of the essays about his childhood and young adulthood, the reader can see his privilege shining through. Sometimes the author draws attention to his unacknowledged entitlements, and other times, the reader can do that without the text making anything explicit. Andre Dubus II was a very sensitive man. His sudden change from being an able-bodied man to being a disabled man intensified those sensitivities, increased his humility, and increased his comfort with weakness. He also gained a greater acceptance of having a lack of control over life. He was forced to become intimately aware of all the many and constant ways disabled people are dehumanized and disregarded in American society, and some of the essays in ""Meditations from a Moveable Chair"" discuss that disregard in powerful ways. Highly recommended. Especially if you are already a fan of the author's fiction. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 18, 2017","Aug 26, 2017","May 19, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33885.Meditations_from_a_Movable_Chair

I read both of those novels years ago, and pretty much forgot everything, other than the fact I thought the stories were okay and finished them both.""Bitterblue"" was thrust on me by a friend who insisted I complete the trilogy. I tried, I really did try. But this book possesses no main plot, only a scattershot storyline composed of a high number of subplots, and I found none of the subplots engaging. Each subplot possesses its own array of secondary/minor characters, and I found all the names frustrating and pointless to read. Bitterblue, the 18-year-old main character, has been ruling her kingdom as the Lady Queen for eight years. She is 18 going on 40: Bitterblue is highly intelligent, levelheaded, calm and collected, steely and tough. She knows how to protect herself in a fight, and she starts sneaking out of the castle at night, searching for ""the truth"" in her kingdom that her advisors are hiding from her.Which makes for a compelling opening, and I was pretty engaged by the first third of this book. And then the secondary characters and the subplots kept piling up, any sense of urgency soon vanished, and the story turned into a long, long slog through the (unending) administrivia of being a Lady Queen inside a castle, since her excursions beyond her castle wall soon come to an end. Bitterblue takes restorative breaks doing things like kneading dough, eating sour cream cake, and sleeping. She meets with people. A lot. She tells the people who work for her what to do. A lot. This might be the most boring YA fantasy I've ever read in my life. The biggest problem I had with this story is that it's not really Bitterblue's story. If any one subplot could be considered more important than the others, it's the storyline with Thiel. What did Thiel do for Bitterblue's father, the evil King Leck? Why does Thiel want to keep that a secret? How does Thiel react once Bitterblue learns the truth?These questions seemed to be at the heart of this novel, and while the reader does learn the answers to these questions, the emotional and psychological ramifications of the answers go unexplored. Bitterblue and this low-class/non-royal young man she has met, named Saf, go off and have sex right away (the scene is not described in any detail, it's a ""fade to black"" moment of kissing) and then Bitterblue sleeps a long time and wakes up and goes back to being a Lady Queen. This was the point at which I DNF'd.The internal struggles in this story were not Bitterblue's struggles: they were Thiel's struggles, and the other men like Thiel who also worked in the castle for Bitterblue's father. All of them wanted to hide what they had done under this evil king. Bitterblue wanted the truth.Did anything change once she knew ""the truth""? Um, no. Everyone already knew King Leck committed atrocities. The details didn't change anything. Was the message of the story one of holding trials for a ruler's henchmen, and bringing those men to justice? I have no idea what the point was. Bitterblue wanted to wholesale forgive Thiel, and the other men who had ""betrayed"" her; Bitterblue's big emotional climax was to stress that she still loved Thiel and wanted him to be okay, so the idea of holding these ""henchmen"" accountable seems like the opposite of any messaging going on in the book.As to Saf, Bitterblue's lover, I lost all respect for him when he stole Bitterblue's crown, less than halfway through the book. Saf was angry with Bitterblue for posing as a commoner/hiding her true identity from him, and I understand and appreciate his initial rage. But once Bitterblue used her power to save his life, and protect him, Saf continued to be nothing but angry. Then he behaved in such a petty, childish way by stealing her crown and creating a lot of drama over nothing -- a lot of boring book-drama entailing ""where is the crown now?"" and ""how will we get the crown back?"" -- not only did I detest Saf for being such a ridiculous baby, but he ended up creating a new torturous subplot I couldn't care less about. Who the f*ck cares if the original crown is gone? Bitterblue is the QUEEN. SHE CAN MAKE A NEW CROWN. She can pass a royal decree stating that the evil Leck's crown will no longer grace her brow for royal ceremonies, and the kingdom will have another fresh start concerning the monarch's headgear. The supposed ""plot tension"" around this silly crown was annoying.As to people who love this book because the author's prose is ""luminous"" and ""stunning"" -- I found the prose to be neither. The writing is adequate; the prose is simple and clean. Nothing out of the ordinary. These sentences are not poetic or gorgeous -- they advance the story, and they're certainly not cumbersome or clumsy sentences, but the vocabulary and sentence structures aren't lyrical or ""stunning."" In the end, the biggest character arc in this novel belonged to Thiel, and the conclusion of Thiel's subplot was massively disappointing. Bitterblue does fall in love with Saf, I think, or at least, has sex for the first time in this book. She discovers some important details concerning the atrocities committed by her father while she was a child, before she came to the throne at age ten. I guess she forgives all the people who worked for her father by torturing, raping, mutilating, and slaughtering innocent people and dumping their corpses in a river that, for some reason, Leck renamed. It's hard to draw parallels to Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot here. The fact that Leck has been dead for eight years when this story begins makes any parallels to other genocidal rulers pretty difficult. Even gross abuses of power, a la Richard Nixon, never resonated with me here. I don't know what real-life messaging I was supposed to take away from this book. I've never read the nonfiction title ""Hitler's Willing Executioners,"" about the people who killed on Hitler's behalf, but I do wonder about just ""forgiving"" people and ""moving on"" when those people have chosen to rape, mutilate, and murder for an absolute monarch. Shouldn't those people face trial for what they have done? Shouldn't our actions have consequences? I don't believe in capital punishment, but a prison sentence, I think, would be a step in the right direction.To the five-star gushing fans of this book, all I can say is, I'm sorry, but this book felt like a long, sloppy mess, and this story just wasn't for me. If I want ""luminous"" prose, I'll read Laini Taylor. If I want to learn about the aftermath of a genocidal dictator, I'd rather turn to a nonfiction title than a YA fantasy like this....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 11, 2017","May 17, 2017","May 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12680907-bitterblue

Haruki Murakami's prose created an expansive, imaginative space for my own mind to step into -- not only to relish in the imagery of the story, but welcoming with an imperative force my own thoughts and reflections. It was a remarkable experience and I found myself awed by that feat of the writing.Then the prose settled down, and moved into a traditional storyline. The main character, Hajime, is separated from his childhood love, a disabled young woman named Shimamoto, when he is twelve. He goes through his adolescence and young adulthood without her. They meet again when they are both 37, and their love story is full of tragedy. The novel has a lot to say about the primacy of erotic, romantic love as the central fuel of imagination, youth, passionate work, ambitions, dreams, happiness, and a sense of completeness. The loss of this singular, romantic love brings isolation, premature aging, emptiness, and a sense of death in a still-living body. The prose is straightforward, poetic in its simplicity, but not especially thrilling to read. This is a very short novel, a chronological tale that is predictable and quiet. Hajime evaluates himself honestly, and never makes himself sound like anything more than the limited person he is. This book was thrust on me by a friend who couldn't stand that I hadn't yet read any books by Haruki Murakami. She'll be so disappointed that I didn't love this novel, because this author is one of her favorites, and she loves all of his work. But for me, this novel was simply ""okay."" I thought the major themes of this book were given far better treatment in the novels ""The English Patient"" and ""The God of Small Things,"" and this slender volume cannot compete with those titans of prose.

Once all of the many different characters were established, and I knew how many different storylines I had to follow, this book read very quickly. Though the beginning was slow, and felt like a hurdle, the rest of the novel breezed by. I found myself attached to these characters, and felt a compulsion to find out what would happen to them. The plot follows the aftermath of a global, non-religious rapture, in which a random assortment of people vanish one day (disappear without a trace), and the people who remain must deal with the emotional and psychological consequences of losing friends, loved ones, relatives, acquaintances, classmates, coworkers... or simply helping other people cope with losses they haven't suffered directly.The author chooses to view this post-rapture world through the eyes of some uber-boring, affluent white suburbanites, people who are just plodding along through life: friendly narcissists, as I think of them. Vapid egoists. They are dull, self-centered, lacking ambition, and in their post-rapture reality, they are falling apart.Do I believe each of these diverging -- and converging -- storylines? Yes, absolutely. For me, the novel's biggest strength is in the bizarre reactions and movements that begin after this strange rapture occurs. The world of this book felt like the real world, and these affluent white suburbanites felt *totally* real. These characters were all so unremarkable and common, and they each make such vastly different choices in response to the rapture, that the variety of character arcs provided a lot of the book's pleasure.But that also led to what -- for me -- was the book's major shortcoming, which was that I didn't feel like I had enough insight into some of these characters. I felt like the story didn't dig deep enough into their psyches to help me understand why they behaved as they did.Most especially, I couldn't understand Laurie. Laurie is Kevin's wife, and the mother of Tom and Jill. (Kevin interacts with another woman named Nora -- and these five characters -- Laurie, Kevin, Tom, Jill, and Nora -- are the five protagonists of this novel.)Laurie's behavior is the strangest, and the darkest. She has chosen to embrace the idea that the rapture was a signal that the world will soon end, despite never having been raised with any religious belief in a rapture. Laurie joins a creepy cult called the Guilty Remnant, a group of nihilists who are at turns hilarious and sickening.Laurie does something really horrifying near the end of this book, and even though the whole situation was a huge part of the story, I wasn't allowed into her thought process at all. I didn't understand why she made the decisions she did, or what she believed would happen to her afterward, or why she even committed herself to those actions. This felt like the book's biggest failing. In a similar vein, Laurie's son Tom also makes a specific choice at the end of the book that had no explanation, other than I am meant to assume that Tom, like his mother, is inherently (and irredeemably) selfish. While Tom's thoughtless behavior unwittingly benefits Nora, I would rather have delved into Tom's psyche more than the scant lines the book gave to his final scene.Kevin's character is a light touch for the book, and he operates as the story's moral center, the sole anchor in a shifting sea of unhinged drifters. The novel ends in a place that indicates Kevin might have a happy ending, some relief for the loneliness he suffers, and I really hope that's the case. Kevin has a good heart, and he is the only character who ever behaves selflessly in this story. I found myself wanting life to be nicer to him, especially as the book drew to a close. The novel's most complex characters are its female characters, who are prickly, selfish, disturbed, and malicious. I really loved them, I just wish I'd had a better window into their minds....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 26, 2017","Apr 29, 2017","Apr 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10762469-the-leftovers

Holy freaking WOW. What an incredible writer.The first story I read in this book was ""The Winter FatThis is an outstanding collection.Andre Dubus II. Holy freaking WOW. What an incredible writer.The first story I read in this book was ""The Winter Father."" It turned out to be a very difficult story for me. I worried I couldn't keep reading this book, my stress level hit such a high level. Because I knew, with each page I turned, that the author was writing his own life when he penned this story. I read Andre Dubus II as the character of the divorced father in this particular tale, struggling to spend time with his young children.And why would that be so hard? Because I'm a big fan of the author's son: Andre Dubus III. Andre Dubus III is one of the most compassionate, dynamic, and inspiring people I've ever met. He's wicked smart, funny as hell, and whenever I've had the pleasure of hearing him speak, I never want it to end.In 2011, Andre Dubus III published a beautiful memoir, ""Townie,"" and I read the book as soon as the hardback went up for sale. Which is all to say that I met Andre Dubus II (the father) after first meeting his son -- in person, and through his son's memoir -- and I know very well that the children of Andre Dubus II grew up in poverty. A hideous, soul-crushing, brutal poverty. When I read ""Townie,"" my heart was ripped out, mauled, and stuffed back in my chest, the way a really good memoir can shred heart tissue. Then along came this collection, ""Selected Stories,"" by Andre Dubus II. And I just happened to read ""The Winter Father"" first. I gnashed my teeth, I felt hideously uncomfortable, but the prose held me. The beauty of these sentences convinced me I had to read more. In spite of myself, I was hooked. I cannot overstate how good the writing in this collection had to be for me to overlook what I know of this author -- what I know his children went through because of the choices he made in his life. But the writing. Is. Stellar. Oh my God, this prose is so good. These stories are dark, insightful, full of careful detail, plot, and complexity. In the prose of Andre Dubus, truth pulls the reader along like a riptide. The sentences are slow and expansive, but also darting and swift -- these stories have a riveting speed to them, and I kept compulsively rereading each page, delighted and awed. Absorbing an Andre Dubus II short story is like seeing a master magician at work, watching all the pretty scarves fluttering through the air, while a woman is simultaneously sawed in half and fifty white rabbits are popped out of top hats. These stories are a spectacular show. My absolute favorites, listed in the order they appear in the book: ""The Pretty Girl,"" ""Townies,"" and ""Adultery."" These stories made me want to jam my fists in the air and howl. And howl, and howl. I loved these stories so hard. My second-favorites of this collection, named in the order the stories appear in this book: ""The Winter Father,"" ""Cadence,"" ""Rose,"" and ""Voices from the Moon.""Human beings show up on every page of this book. These people are flawed, broken, ugly. Selfish. Foolish. Sometimes they are heroic. Often, they are not. Sexism, misogyny, gender essentialism -- all take a front row in these tales.So does classism. And racism. If it's a hideous part of society -- trust me, Andre Dubus II pins it down on the page. This is a writer with clear eyes and an unwavering pen. I often felt slashed, reading these words. Then I just wanted him to slash me again. If you love literature, if you love honesty, if you love authors who write without flinching -- then do yourself a favor, and read this book.

(page 156)The 2017 YA contemporary novel, ""What Girls Are Made Of,"" by Elana K. Arnold, is a masterwork. The plot, character arc, thematic story elements, and prose style all combine in a tour de force of literary prose -- deceptively packaged and sold as a Young Adult book.If you enjoy reading the poetry, short stories, novels and nonfiction of Margaret Atwood, and/or if you love to read modern stories with strong feminist messaging, then I highly recommend ""What Girls Are Made Of."" This book is a masterpiece. The teenage main character of this novel, an affluent young woman named Nina, is the traditional fare of the YA world: she is white, cis, able-bodied, neurotypical, heterosexual, thin, and conventionally attractive. Her parents are married. She lives in a spacious, immaculate home, commonly recognized as the modern isolation chamber of the well-off. Nina also begins the novel in possession of a boyfriend, a handsome and affluent white classmate named Seth. None of the characters initially introduced in this book are likeable. None. While there is certainly change and growth in this story, the reader must trust that redemption is coming. Based on nothing more than the exquisite prose on each page, the reader must have faith that the story will eventually break through the incessant horror show on display in the mindset of Nina and the people she interacts with for most of the book.Author Elana K. Arnold plotted a book that is subtle, nuanced, and tremendously powerful. She set her story against the backdrop of patriarchy and misogyny without ever using those terms in the book -- and yet, those words *are* the book. Nina's redemption at the end of this story is so immensely satisfying because the scope of what she is up against is never absent from the page. I loved this ugly, compelling, beautiful book. Highly recommended. This is an excellent read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Dec 15, 2017","Dec 19, 2017","Apr 16, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29401474-what-girls-are-made-of

Five stars seems a paltry, insufficient rating for this glorious, breathtaking work of historical fantasy. This novel is brilliant.On the surface, the story is a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, set in the historical Ireland of Norman invasions and rival warrior kings. Rather than a magical ""beast"" character, a man named Anluan takes the hero's role in this novel, and he is perfectly real, and perfectly flawed. As a child, Anluan survived some kind of illness, or ""palsy,"" that almost killed him, and as a result, half of his body became disabled. His face was affected as well, ruining his symmetry along with his physical prowess. But worse than any physical wound was the harm done to his psyche, as Anluan internalized the message that he can never be a leader, and can never be ""a real man,"" due to his physical limitations.But to Caitrin -- the 18-year-old protagonist and Beauty of this retelling -- Anluan is so much more than his physical body. Caitrin knows everyone around her is so much more than their surface appearance. She is the penultimate badass of compassion, and the entire story bears witness to her empathy, and her kindness. Like Anluan, Caitrin has suffered emotional and psychological abuse, and she has also been broken by lies. Physically abused, and trapped by members of her own family, Caitrin understands the true meaning of desperation and hope. But Caitrin has finally escaped her life full of hell -- and that is where this novel begins. She has run away from her violent prison, and soon finds herself in the domain of the ""beast."" There are monsters in this book, and ghosts. Loyal friends and family, and betrayal. There are moments and scenes that stole my breath, made me laugh, or made tears pour down my face, overwhelmed with the feels. I read this novel in a day and a half, devouring this story, and I'm still reeling from how f*cking GOOD this book is. I'm surprised by how much this book made me cry -- not tears of grief or despair, but tears full of wonder and beauty. This is such a magnificent book. There is a quiet, insistent, and stunning truth in this book. The kind that reaches far beyond what the characters say or think, far beyond any overt moral message simple words can contain. The prose of ""Heart's Blood"" is adequate writing -- not highly literary, but serviceable and easy to grasp -- and while the beginning felt far too slow for my tastes, the story is startling, exquisitely executed, and profound.The identity of the antagonist is not hard to grasp, and while I could quibble with the book and say that it took Caitrin too long to ""locate"" her main enemy, this would be a false argument. Of course readers make connections faster than characters do -- we're looking for the ""tell,"" aren't we? We expect these things, we expect the story to play along with the fairy tale. Caitrin doesn't know she's in a fairy tale -- she is struggling to survive in a difficult environment, and she does so with determination, intelligence, and grit. The story states quite clearly why the antagonist took so long to identify, and I must say -- the motives of this character, as Caitrin understands those motives to be, were some of the most beautiful and stunning lines in this book. ""Heart's Blood"" is a story about identity, and the root of all courage. Like any good fairy tale, there is so much more to this book than meets the eye. The surface-level understanding of this novel is plenty enjoyable, concerning the plot and the entire ensemble of characters, but it's all the subterranean insight expressed in this story that makes ""Heart's Blood"" so amazing.

The writing might've felt a lot stronger to me then, and I might not have been so tired of reading about white male heroes who grow up in whitelandia fantasy worlds based on medieval Europe. While it was nice that this author clearly understands Roma culture, the Roma aren't sheltered from life's harsh realities -- they live in the real world, where kids grow up fast, they're exposed to death and loss at a young age, they're expected to work, they are often married as teenagers -- and this was even more true in medieval times than today. Kvothe doesn't live in the real world, he lives in a whitelandia fantasy this author created. Kvothe is a modern American 12-year-old boy placed inside this Roma-rip-off upbringing in a whitelandia fantasy. And I really just could not, either with Kvothe or his School Drama, which encompasses the bulk of this story.The cover of this novel made me expect a tale about a *grown* warrior wizard who was doing some badass fighting in a mystical world full of awesome creatures. While Kvothe does kill a dragon/demon creature in the last third of the novel, I was so bored by then I was in super-skim mode. Kvothe goes back to school afterward, and there are many more pages of School Woes & Scholarly Adventuring after this... uh, action scene with a dragon or demon or whatever it was.I will not be reading the two sequels in this trilogy.

I hold Mr. Stevens in high esteem, and I really wanted to enjoy his debut novel, the first book in his Allison Coil Mystery Series.But this book is a mess. Full of factual errors and mwa-ha-ha villains hiding in plain sight, villains who suddenly ""snap"" by the end of the story, start killing people right and left, and one even delivers a long ""villain manifesto"" before the coup de grâce, which allows the hero the necessary lapse in action for victory. Every character in this novel is foolish to the point of absurdity. The story is loosely centered on Allison Coil, a self-professed ""city girl"" turned ""hunting guide"" who has actually never shot an animal. She simply helps newbie hunters learn how to butcher deer and elk, a skill she learned after surviving a plane crash and moving to Colorado. This is how Allison deals with ""a massive bull elk"" on page 7, as she teaches the newbie hunters how to butcher their first kill. After emptying ""the viscera from the elk's cavity,"" Allison engages in the following activities --""She helped fill water jugs in the nearby creek. They washed out the carcass and cut off the legs. She showed Vic how to scalp the antlers and leave enough of the nubs to show evidence that the kill was male, in case the boy-men were stopped on the way home by a forest ranger."" After Allison packed the meat back to camp, and hung the meat in a tree, ""Allison peppered the meat to discourage flies.""To anyone who has ever hunted elk in Colorado, these details are absurd. First, what newbie hunter is going to eat bull meat like that? Gross. The meat is loaded with hormones that make that meat repulsive. (On a personal note: my husband's friend once tried to feed bull meat to his dog, and the dog vomited and later suffered horrendous diarrhea. The dog wasn't the only one who suffered, since the man also tried cooking a slice of that meat in his home, and the smell made him throw up. My husband didn't vomit because he has guts of steel, but his friend sure puked quite a lot. Suffice to say, eating bull meat in season is not something most people would ever do.) Bulls in rut are not what hunters eat, it's the cow meat (cow elk meat) they butcher and take home.Second, what hunter washes a carcass out with water?? No one. No one ever washes out a carcass being field dressed. Hunters carve up the animal and pack the meat to camp. Dumping bagfuls of water all over a fresh kill is absurd. Third, there is no need to leave ""nubs"" behind to prove a kill is male. If antlers are cut off a skull, it's obvious to anyone looking at the skull that the antlers were removed. Fourth, elk season takes place in late autumn/early winter, once the flies are all dead. No Colorado hunter in the Rocky Mountains ever ""peppers"" their elk meat to keep it safe from flies. In fact, right after Allison ""peppers"" the meat and leaves camp, she is caught in a heavy snowstorm, and over a foot of fresh powder accumulates on the ground. Flies aren't swarming around in weather like that. With a butcher scene like that, the only thing Allison is showing me in this story is that she is a fool and a clown, not a hunting guide. She never felt like a believable character, and the novel never gave me enough information about her to ever convince me she was anything more than a fictional caricature of a woman. Other point of view characters in this story include: two different killers, the wife of one of the killers, a super-ditzy animal rights activist who is as unrealistic as she is unsympathetic, and other head-hopping point of view characters too numerous to mention. Suffice to say, all of this head-hopping point of view material meant Allison Coil was never fully developed as a character, due to all of the time the reader spends with secondary characters who have no impact whatsoever on the main plot.None of the characters felt like real people to me, the prose is melodramatic, heavy-handed, and clumsy. Important character development information is crammed into scenes where the material disrupts the flow of the story, making the entire book seem more unrealistic and dull. During one action sequence late in the book, Allison Coil is running for her life, and ends up having a long rumination over the plane crash she survived prior to becoming a hunting guide. Her memories and conclusions about surviving this crash are interrupted when her horse is shot out from under her, and the animal quickly dies. The shooter escapes unidentified, and Allison walks away to find help. She expresses such little emotion over this tragedy -- and there is no real aftermath concerning what is to be done with the horse's body, or where the horse will be buried, since Allison quickly moves on to other plot details, never truly returning to this horror of her HORSE being GUNNED down and killed for NO REASON -- this single scene encapsulated everything that made this novel unreal. The horse is the only person or animal killed in this story that I felt any emotion over -- but Allison had as much reaction to this death as she would to stubbing her toe on a rock.I carefully read the first 150 pages of this novel, and then I had to skim to reach the end of this book. The ""villain manifesto"" at the end, packed with information Allison had never encountered before in the story, felt especially cliché and unbelievable. Given how clunky and unreal the rest of the book felt to read, I should have expected this manifesto, but I still felt aggravated by the ""big reveal"" in the final action scene of the book. For fans of author C.J. Box and his Joe Pickett series, the debut of Allison Coil is no ""Open Season."" I doubt author Mark Stevens has ever gone elk hunting before, or spent any time at camp with elk hunting guides. I wish Mr. Stevens had done a lot more research, and had some experience in the field, before publishing this book. ""Antler Dust"" is set west of Denver, in the Rocky Mountains, but the entire story reads like a tourist penned the tale, not like anything a lifelong resident of the Rocky Mountains would write.I would not recommend this book to anyone familiar with hunting in the west. But for people who enjoy clichéd stories and mwa-ha-ha villains, ""Antler Dust"" is a murder mystery you will enjoy....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 09, 2017","Apr 12, 2017","Apr 09, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28242433-antler-dust

Author Rosamunde Pilcher wrote an amazingly beautiful book when she penned ""The Shell Seekers.""The story is centered on a character named Penelope Keeling, who comes of age in England at the onset of World War II. Penelope's father is a renowned painter, her mother is the daughter of one of her father's close friends, and the story traces their lives, as well as the lives of Penelope's husband, children, and friends, in this enormously satisfying, and entirely immersive work of art. The prose is so detailed and lush that these characters took over my reality. Reading this novel felt truer than my own life. Everything is chosen with great care -- each word, each scene, each line of dialogue, each setting. The story is enormously rewarding for lovers of language. The selection of details is so precise, so deftly considered in symbolism and weight, building in scale with each page, that the prose itself delivers the greatest themes of the book. Character is plot in this novel, and the plot illustrates the accordion nature of time -- how moments can expand or shrink, uplift or bring ruin, and then sound again and again over the years. The past is the present, the future, and then the present again; the subtle nature of time is as constant and enduring as the rhythm of tides. The characters have lessons to teach, in their stark contrasts with each other, and in the choices they make. There are messages given and received in this book, but the novel is so much richer than any ensemble cast, however brilliantly drawn. ""The Shell Seekers"" belongs in a category of timelessness, because the real themes of this book are all philosophical, large and grand in scope, and endlessly expansive. This is a book to break your heart and revive you, a book that takes and gives, and then gives again. This is a story that makes you glad to be alive. I recommend ""The Shell Seekers"" to readers who love rich, immersive books full of heartache and love, books that crack you right open and stitch you together again. The writing is masterful, and this novel is a triumph of craft.

Meagan Spooner's newest release, the 2019 YA fantasy, ""Sherwood,"" a gender-swapped Robin Hood reEDIT: 5/7/19I decided to reread ""Hunted"" in May 2019. Meagan Spooner's newest release, the 2019 YA fantasy, ""Sherwood,"" a gender-swapped Robin Hood retelling, has been receiving a number of one-star s in my Goodreads feed, so I decided to examine ""Hunted"" again and look more closely at the prose.This novel really benefits from the structure of a much-beloved fairy tale (Beauty and the Beast); I would go so far as to say that all of the emotional potency in this book comes from the fact that you *know* as a reader what the story is in advance, and that it is solely that foreknowledge of the fairy tale's plot that drives the reader through the slow pacing, the moments of repetition and sometimes rather cumbersome sentences, the odd backstory choices, and the rushed payoff at the very end. It remains an excellent payoff, though, and I still felt tears in my eyes when I came to the finale again. But this time, I gave more credit for my reaction to the story's structure: the bones of the original fairy tale. The original story's structure is so, so very satisfying, and this novel's ending wrote the twist in a deeply satisfying way. For my money, this book was worth every penny in hardback. I'm glad I own it. The pacing is very slow, but it's still a short book overall, and a quick read.Things still bothered me as I read. Some things more than others. Here's a short list:1. Portraying the Mongols as rulers who cut off all trade into Rus. Sigh. There is never a mention of the Golden Horde or anything, just ""the Mongols"" being portrayed as bloodthirsty killers cutting off trade. Sigh. 2. Beauty's middle sister, the club-footed Asenka, is a gold-medal-winning Disabled Person as Super Crip character trope: saintly, hard-working, never-complaining, perfect and kind in every way. 3. Beauty is supposed to be a hardscrabble hunter who barely has enough food to eat, but she feeds a precious buck liver to her medium-sized dog. The *entire* liver. And the dog eats the *entire* liver in one sitting, in a matter of minutes. Ugh. It's obvious how little the author understands about deer hunting, field dressing a deer, the size of deer livers, the value of deer organs as human food, the ranking of organ meat, etc. etc. It's also obvious that none of her beta-readers for this book were deer hunters, either. Also: the liver-eating dog had just recently broken its foreleg after being violently thrown against a tree. Within 12 hours of that severe injury, the dog eats an entire buck liver. I just wanna say: animals in that level of pain and injury do not gorge themselves on food like that. And if they do, something is really, really wrong, and they are just going to vomit it all back up. It's not even possible for a medium-sized dog to eat an entire buck liver in one sitting, but if it were, this injured dog would certainly not hold it down. 4. The emphasis on the protagonist, Beauty, ""walking like beauty"" or ""moving like beauty"" wherever she goes in the woods just didn't sit well with me at all. Asenka, with her club foot, is set up in the very beginning of the book as moving with pain and difficulty; Asenka is infinitely kind, compassionate, and stoic in the face of pain, as well as being quite pretty. And then the youngest sister, Beauty, who is able-bodied as well as being born the most beautiful of the three sisters, is also said to ""move"" and ""walk"" ""like beauty"" repeatedly in the text. I don't think the author realized that this is a completely ableist set-up and a highly ableist narrative arc. By the end of the book, it's so problematic that it just pains me in a torturous way to be forced to keep reading ""she moves like beauty,"" ""she walks like beauty."" The ableism is out of control. As Gollum would say: IT BURNS US.My dislikes aside, I still enjoyed reading this book. What is good in this book remains good. I'm keeping my original 4.5-star rating. I love Beauty and the Beast retellings, and this is a very satisfying one. I love the twist at the end. I'm glad I reread it.  *****Original 2017 :4.5 perfectly shimmering stars !!!I have been SO disappointed by the YA fantasy titles I've read lately, reading ""Hunted"" took me by surprise, and then totally wowed me. Sure, there are plenty of 4 and 5-star s for this novel on Goodreads, but a lot of horrendous books get showered in gushing praise. Especially YA fantasy titles. I was actually inspired to pick up this book after reading a scathing 1-star . A  that absolutely shredded the plot of this book as well as the characters.I expected ""Hunted"" to be a trainwreck, a Beauty and the Beast retelling stuffed with tropes and plot holes and lackluster prose, but I was so curious about the Slavic/Russian folklore in this story that I couldn't help myself. The scathing one-star  had mentioned Slavic/Russian folklore played a role in the plot, and that was when I decided I had to read ""Hunted.""And thank my fairy tale stars I did! Because this book is WONDERFUL. The very best way to spend a cold, gray afternoon at home. Sometimes the universe is kind.The beginning was the hardest part for me, because the novel is set in medieval Russia, and there were a number of anachronisms that grated against my little history-loving brain. At first, I made note of them (as I always do when I read, especially if I think I might be reading a trainwreck). But the setting of the story soon switches, as Beauty journeys from her town to the enchanted/cursed land where the Beast lives, and the issues I had in the beginning all vanished. The plot of this book honors the original Beauty and the Beast fairy tale in so many brilliant ways, both in structure and character, and by weaving in the Slavic/Russian folklore, author Meagan Spooner added some truly delightful and inspiring depth to this classic story. The prose of ""Hunted"" is well above average. The sentences flow, and some of the descriptive passages are quite lovely. The characters are beautifully drawn. Beast is a point of view character as well as Beauty, and I really loved his chapters. The relationship between Beauty and her two sisters made me tear up, especially toward the end of the book. There is a wonderful canine named Doe-Eyes and a reinvented Gaston character named Solmir. The magic of this story world was subtle, unique, and added so well to the dialogue and plot. The novel had a quiet, relentless drive that built toward the last fifty pages, and it was this final section of the book that made me really sit back and say, WOW. Wow. Fricking awesome.""Hunted"" is a rare YA fantasy that features a lot of emotional depth in the characters, whether they are main characters or secondary. This is a novel in which actions have consequences, psychologically as well as physically, a story in which bodies are not machines full of limitless power, but fragile objects that often struggle and suffer. My highest praise for ""Hunted"" is this: the novel has a depth of understanding about human nature, storytelling, and the power of reshaping stories, that made my brain explode with pleasure as I witnessed Beauty undergo the final part of her hero's journey. The finale of this book is wise and rich and perfect. If you are a reader who loves fairy tale retellings, interesting magical worlds, or stories that weave folklore into their plots, I would recommend you add ""Hunted"" to your reading list....more",Notes are private!,0,4,2,"May 2019Mar 31, 2017","May 07, 2019Apr 2017","Mar 31, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24485589-hunted

If anyone ever suffers the untimely loss of a heterosexual lover, the very best cure is to find a new heterosexual lover. As one might imagine, gender essentialism is vital to this Heterosexual Primacy theme. I often felt nauseated and furious while I read. The gender role/gender essentialism in this book is so extremely dated, I kept thinking I was reading a book set in France in the 1950s, not a novel set in 2012/2013. Sweeping, universalizing statements about the essential natures of men and women are embedded in this entire novel, in dialogue as well as in the narrative voice, expressed to the reader as wisdom and truth. Much later in the story, the book tries to tout the message that women do not need to have a perfect body in order to be loved. But that message is completely disproved by the entire book. Every woman who receives ""love"" in this book (as symbolized by possessing a heroic male partner/spouse) is slender and physically beautiful/flawless/perfect. Women who are ""fat,"" physically deformed, possess facial hair, or other unwanted physical attributes are mocked and belittled by the characters in this story. One young woman who has a single breast and a shaved head (due to surviving cancer), is given a quickie (a brief sexual encounter) by a male character who takes pity on her. Soon after this brief sexual encounter, that male character falls into insta-love with a gorgeous slender female who is riding a tractor, a physically ""perfect"" and healthy woman he chooses to marry. The man's quickie with the cancer survivor is viewed as an act of compassion (so the reader will feel more sympathy for this man), and the fact that he later falls in love with a ""perfect"" woman is seen as wisdom, since the main character of the novel, the bookseller named Jean, silently hopes this young man will not choose to fall in love with a sick woman. ""The Little Paris Bookshop"" is subtly repulsive, but on its surface, the novel is clearly designed as a fun, corny story about an oddball cast of men taking a trip down the river together, traveling from Paris to the south of France aboard a boat full of books. Slapstick comedy and fleeting moments of irony make it easy to envision the movie posters for this story, with film trailers cheerfully proclaiming the picture as ""heartwarming"" and ""delightful"" when everyone knows the best adjective would be ""cheesy."" This novel was originally published in German and French, and then translated into English, and I think some of the random ""cock"" and ""pussy"" phrases were errors in translation, instances in which softer language would have been used by a writer penning a story in English. Or maybe the stronger language was chosen because the prose of ""The Little Paris Bookshop"" is more literary than commercial fiction, and the coarser erotica terms are often chosen for literary fiction. Whatever the case, there are few times in the book when these words are used, and I would never classify anything in this novel as ""erotica."" The story stresses heterosexual love and heterosexual lovemaking, but nothing in the sex scenes I read was very graphic. (I skimmed the last 100 pages, but I doubt anything qualified as erotica there, either.)The novel changes direction in the last 100 pages. The river trip ends, the oddball men go their separate ways, and Jean embarks on a solitary mission of confronting the extent of his grief. He swims in the ocean a lot, eats various meals while he gazes at sunsets, and writes letters. The story read very slow and strange here, since the book had completely shifted direction. After a long period of time, Jean returns to the place where the river trip ended, and the story moves into its final resolution. If I'd been invested in these characters, I wouldn't have minded this big plot change. But since I was worn down by all the gender essentialist statements, which remain glaringly present throughout this Time To Heal interlude, I started skimming. Even the final Grief Summation scene prompted me to skim a few pages. The lover Jean has lost -- a 25-year-old young woman named Manon -- interested me for the sole reason that she equally loved two men. Within the first 100 pages of the book, I really hoped Manon's psychology of sexual freedom would be explored a lot more. But that was never the case, and Manon was characterized overall as a classic Manic Pixie Dream Girl. So was a woman named Samantha, a beautiful woman who briefly joins the men on the boat. Another Manic Pixie Dream Girl briefly appears in a tango dance hall, and she kisses Jean after they share part of a dance together. Since these women are all ""worth"" having sex with, they are slender and perfect. Reading books like this has the unintended consequence of making me hate myself, since I am not a gorgeous Manic Pixie Dream Girl, but a flawed and very un-pixie-ish woman who identifies with the women who were mocked in this story. As Jean says of one of his female neighbors: ""Such a delicate soul in a heavy body!"" As in: Oh, that poor woman! Well, I identify with Jean's exclamation mark a great deal -- woe to my heavy body! I am physically taller than Jean, and I probably weigh more than he does as well. Woe to me! For plenty of readers, all of this fat-shaming and body-shaming and gender essentialism either came across as normal and acceptable, or perhaps added an extra layer of sweetness and joy to the pages of this book, because ""The Little Paris Bookshop"" became an international bestseller and has a huge fan base. Every character in this book (main and secondary) is a white, middle-class, cis heterosexual. Of the two characters who are ""disabled"" by cancer, the disease is a stand-in for death, since Manon is already dead when the story begins, and the young woman with one breast (who is a tertiary character, not even a secondary, since she only appears in one scene) -- her cancer is also a shorthand for ""death,"" since she has been ""battling"" cancer for many years and could soon ""lose"" the fight. For as much as I disliked ""The Little Paris Bookshop,"" I did enjoy the vocabulary choices in certain descriptive passages, and there were moments when I laughed aloud at the slapstick antics of the goofball men aboard a bookshop boat. I can understand why this book gained so much popularity. Overall, this novel felt like the literary equivalent of pink cotton candy -- candy with a bittersweet flavor, due to the focus on grief -- but cotton candy nonetheless....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 29, 2017","Apr 03, 2017","Mar 29, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23278537-the-little-paris-bookshop

Clearly, Dr. Debbie Reese has pointed out that it is not. In mulling over whether I should remove a star from my , which I did for ""Eleanor and Park"" when presented with information like this, I consider the fact that Bella Swan's love interest in ""Twilight"" is not a member of the Quileute tribe. (Please note that I am not ing the entire saga, just this first book in the series.) Since the bulk of this novel focuses on Edward and Bella together as the main romance plot, the Native American content is an overall very small part of this book (in looking at the total pages of the novel in comparison to the number of pages spent on the Quileute characters). This excuses none of the problematic Native American content in this book, but to contrast this book with another YA novel like ""Eleanor and Park,"" by Rainbow Rowell, in which a white female main character falls in love with an Asian American male main character, and the novel spends much more time depicting a culture that is not the white, dominant culture of the female main character.I removed a star from my original ""Eleanor and Park""  due to the fact that Park's characterization and culture was such a larger part of the overall novel, and to have that poorly portrayed felt much more egregious to me. When marginalized people are the main characters of stories, the impact of harmful content is much more amplified than when secondary characters are portrayed with harmful stereotypes. Or, in cases when the marginalized person drives the entire plot of the book, as is the case with novels like ""Me Before You,"" the overall effect of the portrayal magnifies the damaging representation. In all of the things that a single book can get right or get wrong, I try to take stock of the sum total of problematic sh*t in a story, and in the case of ""Twilight,"" I'm going to leave this  with 5 stars. If this book had been published in 2018, I would not give it 5 stars. But with the increasing awareness of anti-Native content in novels and how to avoid it, with We Need Diverse Books and own voices helping to educate authors not to write so much problematic sh*t in their stories, I would expect more from books being published today than in 2005. New books are still being published with damaging Native American content on an equal or worse level than the content in ""Twilight."" Many of these books compound their negative or appropriated portrayals with racism, ableism, classism, homophobia, misogyny, and all other forms of oppressive discourse in culture. Personally, I did not find ""Twilight"" to be a complete sh*tshow of hegemonic discourse, for the reasons I state below. And this is why I'm choosing to leave this  to stand at 5 stars. There is a lot of poison in books in general. With ""Twilight,"" I think readers should be well-informed that the Native content in this book is problematic. I have included Dr. Debbie Reese's Twitter thread link as a warning that this book contains problematic content.**********Review posted in summer of 2018:""Twilight"" is a very sweet, very romantic YA/Young Adult novel. I think it ought to be shelved as a YA contemporary, rather than YA fantasy. I decided to reread this novel *as* a YA contemporary, and once my expectations were adjusted to that genre, I enjoyed it. The first time I tried to read ""Twilight,"" however, I expected horror. By 2008, when I first picked up ""Twilight,"" I had already read the first seven Anita Blake books (1993-1998) and watched ""Interview with the Vampire"" (1994) and ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) enough times to expect my vampires to be monsters, or at least morally-conflicted monsters. I definitely expected a lot of high-stakes action and plot. What I *wasn't* expecting was a YA contemporary, or a YA contemporary romance. YA contemporary often features a love story as the main plot, along with the drama of navigating high school, getting the laundry done, falling in love for the first time, and cooking dinner at night while finishing math homework. It has taken me decades of life to appreciate YA contemporary novels. Like the adult romance genre, YA contemporary is not a favorite of mine, and I do not seek these books out. As a teenager and young adult in my twenties, I found these books beyond dull and loathsome to read. But the older I get, the more I can appreciate the appeal of a gentle love story like ""Twilight."" Stephenie Meyer is an avid reader, and a devoted lover of Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, William Shakespeare, and many other luminaries of literature. That love shines through in ""Twilight."" Her influences are good ones, and this book features a lot of lovely passages drawn from careful observation. Meyer's descriptions of tide pools, walks in the forest, a meadow on a spring day, the Sonoran desert, and many other setting details were as much fun for me to read as all of the tender touches and conversations between the two main characters. Much ink has been spilled on hating this book and its author. It exhausts me to think of how much hate people throw at ""Twilight"" and Stephenie Meyer. Having finally read the entire novel, I cannot agree with the haters. I would not recommend this book to anyone who expects Anita-Blake-level horror, or the kind of standard YA fantasy starring a ""strong female character"" who is also sometimes called ""the badass Mary Sue."" If a reader prefers a female teenage main character who is the ""physical equal of any man,"" then I would recommend YA main characters like Katniss, Katsa, Karou, etc. But while Bella Swan might not be the ""physical equal of any man,"" she has a lot of strength as a character. It's all feminine strength, though, and since the patriarchy says feminine strength is pure weakness (and, let's be honest: absolutely revolting), it's often easy to dismiss Bella Swan as being that most hated of things: a girl. (*Gasp!*) Bella is a *teenage* girl. (*Double Gasp!*) And it gets worse, of course. Because Bella is not just a teenage girl, but a teenage girl who has *feelings.* Yes, *feelings.* (!!!!) (*OMG How Dare She!!*)I know, I know. It's a lot. >_< Teenage girls have feelings. (!!) Grown men have feelings. (!!) People have feelings. (!!) I am not kidding when I say that this book is no friend of the patriarchy. It's also no friend of porn culture. Readers who crave emotionally unavailable men who verbally and emotionally abuse their female love interests should stay *far* away from this book. In ""Twilight,"" Edward cares for and protects Bella, and he is the first one to use the L-word in their relationship. Not only that, but Stephenie Meyer writes *emotions* -- **actual emotions** -- in interior monologue and direct dialogue on Every. Single. Page. (!!!!) Reader beware. (!!!!) Since I'm not drinking the haterade of the patriarchy right now, I want to share a few more of my pro-Twilight thoughts after reading this book. Bella Swan is a great main character. She is carefully drawn. She is a realistic American teenage girl. Edward Cullen is a worthy love interest for Bella. He is an insightful, soulful immortal man with a teenager's body. His vampirism is the star-crossed lovers plot twist that complicates what would otherwise be a straightforward love story. Conflict is the engine of fiction, and ""Twilight"" sets up a good star-crossed lovers conflict. Outside of the paranormal elements, which are not the main focus of this novel, this book is very real, and that is the best compliment I can ever give to a novel. Bella is astutely written as a lower-middle-class teen. Edward and his vampire family live in the upper-middle-class, and that class difference is part of the wish-fulfillment fantasy that so many other novels and movies employ. ""Twilight"" is a book worth loving. It makes me sad that so many fans of this book were so ruthlessly shamed for enjoying this romance that they chose to join the Hate Parade against it. A lot of YA authors who were inspired to become writers because they loved ""Twilight"" so much (Roshani Chokshi, Stephanie Garber, Julie Murphy, etc. etc. etc.) have also publicly disavowed it. Some of these authors have stated that ""Twilight"" is ""poorly written,"" ""complete garbage,"" or ""fluff."" This is equally heartbreaking to me. ""Twilight"" is full of emotion and a lot of great prose. The story is clear, the structure is sound, the pages turn easily. I do not agree with the haterade here. For years, I had a lot of anger against ""Twilight"" because I expected horror and high-stakes action rather than a YA contemporary. Whenever vampires appeared on the page, I expected some gore. I resented that my favorite monsters had been softened so much as to no longer be scary. But vampires aren't really the point of this book. ""Twilight"" is about two people falling in love, and one of them has a condition that creates a lot of problems for being together. The romance is extremely well-written, and I loved all of the real-life, mundane details woven into this book. It only took me a few days to read ""Twilight."" I needed a lot longer to process how many things this book gets right, how many things I admire about what this book does, and how much of the haterade against ""Twilight"" honestly has nothing to do with this book, and everything to do with modern culture (which is largely patriarchal/anti-feminine and pornographic), the power of group-think, and how much we love to hate on things in gigantic packs. My suggestion is to read ""Twilight"" as a YA contemporary, or as a YA romance with paranormal elements. If you want the more standard fare of YA fantasy, which typically features a high-action main plot with a subplot-romance, then look elsewhere.Five full stars for being a delightfully realistic teen romance novel that I can even enjoy as an adult.**********Update: August 6, 2018I have decided to reread this book as a YA contemporary, rather than think of it as YA fantasy or YA urban fantasy. I think I will enjoy this book a lot more if I read it with the right frame of reference. The first time I tried to read this, I expected to read the YA version of Anita Blake, which is certainly not what this is. I'm pretty excited to give this another try. Original  from 2008 --(two stars)I managed to read the first 150 pages of Twilight, and then had such a strong compulsion to DNF that I skimmed the rest. I'm just not the right audience for this book. I didn't like the world-building or the concept of the sparkling vampires who feed on wildlife. I didn't like the protagonist or how all the boys at her school were magically attracted to her. This story just didn't seem realistic enough to hold my attention. The main plot of the romance between Bella and Edward was interesting at first, but after the first hundred pages, I completely lost interest....more",Notes are private!,0,8,2,"Aug 06, 2018May 2008","Aug 20, 2018May 2008","Mar 20, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41865.Twilight

Roughly five years later, I still think of this book -- not because the characters or the story stayed with me, but because this novel received a lot of hype and attention as a literary debut. I was one of those readers who *immediately* rushed out to read it, and so I picked up this book expecting a lot.Sadly, this novel didn't deliver the emotional punch or the dark truths I was hoping to find. I'm glad that the long sections of blacked-out text worked for some readers. For me, that tactic fell flat. I understand that the author didn't want to detail the sexual abuse the child protagonist suffers. But since the book ends on a hopeful note, with a brighter future in sight for this child, I felt like I wanted -- needed -- the prose to take me deeper into this story than it did.I think this book has stayed with me simply for all the ways that I questioned --while I was reading it -- why I wasn't as engaged as I should be. So unengaged that I still wonder why this entire novel has been completely forgotten only five years later. I can usually retain more information than that from a book. I had to read The New York Times Book Review for this novel to remember who the main character was, where the story was set, and what the plot was. Tonight was another night when ""Girlchild"" came back to mind -- a book that had all of the elements of a story I might've loved with the same passion I love ""Red Azalea"" and ""The Liars' Club"" and ""The God of Animals"" -- but the reality is, I forgot everything about ""Girlchild"" almost immediately after I finished reading the book. And honestly, I still wonder why. It's not a bad book, the prose is good, and the story definitely feels like an authentic portrayal of poverty -- but something was missing. Some vital piece of heart muscle that I still wonder if I could name better now, if I ever reread this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Mar 19, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12160934-girlchild

The prose is so beautiful, I was constantly jotting down gorgeous turns of phase and brilliant sentences with a sense of awe and delight. After the death of her father, author Helen Macdonald chose to train a goshawk as a way to help her through grief and despair. She interweaves her personal story with a fascinating biography of author T.H. White. Known to many readers as the author of ""The Once and Future King,"" Mr. Terence Hanbury White also had a fascination with goshawks, and penned his own memoir about the first goshawk he ever attempted to train. I learned an enormous amount about T.H. White while reading ""H Is for Hawk."" The material about him was absorbing on its own, and much more so when read in tandem with Ms. MacDonald's own insights and experiences.My favorite parts of the book involved Ms. Macdonald's descriptions of the natural world -- her enchanting ability to describe a landscape and the history of a landscape -- as well as her poignant descriptions of her goshawk, Mabel. I learned so much about raptors and goshawks, and the reptilian nature of birds in general, by reading this book.The poetic prose of this memoir is writing craft of the highest order, and this book is pure pleasure to read.

I definitely felt the truth of those words while reading, because this book reads like a first novel. The pacing is off, the plot loses steam early on and struggles to regain its tension (never successfully), and the female love interest of the title, most often called ""the maid"" or ""the Grey Rose"" by the male main character, ends the book by basically telling the hero, ""I'm just not that into you."" But she uses some bullsh*t excuse about suffering and time instead of just telling him the truth, which was super annoying. I wish she had just died at the end, since I was pretty much over her character as a plot device by that point and longed for her destruction. It's never a good sign when you're hoping the plot-device heroine dies.Alas, I am made of salt and bitterness. I give this book 2.5 stars, and round it up to 3.I wish I had loved this book, because ""The Harp of the Grey Rose"" is my friend Hannah's favorite fantasy novel, and she gave me this book as a gift.The first 83 pages, or 30% of this novel, were a great read. I was really enjoying myself when the story began. This book is a classic fantasy bildungsroman, with a young boy named Cerin who is destined to save the world. He sets off on his hero's journey by leaving his small town behind, desperate to save Leia Organa Skywalker -- oh, sorry -- I mean the Grey Rose, a girl who is part goddess and blessed with immortal life. Very early in the book, the Grey Rose is kidnapped by an immortal shadow killer god-type thing named... sorry, I can't remember the first antagonist's name. Yarac the Waster is the name given on the back of the book, so I think that's him. Cerin easily kills Yarac within the first 83 pages, and the book introduces a new villain off-scene, a super-malevolent female killer armed with super-malevolent magic. I can't remember her name, either, but I was glad when she finally died because she was utterly horrible. Cerin spends the bulk of this novel meeting a lot of warrior-dude buddies who help him on his quest to learn how to fight, use his magic, and save the Grey Rose, who is almost always off-scene and under constant threat of death by the super-malevolent witch woman, because reasons. The evil witch lady takes over a whole city and then sends creepy monsters after Cerin to kill him. There's a dwarf character who is a *lot* like Gimli (from The Lord of the Rings), and a talking bear-warrior friend who is a lot like Iorek Byrnison (from The Golden Compass, 1995). Talking animal friends are a popular trope in fantasy, and this novel has bears and other animals who talk and act just like people.While ""The Harp of the Grey Rose"" is a traditional sausage-fest of male warriors who are motivated by: 1. the evil witch destroying everything, and 2. the beautiful good female who is the mc's love interest, it did attempt to subvert a few of the Super Fantasy Tropes that make this book so predictable. Having the Grey Rose tell Cerin at the end to (basically) piss off was one such subversion. My favorite part of this book was that the Grey Rose is the one to defeat the evil witch at the end, rather than Cerin or one of the other warrior-dudes. Though I have a suspicion there was only a sense of author-chivalry behind that choice, in that the author worried Cerin might be seen as an asshole for ""killing a woman"" at the end, so the Grey Rose gets that duty. Who knows. There's also a topless woman who has the lower body of a deer in this book, because titties. Cerin might not get the Grey Rose at the end, but he does get to stare at some very pretty boobies. This naked deer-woman makes two appearances in the story, because boobies. I think she also kisses Cerin on the mouth, and the Grey Rose kisses him on the mouth at the end of the story, too. That's the extent of the novel's sexual content. The nicest aspect of this book, for me, was that Cerin is a harpist, and he uses his music and his harp as a magical power. While the plot moments largely fell flat for me, regarding his powers and how they are used, Cerin does finally make good on his magic by the end, and that was nice.The story is told in first person, and the writing is good, full of interesting detail and a nice use of vocabulary. But for all of its competency, the prose feels distant and lacks urgency. It often feels like Cerin is narrating this tale as an old man, and after the first 30% of the book, I never felt any fear for him, or wondered what would happen to him or how his story would end. The book just hammered hard on the most common fantasy tropes, and added a lot of world-building detail that went nowhere. While I liked seeing a male main character cry in a novel, the fact that the Grey Rose dumps Cerin at the end really made Cerin's growth into manhood suffer overall. Cerin isn't the one who vanquishes the evil witch, he cries more than once through the book, he has to be pushed by the Grey Rose and other people to use his magic at all, even at the end of the story -- and to me, he still felt like a 17-year-old boy by the end, not fully an adult yet. I admit that I'm not the best audience for adult fantasy books. I didn't care for ""The Golden Compass,"" or ""Uprooted,"" I've only seen ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies twice (and never read the books), and my favorite adult fantasy is ""Wise Child,"" which is not a traditional sausage-fest trope book. I read a lot of YA fantasy, but the adult titles just never seem to do it for me. If you are a fan of adult fantasy and have not yet read this book, you might really enjoy it. Charles de Lint has published a lot of other novels that have had a wider readership than ""The Harp of the Grey Rose,"" and you might also really enjoy his other books, too. He's a good writer, and has won many awards. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 22, 2018","Nov 18, 2018","Mar 15, 2017",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1003866.The_Harp_of_the_Grey_Rose

The author has been raised to assume shThe literary memoir ""The Rules Do Not Apply"" is all about a privileged white woman who has led a charmed life. The author has been raised to assume she has control over all aspects of her life because nothing traumatic has ever happened to her, or anyone in her family, and she has had a successful writing career, according to plan. She has grown up believing she should ""have it all"" in life, and she actively pursues that goal throughout childhood and into her adulthood. Author Ariel Levy assumes that this message of ""having control"" and ""having it all"" in life was a lesson of feminism. At age 38, the author uses medical intervention to become pregnant for the first time, but suffers a miscarriage five months into her pregnancy. Due to this tragedy, Ms. Levy suddenly realizes life is uncontrollable, and is a terminal event for all of us (she figures out that we all have to die). She also realizes that she does not have control over life, and she is now forced to accept that she cannot ""have it all."" Ms. Levy blames her lack of control, and her inability to ""have it all"" on feminism. Her memoir touts the belief that feminism has failed her. It is difficult to type a  when my skull is full of such utter loathing for a book. I don't hate the author for sharing what she has suffered; I hate that Ariel Levy chose to universalize her experience as representative of ALL women, and then blame the vagaries of life on feminism. As if feminism were responsible for the placental abruption that caused her miscarriage. As if feminism were responsible for her spouse being an alcoholic, or the cause of the author's adultery. As if feminism were responsible for alcoholism and adultery ending the author's marriage. News flash, Ms. Levy: PRIVILEGE and ENTITLEMENT teach the lessons that life is always within your control, and that you deserve to ""have it all."" FEMINISM teaches: that those who possess any kind of female genitalia or feminine gender are human beings, and that ALL human beings deserve equal access to dignity, legal rights, opportunities, experiences, education, and love.Here are some examples of how Ms. Levy (who was born in 1974) universalizes her privileged experience as a central theme of her memoir.""We [Ms. Levy and her female friends] lived in a world where we had control of so much. If we didn't want to carry groceries up the steps, we ordered them online and waited in our sweatpants on the fourth floor for a man from Asia or Latin America to come panting up, encumbered with our cat litter and organic bananas. [...] Anything seemed possible if you had ingenuity, money, and tenacity."" (page 10)""We were raised to think we could do what we wanted -- we were free to be you and me! And many of our parents' revolutionary dreams had actually come true. [...] You could be female and have an engrossing career and you didn't have to be a wife or mother (although, let's face it, it still seemed advisable: Spinsterhood never exactly lost its taint). Sometimes our parents were dazzled by the sense of possibility they'd bestowed upon us. Other times, they were aghast to recognize their own entitlement, staring back at them magnified in the mirror of their offspring.""The ""we"" in that passage on page 10 and 11 walks a fine line between referring to ""Ms. Levy and her friends"" and a ""we"" that stands in for ""all women of the author's generation."" Here is a place in the text in which the ""we"" most clearly refers to ""all women of the author's generation"" and doesn't limit itself to Ms. Levy and her friends alone:""Women of my generation were given the lavish gift of our own agency by feminism -- a belief that we could decide for ourselves how we would live, what would become of us."" (page 69) Ms. Levy makes it clear she has no idea what feminism stands for -- because feminism most certainly does NOT say you can determine your own fate. Feminism says all people should have the right to make their own choices -- feminism doesn't promise that life will deliver that choice.But the delusion gets even worse. Here is a passage in which Ms. Levy is comparing herself to her mother, and then universalizing her own desires as the desires of ALL women (not just as the desires of herself and her small group of friends) --""I wanted what she [my mother] had wanted, what we all want: everything. We want a mate who feels like family and a lover who is exotic, surprising. We want to be youthful adventurers and middle-aged mothers. We want intimacy and autonomy, safety and stimulation, reassurance and novelty, coziness and thrills."" (page 90)I started gnashing my teeth when I read that. Because I am a woman and I do NOT want to be a middle-aged mother. I have NEVER wanted to have a child. Not when I was a child myself, and not as a woman who is now 36 years old. Feminism lets me know that it's OKAY to make that choice for myself. That I am NO LESS a woman just because I do not want to give birth, and have never wanted to be a mother.But here is the passage in the book in which it is clear how insulated in her privilege Ms. Levy truly is: when she writes of fleeing her home after finding her spouse (Lucy) has been drinking. The realization that Lucy has been lying all along about her drinking problem precipitates the end of their marriage, and Ms. Levy makes the choice to leave their ""island house"" immediately --""I got the keys from Lucy and told her it was time to take a nap -- she fell asleep quickly in our bed. Then I found the kittens and my computer, and got in the Jeep, sweat rolling down the back of my neck, the insides of my thighs. I drove past the mariners' shops in Greenport and the stalwart farms and corny wineries of the North Fork. I looked at the people -- from Guatemala, from Mexico -- working in the fields, the sun pounding down on them indifferently. I wondered if everything that pained me would seem ridiculous to those women, or if some of our problems were the same. The cats roamed between the backseat and the passenger's side in front, pushing their faces toward the air conditioner."" (page 119)That is all the attention those ""people/women"" receive in this text -- a passing thought smashed between the mention of Ms. Levy's kittens. But let me point out something important here -- a level of racism that is subtle, insidious, and completely at odds with feminism. Ms. Levy is using a casual shorthand to give her readers a visual on these workers, stating they are ""from Guatemala, from Mexico"" -- even though she doesn't know anything about these field workers beyond what she can see from her vehicle window. She is traveling across Long Island, back to her home in Manhattan, and making assumptions based on a glance. In reality, Ms. Levy doesn't know WHERE ""those women"" are from -- and I have a big news flash for the author -- field workers can be U.S. citizens, born and raised on American soil. Field workers in the United States might have been born and raised ANYWHERE. And I would bet at least some of ""those women"" working the fields are Ms. Levy's age, fellow members of Ms. Levy's generation, and could have grown up in the state of New York along with her. And you see what Ms. Levy does? She tells the reader ""those women"" have dark skin, dark hair, and they look foreign. She tells the reader ""those women"" don't look American. Because they're ""from"" a foreign country -- even though all she truly knows about them is what she can see with her eyes.She did the same thing to the people she hired to deliver her groceries -- when she used the phrase ""a man from Asia or Latin America"" to describe a delivery person -- based on nothing more than what she can see with her eyes. As if a yellow-skinned or brown-skinned delivery person cannot be born in the United States, or England, or France, or anywhere that is not a developing or communist nation.The entire memoir is like this: it's the tale of a white woman of privilege who is so insulated in her levels of entitlement, she believes she speaks for ""all"" women when she cannot even recognize that her class and race have completely Othered the non-white women around her, to say nothing of the women of her own class and race who have never felt entitled to ""having it all,"" or the women who have always understood that life is a terminal event that is not completely under their control.It's important to note that Ms. Levy tries to equalize herself with the women working in the fields by pointing out that she is sweating along with them. Ms. Levy, with her air conditioner struggling to cool down the inside of her Jeep, is sweating the same way those field workers are sweating in the indifferent sun. As if their suffering is equalized, in the same way she is suggesting that alcoholism, and the consequences of alcoholism, aren't limited to a particular nationality, class, or race. Not only does she Other ""those women,"" but she strives to put their suffering on the same scale as hers.This memoir taught me that there are accomplished literary elites in the world who would rather blame their problems on feminism than white privilege. ""The Rules Do Not Apply"" features Hemingway-esque prose and a severe lack of depth. This memoir is not about universal womanhood, but all the ways entitlement can weaken and debilitate those who are insulated from the hardships of life by their place of birth, skin color, and wealth....more",Notes are private!,0,138,1,"Mar 26, 2017","Mar 29, 2017","Mar 15, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32572166-the-rules-do-not-apply

She is eighteen years old. Her name is Celaena, which is pronounced ""Sell-lay-nah,"" according to the book'DNF at 69%This is a book about an assassin. She is eighteen years old. Her name is Celaena, which is pronounced ""Sell-lay-nah,"" according to the book's pronunciation guide.If you ever, for a moment, forget that the main character is an assassin, don't worry -- the third person narrator will frequently remind you of her job title by referring to Celaena as ""the assassin"" in exposition.Celaena/the assassin is not just any assassin. On page one, she is identified as her kingdom's ""most notorious assassin."" On page nine, the Crown Prince of her kingdom calls Celaena ""the greatest assassin"" in the world. Except a year before the story begins, when Celaena was seventeen, she got caught. Busted. Betrayed by some unknown person, and imprisoned by the King. The King put Celaena on trial, and then sentenced her to die in a death camp. This particular death camp is a salt mine, and we're told most prisoners die within a few months, if they even make it that long. When the book begins, the reader learns that Celaena has survived an entire year at this death camp/salt mine. On page eleven, we're told she once tried to escape, and ""killed her overseer and twenty-three sentries before they caught her."" On page 122, we are told that even though Celaena was whipped on her first day at the mine, was almost starved during her time there, and was often beaten like the other slaves/prisoners, none of the guards at the death camp ever ""raped"" Celaena because they were ""afraid"" of her.Celaena is a virgin. Despite being the most notorious assassin, who was betrayed and imprisoned by a corrupt king, and then sentenced to die in a death camp where other women were raped and killed as a matter of course -- Celaena survived with an unviolated vagina intact.On page one of the book, Celaena is being removed from this death camp in order to compete in a ""competition"" at the King's castle, a competition that turns out to be a lot like a high school track meet. There is an archery test, a climbing test, a running test... The King designed this competition himself, and he told 24 members of his court -- including his own son, the Crown Prince -- that they could pick a person to compete in this high school track meet-style contest. So these court members each pick whatever scummy, ruthless people they believe might stand the best chance of winning: convicted serial killers, murderers, thieves, criminals... folks like that. There are 23 of them, plus Celaena. So Celaena has to defeat 23 competitors to win the contest, and avoid being sent back to the salt mine. She will become the King's ""Champion,"" his most trusted killer and doer of dirty deeds.Hmmm... where have I seen that number ""23"" before? Oh yes: when Celaena tried to escape the salt mine, she killed 23 sentries. Of course. Big thanks to the author for broadcasting exactly how this book will end. ""Throne of Glass"" is not really about this contest though, or Celaena's work as an assassin. This book is the equivalent of reading a YA contemporary about a white girl living in a wealthy white suburb who moves to a new school (located in a castle), makes new friends (a princess, a maid, a puppy), and sorts through her emotions concerning two really cute boys who both fall in love with her (the Crown Prince and the Captain of the Guard, who is only 22 years old). Celaena spends hours upon hours in this story worrying about which pretty dress she should wear, reading books, playing the piano, playing billiards, strolling the grounds of the castle, hanging out with her friends, and listening to people tell her how pretty she is. Lots of people in this story comment on Celaena's good looks.Even though Celaena has no idea who betrayed her right before she was captured, she is very trusting of everyone in the palace. She participates in the contest for several weeks before she thinks to look around her big bedroom one night, pulls aside the tapestry on the wall, and discovers a doorway that leads directly outside. Even though some kind of monster has been turned loose in the castle by then, and the competitors are slowly being shredded/mauled/eaten/dismembered by this unknown thing, Celaena does not leave the castle and run for her life. She returns to her bedroom and continues flirting with cute boys. And shortly after participating in a ""name that poison"" kind of contest with the other competitors (in which Celaena earns a perfect score by cheating) -- she finds a sack full of candy in her bedroom, placed on her pillow. No note, no idea who sent it or what is really in that candy -- Celaena just immediately starts eating it, stuffing handfuls of the sugary treats in her mouth, blissfully.The narrator has to keep calling Celaena ""the assassin"" throughout the book because she never acts like one. Celaena behaves like a modern American teenager, navigating the perils of high school, which is focused on image, popularity, prestige, and maybe participating in a high school track meet.In the real world, once a person has started killing for money, they are a target. People hire assassins to kill other assassins in vengeance. (Or surviving family members and friends can choose to go after them on their own.) Celaena stood trial, and was put in a death camp -- it is completely unbelievable that someone didn't kill her while she was either in the King's dungeon or at the death camp. If she was good at her job, she killed someone of means. And people of means are missed by other people of means when they're gone -- in other words, missed by people with the money to hire a killer of their own.The author tries to explain why the people in the kingdom didn't know Celaena was at the death camp by saying that the King kept her trial ""a secret."" Obviously the author has never heard the expression: ""Three men can keep a secret if two of them are dead."" There is no way the King could keep the TRIAL of the MOST NOTORIOUS ASSASSIN a SECRET. Even if the King MASSIVELY BRIBED every official and guard who interacted with Celaena throughout this entire capture-and-trial process, I guarantee that the families and friends of the people Celaena had killed were willing to pay EVEN MORE for her name. And I guarantee that the men working for this corrupt and foolish King would have eagerly pocketed that money, too. I had equal believability problems concerning the Prince deciding to keep her identity ""secret"" long after he takes her out of the salt mine. When the Prince comes to collect her, he has fourteen guards with him, plus the Captain of the Guard, plus a vicious/evil character name Duke Perrington. ALL of these people know who Celaena is, and why the Crown Prince is taking her to the castle. To make this secret-keeping even more ridiculous, Duke Perrington is also a rival of the Crown Prince -- the Duke is fronting his *own* competitor to compete in the contest -- a muscle-bound thug named Cain. (Because whoever sponsors the winning ""Champion"" of the contest wins a bunch of gold, courtesy of the King.) After Celaena arrives in the castle, and has met all of the other competitors, the Prince tells her he will keep her identity a secret during the contest, and that she is to use the name ""Lillian"" from now on. No mention is ever made about ALL THE PEOPLE who already KNOW who she is, including Duke Perrington. Yet much later in the book, when Cain tells Celaena that he knows her real name, Celaena is shocked and freaked out by the revelation. If I was meant to think of Celaena as an intelligent person, ""Throne of Glass"" failed abysmally in achieving that goal. This book made me feel especially sorry for all of the real-life survivors of death camps. Of course the Holocaust comes to mind first, but there have been countless death camps all over the world. To survive a year in a death camp takes an enormous psychological toll on a person. Anyone who thinks that Celaena's behavior in this novel is an accurate portrayal of a traumatized death camp survivor should consider picking up some nonfiction titles to read. Holocaust concentration camp survivor tales might be the most accessible for readers who are curious about how a person might behave after spending a year being beaten, whipped, and deprived of proper nourishment while doing manual labor.A large number of readers adored ""Throne of Glass"" because Celaena, unlike Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games,"" cares about wearing pretty dresses, being told she is pretty, and flirting with boys. Celaena also has moments when she tells the reader that looking at the handsome Crown Prince makes her feel ""ridiculously tingly and warm."" At no point does Celaena ever question why a King would let OTHER PEOPLE pick his competitors for the role of ""most trusted Champion."" News flash: the competitors will always hold loyalty to their sponsor over their corrupt and ineffectual ""king."" What this story has done is guarantee that this King has a Death Wish, putting himself close to people who cannot be trusted at all. And the King has an ENTIRE ARMY to choose a Champion from -- why is he scraping the bottom of the barrel here, and having criminals compete in a track meet to find a ""personal assassin"" to kill in his name? All I can say of ""Throne of Glass"" is that this book exists in a Logic Free Zone.I had other problems with the story. The timeline is all wonky, for one. We're told the contest will take 13 weeks before the final duel will take place, but 3.5 months go by (14 weeks), and then at least two more weeks go by, and the contest is still going on. It's like the author forgot the rules of the game.  I really didn't like the random mashup of bastardized Pagan words the author used in this book. She did this for the purpose of world-building, and even though there were only two, both made me angry. First, there was ""Samhuinn,"" a bastardized term for the Pagan celebration of ""Samhain."" That one really aggravated me. But then I discovered ""Yulemas"" on page 272, described as ""a holiday to celebrate the birth of the Goddess's firstborn son. It was simply a day when people were more courteous, looked twice at a beggar in the street, remembered that love was a living thing."" This was the first time in the book the word ""Goddess"" was used, and the thoughtless combination of taking what sounds like the author's own experience of Christmas in real life, and inserting an unnamed Pagan ""Goddess"" into the place where the Christian ""God"" should appear, upset me a great deal. Maybe people who spit on *all* religion just do not give a damn about insulting the belief systems of real people, and I do understand that many readers mock modern Pagans who celebrate Yule. I am not one of them. This sloppy, thoughtless ""fictional holiday"" of Yulemas hit me like a slap in the face. Especially since the only other world-building term from real-life used in this book -- Wyrd -- wasn't bastardized, and only made the author's mashup of words feel even more random. The word ""Yulemas"" appeared at the same time the unmarked bag of candy appeared on Celaena's bedroom pillow. The combination of the candy-eating on Yulemas caused my brain to simply Shut Down and Switch Off and Refuse To Continue Reading This Book. I turned a few more pages, but the end had arrived. If you want to read ""High School Drama"" set in a castle starring a Mary Sue in a Love Triangle with Two Cute Boys -- with the word ""assassin"" in place of ""student,"" and the word ""King"" in place of ""mom and dad"" -- this is your book. If you want to read a YA fantasy starring an assassin who isn't a ""real-life scary"" assassin but kind of a manic pixie dreamgirl who is totes gorgeous, this is your book. And if you want to read some YA Fantasy Lite, a book that is simply designed to be fun entertainment, without lots of gore or extreme deprivation or rape -- ""Throne of Glass"" may be exactly what you're looking for. There are plenty of sequels. And a super huge fandom.

I have never laughed aloud so much readinOverall: 2.5 stars, though I give the first third of this novel 5 glorious couldn't-put-the-book-down stars. I have never laughed aloud so much reading a book as I did reading the first third of ""The Hating Game."" Those opening pages were absolutely delightful. ""The Hating Game"" is a funny, sweet, and steamy bit of brain candy. A super predictable romance with a plot centered on a love story, and pretty much nothing else. Read this book for the dialogue, the kissing, and the steamy scenes, because that is where this book really shines.For me, the book fell apart and lost my interest for a number of reasons, mostly due to unresolved conflicts in characterization. After the first third of the novel, the two leads start to behave so unrealistically that I stopped being able to think of them as real people, and saw them as puppets on strings, yanked around by an author controlling the plot. Not that there was much of a plot. The ""twist"" of the story is broadcast so early on in the book, yet the protagonist, Lucy, requires the entire length of the novel to figure things out. I grew so bored and tired of this book at 65% -- and planned to DNF -- but I convinced my friend Adriana to read the first half, so we could discuss the book together, and Adriana ended up loving this book SO MUCH that I had to finish so we could discuss the entire novel, not just the first half.For anyone sensitive to fat-shaming, please beware that this novel has a ruthlessly high level of fat-shaming. The only ""fat"" character in this novel is a morally repulsive over-eater, who is also a lecherous and egotistical jerk. Even though the author has Lucy claim (in the last third of the novel) that she could still feel attraction for a man who looked like this hideous character (he is referred to as ""Fat Little Dick"" in the book, and Lucy uses this epithet for him when making her claim) -- it is clear that Lucy is lying. Her true love, Josh, even calls out her lie in that scene. Physical beauty plays a HUGE role in this novel, and the fat-shaming was laid on especially thick.This is a romantic-comedy novel, and some of the humor can be pretty cruel. Those sensitive to linguistic ableism might want to avoid this novel, because a LOT of the dialogue and Lucy's interior monologue is loaded with ableist jokes. We live in a culture so super-saturated with ableist language that most people won't see any problem with the jokes in ""The Hating Game,"" but I found a lot of the language choices as extreme as the fat-shaming. I don't point those problems out as deal-breakers though, they just added to my overall displeasure the further I read in this book. The dialogue between Lucy and Josh is often witty and humorous, but it just wasn't enough for me. There was no plot in this book, no surprise twists to look forward to, no depth to the characters, and certainly no subplots. The writing is GREAT -- sentence structure and word choice in this book are both wonderful (aside from the fat-shaming and ableism) -- but ""good writing"" isn't enough for me, either. I need some meat in my books, and this novel is pure cotton candy.I recommend this book for people who LOVE cotton candy books, and want a novel that will make them laugh, make them swoon over two physically-gorgeous people falling in love, and anyone who wants to read some truly delightful sex scenes that focus on lots of foreplay. There is even a lengthy scene with non-intercourse orgasms -- sexual encounters like this are so extremely rare in ANY fiction, including romance, that I hope more authors start writing erotic scenes like this.For my friend Adriana, ""The Hating Game"" earned five full stars and an *immediate* reread -- and she hardly EVER rereads a book. I was glad I turned her on to ""The Hating Game,"" and we had a great conversation about what worked for her, and what didn't for me. I'm sure this novel will be turned into a movie quite soon, and I'll be excited to watch this one. For a romance, the erotic scenes in this book are so unique, and so sensual, I'm keen to see what filmmakers do with them....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Mar 01, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/25883848-the-hating-game

Thank you.***SPOILERS EVERYWHERE AHEADPlease don't read on if you plan to read this book. Thanks.***In so much of modern YA fantasy, all roads lead to ""The Hunger Games."" Suzanne Collins gave readers such an amazing character in Katniss Everdeen, and such a truly compelling story, that writers continue to create new teen characters who must engage in brutal fights-to-the-death with other teen characters, and then face the moral ramifications of their survival.""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" is another such attempt. This novel is ""The Hunger Games"" meets Bella Swan's immortality-transformation meets ""Beauty and the Beast."" The main character is a nineteen-(or twenty?)-year-old human named Feyre. Feyre is a prickly Katniss-esque point of view heroine, who must provide for her family by hunting wild game in the woods by her house. Feyre is also the Beauty of ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- in a storyline that adheres to the original published version of the fairy tale, rather than the award-winning animated Disney film.In the original fairy tale, Beauty is more like a Cinderella character, picked on by her siblings, who actually try to trick her at one point. It's a complicated story with moral grey zones, often noted for its choice to star a member of the merchant class, rather than a royal. ""A Court of Thorns and Roses,"" however, is not a story with moral grey zones. There is evil in this book, and such an enormous amount of mind-numbing violence that ""The Hunger Games"" as well as some of its most financially-successful imitators -- ""Red Rising"" and ""An Ember in the Ashes"" -- look really tame in comparison. Those imitation stories both upped the gore level in their plots, following the popularity of the HBO series ""Game of Thrones,"" and ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" delivers a lot of Thrones-esque violence and gore.In both ""Red Rising"" and ""An Ember in the Ashes,"" the male main characters are ""forced"" by the power-hungry villains to murder people their own age. Darrow (in ""Red Rising"") and Elias (in ""An Ember in the Ashes"") both kill their fellow students/competitors in order to survive. Their moral guilt is largely absolved by their beliefs that they have ""no choice"" but to murder in cold blood to survive.Feyre is placed in this same situation. Unlike Katniss Everdeen, who kills in open combat, Feyre is forced to murder fellow young people in cold blood, execution-style, in order to survive. Feyre is ""forced"" to execute the innocent young captives of the villain.Feyre does this not once, but twice in this book, by plunging a dagger into their hearts. Feyre also saves herself by giving the villain a false name for herself -- the name of one of her innocent neighbors -- and that young woman is tortured to death, her body is nailed to a wall (and kept on display) for the last 30% of this novel, and that girl's entire family is burned alive in their home. This is another price Feyre pays to survive: she saves herself by giving the villain someone else to torture and kill in her stead.While Feyre does feel guilt for her actions, she is also given all the plushest rewards of a hero for committing these atrocities. At the end of the book, immediately after murdering these people, Feyre receives great wealth, the true love of a gorgeous and powerful man, immortality, a restored body, supernatural powers, a palatial manor to live in, and her own family is saved -- whatever amount of guilt Feyre feels is overpowered by all of the rewards heaped upon her, and this is why I call this a repugnant book. Feyre chooses the path of evil to survive, and immediately receives an enormous Happily Ever After as a result.If there is any moral grey zone in this novel, it goes completely unspoken in the text -- and that is the fact that her gorgeous true love, Tamlin, manipulated and used Feyre for his own gain.Tamlin is an immortal High Lord/High Fae, who can choose to transform into a beast-form in order to kill. For the majority of the book, Tamlin is in his human form: that of a physically-gorgeous adult male who wears a bejeweled mask over part of his face.After reading 70% of the novel, Feyre is finally told by one of Tamlin's household servants that Tamlin brought Feyre to his house in order to manipulate her into falling in love with him, and thereby free his body from a curse (as well as free himself from that annoying bejeweled mask he must wear). The Completely Diabolical and Torture-Loving Villain has cursed Tamlin and stolen most of his magic, and if he doesn't regain his powers, he will become the villain's slave forever.The novel never uses the word ""manipulate"" in regards to Tamlin. But he is ancient, an immortal, physically perfect and extremely powerful, and the moment young Feyre arrives in his house, he is exceedingly kind to her. He takes care of her, serves her food by his own hand, gets her anything she desires, takes her riding, adores her paintings, gifts her with fairy sight, dances with her, kisses her, and so on and so forth. The first 65% of this novel is basically Tamlin wooing Feyre, with mild hints that there is a villain pulling strings somewhere else (far away) in the land of the fae.Even Tamlin's decision (after the first 65% of the book) to send Feyre home felt like a manipulative ploy, once the ""plot twist"" is finally revealed that Tamlin knew all along Feyre had the ability to break his curse and save him. There is no hiding how morally repugnant he is, and yet, Tamlin is always written as this wonderful man, a true hero. Feyre always sees him that way in her interior monologue, and the story is careful to feature him as a hero. Tamlin is the one who finally kills the Torture-Loving Villain by ripping her throat out at the end of the book. Tamlin does this in beast form, not as his beautiful human-shaped fae self. It's important to note that the author's choice to put Tamlin in beast form when he kills (any time in this story) has the moral ramification of keeping Tamlin ""pure."" He is portrayed as good, worthy, strong, and heroic. He is never portrayed as manipulative, conniving, and craven. But to me, he was only the latter: a powerful man using a human girl to get what he wanted. Feyre commits evil in order to secure the permanent love for herself of a man who is evil. That is the only moral grey zone I saw in this story -- these are two people who have both sacrificed their integrity to survive -- but Tamlin's evilness was never shown in the book. I saw him as evil, but the story never did. The story held Tamlin up as a hero, a man who is ""worthy"" of the ""sacrifices"" Feyre makes when she engages in cold-blooded murder to save him.Feyre commits murder because she cannot solve the villain's Super Obvious riddle in time. If the author had allowed Feyre to solve the Super Obvious riddle five minutes sooner, Feyre wouldn't have needed to execute the villain's bound prisoners to save Tamlin, and I might have been okay with the Happily Ever After Feyre receives.As it was, this book put me into the story of a ""hero"" who commits evil to win her reward. And I felt morally stained and ruined as a result. I have a hard enough time with internal feelings of unworthiness and shame, and I've never murdered anyone in cold blood. Being in Feyre's shoes as the ""hero"" of this story, and being rewarded for the evil actions she commits, left me in such a terrible state of self-loathing. I know I didn't actually kill any innocent people, but I was still rewarded for doing so, by being in Feyre's head while reading this book, and I reached the last page of this book utterly hating myself. For anyone I've angered by giving this novel a one-star rating, I'm sure they're happy to hear that I'm full of self-loathing because I finished the story. To the book's fans, I say, ""Fair enough."" I paid a steep price for not DNF'ing this book. This story didn't just shatter a part of Feyre's soul, but my own.Other ers have complained that the first half of this novel is extremely dull, an absolute slog to read through, and causes a great many readers to DNF early on. I agree with that analysis, though I'd say it's the first 70% of the book that's extremely dull, and the last 30% of the book is a Horror and Torture Fest.The author adhered to the original Beauty and the Beast story, which features a lot of pretty clothes, fancy food, dancing, wooing, and finery. ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" took all the whimsical-falling-in-love scenes and mixed them in with the murder and mayhem of a violent fairy world. Feyre is safe inside Tamlin's house, but the world of the fae is random and brutal, and her life is at risk whenever she ventures outside.The author is capable of writing some really fine sentences, and there were some excellent phrases and lines in this book. But Feyre's constant story interruptions for repetitive internal monologues drastically slowed the book down, and I wish an editor had red-penned all of this unneeded material. The prose was also repetitive on its own, and I grew tired of reading certain phrases and words. When Feyre is scared, her ""bowels turn watery"" or she feels ""bile in her throat."" People often whisper into ""the shell of her ear."" And some of the book's sentences were just outright clumsy, such as this one in Chapter Three, in which Feyre is describing her first impression of seeing Tamlin in his beautiful human-fae form: ""I didn’t want to consider what might require him to wear a warrior’s attire and tried not to look too hard at the leather of the baldric gleaming in the sunlight streaming in through the bank of windows behind him.""That is called having way too many prepositional phrases in one sentence. And the rhyming of ""gleaming"" and ""streaming"" is also annoying. Sentences like that one really detracted from the overall prose style of this book.Some ers have pointed out that Tamlin's behavior on the Fire Night ritual is a blatant promotion of rape culture. I have to say, I disagree. While Tamlin does grab Feyre's arms after she tells him to leave her alone, and he bites her neck after being told to let her go, the fact is, Feyre was *warned* Tamlin would be drugged and half-mad with sex hormones during that night -- butFeyre ignored this warning, went to the ritual, was almost raped by three scary fae, could've been raped by another fae, her friend Lucien returned her safely back to her bedroom -- and then Feyre left her room AGAIN, went off to the kitchen to eat, and then went to her artist room to paint. Tamlin arrives at the house and finds her in the hallway. Sure, Tamlin is sexually predatory in that scene, but Feyre was inviting abuse -- she wanted to run into him, she wanted him to assert his wild/sexy/scary sexual dominance over her. Later in the book, when Feyre is encouraging Tamlin to have sex with her for the first time, they are rubbing all over each other, and Tamlin says to her, ""If we keep going, I won't be able to stop at all."" And sure, reading that line in this book really pissed me off. It's highly problematic language. I hate that this sentence is spoken in dialogue by the ""hero"" of this story. But as I've already made clear, Tamlin is a villain to me, and rapey lines like that are worthy of villains. Plus, rapey stuff does turn some women on, and Feyre was turned on by everything Tamlin did in that scene. Far from being offended, Feyre was enjoying herself. In a book full of torture, mutilation, and murder, I can't get bent out of shape by Feyre's libido. The girl commits cold-blooded murder at the end of this book. Finding Tamlin's machismo hot is the least of the contentious things she does in this story.As to the High Lord/High Fae Rhysand giving Feyre a roofie-esque drink at the end of this book, to force her to dance for him in lewd clothing -- it is REALLY hard for me to find this offensive when the mutilated body of an innocent human girl is nailed to the wall over their heads. So what if Feyre is dancing in a fugue, given the horrifying decor of the dance room? Feyre gave Rhysand the name of that innocent girl to save her own skin, and Rhysand and Tamlin both watched that girl be tortured, killed, and nailed to the wall, even though they knew she was innocent. I'm supposed to find some skimpy clothes and roofie-esque dancing offensive, after that? I find the level of outrage over the roofie-drink really odd, given the fact that Feyre is only standing there dancing in skimpy clothes because she is not the girl who was tortured to death and nailed to the wall.I will not be reading any of the sequels to ""A Court of Thorns and Roses."" I've had more than enough of Feyre and Tamlin and the nonstop atrocities of this Game of Thrones fairy world. If the author portrays Tamlin as a villain in future books, and Feyre hooks up with Rhysand instead, I would not be surprised. At least Rhysand owns his villainy. Tamlin is a fake and a liar. These people are all out for themselves, and this is just not the kind of literature I want to spend my time reading....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 19, 2017","Feb 20, 2017","Feb 19, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/23666139-a-court-of-thorns-and-roses

I wish I could give this book a negative ten.""An Ember in the Ashes"" is a YA fantasy that took the plot structure of ""The Hunger Games,"" the gore-and-rape level of ""Red Rising,"" and the insta-lust/insta-love found in ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone,"" and churned them together into this nonsensical and frustrating story.A lot of people have given ""An Ember in the Ashes"" five million stars and proclaimed their undying love for this book. I wish I were one of them. Right now, I just feel like that video of Godzilla tearing sh*t up in a rage, while the words, ""F*ck this house, F*ck this building, F*ck these people,"" scroll across the bottom of the screen. At 446 pages, this book is LONG. The opening pages start out *really* well, with excitement and good prose and the promise that the book will have action. But then things slow waaayyyy down, for over a hundred pages, before anything starts to happen again. Around page 280, my brain was starting to melt, and I was losing the will to live. I forced myself to keep reading. By page 333, I realized the book was winning the battle to kill me, and I shifted into skim-mode. Even this felt super-painful. But I did finish this book. I regret that. I really should have DNF'd this one. I should have stopped reading on page 77, when Elias, the super-stud-who-believes-he-has-a-heart-of-gold, shares this thought: ""If the Augurs made my armor to accentuate my body's power, they made Hel's to accentuate her beauty.""THAT was my big red flashing sign. The sign in the book that says, WARNING, WARNING, ABORT, ABORT.I ignored that sign. And man, did I pay for it.""An Ember in the Ashes"" is set in a fantastical, ancient Roman-esque story world, and features two point of view characters: a (supposedly) reluctant militarist named Elias, who is twenty years old, and a newly-orphaned young woman who willingly becomes a slave, named Laia. Laia is seventeen. But she is so gullible, naive, and outright foolish, I kept seeing her as eleven or twelve. I had a hard time remembering she had breasts and the other physical symbols of attraction to draw Elias's insta-lust. Elias and Laia both have a lot of insta-lust for each other. Elias also has moments of desire for his best friend, the only female student at his military school, a young woman named Helene. I really liked Helene through the first half of the book, and I wish Helene and Elias had been lovers. I would have believed that a morally-conflicted Elias could be the top student of his class at this ridiculously-brutal-to-the-point-of-absurdity military school, if he had known true love and intimacy with his best friend.But no. Elias has slept with some other girls around town, one-night-stands, but he never sleeps with Helene. In fact, he keeps major secrets from Helene. They have the opposite of intimacy with each other.Even though Helene was my favorite character when I began ""An Ember in the Ashes,"" by the end of the book, it is clear that Helene is an even bigger fool than Elias or Laia, because Helene is making ridiculous promises for the total fools and sadists who have done nothing but cause murder and chaos throughout the whole book. The events that take place around Elias, Helene, and Laia read like a nonstop horror story of Rome's worst emperors, but are presented to the reader like this is a sustainable power structure. There was no point to anything going on in this story-world's Empire, including the group of red-eyed immortals called Augurs who set up these ridiculous ""Trials"" at the school, ordering the students to butcher each other for the sheer sake of butchery. If this story is set in a Rome-esque world, then this is Rome when the empire was quickly eroding and shrinking, crumbling into its total collapse.""The Trials"" are a series of nonsensical battles a nonsensical number of students are put through in order to find a new Emperor for the Empire. Apparently, the best kind of ruler is someone who can Kill Everyone Without GAF, including their close friends and people they love, and as final proof of their Resolution To Kill At All Times, they must also be the fastest person to slaughter an unarmed slave who is like, tied to a post on a small stage. The fastest person to kill the slave wins! This kind of sociopath will thenceforth make the best ruler of a large and prosperous Empire.(If this sounds like a solid plan, I suggest further study into the rise and fall of actual empires, especially Rome. Trade networks and thriving commerce cannot exist in complete chaos. And what is going on with the Empire in ""An Ember in the Ashes"" is utter chaos.) The book stars a cardboard mwa-ha-ha-ha evil-for-the-sake-of-evil villainness called the Commandant, and she is like that character Ursula from the ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" movie -- every time the Commandant was around, I pictured Ursula in her Nazi outfit, because this woman wore a similar getup. The Commandant tortures and murders people all the time, including small children (she once gouged out the eye of a five-year-old girl). For further proof of her villainy, the Commandant once tried to have an abortion (gasp!) but the poisons wouldn't kill the fetus (gasp!) so she ended up being forced to give birth on her due date. (Don't worry, she abandoned the baby a few hours later, because Evil.) The Commandant is also supposed to be super-smart and able to ""read"" people by looking at them, and yet bumbling Laia comes to spy in her house by posing as a slave, and even Elias (who is the Commandant's son) can tell Laia is no slave but a freeborn woman who has suddenly been put into slavery -- and yet the super-scary Commandant figures out none of this. Laia never has her face mutilated (like the other slaves who work in the house) and she maintains a successful role as a haphazard and untrained spy, even though the Commandant should have caught her about three million times. It was like no one was allowed to have a functioning cerebral cortex in this novel -- not the villains, not the Augurs, and certainly not Helene, Elias, or Laia.Elias made no sense to me. He's the number-one ranked student at a school that makes the historical Nazi academies look tame, and yet all he can think about is escaping the job he's spent his life training for, while staring at hot-looking girls and daydreaming about sexy-times. At one point in the book, he goes Full On Killer in one of the Trials, and commits to slaughtering Helene in order to save his own life -- and I hated Elias for that, and I never forgave him. Elias had no moral code, and he proved that when he sent his dagger plunging straight into the heart of his best friend. Ugh. The reader is supposed to forgive him. Nope. No way. Never. When Helene picks up that ax near the end of the book, I wanted Elias to go the way of Madrigal in ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone"" -- I was ready for justice to be served. Didn't happen. Because there *is* no justice in ""An Ember in the Ashes."" Just a long, nonstop nightmare, all the way to the very last page. One minor thing that really bugged me: the primary weapon Elias and the other military students all fight with is called a ""scim"" -- which is just the word ""scimitar"" cut in half. So I always pictured Elias and the others fighting with scimitars as I read. However, in an interview (linked below) about the book's weaponry, the author stated that while she did derive the word ""scim"" from the word ""scimitar,"" she actually modeled the scim to look exactly like the Japanese katana -- ""all the way down to the circular guard and the slight curve of the blade.""http://www.avclub.com/article/win-cop...I came across that information after I finished the book, and it upset me a great deal to realize I'd been picturing the wrong style of sword in their hands the whole time. I thought I would love ""An Ember in the Ashes,"" because so many ers have heaped so much praise on this novel, and I feel like I'm always seeing this book on my Goodreads wall.But I just want to purge this entire story from my brain. Few books ever leave me feeling this disappointed, insulted, and angry. ""An Ember in the Ashes"" finishes with a cliffhanger-style ending to make readers eager to find out what happens next. But my journey with these characters stops here....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 09, 2017","Feb 11, 2017","Feb 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20560137-an-ember-in-the-ashes

Each poem is preceded by a thematic photograph printed on translucent paper, lending elegance as well visual appeal to this stunning work.Author Joseph Miller summarized poet Kierstin Bridger's ""Demimonde"" as follows: ""These are the songs of saloon girls and prostitutes working the mining camps of the old west -- mocking and lyrical, forlorn, ragged, radiant with hunger and cruelty. Check out their clean lines and spikey language, their gunfire and laudanum and perfume.""Most of the poems in this collection *are* told from the point of view of various prostitutes struggling to survive in a mining town and the surrounding camp environs, that of Telluride, Colorado, circa 1890s/early 1900s. One woman in particular, named Ella, makes an appearance in several of these poems.But some of the poems are written from the point of view of the poet, Kierstin Bridger, living in modern-day America, visiting the mountain town of Telluride, and reflecting upon the tortured existences these women faced. The poem ""Mining Town"" definitely felt this way, as did the poem ""Baby Names."" In the poem ""Relic,"" the poet seemed to be taking a hike above town, imagining a saloon girl traveling with her, allowing imagination and introspection to bring Telluride's history to life. This pensive mood is taken to a stunning conclusion in the final poem of the book, ""Ascendant of Shadows.""In ""Ascendant of Shadows,"" the poet visits the site of one of the bordellos still standing in Telluride, which is alive with the presence of ghosts. Ella, the woman who features most prominently in this collection, makes an illustrious appearance here. On page 93, in this place of ""ghosts biting at the heels -- / specters shrill in death as in life""--Ella's presence was most eloquent;the air hung with her oak-cask laugh,smoky, ruby cut perfume,the stain of her cinnabar pout,rustle of silk on steps, lines of lyric patois,heel clicks, and silver echoes, her rings on doorframes.There were others, in glassy ersatz jewels --coarser women, nipping from novelty flasks,cackling through graying teeth,skirts of quiet wool, thunderous corsets,and hair beneath tight, misaligned wigs.This Demimonde, this underworld,a state of liminal shadow,of being sought in the dark,banned in light,of listening to voices living in cedar,in the ashen white of aspen.The cedar and aspen used to build this bordello hold the sounds and spirits of these ghosts, which the poet is receptive to while considering the horrible judgments and fates cast onto these women.On page 94, the final lines of this poem break into a space of radical empathy, and end this beautiful collection on a powerful note of redemption, an atonement that encompasses the life of the poet as well as the brutal lives of the ghosts she observes in the building -- It's the blur we catch:our other selves,selves we'd want saved --Perched as they arein the glossy corner, the spark of our unwavering eye.It is a bitter fact of life that redemption and atonement for evil -- for the cruelty and horror we inflict upon each other -- are so often only found inside the mind, in imagination and empathy, and inside the human heart. Kierstin Bridger's ""Demimonde"" is a beautiful exploration and celebration of replacing cruelty with understanding and love. A healing balm for a history that can never be healed....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 05, 2017","Feb 07, 2017","Feb 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29607055-demimonde

This book is a triumph, one I recommend EVERYONE read.""Witness to War"" is a difficult book to absorb. The challenging content includes the subject matter of the civil war in El Salvador in the early 1980s (complete with many anecdotes of atrocities), the author's adherence to Quaker principles of pacifism in the face of government brutality, and the involvement of the United States government in funding the death squads of El Salvador -- as well as the United States funding of the relentless state-sanctioned massacres of civilians by the army of El Salvador -- make this one of the most painful books I've ever set out to finish. In addition to the difficult content, ""Witness to War"" wasn't penned to be a literary work. The prose is straightforward, and the story doesn't use suspense as a plot device. Facts are told in a straightforward manner, details are delivered bluntly, and the result is a raw honesty on the page that is astonishing as well as heartbreaking.I really love this book. I felt like I took an entire class on the history of El Salvador by reading ""Witness to War."" The author took so many risks, and sacrificed so much of his personal life, in order to live among the guerrillas of El Salvador for an entire year, caring for the medical needs of civilians (and sometimes, the soldiers -- both the guerrillas and the army POWs captured by the guerrillas) who were injured and killed during this conflict. ""Witness to War"" is an amazing achievement. I'm so glad that Dr. Charles Clements journeyed to El Salvador on a personal humanitarian mission, wrote this book, and shared this story with the world. It's a brutally important book to read, full of truths about imperialism, injustice, and resistance, as well as the specific civil war in El Salvador. ""Witness to War"" had so much to teach me. I express my profound gratitude for the opportunity to read this great book. Thank you, Dr. Clements, for this truly significant memoir. ""Witness to War"" is a heartbreaking treasure, a beautiful testament to the goodness and perseverance of the people of El Salvador.

""The Body Silent"" has so much to say about culture, the shaping of identity, the stripping away of humanity from the disabled, and the fierce desire to live in whatever body we have, that I could never absorb the totality of Dr. Murphy's arguments in only one reading.

I was completely gripped by this book, which challenged my thinking, my identity, and my worldview, with every page.For readers who don't want to be challenged, or grapple with any of Murphy's insights and arguments, it's easy to take cheap shots at the prose, and use that as an excuse to give up on the book. Like any writer, Murphy is bound by the semantics and understandings of a specific time and place. Modern readers don't appreciate people of Asian or Middle Eastern heritage being referred to as ""Orientals."" Sweeping statements about women and gender can also hit a nerve, as can some of Murphy's general comments about race relations between black and white Americans. In Murphy's defense -- and I do defend him, absolutely -- he informs the reader in the very beginning of his book that his text will likely have problems, and he makes it clear to the reader that he understands he is writing from a particular vantage point: that of a middle-class, white, American male, penning his memoir in the late 1970s and 1980s.Dr. Robert Murphy was a professor of anthropology at Columbia University, a well-loved teacher who continued his work even after he began suffering terrible pain, lost the use of his legs from paralysis, and began using a wheelchair. Eventually, he lost the use of his arms as well, and this memoir takes the reader along with him on his journey of change. For whatever flaws the prose contains, given the time period it was written in, this book is a monumental achievement, and an incredibly powerful treatise on the role of ability and autonomy in American society. ""The Body Silent"" analyzes the impact of disability on a personal level, in relation to the family, to one's peers and to work, and within the culture at large. I could never praise this book enough for the powerful insights this author delivers.  This is the kind of book that can change a reader's life, and it's definitely changed mine. ""The Body Silent"" is a book that takes ableist assumptions about the meaning of disability and subverts them all. Dr. Murphy shines an unflinching light upon the unconscious thoughts people inherit about the role disability plays in our lives, and probes the dark recesses of our minds.Five full life-changing stars.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 16, 2016","Jan 13, 2017","Dec 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/396837.The_Body_Silent

The novel is told from the point of view of his sister, who grapples with her grief along with her parents. The author added a big moral message at the end of the book, about the importance of wearing bicycle helmets to prevent head injuries and death. Personally, I didn't think the moralizing was needed; the simple representation of grief through the eyes of Mick's sister stood up just fine on its own. But the novel wove in the climactic messaging with the plot in a key way, which made it far more palatable to me. I understand that this book is written for middle-grade readers, but I can't help but think about how much I didn't like being preached to at age ten. That said, this is still a great book.

Eager to experience what this agent loved about the book, I immediately devoured the novel. I was really primed to love and enjoy the book based upon the agent's comments, but I didn't find the story engaging at all. The constant swearing and self-righteous anger of the main character was a theme that wore on me when it continued for page after page (right up until the bitter end), and the continued homophobia and drinking by this collection of ""kids"" (as the author calls them) was alarming and dull. It made the book feel more like a Budweiser commercial than a YA novel. I thought the author's descriptions of characters and settings were all extremely weak, bordering on nonsensical at times, and the dramatic plot-twist of Seth the ghost magically saving Conner's life at the end and making him human again was silly. Smith's decision to keep the main character from remembering what his body was doing while (part of?) his mind was away made the novel disjointed, like I was not only purposefully confused but robbed of the experiences I expect to feel when reading a book. Not only was the main character's life ""half-lived,"" but my ability to be immersed in a story was cut down as well. The author never explained why Jack could remember large amounts of history about Marbury, but nothing from his missed time on earth. I read a few s of this book online, and one father said that he didn't want his daughter reading this book until she was ""seventeen, if ever."" He felt there were far better books out there for her to spend her time on, and I have to say, I agree. I even called one friend of mine with a ten-year-old boy and warned her this book should be R-rated and described some of the content. She was horrified that ""such garbage"" could even be called YA. Maybe I'm missing the point and I'm just supposed to accept that all teenage boys are self-righteous, angry, homophobic and obsessed with drinking beer, and that some people have no hope for redemption-- but it makes me sad that I have to read about a boy who never grows emotionally over the course of an entire book. The main character wants to throw around blame like a wrecking ball, and I know that's what many boys do-- but after an entire novel, a smidgeon of enlightenment would have been a huge relief. Alas, no such luck with this story. Jack hates his mother, father, feels nothing for the grandparents who raised him, and insists that having a boner for a girl equals love and that he is correct in giving his sole affection to his homophobic best friend. It all made me think of that bumper sticker that says ""Teenagers: Move out while you still know everything!"" That's exactly what I would say to this ungrateful main character if I could.  As to Jack's constant PTSD moments and flashbacks to his would-be rapist-- so many girls, and boys, are raped as children or young women and men, and still function, that I had a difficult time grounding myself in Jack's fall-apart mentality. He was just so incredibly weak-minded on earth, but then incredibly strong-willed on Marbury, but he never realized for himself that he loved Marbury because he felt brave there, and that he was nothing but a weak, shaking, and vomiting person on Earth. I wish an editor had given the author a serious chat before he published this book, so that aspect of self-awareness could've made an appearance somewhere for the poor benighted Jack. This was a one-star read for me.

In a book that is 338 pages long, this time-skip happens on page 37. *Very* early in the story. The big ""plot twist"" was therefore not a plot twist at all. It was simply the Most Obvious Solution for explaining the nonsensical fugue-state that is the life of this main character, Silla. I haven't been so bored and frustrated with a book since I read the YA fantasy ""The Marbury Lens"" five years ago. I disliked the book SO strongly I would never recommend anyone read it. I feel the same way about ""And the Trees Crept In.""The prose features some hyper-pretentiousness that inspired severe irritation. Here is one such passage on page 110, while Silla is talking to her True Love, Gowan: ""'Tell me other things, Gowan. Tell me stories of the sky and the sea. Open places full of magic. Tell me tales of places where music dances on breezes and girls go twirling through the sand. Tell me, Gowan.' Tell me pleasant lies, and I will believe them before I throw them away.""This is supposed to be a seventeen-year-old speaking in 2016. And no, she is not studying to be a poet one day. She's not even going to school.Before you say, ""But WAIT!! Maybe she's a manic pixie dream girl!?"" lemme just say no. No, Silla is no manic pixie. Her dialogue there is just the author's voice bleeding into the page. Also note the repetition of ""tell me"" in the passage quoted above. While that is just a repeated phrase, it is important to share that, overall, there is a LOT of repetition of scenes, ideas, and lines in this book. A LOT. If you are a reader who gets easily frustrated rereading information, steer clear of this book. If you enjoy repetition and want drinking-game ideas: take a shot for every time you read the word ""stone"" in this book. And in the second half of the novel, take a shot for every time you read the word ""vomit."" Make sure you have someone ready to save your life should you pass out in an alcohol coma.The words ""creak"" and ""Creeper Man"" are repeated so often, I can't even make a drinking-game with them. The effect of rereading those words so often was just mind-numbing boredom. Here is another example of the book's prose, a passage in which Silla is falling in love with Gowan, on page 126:""My eyes take in the straight line of his jaw, the suggestion of stubble as we sit in the library. The flecks of brown in his eyes and the way his hair falls just so. I linger over the curve of his shoulders, and I inhale his scent. So heady, so wonderful. I'm careful not to let my infatuation show on my face, but I can't deny it. He is like a shining beacon in this place. Everything is slightly damp, slightly moldy, slightly pale. But he is beautiful and bright and, well, handsome. You notice him.Gowan.Something stirs in the stone of my insides. Something warm. Vital. Totally dangerous.""The fact that Silla and Gowan love each other plays an enormous role in this plot. But I never felt any real chemistry between them, and I certainly couldn't understand why they ever fell in love to begin with. While it was obvious that Silla loved Gowan because he was ""handsome,"" and, well -- most importantly -- he was *there* -- Silla seemed like a monster, long before all the weirdness began.When the story opens, Silla is fourteen and saving her four-year-old sister, Nori, who has had some of her teeth broken out by their abusive, alcoholic father. Nori has also suffered a broken collarbone and broken arm from the hands of their father, and her arm was never set, so the bone has healed crookedly.After Silla and Nori arrive at their aunt's manor house, Silla never bothers to take Nori to the hospital to have her arm repaired. And she never takes her to the dentist to have her teeth examined. This was when I started to hate Silla, hate her with a burning passion. Much later in the book, Silla finally admits that she did this. On page 234, she has the following conversation with Gowan:""'When we first got here, Nori had a broken collarbone and arm. It'd been healing for a few weeks, a month maybe, and...' I squeeze my eyes shut. [...] 'I told Cath it was a birth defect.''So you left Nori's arm to heal askew.''Yes. Her teeth, too. I... I left her to be a cripple with messed-up teeth and now I'm paying for it.'""By the end of the book, when the ""big plot twist"" is revealed and the story is explained, I wasn't sure whether the broken collarbone and arm and missing teeth had ever been real. Ditto whether Nori was mute or not -- because at the end of the book, there are many moments of her laughing and talking in fugue flashbacks, so maybe the muteness was merely hallucination on Silla's part. I remain unsure, and unwilling to reread anything to go look. Nori's physical ailments are a minor point to the book, but in terms of how much I hated Silla, it played a dominant role. A few lines at the end of the book, telling me, basically, ""It was all a dream, silly!"" cannot erase feelings toward a character built up over 300 pages. And that plot point with the broken arm wasn't even clarified the way others were at the end, nor was the situation with the father in general -- was he ever arrested? Why didn't he ever hunt down his daughters at their aunt's house? If one parent died, did the girls go to a funeral? Was there a court case? Who the hell knows, it was all left unexplained.Plot holes, repetition, confusion masquerading as a literary technique -- these are not good strategies for winning over my reader-heart. ""And the Trees Crept In"" goes down as a massive disappointment. It was not scary, not thrilling, and not even suspenseful. The melodramatic ending is heavy-handed, to the point of absurdity, and while I did shed a tear on the very last page, I hated the author for turning to subject material guaranteed to cause that effect, because of course my heart isn't ""made of stone"" and my eyes get misty when certain subjects are brought up. I closed this book feeling angry and resentful, like my emotions had been blatantly manipulated and cheapened on the last page. Had I been an actual teenager reading this book, I'd have DNF'd before finishing 20 pages. I had a hard time getting into the book, the time period was hard to pin down, and once it was clear that the story had a modern-day setting, the plot holes really started to mount. As a teen reader, I had no tolerance for those kinds of errors. As an adult, I can forgive plot holes in the hope that something will happen to redeem them. For this book, I didn't find that to be the case.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 25, 2016","Nov 26, 2016","Nov 25, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28449150-and-the-trees-crept-in

Sadly for Luce, these shadows like, killed a boy, or something, right before the novel begins. The details were never fully explained in her backstory. Not the shadows, or how this boy died. Luce was sneaking off with him somewhere on a date, and then he just died from the shadows.So Luce ends up in court, and the court finds her -- um, guilty of murder, I guess? And she has to go to a reform school. (Again, this is all hazy backstory... things don't need to make any sense in this book, you just have to roll with it.)This reform school is set near the coast of Georgia. Similar to Twilight's Pacific Northwest coastal setting, and reminiscent of ""Hush, Hush,"" another YA fantasy with fallen angels which is set on the coast of Maine. It struck me that it is apparently important for these YA fantasy heroines to have access to brief glimpses of the ocean. I guess the authors believe an ocean sighting = instant character depth. Who knows.Anyway. Luce goes to this ""reform school"" that is kinda rundown, drab, and rather scary, more like a state prison than a school. There is a huge old cemetery on the school grounds though, which is creepy and cool, and it's easy to turn off the cameras in the classroom and dormitory hallways, and sneak in all forms of contraband, for whatever shenanigans or transgressions the students might want to engage in. So this reform school is really like a lawless state prison full of teens, a place where anything goes. On her first day there, Luce is overcome with insta-lust/insta-love/insta-soul-mate-awareness for a boy named Daniel. Daniel returns Luce's googly-swoony eye contact by flipping her off, then proceeds to ignore her. Later, he allows other students to publicly humiliate Luce in the school cafeteria while he smirks with his friends, and Daniel gets to maintain his status as Hottest Guy At Reform School, who is too cool for girls. In the prologue of this book, the reader is told that Daniel and Luce are in a really complicated relationship, in which Luce dies when Daniel kisses her, then she's reborn each time this happens. She grows up, reaches the age of seventeen, falls in love with him again, and dies once more with a kiss. Like Snow White with the apple, only it's Prince Charming who kills her. Also, Daniel is an immortal, a fallen angel, and he has chosen to hang out at this reform school with a bunch of other immortal fallen angels. Even though these beings are all super-powerful, they run around acting like high school teens, keeping petty secrets, and pretending they haven't been alive for hundreds of years. The story of ""Fallen"" centers on Luce being inexplicably drawn to Daniel, who treats her like crap, but Luce forgives him his awful behavior because he is so beautiful. Even the way he jumps rope makes Luce's heart skip: ""Never in her life had she seen anyone move like him. It was almost like Daniel was flying. The rope whipped up and over his tall frame so quickly that it disappeared, and his feet -- his graceful, narrow feet -- were they even touching the ground? He was moving so swiftly, even he must not have been counting."" (page 135)I mean, clearly this guy is worth repeatedly dying for, right? He's gorgeous, he's aloof in that hot-asshole-guy way, and he's got mad jump-roping skillz. So Luce proceeds to stalk Daniel for several days, and even breaks into the school records room to take a peek at his student file -- which is something else this book had in common with ""Hush, Hush."" In that novel, the main character's helpmate was named Vee, and in ""Fallen,"" Luce is assisted by a fellow student named Penn. Penn is nowhere near as beautiful as Luce is though -- so, unfortunately for Penn, this means she won't survive for the sequels. Penn is killed in a pointless and gratuitous death scene near the end of this book, because If You Are Ugly The Hot Guy Will Not Save You.Luce, however, being so pretty, is deserving of saving. After all the meaningless drama involving another cute boy at school who likes Luce -- a fallen angel named Cam -- and a weird sequence of events in which some poor human guy named Todd dies in the library, and there's like, a fire, or something -- Luce ends up at the cemetery, passionately kissing Daniel, who she now knows is an angel. Then the shadows reappear, and so do some other angels with wings, flying around and ready to rumble. Plus Penn and some random teacher show up, because why not? So Luce sees these strange shadows again and hears some weird noises, and then she and Penn are told by the angels to run away. So Luce and Penn leave the cemetery with this random teacher. Except this woman is really some kind of evil betrayer, and all the immortal/super-powerful fallen angels pretending to be high schoolers in reform school never realized this woman was bad news. So this teacher leads Luce and Penn away from the Angel Rumble, in which the angels fight some noisy shadows, I guess; I can't say for sure because the action takes place off-screen. While the battle is going on, which takes all of maybe ten minutes, this woman slits Penn's throat, and she is about to kill Luce when Daniel sweeps in with his angel wings and saves her. That was the important takeaway message of ""Fallen"" -- as long as you are beautiful, you are worthy of being saved by the Hot Guy. But if you are smart, creative, compassionate, quirky, and ugly, you will die a horrible death and no boy will ever love you. So it went with Penn, the single most memorable character in this book, the only character I cared about, the only character who possessed a functioning brain, and the one I wish had been the main character of this story. After Penn's tragic death, Daniel leads Luce to a lake by the school, and he says that even though it is so cold, they should go for a swim. So Luce and Daniel go swimming, and kiss, and come to grips with the fact that Daniel must go do something unnamed that Luce can't be a part of. So after some time spent swimming, kissing, and being all moony with each other, Daniel takes Luce to a small airplane by the lake getting ready for takeoff, and it's being piloted by their history teacher. This teacher just comes out of nowhere at the end of the book, and there's no explanation for why he is trusted so much to take Luce someplace safe. Two other angels show up to tell Luce goodbye, and then she hops in the plane and flies off with the history teacher.He takes her to some island off the coast. In the Epilogue, Daniel comes to stare at her while she's sleeping, as well as the cute boy Cam, who was a bad guy in the book but I guess is now Daniel's buddy. They shake hands in some kind of teammate effort that isn't explained at all and really makes no sense.""Fallen"" doesn't feature any kind of angel mythology, or religious explanation for these fallen angels, or any kind of logical setup for the plot of the fallen angels at this reform school. The evil betrayer teacher does mention, at one point, that Luce and Daniel are ""damned,"" but since she turned out to be a lying murderer, who knows if that was true or not. In the opening pages of ""Fallen,"" I thought the writing was stronger than the prose of ""Hush, Hush,"" but then I quickly changed my mind. ""Hush, Hush"" often had humor speckled through the chapters, and ""Fallen"" had none of that. ""Fallen"" takes itself very seriously, which only makes the nonsensical story that much more absurd. This book is also much more repetitive than ""Hush, Hush,"" to the point that I had to skim large sections in the middle. This novel made me angry. Not just because the prose was so clumsy, or the story featured so much repetition. I can't stand books that send a message that physical beauty makes someone worthy of love and and of life, and ""Fallen"" hammered that message in my head, over and over again.This book was a one-star read for me, and I recommend this novel to no one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 27, 2016","Dec 10, 2016","Nov 16, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6487308-fallen

The story is quite chaste, devoid of sexual tension, and reads more like a G-rated YA novel than a romance book for adults.For readers who enjoy the movie ""Sabrina,"" worship the Disney film ""Cinderella,"" and secretly wish the world could transform into the 1950s again, this novel might be exactly what you are looking for. ""Christmas Spirit"" features a plucky and somewhat hare-brained office assistant named Emma who has fallen in love with her handsome, rich, company-owning boss, a man named George, who is also the chief editor of his publishing house. Emma is 31, George is 47, and though Emma has worked as George's assistant for a while, this year she is determined to make George fall in love with Christmas, and then fall in love with her. Standard tropes abound: Emma's sole antagonist is, of course, a slender blonde bombshell who wears diamond earrings, perfect clothes, and has perfectly manicured nails. Even though I just finished reading this book, I've already forgotten this character's name. Suffice to say, she is gorgeous and skinny and therefore Bad News. Emma informs the reader this woman is actually ""evil"" and ""a bitch"" and is about to be engaged to George, wanting him only for his money. Emma, on the other hand, is a good girl. A really good girl, who works hard and spends time with her family and yearns for true love. She enjoys every second she gets to dote on her boss, manage his every need, and fix his problems before he even notices them. She especially never thinks about sex, unless the Evil Woman is around and makes mention of being in bed with George, because the Evil Woman thinks about sex, not Emma.Emma has George pay for a company to decorate the office for Christmas, intent on her make-George-love-Christmas plan. Then George goes out to lunch, is randomly hit by a bike messenger, and ends up in a coma. Like most plot-device comas, there is absolutely no medical terminology or brain science in this novel. George is basically taking a nap for a week, and when he wakes up, he's a bit tired, stays home for a few days, and then returns to the office. But those seven days while he is asleep -- and on life support -- comprise the bulk of this novel. Because while George's body is in a coma, his spirit becomes a ghost, and Emma is the only one who can see him, hear him, and speak to him.So Emma spends a week doing Fun Christmas Stuff with her ghost boss. They visit the Christmas displays at the zoo. They go to see Santa Claus at the mall. They window shop downtown Denver to enjoy more Christmas decorations. Even after Emma learns that George gave his younger brother an Advance Directive stating that, should George ever be placed on life support, he must be unplugged after seven days and left to die -- even THIS doesn't dampen Emma's Holiday Spirit too much. Because good 'ol Emma, faithful secretary and true love of her boss, is certain that as soon as George can truly love Christmas, he will awake from his coma and be okay.So Emma and George continue their agenda of Fun Christmas Stuff and do their best to ignore George's comatose body in the hospital. They spend time with Emma's family, and George learns that Emma has always been scared of Santa Claus costumes, because they remind her of clowns. ""I hate clowns,"" Emma says (page 120). ""They completely wig me out.""Hearing this, George immediately feels ""protective, wishing he could wrap his arms around her and hold her,"" and asks Emma, ""What about all the happy costumed characters at Disney World?""But -- gasp! Emma has never BEEN to Disney World!! Her parents never took her!So George vows he will take Emma to Disney World. ""As soon as the holidays are over."" Nevermind the pesky question of whether he wakes up from his coma or not. George promises himself that he ""would take her to Disney World, and make sure she felt safe, with him, around all those ridiculous costumed characters.""Since ghost-George spends his seven days before Christmas staying with Emma, and sleeping in her apartment at night (she is in her bedroom, he sleeps on the couch), I would've thought the two of them would start some sexual chemistry. But feelings of desire, erotic longing, playful touching, and sexy banter feature nowhere in this story. Animated Disney films like ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" have a higher erotic quotient than this novel. It is not until page 163, as the hospital staff are unplugging George's comatose body from the life support equipment, that ghost-George finally makes a move on Emma. He ""carefully leaned in and lightly kissed her on the lips."" His last words are, ""Merry Christmas, Emma...""""Then he disappeared completely.""I'm sure you can guess how this book ends. George's ghost returns to his body, he wakes up from his coma able to speak and converse, and soon he has run off the Evil Woman and is reunited with Emma. In an Epilogue one year later, Emma is showing off her gorgeous (and tastefully expensive) engagement ring to her family, and has just found out she is pregnant. Because YAY for babies!!One of the sub-plots of this book involves George's ineffectual and flirtatious younger brother, Harry, and the final lines of this novel center on Harry. Emma's closing dialogue about George's brother made ""Christmas Spirit"" end on an odd note, like a cliffhanger with Harry on the edge, and the only way I could explain that weird choice for a close was by assuming the author intends to write a sequel that follows Harry's life. The prose of ""Christmas Spirit"" is easy to read and quite fun at times, though Emma and George both repeat information so often, mulling over their lives, that the pages in the middle and end become highly repetitive. I tried hard to read this entire book, but starting around page 130, I had to start skimming. One of the biggest plot-devices in this book is ""let's keep a secret that doesn't need to be a secret,"" in which characters withhold simple information from each other for the sole reason that the author needs them to not answer direct questions, over and over again, because Who Knows Why.So that frustrated me enough that I had to start skim-reading to the end. For romance readers who enjoy chaste love stories starring adults who behave like children, and for anyone who feels a fervent devotion to the gender roles most often seen in classic Hollywood films and Cinderella movies, ""Christmas Spirit"" will be a heartwarming and fun read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 16, 2016","Nov 18, 2016","Nov 16, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26073802-christmas-spirit

J.D. Vance tells the story of growing up in the Rust Belt city of Middletown, Ohio, a""Hillbilly Elegy"" is an excellent memoir, and an excellent read. J.D. Vance tells the story of growing up in the Rust Belt city of Middletown, Ohio, and the Appalachian town of Jackson, Kentucky. The book jacket states that this memoir ""is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis -- that of poor, white Americans."" The book centers on the upbringing of J.D. Vance, as well as the lives of his immediate family members. Mr. Vance adds in his views and opinions as to why conditions in his childhood were so difficult, as well as his thoughts about why he didn't end up ""a statistic.""At sixteen, Mr. Vance read a book titled ""The Truly Disadvantaged,"" about ""black people in the inner cities"" who were ""trapped in towns and cities that could no longer support such large populations with high-quality work"" (page 144). Mr. Vance states of that book, as well as a book titled ""Losing Ground,"" another book ""which addressed the way our government encouraged social decay through the welfare state"" --""Though insightful, neither of these books fully answered the questions that plagued me: Why didn't our neighbor leave that abusive man? Why did she spend her money on drugs? Why couldn't she see that her behavior was destroying her daughter? Why were all of these things happening not just to our neighbor but to my mom? It would be years before I learned that no single book, or expert, or field could fully explain the problems of hillbillies in modern America. Our elegy is a sociological one, yes, but it is also about psychology and community and culture and faith.""Statements like that are what make ""Hillbilly Elegy"" so memorable, and such a good read. Mr. Vance touches on the reasoning why those who are labeled ""the working poor"" are so often angry and resentful toward those on welfare. As a teenager working as a cashier at a local grocery store, Mr. Vance says that the job turned him into ""an amateur sociologist"" (p.138). On page 139, he states, ""I also learned how people gamed the welfare system. They'd buy two-dozen packs of soda with food stamps and then sell them at a discount for cash. They'd ring up their orders separately, buying food with food stamps, and beer, wine, and cigarettes with cash. They'd regularly go through the checkout line speaking on their cell phones. I could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largesse enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about.""Who is to blame for so many hillbillies being ""left behind"" in the globalized economy? Mr. Vance points a finger at the hillbillies themselves. On page 146, he states, ""Our homes are a chaotic mess. We scream and yell at each other like we're spectators at a football game. At least one member of the family uses drugs -- sometimes the father, sometimes the mother, sometimes both. At especially stressful times, we'll hit and punch each other, all in front of the rest of the family, including young children; much of the time, the neighbors hear what's happening.""""We don't study as children, and we don't make our kids study when we're parents. Our kids perform poorly in school. We get angry with them, but we never give them the tools -- like peace and quiet at home -- to succeed. Even the best and brightest will likely go to college close to home, if they survive the war zone in their own home.""""We choose not to work when we should be looking for jobs. Sometimes we'll get a job, but it won't last. We'll get fired for tardiness, or for stealing merchandise and selling it on eBay, or for having a customer complain about the smell of alcohol on our breath, or for taking five thirty-minute restroom breaks per shift. We talk about the value of hard work but tell ourselves that the reason we're not working is some perceived unfairness: Obama shut down the coal mines, or all the jobs went to the Chinese. These are the lies we tell ourselves to solve the cognitive dissonance -- the broken connection between the world we see and the values we preach."" Mr. Vance is careful to point out that not ALL hillbillies live this way (page 148). ""Not all of the white working class struggles. I knew even as a child that there were two separate sets of mores and social pressures. My grandparents embodied one type: old-fashioned, quietly faithful, self-reliant, hardworking. My mother and, increasingly, the entire neighborhood embodied another: consumerist, isolated, angry, distrustful.""On page 149, Mr. Vance states loud and clear what all public school teachers with low-income children in their classrooms are already overly-familiar with: ""Reams of social science attest to the positive effect of a loving and stable home. Entire volumes are devoted to the phenomenon of 'resilient children' -- kids who prosper despite an unstable home because they have the social support of a loving adult.""

But the only positive for me is that, when I compare this book to ""Twilight,"" the prose wasn't so painful that I had to stop reading. I couldn't finish reading all of ""Twilight,"" and had to skim most of that book. With ""Hush, Hush,"" I read the entire novel. And that's about all I can say that feels positive about this experience.If you want to play a fun drinking game with this book, take a shot every time Patch smiles. Except... Patch smiles so often, sometimes multiple times per page, that game won't last very long. Okay, to avoid an alcohol coma and death, maybe just take a sip of beer every time Nora looks into Patch's dark eyes and figures out some deep emotional angst or train of thought based upon one glance -- or, better yet, figures out some important plot point in his gaze. You might get through the entire novel without passing out.I felt no chemistry between Nora and Patch. None. When the big L-word is dropped at the end, I felt queasy and frustrated, close to flinging the book away from me, at a complete loss for how any reader could interpret the random actions of this book's plot and decide all those scenes built up to love. Because love was the last thing I felt. Aggravation was my Number One emotion, given how foolishly and unrealistically all of these characters behave. They never felt like real people, just stick figures drawn by an author into a haphazard story-line that was often nonsensical. Of the 391 pages in the paperback, the main plot line of angels isn't introduced until page 250. That means over half of this book features mundane teen drama of high school, framed around the ""normal"" life of a white cis middle-class able-bodied young woman. It was painfully dull to read. Biology class, driving in cars, a visit to an amusement park, a trip to the mall... If you are hoping for a book full of magic and angel-action, this is not it.There is humor sprinkled through the book, most of it in the form of bizarre, wonky dialogue and irritating antics from Nora's ""best friend,"" Vee. To say that Vee's idiocy grated on me is an understatement. When Vee willfully puts her life in danger at the end of the book, and tells Nora she should go on a camping trip with a man who physically abuses her, I was just hoping that Vee ended up dead before the last page. Sadly, that didn't happen.""Hush, Hush"" read as a sloppy, foolish book. The writing wasn't terrible, but it *was* often lazy. Scenes in which two real people would speak to each other were written as passing in silence. The logistics of what happens when an ambulance or law enforcement are called to an emergency were completely ignored. Though the novel is set in ""the real world,"" nothing about this novel felt real. The dialogue had sections of painfully bad info-dump material, when the author is simply jamming in plot material to forward the story in the most unrealistic way possible. The villain gets a long monologue at the end, an entire drawn-out scene of ""mwa-ha-ha-ha, this is why I must kill you, little girl, let me explain the plot of this entire book first though, before I off you!"" that always reads as cartoonish and irritating, no matter what genre I'm reading. In one scene late in the novel, the villain guns down an innocent woman who is wearing Nora's coat, in a random case of mistaken identity, without even getting out of his vehicle. But a few hours later, he goes through this long, elaborate plan of locking up an entire school building before delivering a ""villain's manifesto monologue"" and attempting to kill her. The inanity of this book's plot was beyond. But the absolute worst tragedy of ""Hush, Hush"" was that I never got to see an angel sprout wings and fly. Not. ONCE. Even though Nora remains conscious for most of the finale, this failure to give me even ONE angel scene was the biggest letdown of this entire novel.I give this book one star for being a painful and ridiculous read. I know my official rating shows 3 stars, but truly, this book gets only one. I could not in good conscious recommend this book to anyone to read. My recommendation is to just stay as far away from this book as you can.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 06, 2016","Nov 15, 2016","Nov 04, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6339664-hush-hush

Bold.My three favorite words to describe Peggy Orenstein's excellent 2016 nonfiction book, ""Girls and Sex: Navigating the Complicated New Landscape.""Examining the headlines, reports, and statistics about modern teenagers and sex, author Peggy Orenstein conducted a series of interviews with young women who are part of this data -- and chose to let them speak for themselves. In personal statements woven throughout this book, these young interview subjects share their thoughts and experiences with their bodies, their sexuality, and their experiences having sex. I found this book quite difficult to read. I often had to put the book down and take breaks from the text. Some of the material shared, involving rape and sexual assault, is not material I can breeze through -- especially when these young women only realized in the interview process, speaking about these experiences for the first time with anyone else -- that they had been raped, assaulted, or abused.Though some of the material in this book is dark, disturbing, and even horrifying, ""Girls and Sex"" is *not* focused on rape or sexual assault, and this is not a depressing book. The author's intent is to spread a message of body positivity, future progress, and hope, and she does so throughout the book. The author's most powerful message is contained in sharing the work of a high school sex educator named Charis Denison in the book's final chapter. Ms. Denison's educational work, ideology, and instructional technique amazed and impressed me in the very best way. I wish every teenager in America could attend a weekend workshop with Ms. Denison.Since ""Girls and Sex"" is a work of nonfiction, Ms. Orenstein explains her methodology for conducting her interviews in the book's introduction. Readers curious to know whose voices they're listening to have that data available. Every study and statistic referenced in the book is cited in the Notes at the end of the text. If a reader wants to understand where the author sourced her facts and figures from, that information is meticulously cited and accessible. A Selected Bibliography is also provided, in addition to the Notes from the text.I found ""Girls and Sex"" to be an incredibly compelling read. I feel fortunate I was able to acquire a paperback copy -- this is a book I want to keep on my shelf. Recommended for anyone interested in teenage body health, sexuality, or modern rape culture. I would also recommend ""Girls and Sex"" to any authors who are currently penning Young Adult novels. Many adults like to generalize their own experiences onto younger generations -- and this book is a clear warning flag not to do that. Real understanding and empathy cannot be based on assumptions. Author Peggy Orenstein dared to listen to all of these young women tell their own stories, and her book allows these young women to speak for themselves. The most radical act is to pay attention and listen....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 27, 2017","Nov 11, 2017","Oct 23, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25816707-girls-sex

This second book is good, but there were a number of structural issues that kept ""Revelation"" from having the kind of emotional impact the first novel had. The hot-tempered Prince Aleksander, whose friendship with the main character, Seyonne, created the main plot of ""Tranformation,"" appeared in this book only briefly, in the beginning and end. I missed Aleksander's presence fiercely. This sequel introduces a new character named Blaise, a powerful sorcerer who is an Ezzarian like Seyonne, but Blaise is ""demon-born,"" with a human soul fused with a demon's, and he's able to transform his body at will. Blaise is an excellent character -- but again, he is seen in the beginning of the novel, and then again only briefly, at the end.Ditto for Fiona, another new character I love love LOVE. Fiona has become Seyonne's Aife, the person who weaves portals and battle-realms for him to fight demons inside of, and has been assigned to watch over Seyonne due to his supposed ""corruption"" from living as a Derzhi slave for so long. Fiona plays a huge part in the beginning, and then again briefly, at the end.Most of the action and plot of ""Revelation"" takes place in the ""demon realm"" -- the place where the demons who come to possess human bodies all live. Seyonne chooses to travel there in order to unravel the secrets of his people, and figure out why the Ezzarians are engaged in a never-ending war with these demons. The information Seyonne learns is interesting and worthwhile. But oh God, does Seyonne suffer. Physically, emotionally, psychologically. This book is just NONSTOP SUFFERING. Seyonne suffers in the demon realm, and when he finally leaves the demon realm, the Ezzarians REALLY make him suffer, and even Aleksander and Blaise and Fiona all heap on aspects of torment. In the end, Seyonne's three closest friends prove themselves to be his friends after all -- but oh God, what happens before then is JUST BRUTAL.Since most of this book takes place in the demon realm, it was the emotional stakes here that really make or break the impact this novel could have, and for me, this section lasted too long and didn't have enough payoff. Seyonne doesn't become close to any of the demons, though he does learn to trust them. The demons do such AWFUL G*DD*MN things to him, and Seyonne has to uncover layers and layers of subterfuge and betrayal. There is good conflict here, I just never felt like I bonded with any of these demons at all. As friends, or as helpers, or as beings worthy of the sacrifice Seyonne makes. (And boy, does Seyonne ever go through some pain to save lives here. Jesus.)As a teenage warrior, Seyonne married a powerful Ezzarian named Ysanne, and Ysanne is still his wife and the Queen of the Ezzarians. In ""Revelation,"" Ysanne's actions were the most repulsive in this entire book, and after what the demons do to Seyonne, that is *really* hard to top.The big-battle climax of this novel features Seyonne fighting Ezzarians, and then he is unconscious and unable to witness ALL THE BIG PLOT POINTS he has worked so hard to achieve. The reader doesn't get to watch what happens, we're just forced to witness Seyonne suffer EVEN MORE at the end, and then wake up to the aftermath of what his friends did while he was unconscious -- action they summarize for him in a few short sentences. This was such a massive letdown for me, I felt so horribly cheated. Cheated by the story, cheated of any sense of victory. Sure, Seyonne saves lives. But these people felt so UNWORTHY of ANYTHING, especially life. Unlike Aleksander, who proved himself worthy of all Seyonne's love, I did not have any such link to the characters in ""Revelation."" I didn't think it was possible for me to hate anyone so much as I hated Aleksander as he appeared in the beginning of ""Transformation"" -- but Ysanne beats out the young Aleksander for viciousness by such a wide margin, if this were a mathematical equation, I'd need to use exponential power to describe how foul Ysanne is in comparison.And the same goes for the Ezzarian people. They make me sick. As a reader, I love Seyonne, I love Seyonne to the ends of the universe and back, and in ""Revelation,"" I witness his nonstop suffering in order to save people who are vile. It makes me furious. The first novel left me with such a feeling of triumph, with grateful tears in my eyes. This second novel leaves me wishing ALL THESE PEOPLE WOULD JUST DIE. I wish Seyonne could take his child and go live somewhere without any of this foul bullsh*t these ignorant and vicious Ezzarians bring to his life. Even though I felt jerked around by this sequel, and so massively cheated that I'm giving ""Revelation"" three stars, I've already started reading the third (and final) book in this series. Because I love Seyonne so much, I'm hooked, I'm all-in to find out what happens to him. And I HATE Ysanne so much, I have to know what becomes of her. Is the author going to redeem this woman? Is Seyonne going to stay married to her and reunite with Ysanne? It's torment to just IMAGINE Seyonne will end up with Ysanne. I'm grieving this, in a state of emotional wreckage, because what Ysanne did is so horrendous, and Seyonne deserves so much better. I want Seyonne to have a love that is worthy of him, because Seyonne is THE KING OF ALL MEN. He is just that badass and awesome. He's so broken and damaged by the end of ""Revelation,"" and *still* he is the king of all men. I love him. Now I have to find out what becomes of him in the last book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 21, 2016","Nov 06, 2016","Oct 21, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/618197.Revelation

The book features a blatant disregard for medical realities of traumatic brain injuries and combat wounds, and pins the protagonist's moral hardships on issues surrounding the U.S.-led wars against Terror in Iraq and Afghanistan.The novel is told from the point of view of Gabriela ""Gabi"" Santiago, a seventeen-year-old who is one month shy of her eighteenth birthday, and two months shy of her high school graduation. Gabi's father is enlisted in the U.S. Army, and he's currently posted on a base in Germany. Gabi lives with her parents and her five-year-old brother, Matteo. Her older brother, Lucas, has enlisted in the U.S. Army, and is serving a tour of duty in Afghanistan. The story begins soon after Gabi receives a text message from her father stating that her brother Lucas has been wounded in action. Within 24 hours of surviving a blast from an IED, Lucas arrives at the hospital in Germany, where his family goes to see him. On page 20, Gabi's father tells her Lucas is ""unresponsive"" and ""in a coma."" Gabi assumes that her brother is ""on his way to becoming a vegetable"" but her father tells her that, ""The doctors are hopeful. They say these first few weeks are crucial. If he shows signs of response, anything at all, there's a chance he'll come out of it.""No other medical details are provided, though for the next month, the family remains worried that Lucas might die, a sure sign that he has some form of traumatic brain injury from the blast that caused the coma. The author never provides a scene in which the family receives a report of what happened in Afghanistan from Lucas's commanding officer, or anyone else in an official capacity. At the end of the novel, Lucas's good friend, Seth, reveals to Gabi the details of what happened before the IED went off. Also at the end of the book, the reader learns that Lucas's spine was damaged in the blast as well, badly enough to paralyze him, but this information about a severe spinal injury is saved until the end of the novel.According to the book jacket for ""Beneath Wandering Stars,"" Gabriela made a vow to her brother before he left for Afghanistan: ""If anything ever happened to him, she would walk the Camino de Santiago through Spain, making a pilgrimage in his name.""But in the novel, Gabriela doesn't have any idea her brother wanted her to undertake this pilgrimage. On the same day Lucas arrives in the base hospital in a coma, his best friend and fellow soldier, Seth, also arrives. Seth holds up a letter from Lucas, which Gabi and her father refuse to read. So Seth paraphrases what the letter says for them: ""Lucas wants you to revive your old tradition by taking another trek. He wants you to do a pilgrimage. He claims people have made journeys like this on behalf of absent soldiers, the sick, and the recently deceased for thousands of years."" (page 27/28)Gabi immediately says, ""That makes no sense. Lucas isn't exactly devout.""Despite how nonsensical this all is, Seth goes on to say, ""Lucas wanted you to walk a very specific route, mainly because it's your namesake.""At which point (page 28), Gabi's father says, ""You mean the Camino de Santiago?""And Seth says, ""That's the one."" He adds, ""In his letter, Lucas wrote that if he wasn't able to walk to Santiago with you two for any reason, then he wanted me to go in his place.""Shortly after this exchange, Gabi and her family go home for the night. Both her parents, Matteo, and Gabi go home to their beds, and Gabi sleeps ""well. And long. The smell of Mom's blueberry pancakes, served with the Michigan maple syrup her uncle taps and ships to us overseas, is what finally wakes me.""Matteo watches SpongeBob on TV, and Gabi's father spends the morning printing out ""every map he could find of the Camino de Santiago"" (page 33). At this point in the novel, I didn't believe these were real people at ALL. What parents would leave their almost-fatally wounded son alone in the hospital, when he could die in the night? How could anyone just go home and ""sleep well"" and cook a big family breakfast, when their son could die of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) at any moment?Not only that, but instead of going to the hospital right away as a family, Gabi's father gives Gabi his credit card, and drops Gabi and Matteo off at the mall, to eat and shop for hiking boots, so Gabi can go on this 500-mile walk across Spain.This is where my jaw dropped. Clearly, this author has *never* had a family member put in the hospital with a TBI, whether from a civilian injury like a car accident or a battlefield IED. No loving parents abandon their children the way Gabi's parents abandoned Lucas. No loving father would consider running off on a pilgrimage when a child is so close to death. This is a time for constant vigilance, waiting for brain scans and test results, being there to help care for the patient after life-saving surgeries, and praying that infections and blood clots don't develop, which are often lethal.There is no medical language like this in the book though. The father instead plans to go on the pilgrimage with Gabi, but then a new work assignment keeps him in Germany, so he cancels the trip. Furious to have the trip cancelled the day after buying her hiking boots, Gabi decides to sneak out of the house and go to Spain anyway. Her boyfriend in the U.S. buys her an airline ticket to France, where Gabi meets up with Seth. They take a train to southern France, where they begin this pilgrimage. The most popular pilgrimage route for the Camino de Santiago starts in southern France, and crosses northern Spain, ending in the city of Santiago, Spain. This is the route the characters use in the book. Gabi spends the first several days on this pilgrimage thinking about her boyfriend and clashing with Seth. It is not until page 92 that she makes her first phone call home to her mom to ask how Lucas is doing. She never feels bad about leaving her parents alone while they visit the hospital, and she never feels bad about leaving her little brother behind, either. Instead, Gabi suffers the physical hardships of trekking (sporadic showering opportunities, blisters, being caught in the rain) and after her boyfriend breaks up with her over email one day, she gets so angry that she ditches Seth to hike the rest of the route alone. This is when she pities herself, and realizes she has given up time she could be spending with Lucas in order to be making this pilgrimage. It was rather bizarre to read those thoughts, since Gabi claims she is making this pilgrimage because her father wants her to, and in order to ""heal"" her brother. Eventually, Gabi runs into some trouble with some men in a bar, and Seth magically reappears to protect her and finish the pilgrimage with her. The book's primary aim is to detail what it's like to walk the Camino de Santiago, and develop the love story between Gabi and Seth. The author also wanted to provide details about what it's like to grow up in the military, moving from base to base when enlisted parents are posted to new assignments. The term ""military brat"" is used quite often throughout the novel.In order to document their pilgrimage, Seth and Gabi photograph a G.I. Joe action figure (with a picture of Lucas's face taped to the head) at various stops they make along the route, and Seth ends up posting the pictures online. Soon the picture thread goes viral, and people send their blessings and thanks to Gabi and Seth for walking on behalf of a loved one. Some of these strangers and friends donate money to help with Lucas's medical costs. Right before the last part of the journey to Santiago, Seth falls and sprains his ankle. A Spanish couple provide him with an old wheelchair, and Gabi pushes Seth the rest of the way to Santiago. As they reach their final destination, Gabi finds her father waiting for them, and learns that Lucas has awoken from his coma. He has suffered no damage from the coma or the TBI, but the IED severed his spine and he is paralyzed from the waist down. Enraged by this news, Seth responds by smashing up the borrowed wheelchair with a piece of pipe, until the wheelchair is only a ""twisted pile of scrap metal"" (page 243). Even though Seth and Gabi kiss passionately before they go their separate ways, Seth refuses to return to Germany to see Lucas.As Gabi says of Seth, to explain: ""Send this boy back to Afghanistan, and he'd be fine. But make him visit my brother--half the man he was, at least physically--and the survivor's guilt would have Seth running from the room"" (page 255). This is close to the end of the book, and it is the first time the term ""survivor's guilt"" has been mentioned. So Gabi goes back to Germany with her father, having been in Spain for one month, long enough to turn eighteen. After she's been back in Germany for three weeks, Lucas is riding around in a wheelchair, and is discharged from the hospital, and taken home. No physical therapy, no recovering from surgeries to repair his spine or any other medical complications. After being in a coma for a month, Lucas only needs to spend three weeks in the hospital until he is sent home, healthy and whole but no longer able to feel or move his legs. The book ends with Gabi saying of Lucas: ""Right now you wouldn't even know Lucas had a disability. He looks content, like he knows this is where he belongs."" Then she lists the three things she loves ""about being a military brat"" as the grand finale of the novel.In sum, I think this novel would've been much stronger if Gabi had stayed at Lucas's bedside before he awoke, waited until he was well enough to travel by wheelchair, and then made this pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago with Lucas, their father, and Seth. The novel would've still functioned as a love story, as Seth and Gabi could've still fallen in love, and the moral dilemmas of being a modern-day U.S. soldier could've still been explored -- even more thoroughly than they were with Gabi and Seth alone. If the author had kept Seth and Lucas together, the dialogue would've been far more interesting, since I had the strong feeling the two of them had a lot of unfinished business, given what had happened to them in Afghanistan. Seth ends up leaving Spain for Scotland, making it clear he plans to keep moving and stay a pilgrim for some time. It cut my heart in such a savage way to know that Seth had the ability to take Lucas on one of these pilgrimages, but chose to avoid spending any time with Lucas. While I recognize that a lot of able-bodied friends choose to disassociate themselves from their friends who become disabled, watching Seth do that to Lucas made me so sad. And hearing that Gabi plans to leave him to go spend a year living in Mexico gave me another strong feeling of sadness. While this might be the way people operate with their disabled friends and family in real life, it sure made me depressed to see Lucas treated this way by his sister and best friend. If Lucas had been my brother, there is no WAY I'd leave him hovering close to death in the hospital to go on a trek across Spain on a whim. I'd be by his side as much as I could, helping as much as I could. I think Gabi fled to Spain with Seth because she was terrified of facing her brother's death -- and yet this emotion was never dealt with in the book. Gabi's trek across Spain was always portrayed as being courageous and bold, when I saw it as the opposite -- she was a young teen who realized she was mortal, and couldn't bear to watch her brother possibly die. I do understand that the pilgrimage was seen to have some mystical healing power, and was portrayed as the reason Lucas awoke from his coma. While Gabi does have religious thoughts and reflections through the novel, and often gets angry with God, or pleads with God to heal her brother, I know people wake up from comas in real life every day, including when the odds are stacked against them or after all hope is lost, whether someone is making a pilgrimage in their name or not. This is why I wished Gabi had waited to start this pilgrimage until Lucas could make the journey with her. Though I had some problems with this book, if you enjoy reading travelogues, and are interested in learning more about the Camino de Santiago, this novel provides a lot of great details about what it's like to make that journey. I enjoyed reading about the trip across Spain, and Gabi and Seth share several sweet moments as they fall in love. For those sweet moments and the interesting portrayal of this pilgrimage route, I give ""Beneath Wandering Stars"" three full stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 21, 2016","Oct 26, 2016","Oct 21, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27501068-beneath-wandering-stars

Even though the opening pages contained long sections of info-dump, and plot points were repeated a lot in the opening, the story picked up and I devoured the first half of ""Cruel Beauty"" very quickly.I wanted to love this book more. The story had an inherent darkness -- both in the world and in the main character, a young woman named Nyx -- that spoke to what I love most in fiction. But the book wore on me. The author kept using the same plot device to maintain conflict: Nyx learns something important, then forgets. Sleep is often involved. Reveal and forget, reveal and forget. Over and over and over. I grew so tired of this, especially in the second half of the book, when the story felt prolonged for no reason. One of my FAVORITE parts of this book were the Gentle Lord's red eyes with their cat-slit pupils. I absolutely loved his characterization, although I wish he'd been an actual beast or a monster, rather than a beautiful man. It took a lot of the punch out of the thrill of ""Beauty and the Beast"" to have Nyx interacting with such a gorgeous and playful demon.I picked up this book because Rosamund Hodge's newest novel, ""Bright Smoke, Cold Fire,"" has been receiving lackluster s, but this debut novel received high acclaim. I'm glad I read ""Cruel Beauty,"" since the first half of this book was a compulsive 5-star read for me. I don't think the Greek mythology was necessary, but I have friends who would buy this book simply *because* the Greek myths are mentioned so often. I debated whether this was a 3.5-star read for me, or a solid 3-star experience, and chose a solid 3 stars. Recommended to everyone who loves fairy tale retellings, Greek mythology, and YA love stories/romantic-relationship dramas. If you crave a main character who takes more direct action in stories, with fight scenes instead of kissing scenes, then ""Cruel Beauty"" might wear you down the same way I felt tuckered out by the end. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 06, 2016","Oct 07, 2016","Oct 06, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15839984-cruel-beauty

One of the best YA novels I've ever read, from the gut-punching swift prose to the subject matter to the unforgettable characters. This story is nothing like most YA on the market today. These characters felt honest, true to life, crackling with flaws and ugliness and yearnings, selfish and compassionate in equal measure. The world of these high schoolers felt like *my* high school world, dark and dirty, heartbreaking and mundane. This book felt so true to life to me, and I loved every second. Even with the realism and the darkness everywhere on the page, there is a lot of moral messaging going on in ""The Female of the Species,"" and the ending articulates a strong moral comeuppance, as one would expect with YA. But the ending is also perfect, and the final chapters strike all the right notes. By the time I reached this sentence (page 334), I had tears in my eyes: ""And while she came to me out of habit, I know there's more comfort for her in those wounds than I can ever give.""I refuse to spoil the plot by revealing what specific wounds were being discussed here, but I *can* say that this chapter ending was so powerful, I had to put the book down for an hour before I could read the finale. And I'm so glad I did wait, to give myself the emotional fortitude to read slowly and carefully, because the final chapter of this novel was GORGEOUS. If you crave YA that features young women who are shy and chaste, physically beautiful and adorably unsure of themselves, who fall in love with experienced rich boys who quote poetry and save their fairy tale-esque lady loves from all manner of harm, and everyone generally waits to have sex until after marriage vows are recited or formal proclamations of True Love have been made -- you should probably avoid this novel.If you crave a well-crafted book that hums along like a powerful piece of machinery, a story that grinds up fairy tale tropes like wood thrown into a chipper, and delivers a story that is exciting, gut-wrenching, and brutally stunning -- then ""The Female of the Species"" is one for your list. Highly recommended.

He celebrates his fourteenth birthday in the opening pages of this book, so I doThe main character of ""The Rampart Guards"" is a teenager named Jason. He celebrates his fourteenth birthday in the opening pages of this book, so I don't know whether that makes this fantasy a Young Adult novel or middle grade fiction. It was sold to me as middle grade fiction, and it reads as middle grade, but I'm still unsure. Fourteen seems like YA territory to me, but maybe readers are so used to YA novels that star sixteen-year-old protagonists, fourteen doesn't qualify for the marketing demographic. No matter how this book is shelved, the story takes a long time to delve into the ""fantasy"" part of the book's plot. Jason's mother goes missing, the family moves to a small town in Idaho, Jason makes a new friend and settles in. He meets his quirky uncle, discovers his uncle studies fantastical creatures called cryptids, and that his uncle is a Rampart Guard.The Rampart is defined as ""a shield"" (page 77). This shield has something to do with electricity, and the shield covers the earth. As the uncle explains to Jason (page 78): ""Regions around the world are assigned Rampart Guards who are charged with sustainment of the Rampart -- the shield I mentioned -- to maintain the balance of energy between cryptids and humans, ensuring peace and safety for all.""So of course, an Evil Villain with a Team of Sidekicks has decided to destroy the Rampart in order to kill off the human race. This Evil Team can only be stopped by Jason, even though he has received no formal training and blunders repeatedly into traps. If you enjoy fantasy stories with ineffectual villains, ""The Rampart Guards"" will delight. Late in the book, Jason learns these evil villains want to wipe out the human race due to human-caused global warming and pollution. What was especially odd about this reveal was that no mention of human pollution and/or global warming was made in the story until this big mwhahahaha-declaration of evil-intent quite late in the book. The agenda of Team Evil felt uninspired and pat. If you pick up this book hoping that the story will be full of magical creatures and action, be warned that most of this book focuses on the mundane world of a small town in Idaho, and the novel takes a long time to turn into a fantasy story. The prose is adequate, the writing is clean and easy to read, but highly repetitive of dull story details. I never felt like I learned enough about the Rampart, the regions, or how this ""shield"" really worked, where it came from, or how the Rampart Guards began. Instead, characters repeated previous scene information in detail, either in phone conversations or direct dialogue. The constant use of so many food descriptions -- such as the eating of sandwiches, cookies, drinking glasses of water -- read as distracting and unneeded. By the time the big final action scene began, I was skimming, and wishing the novel had featured that level of action much sooner. As it was, I had such a hard time accepting the plot twists at the end, concerning Jason's father especially, that the ending left me dissatisfied. ""The Rampart Guards"" receives a full 5 stars for the identity of Evil Henchman #1, who is the primary antagonist of this novel. The author made an excellent choice with Jason's big nemesis in this book.But the novel receives a one-star for the excessive repetition of information, and the lack of information about the Rampart. I also give this novel a two-star rating for taking so long to introduce the cryptids, and forcing me to read so many pages before delivering an engaging action scene. Overall, I give this book 3 stars. Recommended for anyone who is craving a middle grade fantasy that is heavy on mundane detail, light on fantasy world-building, and features a big action scene at the end. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 04, 2016","Oct 10, 2016","Oct 04, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28456860-the-rampart-guards

I give this book a solid 3.5 stars because I didn't skim any chapters, the vocabulary was interesting, and there were action scenes with flying dragons in the book. I think the book's structure suffers a bit because the novel begins with characters who don't feature in the main plot at all, and the opening chapters set a rather dull tone for this high-action tale. Instead of starting the novel in art class with a belligerent football-coach teacher (who never appears in the story again) and a bully who is largely inconsequential (he reappears one more time, but really serves no purpose), the story could've introduced the primary antagonist/main villain in chapter one, since Rex Triumph plays such a huge role in the book and becomes one of the point of view characters on page 129, when he is introduced for the first time.My favorite line in the novel appears on page 261, when the main character, Rose, is riding a dragon named Jade, and they're engaged in a high-action battle in air against the villain-dragon, Rex Triumph --""She was like a knight in diamond armor."" As much as I loved that line, I also really struggled with that sentence being written as a simile, since Rose WAS flying into battle, in a fight to the death, while wearing diamond armor. I don't know why the author used ""like"" there other than a sexist notion that knights can only be male, and never thirteen-year-old females. I wish the line had simply read: ""She was a knight in diamond armor."" Once the book finally arrives at the main plot, the story picks up and there's a good deal of action. The final third of this novel features a lot of battle and danger scenes. The villain Rex Triumph also brings some robotic dinosaurs to life, and the animals tear up a Las Vegas casino. My favorite thing about this book was the use of the words tektite, harbinger, and graphite powder. This novel had a lot of interesting concepts and terms, and the use of modern science, as well as a brief mention of Wicca, elevated this book far above a lot of the other middle grade fiction I've read.

Ditto uneducated, working-class white people: this book throws them all under the bus.

And this phrasing stands, unquestioned by anyone: spoken to Theo just days after the attack. Because there is no real terrorist attack in this novel. The bombing at the art museum is just the author's way of talking about the 'small-t trauma' many white, middle-class adults suffer in their daily lives. It is a trauma of profound disconnection from a person's own authentic self, and it leads to a massive inability to connect with anyone else in life, because the connection to self has been so brutally severed.None of which is discussed in this book, however. Oh no. What is presented in this book is Theo's philosophical treatise on life, his great magnum opus of adolescent whingeing and acute emo-angst, featured as the novel's ultimate truth.Theo is supposed to be 28 years old or so when he records his memoir for his assumed reader. But the voice of this book is the same throughout: Theo at thirteen years old. He never emotionally or mentally matures whatsoever. Theo presents the reader with some uber-profound permanent-victim-mentality ethos at the very end of the novel. I'll quote from track #8, disc #26 (the final disc) of the audiobook:""A great sorrow, and one that I am only beginning to understand: we don't get to choose our own hearts. We can't make ourselves want what's good for us, or what's good for other people. We don't get to choose the people we are."" It's infinitely funny to me that this novel was cited in so many laudatory s as being ""Dickensian,"" when who else but Dickens so fervently believed that human beings are capable of great transformation? Who else but Dickens could give us the character of Ebenezer Scrooge? But here's Theo, laying down his own version of truth, and telling us that Dickens was full of shit. All of Dickens' stories and novels in which human beings completely transform, completely change who they are and how they behave in life: according to Theo, that is all a crock of shit. On track #11, Theo goes on to state:""No one will ever, ever be able to persuade me that life is some awesome, rewarding treat. Because here's the truth: life is catastrophe. The basic fact of existence, of walking around, trying to feed ourselves and find friends and whatever else we do: is catastrophe.""I'm currently reading a nonfiction book about the 1972 plane crash of rugby players in the Andes, a book that details all of the capital-t Trauma those survivors went through to live through that ordeal, and what is abundantly clear to me: that *plane crash* is ""catastrophe."" The terrorist attack at the beginning of the novel that Theo (according to the text) walked away from was ""catastrophe."" Walking around in an ordinary city on an ordinary day, eating at food trucks and saying hello to people in coffee shops: is *not* catastrophe. The metaphorical language only works if ""catastrophe"" is qualified in the text, and if Theo's misery is accurately named for what it is: profound emotional isolation; profound disconnection from self; profound disconnection from others. But Tartt doesn't do that. This understanding of emotional isolation is *nowhere* in this book; I'm grasping at straws to make this make sense. Instead of giving me anything logical, Tartt has Theo inform me that my mundane, happy life, the life that people surviving big-t Trauma are always desperate to return to, and are most often profoundly grateful to inhabit, is ""catastrophe."" And I cannot WTF hard enough at this shit.Theo further adds, near the closing lines of the novel (track #11-12):""For me, and I'll keep repeating it doggedly till I die, till I fall over on my ungrateful, nihilistic face, and am too weak to say it: better never born, than born into this cesspool."" And there's the big capital-t Truth of this novel: all human life is a cesspool. And Theo, in all of his profound wisdom, has adopted cynicism and nihilism to protect himself from this literal shithole called ""life."" See that, Dickens? You great hopeful dope, trying to pen stories about casting off cynicism and nihilism in exchange for authenticity and social justice: go fuck yourself, Dickens. Theo is in the house, and he's here to lay down the real truth: ""nature is death,"" and ""death always wins."" Armor up with cynicism, armor up with nihilism. This is the path of true wisdom. Don't put your faith in connecting with yourself, or with other people. Because death destroys people; people don't last; people don't matter. What matters is that which death ""doesn't touch"": physical objects. Stuff like antique furniture, and paintings. At the very end of ""The Goldfinch"" (track #12), Theo says that ""it is a glory and privilege to love what death doesn't touch."" To love objects is the only way to grant oneself immortality, because objects are immortal, not people. Talk about a slam-dunk for the uber-mensch, Theo. Take that, Dickens, you outdated sap. I think we all know now what Ebenezer Scrooge should have done in ""A Christmas Carol"": clung to his physical possessions all the more passionately, because ""it is a glory and privilege to love what death doesn't touch."" And more importantly, according to ""The Goldfinch"": Scrooge is incapable of change, because as Theo has learned: ""We cannot escape who we are."" Scrooge, the great miser, cannot actually change who he is. Because: ""We don't get to choose the people we are."" Take it from Theo. He survived a terrorist bombing, and he knows what's up. Not that eternal fuckup, Dickens, and his so-called ""art."" The truth is: ""We can't escape who we are."" Scrooge was bound to be a miser forever. How dare Dickens tell us all otherwise.If Tartt had presented any level of meta-awareness as to Theo's emotional immaturity, I would not despise this novel as much as I do.But Tartt does not get meta at all in this book. Theo's juvenile understanding of life is presented as capital-t Truth in the book, and promotes all of his nihilistic concepts as wisdom. And the book is just outstandingly silly and unrealistic, besides. From the aftermath of the terrorist bombing, to Theo fleeing his father's plot-pull death on a fantasy Greyhound bus trip, to Theo living for many years in New York City without ever hearing from Hobie's social circle that Andy and his father died tragically in a boating accident: ""The Goldfinch"" is staunchly outside of objective reality. This novel is a fantasy land in which all authorial strings are pulled so Theo the child-puppet can whinge. In short: this book is bullshit and I hate it. I hate it so much that I will never again read Donna Tartt. And I almost removed ""The Secret History"" from my bookshelf, despite having read it three times, because I cannot believe that I ever enjoyed something from the same author who wrote the epic drivel of ""The Goldfinch.""Not only did I hate ""the point"" of this book, but I loathed the faux-poetry style of the prose. These sentences weren't ""lovely"" to me. But they did communicate a juvenile mindset, an immature and ego-centric worldview, exceedingly well.All the negative stars.I would drink arsenic before I recommended this book to anyone to read. The fact that this book is so beloved, given its contents, was illuminating to me. So I'm giving it two stars as a market research read. ""The Goldfinch"" is an Elin Hilderbrand YA novel for ""the literary elite."" Victim mindset juvenalia. I am not amused.

The four teenage point of view characters didn't hook me right away, ""Salt to the Sea"" was a challenging read, a book that I struggled with at first. The four teenage point of view characters didn't hook me right away, and I read the first half of this book feeling like the narrative was distant, dull, and boring. I wasn't engaged by the content or the story, and the moments of wartime atrocity experienced by strangers didn't grip me either. After watching films like ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist,"" the author's attempts to show short, punching scenes of horror simply couldn't compete with anything I've already been exposed to. After 200 pages, I almost gave up on this book.Then I read the ""Author's Note"" at the end. Followed by the ""Research and Sources"" concerning the sinking of the ""Wilhelm Gustloff"" by Russian torpedoes, and the people who have dedicated their lives to the ship's memory, as well as memorializing those who perished aboard it -- and suddenly everything changed. My heart was so deeply moved by those pages, I even cried as I tried to read them aloud to my husband later -- and that was when I became determined to finish this YA historical novel. I'm so glad I did.I came to appreciate all of these characters, to care deeply for them, and to root for them. I even cared for Alfred, who is labeled a ""sociopath in training"" (page 280) by Florian. But I didn't see Alfred as a sociopath, but a young man twisted by the circumstances around him, and I actually pitied him a lot. I know the exact moment when ""Salt to the Sea"" became a 5-star read to me, and the paragraph arrived on page 332. Joana is narrating a scene of the ship sinking, desperate to get into a lifeboat and save herself, and she witnesses this event happen:""I grabbed a railing near the staircase. A loud crash thundered from behind. The enormous anti-aircraft weaponry slid across the deck, broke through the rail, and smashed onto a lifeboat that had just been lowered. The weapons, the boat, and all of the passengers sank quickly beneath the surface.""While I read the final third of this novel, I had the urge to watch the James Cameron film, ""Titanic,"" with my body wrapped in heavy blankets, having a good cry. I also felt myself mentally pushing against my acculturated hatred of the Nazis and the silent German people who never spoke up against the concentration camps and atrocities of the Third Reich. Similar to when I read ""All the Light We Cannot See,"" which places the reader into the point of view of a German soldier, ""Salt to the Sea"" places the reader into the point of view of Germans fleeing the advance of the Russians in 1945. Even though Emilia is Polish, Joana is Lithuanian, and other characters are noted as having ""impure"" heritage, these are teenagers swept up in events much larger than themselves -- and by reading this story, it is made obvious that the same goes for adults. This novel did something few books ever do for me: forced me to confront my assumptions, my hatreds, and my bone-deep rage against every horror perpetuated by the Third Reich, as well as the silent complicity that led to Hitler's rise. ""Salt to the Sea"" is a novel of great compassion. Important, riveting, and emotionally beautiful.

I thought the most interestingI enjoyed the prologue and the first five essays in this book well enough, but I didn't find them exciting or gripping. I thought the most interesting parts in those pages were the sections about Margaret Atwood's own youth and young adulthood. Her knowledge of classic literature and history are profound, and often entertaining, but the fifth essay felt like a chore to finish, and I debated putting the book down, and giving up. And then the sixth and final essay of the book --""Descent: Negotiating with the Dead: Who Makes the Trip to the Underworld, and Why?"" arrived -- and Oh. My. GOD. That sixth essay was a complete game change. The book rocketed up to the top of my list as one of the very best essays about writing, and why writers write, that I've ever read.The quotations Ms. Atwood places before this essay are gorgeous. Stunning, powerful, beautiful. And by the time she arrived at quoting Book XI of the ""Odyssey,"" allowing Odysseus to narrate a tiny piece of his story, I was like a wolf howling at the moon, overcome --""When I had finished my prayers and invocations to the communities of the dead, I took the sheep and cut their throats over the trench so that the dark blood poured in. And now the souls of the dead came swarming up... From this multitude of souls, as they fluttered to and fro by the trench, there came an eerie clamour. Panic drained the blood from my cheeks.""Ms. Atwood analyzes this passage by saying, ""As well it might. Odysseus sits beside the trench with drawn sword in hand, to keep any of the souls from drinking the blood until he gets what he wants, because he's there to do a negotiation, to make a trade. Of what he wants in return, more shortly."" (page 164)She moves from discussing Odysseus, to all sorts of grisly rites, and eventually arrives at Gilgamesh in this essay. I howled with love to the end.On page 156, Ms. Atwood describes her essay's title this way: ""[...] perhaps all writing, is motivated, deep down, by a fear of and fascination with mortality--by a desire to make the risky trip to the Underworld, and to bring something or someone back from the dead.""This essay is GENIUS. And earned the book a full five stars.

The main character, Lena, is a teen girl living in poverty with her three-year-old brother, Jozey. They live wThis YA fantasy starts out really well. The main character, Lena, is a teen girl living in poverty with her three-year-old brother, Jozey. They live with their aunt because their parents are dead, and the aunt needs $100.00 from Lena at the end of each month in order to pay the rent and keep them in their home. So Lena has turned to drug trafficking to make that $100.00 each month, and works as a drug mule for her boyfriend, an opera-singing boy named Santiago. Early in the novel, the reader is told Lena's parents are ""long dead"" and I assumed that meant they'd died in an accident right after Jozey was born. The reader is also given the sense that Lena has been living in poverty for quite some time, and that she has *NO* other way to make money than by doing these drug pickups for Santiago.Much, much later in the novel, the reader learns that Lena's parents have only been dead for seven months. And Lena has other ways of making money -- a character named Gramma Scar urges Lena to earn money by working at her restaurant in town, and the daycare facility owner also asks Lena to come and work for her. Very late in the book, Lena makes a vague comment about marks on her arm (marks that were given no visual description), and mentions that ""the girl"" who made those marks no longer exists. Because Lena states more than once that she has never done drugs (or had sex), I took this mention of ""marks"" to mean that Lena might have been self-harming, perhaps cutting herself, before the novel begins. I felt super-confused by that comment so late in the book, and this was simply my best guess as to what was meant by that line. The unspoken truth of this novel is that Lena is hell-bent on self-destruction. She has options to help herself, she just refuses to use them. Her psychology goes vastly unexplored in this novel, and that made ""The Never Prayer"" extremely frustrating to read. Lena is a girl who was wealthy-enough, pretty-enough, and popular-enough at school before her parents died. Seven months later, in a state of mind that is never adequately addressed by the story, she is trying to destroy herself due to grief. Instead of tackling Lena's self-destructive psychology, the novel spins off in other directions. An angel and a demon show up in town disguised as two teen boys. They start coming to school to complicate Lena's life. If the book jacket hadn't told me these boys weren't human, I'd never have guessed.Then the book focuses on the three high school cliques at Lena's tiny mountain-town school. These cliques consist of the rich/popular students -- who call themselves the Paladins, the poor/druggie students -- who call themselves the Heretics, and the students who are unwanted by the Paladins or the Heretics, and are called/call themselves the Untouchables. The novel's depiction of these high school cliques felt so surreal to me, with their names and identity-behaviors, they seemed more like gangs than high school cliques. For the first half of the novel, I thought the descriptions of these cliques were what made ""The Never Prayer"" a fantasy. But it turns out, these cliques were meant to be an authentic portrayal of high school life, and once a boy sprouts angel wings and starts flying on page 107, the book makes its thematic shift from a contemporary novel to a fantasy. Because the book doesn't describe the psychology of grief, trauma, or the self-destructive effects of survivor's guilt -- in fact, none of this language is used in the book anywhere -- Lena's behavior reads as infuriating and ridiculous. Late in the novel, the reader is finally told that Lena and Jozey both watched their parents be shot to death by a stranger -- and yet, they aren't in any counseling, and the story makes no mention of how traumatic witnessing such violence would be to a person. Instead, the reader just witnesses Lena's inexplicably self-destructive behavior. By the time she takes her ""red purse"" full of ""drugs"" to school for No Reason, right after she learns that one of the teen boys at school is actually a demon doing everything in his power to hurt her, I was done with caring about her, as she had become a young woman with no functioning brain by that point. The only mention of Lena's self-destructive grief-spiral is made near the end of the novel, as the demon boy is attempting to blow up the school with dynamite (page 183): ""And most important, Lena has let go of her grief.""I had two immediate thoughts while reading that single, erratic sentence: 1.) How can anyone ever ""let go"" of grief? -- loss is loss, and unless you can forget you have lost something, you will always grieve that loss from time to time, in random and unforeseen ways, and 2.) When did Lena ever ""let go"" of her grief? and why wasn't this discussed in the novel?The word ""drugs"" appears many, many times in this book, but at no point is the reader given any specifics as to which particular drug Lena is supposed to be hauling around in her red purse. This lack of detail was fine in the first 50 pages, but as the role of the drugs kept growing, the book's refusal to deal in specifics became incredibly frustrating, destroying any credibility that Lena could be a real person. The dialogue suffered for this lack as much as the plot did. And speaking of dialogue, after the first 50 pages, every one of these characters had moments when they didn't sound like teenagers, or even normal people, at all. Take these lines spoken by Deirdre, Lena's former-best-friend, while Deirdre is talking to Lena at school (page 54) --""Come over tonight. We can pretend to do homework. And bring Jozey, since it has been far too long since I have gazed on him. You need the calming influence of the Paladins at this stage of your life.""I have never in my life told a friend to bring her little brother over while we hang out because ""it has been far too long since I have gazed on him."" When Lena's aunt comes to the school, to warn Lena that someone has called Child Protective Services and that Jozey could be taken away from them, Lena throws her rage (and guilt) on her aunt by saying (page 59): ""Perfect timing! Such wonderful news you have for me, Auntie! And Merry Christmas to you. Did they say who called them?""I've never heard a teenager, or anyone else, say, ""And Merry Christmas to you,"" as an expression of anger. Dialogue like this hindered the story a lot.So what kind of novel is ""The Never Prayer""? Lena is self-destructive and suffering trauma as well as grief, but really, this is a book about the importance of being kind in a cruel world. There's a lot of plot around the ""drugs"" Lena is carting around in her red purse, as well as a focus on the dangers of gang-like high school cliques. There's a lot of ""let's stop hating each other and work together"" -- and the final action scene involves some drug-dealing almost-rapists with dogs, school lockers full of dynamite, and a demon boy trying to kill everyone. If you enjoy light romance, action scenes, angel stories, and self-destructive main characters, ""The Never Prayer"" could be exactly the book you are looking for. I wanted more of Lena's internal struggles though, and less focus on the high school cliques. The introduction of the demon and angel boys didn't help me learn anything more about Lena's psychology, though the angel boy does explain *why* Lena's parents were shot. But just knowing why something happened isn't a magic pill to allow someone to instantly ""let go"" of their grief. So I struggled with reading ""The Never Prayer"" a lot. For those readers who simply enjoy action stories without much internal growth in their main characters, this novel would be a far more satisfying read. Just keep in mind that the first angel/demon fight doesn't happen until halfway through the novel, and that the story begins with over a hundred pages of tension about where Lena's purse full of drugs is before the novel kicks into high gear with a battle scene. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 27, 2016",Oct 2016,"Sep 14, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13565800-the-never-prayer

But""The Girl Who Drank the Moon"" is middle grade fiction, and I read this fantasy because the cover is GORGEOUS and that image promised great things. But this story isn't really about the young girl on the book cover, or her little dragon friend. While that young girl and the little dragon are certainly characters in this novel, the story follows at least a dozen different people and creatures in an omniscient, head-hopping narrative voice that tries to channel Laini Taylor's prose in ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone"" but never achieves the exquisite force of Taylor's storytelling. Because of the omniscient narrative voice, scene details in ""The Girl Who Drank the Moon"" are repeated over and over through the various point of view characters, without ever changing or advancing the plot. These redundancies felt like hurdles that grew higher and higher the longer I read the book. By the final chapters, the repeated material felt so painful to read, I was amazed I managed to finish this novel.""The Girl Who Drank the Moon"" features a lot of high-level vocabulary, but the presence of so many linking verbs (""was, is, had been, were"") in the narration really dulled the story, and when the author did swap out linking verbs for more interesting ones, the verbs ended up being distracting (count how many times the word ""skittered"" or ""skittering"" is used, for an example of this book's repetitive word choice).The novel is a whopping 388 pages long, and the story didn't justify that length. The plot of this book felt more like 150 pages would've gotten the job done. Due to the head-hopping point of view choices, I never felt invested in any of these characters; the story never felt like it really ""belonged"" to anyone. Except for one character who is ""bad"" because she's suffered grief, and one older man who is simply selfish, every other character in this book is a wonderful human being or creature. These characters don't have goals or desires, but just react to a societal structure that is causing all the hardship in the tale. The lack of agency in this book made the story dull to read. I appreciated that the author pounded home a lot of good morals at the end of the book, centered on love and forgiveness and the pointlessness of punishing one's vanquished enemies. The message at the end of this novel is really strong, if heavy-handed, but young children benefit from that kind of storytelling so I thought that was fine. The author's themes of love and forgiveness at the end of this book are why I give ""The Girl Who Drank the Moon"" three stars. As a piece of escapist fiction though, the repetition, head-hopping, and omniscient narration, combined with an overload of cutesy scenes centered on babies and child-rearing that existed for the sole purpose of cuteness, made me feel like the cover of this novel promised something amazing that the actual story never delivered.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Sep 10, 2016","Sep 15, 2016","Sep 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28110852-the-girl-who-drank-the-moon

What a surprise to me that I couldn't even finish it.I'll leave my original  for this book pasted below. I have some thoughts to share about my reaction, and why I must have enjoyed this book so much when I first read it in 2007.The main character, who only ever calls herself ""Moi"" in the text, is severely anorexic, along with several other female characters named in the story. This condition is slyly introduced, and then features more and more prominently in the story. The novel treats all eating disorders like a joke. Every woman in this book is intent to get married and stay married, and every woman in the story is superficial and obsessed with money. A little less than halfway through the book, Moi tries to commit suicide by overdosing on Advil. A young man named Charlie (Moi's future love interest) finds her unconscious, naked, and with her suicide note lying beside her. Charlie is shocked and tries to help Moi. A few hours later (which is only a couple of sentences later on the page), Moi ditches Charlie for a ""hot guy"" in a restaurant. The wealthy man takes Moi from Paris to Italy without her consent. After a few days of sex with this stranger, Moi no longer wants to kill herself. She returns to New York City and resumes her day-to-day life. That was the point at which I DNF'd. In the years since I first read this book (in 2007), I have read a lot of nonfiction about eating disorders, body image, and feminism. I must be 100% honest and say that I originally found this book so funny because I lacked awareness, and I also lacked empathy. What I originally considered to be ""hyperbole"" and ""satire"" in this novel is actually the stark, brutal truth: the young women Sykes is satirizing in this story really do suffer from severe eating disorders, problems with body image and body acceptance, and internalized misogyny. Moi suffers from severely low self-esteem, and constantly allows men to treat her like garbage. The entire book exists in an echo chamber of the patriarchy. The relentless misogyny on display in the story is embedded in the narrative, unchecked.I'm shocked that I ever found this book so ""hilarious."" I'm definitely not laughing now. A few days ago, I watched an interview Victoria (Plum) Sykes gave about her novel, ""Party Girls Die in Pearls: An Oxford Girl Mystery,"" published in 2017, and I could see for myself that Sykes is very pretty, extremely thin, and glamorously dressed. She attended Oxford in the late 1980s, and states that she never thought of herself as a ""feminist,"" since feminists were demonized at Oxford and in the fashion world of New York City, where Sykes worked after college. It was only after President Trump's election that Sykes began to see herself as a feminist, and began to believe in feminist causes. I realized: ""That explains so, so much about the misogyny embedded in the narrative of her first book.""""Bergdorf Blondes"" is both wish fulfillment for Sykes (a brunette, just like Moi) and a narrative that runs on the societal hatred and condemnation of ""the dumb blonde."" The story relentlessly mocks ""rich girls"" as ""stupid and fake."" The book's moments of satire are completely undercut by the patriarchal cluelessness of the narrative. It's an overall ugly novel, full of romanticized misogyny, classism, and cruel barbs against women. I could really beat myself up over how much this book made me laugh 13 years ago. I could definitely get a ""Shame Attack"" like those that the characters suffer in this story. But reading 147 pages of this novel has already made me suffer enough. I don't feel like I need any more shame, so I'm being honest about my reaction instead.I've cancelled my original 5-star rating for this book. I'm going to leave it unrated. I do not recommend this book. I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone who has suffered from an eating disorder, depression, or struggled with suicide. There are certainly ways to handle these topics with comedic insight and wit. But I don't think ""Bergdorf Blondes"" does it well.This book became more excruciating with each page I turned. I cannot imagine ever reading all the way to the end. My paperback copy is already gone, and I won't be keeping my hardback copy, either. This just isn't a book I want to have in my house.*****Original thoughts on this book:I read this novel in the summer of 2007, and laughed so hard in the airport that I almost missed my flight and tears ran down my eyes. I've never laughed so hard reading a book as I did reading ""Bergdorf Blondes."" I smile every time I think of this novel. I found a first edition hardback today at a Goodwill store in Oregon, in perfect condition. I've always owned this book as a paperback, but now I have it in hardcover too.

After seven months of trying to finish this book: Mission. Accomplished!!The last essay/short story I read in this collection was ""Born on the 9th of July,"" by Patrick Symmes, about a trip he took to South Sudan in 2012. One year before his visit, on July 9, 2011, South Sudan achieved independence from Sudan.This was a fascinating essay: well-written, packed with information, history, interesting people, and travel details, and laced with touches of humor throughout. This essay was a perfect example of the kind of writing I *expect* when I pick up one of these collections to read. ""The Best American Travel Writing: 2014,"" however, is a much more philosophical, historical, and somber collection than others I've read. The first two essays really set the tone for this book: ""Poisoned Land,"" about medical researchers conducting work treating a mysterious kidney-wasting disease in the countries of the former Yugoslavia (an essay which had like, NO travel-adventure details, but a *ton* of medical language and Balkan history); and ""Amigos,"" about impoverished Communist workers in modern-day Cuba, centered on the life of a hardscrabble hairdresser who makes better money as a prostitute. ""Amigos"" was an unrelentingly sad story, and the ending was powerful in its unflinching honesty, a truthfulness that I welcomed and embraced, even though the truth was so utterly depressing that I didn't want to read the book anymore. Things didn't get any better with essay/short story #3, ""Life During Wartime,"" in which the author expresses a lot of existential angst and despair over her lost youth and passion for life, which she last felt while covering the war in Sarajevo as a journalist in the 1990s. This essay featured a lot of brutal history, details involving the war, and the author's hard life spent as a war reporter, and ended on a sad note of helplessness.So many of these essays were great at opening my eyes to parts of the world I don't know much about, but the philosophical and historical tone, overlaid with copious amounts of Grim Reality, did not make me want to visit any of these places, did not inspire any kind of wanderlust within me, and I really, really struggled to finish the book. So why am I giving this 5 stars, rather than 2 or 3? Well, quite simply, for Matthew Power's essay, ""Excuse Us While We Kiss the Sky"" -- a short story of his time spent with ""urban explorers."" People who infiltrate and explore urban locations that should be off-limits to the public: abandoned Tube stations, uncompleted skyscrapers, Cold War nuclear bunkers, a derelict submarine, the catacombs beneath Paris. The writing in this piece was exquisite, the subject material was exhilarating as well as fascinating, and I found myself transported into that rare place of magic in which I enter a piece of writing and never want it to end.The author, Matthew Power, is dead now. The book's Foreward states that this book is dedicated to him, and that he ""died tragically in March of this year [2014] while on assignment in Uganda, reporting on an explorer walking the length of the Nile. Matt was 39, [...] and he was a true adventurer and seeker of truth [...]"" Matthew Power's essay was not the only one I enjoyed. I mentioned ""Born on the 9th of July"" as a favorite, and I also loved ""Dream Acres,"" about a young man who bought a filthy, broken-down shack in Alaska with his friends, and then took his girlfriend to visit. ""The Last of Eden,"" about the few remaining tribes in what is left of the rain forests of Brazil, was highly informative and interesting, even though it was also super-depressing. I really enjoyed the history in ""Birthplace of the American Vacation,"" about the inspiration behind the ""great camps"" around Sagamore Lake in Adirondack Park, and how people are trying to save and restore these camps now, after so many of these gorgeous places have been destroyed. (Okay, I admit: this essay DID make me want to travel to Adirondack Park and book a vacation at one of these antique ""camps."" I stand corrected.)And the long essay, ""460 Days,"" a condensed account of the book Amanda Lindhout wrote about being kidnapped and imprisoned by terrorists in Somalia in 2008 -- this was also an extremely memorable piece of literature. Not because it makes anyone want to travel to Somalia, but because it was utterly horrifying and searing to read. This is a book I plan to keep on my shelf, because the essays I loved really spoke to me, enough that I will want to go back and reread them. There is a lot of brilliant, exciting, and heartfelt writing packed into this collection. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys well-written prose and wants to expand their horizons, learn more about under-discussed places in the world, and find new sparks of creativity in their own life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 25, 2016","Feb 09, 2017","Jul 25, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20256713-the-best-american-travel-writing-2014

The author is a woman on a journey of self-discovery, which she documents over a few years spent in sThis memoir is quite long, and rather ponderous. The author is a woman on a journey of self-discovery, which she documents over a few years spent in southeastern Utah. Ms. Irvine gives the reader a lot of general history about Utah -- especially the Mormon settlement of the West and the Ancestral Puebloans and other ancient Native American tribes. Far more interesting to me were the smaller sections of information the author shared about the Native Americans who inhabited the land right before European immigrants forced the surviving tribes onto reservations.Since I grew up in southwest Colorado, and live there as an adult, this is all territory and history I'm really familiar with, and I found myself pretty bored reading most of the long general history summaries loaded into this book. That information felt like reading a high school text on general Western history. For readers who've never read about these topics, and have never been exposed to great books like ""Desert Solitaire"" or ""Under the Banner of Heaven,"" the long history sections in ""Trespass: Living at the Edge of the Promised Land"" might be more interesting. During the rare moments and scenes in which Ms. Irvine focused on her own life, I wanted so much more -- I wanted the author to delve deeper into the problems and pain that drove her to live in a more isolated part of the state of Utah than where she'd grown up (in Salt Lake City). I wasn't interested in reading about the general problem of not fitting in, which so many of us suffer from -- I wanted the author to detail more of her personal life, rather than keeping the focus on what ""typical Mormons"" think and act like. But on the most bracing subjects to read -- such as the topic of child abuse, and how abusive the author's stepfather was -- the reader gets only one glancing sentence, near the end of the book. Likewise, the subjects of adultery and giving birth to a stillborn child are also heart-wrenching and gripping, but the author mentions these pieces of her life with swift, light sentences that don't dig into pain so much as skim over it, leaving the reader to assume a depth of feeling that I never felt resonate. The final conclusions of the book were deductions I came to in the first half of the book -- namely, that the author had grown up in a community she couldn't emulate, and in her search for freedom, and her desire to embrace her authentic self, she struggled to find not only an accurate role model, but a community of like-minded souls who would accept her and support her as one of their own.In the end, the author's life is given purpose and connection after she delivers a living child and becomes a mother, followed by a move to southwest Colorado. This biology-is-destiny ending seemed to sidestep the author's agony by simply shunting her pain aside in the face of the onslaught of parenting duties. It made me wish the author had ended the book before the birth of her living child. For so many people, it's easy to find Meaning in life after the act of procreation, and the author didn't begin the memoir by hungering to have a child. Based on the opening chapters, I thought I was being set up for a different kind of journey, but this author's search for identity returned her to the gender roles she'd found so stifling while growing up -- in the act of bearing children, forgiving her adulterous mate, and letting her husband provide for her (building their house, working outside the home, providing for their food and material needs) while she saw to the duties of breastfeeding and childcare. Ms. Irvine's journey of self-discovery ends with the life-affirming gift of motherhood lighting her way, and suggests that her embrace of gender roles is more enlightened because she lived with psychological chaos and a hormonal deficiency for so long before bearing a child and finding her purpose/meaning/spiritual self in life. Enduring the emotional hardship before finding Meaning in motherhood and a sense of authentic belonging in Colorado is the purpose of Ms. Irvine's memoir. My favorite scene occurred when a Utah cowboy found himself clashing, and then flirting with Ms. Irvine in a Laundromat, which was followed by some really great information about the Paiute -- the history of their tribe and their current reservation status. Long after those pages, by the time I arrived at the moment Ms. Irvine learned her first child no longer had a heartbeat in utero -- a revelation that was skimmed over the same way many other important moments were skimmed over -- I felt really let down by the book. Instead of being able to truly embody those scenes, I felt like I was reading a journal. Which had to have been what the author intended, but I wanted something else. Something more like the scenes I experienced when reading ""Into Thin Air"" or ""Wild"" -- I wanted to experience the horror and pain of the journey, but what I felt instead were cerebral brushstrokes of moments, a light sketch of a personal history, rather than a full embodiment of a life.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves memoir, history, and Western culture, as well as to anyone who might be considering moving to Utah.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 14, 2016","Jul 21, 2016","Jul 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2303179.Trespass

Written as a letter to the author's fifteen-year-old son, Samori, Ta-Nehisi Coates has penned a masterpiece. I've read the book twice this year, the second time today, and the prose is even richer, deeper, and more powerful as I absorbed the words again.Pain and terror radiate through this narrative with a heat like the sun, burning through American history, shining its harsh light on racism, on the price paid for the cruelty embedded in hierarchy, all framed within a letter to a black child who is not -- and never will be -- safe.The author uses the language of women's studies -- specifically, the academic discourse used to discuss the rape, assault, and exploitation of women's bodies within hierarchical systems that denote the female body as lesser -- to illuminate the effects of racism upon black bodies in the United States. The result is this elegant, honest, poetic, and riveting book. Mr. Coates expresses regret and despair, rage and fear, pride and hope, at the state of his life and his history, his heritage, his future. He writes with great feeling of his hopes for Samori, ""I would have you be a conscious citizen in this terrible and beautiful world.""

And her capacity to love all of life -- life in all of its ugliness and its magnificent glory -- illuminates every page of this book.My favorite lines appeared on page 387, the final lines of the short story ""Wait a Minute,"" in which the narrator is longing for her dead sister. These are some of the most perfect, heartbreaking, and gorgeous sentences I have ever read in my life:""You last arrived a few days after the blizzard. Ice and snow still covered the ground, but we had a fluke of a warm day. Squirrels and magpies were chattering and sparrows and finches sang on the bare trees. I opened all the doors and curtains. I drank tea at the kitchen table feeling the sun on my back. Wasps came out of the nest on the front porch, floated sleepily through my house, buzzing in drowsy circles all around the kitchen. Just at this time the smoke alarm battery went dead, so it began to chirp like a summer cricket. The sun touched the teapot and the flour jar, the silver vase of stock.A lazy illumination, like a Mexican afternoon in your room. I could see the sun in your face.""By the time I reach that last sentence, every time, I feel tears in my eyes.

I read ""When Breath Becomes Air"" shortly after the book was published, as a result of the incredible amount of hype and buzz surrounding this memoir. The prose is perfect, the material is moving, as any story about dying of cancer is bound to be moving. When I finished, I thought I would give the book 4 stars, but so little of this memoir has stayed with me in the months since I read it, I think 3.5 stars is more appropriate. The most heartbreaking section of this book is the last part, after the author has died and his wife picks up the pen to tie up the loose ends. I give a full 5 stars to her finale. Her words burned into my heart. Why didn't I find this book more compelling than I did? Well, the answer is simple. This is death by cancer made clean, and I'm used to cancer as horror, an unrelenting torture leading to an awful demise. Mr. Kalanithi had access to finances, family assistance, and the most cutting-edge medical care, and so the ugliness involved in this memoir is in the fact that the author's cancer is terminal, and treating cancer remains agony. I would never tell anyone not to read this book, as Mr. Kalanithi is a gifted writer. But for me, the most gripping piece I've ever read on the process of dying of cancer remains an essay published in Esquire, on May 10, 2015, titled ""The Friend: Love Is Not a Big Enough Word,"" by Matthew Teague. That essay is one of the most gut-wrenching and horrifically beautiful things I've ever read in my life. I've returned to that essay again and again, to absorb the prose and the story. Mr. Teague's writing continues to haunt me profoundly. ""When Breath Becomes Air"" was a much easier tale of the sadness and cruelty of dying of cancer, when the painkillers rob you of so much of your life, but the desire to live doesn't lessen. I have held the hands of many loved ones as they've died of cancer, and over and over, reading this book, I often envied how much easier Mr. Kalanithi's situation was, for himself and for his family, as his body shut down over many long months, and he faced his end in the best way possible -- with the finances to pay for treatment, stellar medical care, and so many loved ones all pulling together to make the situation the best it could be.I wish that everyone could have the money, treatment, and emotional support that Mr. Kalanithi was blessed with. I suppose that was why this book is most needed today -- a lot of people *are* this well taken care of as they die, and this memoir is more reflective of those blessed with so much good fortune.I'm glad Mr. Kalanithi penned his memoir before dying, as he was dying, and I'm glad that so many people have fallen in love with this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Jun 11, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air

A sensitive guy. A nice guy. He loved his wife, before she died in the pandemic. He used to write poetry. Hig has a dog named Jasper, and Hig loves his dog. Sometimes he visits ""the families,"" some sick survivors with children who live kind of close to him. The families fly a special flag to make sure everyone knows they have the blood disease, a lethal infection that spread after the pandemic.Hig and Bangley never fly a blood disease flag to keep people off their property. Oh no. That's not their style. They actually use solar-powered light to lure in other surviving humans at night, sometimes men with young kids in tow, and then Hig and Bangley gun them down, kids and all. Easy as killing ""fish in a barrel,"" or ""whatever other hapless metaphor for the hapless soon to be dead,"" Hig says in narration (page 41). Hig is sad that the trout and the elk have also died out due to some kind of disease. Another reason he is a nice guy: Hig loved to fish for trout, but now that they're gone, he's reduced to fishing for less savory species of freshwater fish, and he can only shoot deer, not elk anymore. Poor Hig.Hig lives in a hangar where he keeps his 1956 Cessna, which he uses to fly patrols of the large spread where he lives with Bangley. They have a clean, constant source of water, plenty of food, an excellent garden, and a super-fantastic arsenal for killing folks on the reg. Bangley lives in what Hig calls an abandoned McMansion that's still decorated with the former owner's possessions. Even though Hig makes it clear that the coyotes and raptors and wolves have plenty to eat -- meaning prairie dog, rabbit, squirrel, and the like -- Hig doesn't hunt small game to cook up for his dog. No, Hig feeds Jasper human flesh. Hig explains his rendering process simply enough on page 47 --""This is what I do, have done: I strip off haunches arms breast buttock calves. Slice it thin soak in salt brine and dry to jerky for Jasper for the days between. You remember the story of the rugby team in the Andes. The corpses were corpses already dead. They did it to survive. I am no different. I do it for him [Jasper]. I eat venison, bottom fish, rabbit, shiners. I keep his jerky in airtight buckets. He likes it best of all his food I'm sure because of the salt. Tomorrow I will do it again but not the boy [a dead nine-year-old who's been shot fish-in-a-barrel style], I'll bury him not with any tenderness or regret just in one piece with his hawk feather.""The idea that anyone can justify feeding their dog ""human jerky"" when they have plenty of bullets, hunting gear, and there is plenty of wild game around, fills me with such a deep and abiding rage. This argument Hig makes that what he is doing is ""no different"" from the rugby team that crashed in the Andes is such complete and utter bullshit. Those rugby players had NO WAY to collect other food, and they were TRAPPED on a FROZEN MOUNTAINSIDE. They also didn't cook up or brine the flesh of the dead -- they cut careful pieces off, with the utmost respect, and they prayed and wept and agonized over what they were doing, the price they paid to survive. They didn't treat their fellow humans as meat, but as the bodies they had to take from to live. They prayed to those bodies in gratitude, gave thanks to those who had died so that they might be saved. But here is Hig, reducing those empathetic people, who were trapped on the frozen side of a mountain, to his own sub-human state. Hig is cruel and has lost his humanity, even though he keeps proclaiming he loved his wife and he loves his dog. But the facts are the facts: Hig lives in Denver, with a big garden and easy access to the Rocky Mountains, and it is NOT winter but late spring and summertime during this novel. No one is freezing to death, food is abundant, and Hig and Bangley have survived together successfully for nine years. They have guns, ammunition, plenty of water and plenty of food, and they are damn well not sharing that with anyone. Well, unless Hig wants to try to prove that he's really a good guy again. Then he'll fly his Cessna over to the families and drop off a few meager supplies or fix something for them, so the dying women and children can swirl around him and worship him as a hero. Hig needs people to know he's a hero. He's always been an avid hunter only now he kills people, and since he was once a poet that means he is really better than Bangley, because poetry. I guess poetry is shorthand for ""having a heart.""But in case the reader starts to worry Hig's love of poetry might make him too soft, never fear. Hig gets in a fight with three men over some cases of Coke (the carbonated beverage) left in a truck, and after Hig shoots one man, Hig tells the two men still alive, ""What you're gonna do is drag your buddy to the ditch and not say a word, not one fucking word while my dog has dinner."" (page 86)That's right -- Hig wants these two men to watch their friend be eaten by Jasper. Like a scene right out of a film about drug gangs, such as in the (exquisite) movie ""Sin Nombre."" Except in ""Sin Nombre,"" the BAD GUYS feed people to dogs, not the hero. To treat a human being as dog meat is to know that there are true monsters present, fiends who have lost their humanity. But in ""The Dog Stars,"" Big Hig is the hero of the story, the good guy who gets a happy ending, and he is the one feeding people to his dog. The book is at least better-researched than some of the other postapoca-lit on the market. Hig understands that car fuel degrades rather quickly. ""Plenty of gas still out in the world but problem is the auto gas went stale and bad a year or two after. 100 low lead, which I burn, is stable something like ten years. So I expect to lose it one of these days. I can add PRI and nurse it along for ten more years probably. Then I'll have to look for jet fuel which is kerosene and lasts for basically ever."" (page 74)Passages like that made this book far more palatable to me than other dystopian postapoca-lit tales I have read, in which the authors don't bother to figure out any of the details a complete breakdown of society would entail.Because I finished reading ""The Dog Stars"" to the end, I do know that a character Hig meets much later in the book, a man he calls Gramps and Pops, finally calls Hig on his bullshit, his whiny sense of being a good guy who is sensitive and heroic, despite all the people he's fed to his dog. ""I suggest you shrug out of your pissant self-righteousness,"" Pops tells Hig (page 206). I put the book down to clap and say, ""Here, here!"" in approval, and I wished Pops had gone on for several pages, or even continued with a screed for the rest of the book (which was 320 pages long). Then my feelings toward Hig as a reader would have been honored. The one good thing that Hig does in this novel comes near the end, when he saves Bangley's life. Bangley and Pops were the only characters I liked in this book, and I was glad that Hig was there to help Bangley when Bangley needed him most. When Hig actually did something useful, and saved someone's life, my hatred softened for a few pages. Then the story passed by that moment and I had to force myself to keep reading again.The one female character, a woman around Hig's age named Cima, I gave up trying to like on page 240, when she starts describing how she got into Dartmouth as a teenager, and no longer sounded like a real person at all, but like an even more pretentious version of Hig. Cima speaks in such long, long paragraphs in that scene, not one of them believable as authentic speech. Acknowledging her position as the sole student from her high school going to Dartmouth, Cima tells Hig, ""I could already feel the envy. Like a wind. By the end of the day I wasn't sure if any of this was a curse or a blessing."" Upon seeing the guidance counselor, Cima adds, ""He was completely bald. I thought his head was the shape of an egg. I remember seeing tiny beads of sweat on the mottled pink dome of it as if it were he on the hot seat."" If you think tough survivalist ranch women tell stories of their lives that include phrases like, ""tiny beads of sweat on the mottled pink dome of it,"" let me assure you I've grown up doing ranch work with college-educated ranchers and not one of them ever uttered a sentence like that. What makes for great internal monologue does not make for believable dialogue, and that was the case with Cima in ""The Dog Stars."" I didn't believe she was a real person after she started to talk in bookish author-ese. In the end, I only have two major thoughts to share on this novel. The first is that I've grown extremely weary of authors who assume surviving an apocalypse means becoming a monster that can turn human beings into jerky to feed to your pets. While I understand stories are more exciting when the protagonist has to confront a malevolent Other, and there is no greater malevolent Other than a person, the truth is, the strength of humanity is that we've evolved to survive in groups. And whenever the shit hits the fan, people band together in strong groups to survive, to protect their children, because humanity has a powerful, altruistic and completely empathetic desire to keep our children alive. Do I believe that some people remain outside those groups, either to mindlessly murder for what they want or to simply be left alone? Sure, absolutely. But the constant portrayal of the end times as solely the domain of a bunch of murdering psychopaths simply doesn't ring true to me. Good people will survive along with the bad, and the good ones always act to protect the young, the defenseless, as well as their hearts and their souls.My other thought on this book is that a lot of authors create avatars of themselves on the page, a character with a voice that is strongly the author's voice, an embodiment of the author in a fictional setting and/or a fictional situation. In ""The Dog Stars,"" Big Hig had many, many similarities with the author, Peter Heller, enough that I would call Hig an avatar of the writer.If there is a ""character type"" to Hig it belongs to a lot of men I've encountered who move ""out West"" as teens and adults -- East Coast guys, Southern guys, Midwestern guys -- who grow up idolizing the work of Ernest Hemingway and other writers of that sort. These men discover they yearn to be mountain men so they can possess a kind of rancher/miner/native westerner authenticity. So these college kids and adults arrive in the Rockies and start to chase that Hemingway Self, that thing they want to embody so badly as a birthright, except they weren't born to the mountains, and they know that and everyone else knows that, but they still want to ""pass"" as authentic. I live in Colorado, the state that provides the setting for ""The Dog Stars,"" and I see these kinds of men everywhere, every day. Some men can accomplish the feat, and blend in as native. Many cannot. Even though Hig occupies a dystopian future, a postapocalyptic future, he is a man who yearns for authenticity, to be known as a true Rocky Mountain man, a native. But to me, Bangley was the only character who felt authentic. Bangley wasn't turning anyone's corpse into dog food. I honestly don't know any ""real mountain man"" who would do such a thing when food is plentiful. In Hig's situation, those men would hunt the small game and keep their dog fed that way. Because a person is a person is a person. Even if the dead was an enemy while alive, that's still the body of a human being. And even the most simple rancher knows you bury the dead to help ward off the spread of disease, even if there isn't a pandemic involved, it's just common sense. While I wasn't a fan of ""The Dog Stars"" because of Hig's behavior coupled with his false sense of self-righteousness, a lot of other readers adore this novel, and it's currently being turned into a film. So if you love ""lone voice in the wilderness"" stories that star heroic men doing good deeds, I'm sure you would love ""The Dog Stars."" Most readers had no problem with Hig turning corpses into jerky for his dog, and I'm curious if the movie will show that or not. I'm guessing not, but I'm definitely still curious. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 11, 2016","Jun 20, 2016","May 31, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13330761-the-dog-stars

The story is loaded with darkness and violence, mental manipulation and death. If you enjoy the 1953 Disney animated film ""Peter Pan"" but would have preferred the addition of bloodshed, terrifying magic, and a Tinkerbell who was being beaten into submission by Peter Pan, then this is the novel for you. The setting of ""Wendy Darling"" is the novel's greatest strength, as the author is adept at writing interesting description that engages the senses and makes the background vivid and imaginative. A minus is the repetitiveness of the prose. The most repeated word of this novel is ""curled"" (or its frequently employed opposite,""uncurled"") -- which appears on almost every page, and sometimes multiple times per page. Things are constantly curling in this book -- fingers, lips, arms, bodies, magic -- and I wish the author had realized there are other verbs to make use of for her visuals.If you wanted to play a drinking game with this book, take a shot for every time something ""curls,"" or how many times Peter Pan displays a ""naughty grin,"" or how often the fairy magic is described with ""white heat,"" and you'll have yourself in an alcohol coma by page 90. By the time you finish all 312 pages, assuming you survive the ensuing comas, you'll have permanent liver damage, and the great mother of all hangovers.Speaking of mothers -- like Lord of the Flies, the assumption that femininity (in its Victorian England form, wherein the goal of being ""a good mother"" is the supreme purpose in life of all females) -- the assumption that femininity is a driving force behind civilization and order is definitely an underlying theme of this novel, as it was in the original version of ""Peter Pan,"" by J.M. Barrie. Wendy Darling, as the sole human female addition to Peter's tribe of Lost Boys, longs for manners, rules, and an ordered society. The Lost Boys and Peter Pan long to be nurtured and cared for, enveloped in unconditional love by the Platonic ideal of a mother figure. Academics have analyzed the finer points of ""Peter Pan"" for decades. For me, it's enough to know that this story is loaded in gender roles, heavily weighted in the unconscious assumptions of the modern world as well as Victorian England, and ""Wendy Darling"" isn't trying to mess with those gender roles or unconscious assumptions one iota. This is a story that portrays the character Wendy the same way she appeared in the 1953 Disney film, meek and mousy and wholeheartedly embracing her place in the world, dresses and manners and all. Unlike the cartoon, in this novel, Wendy's brother John is cruel to her, her mother and father are equally unlikeable, her five-year-old brother Michael is daffy and sweet, and she is in love with a poor bookseller's son named Booth, a love that -- due to their different socioeconomic classes -- is forbidden.The night that Wendy determines to run away from her family for a secret meeting with Booth, to discuss with him the possibility of choosing a penniless, ostracized life with Booth over the dictates of her social position -- is the same night Peter Pan first appears. Before Wendy can sneak out, the window in the nursery erupts with loud slamming sounds, then the glass melts, then explodes, in a terrifying light show full of noise. Peter Pan appears moments later, right after the Darling children finish screaming in terror. It's pretty clear to the reader that Peter is some kind of fairy himself, flying around as he does, and that he starts to mind-whammy the children with his magic right away, since Wendy is quickly overcome with insta-lust for Peter, and the fear of the moment vanishes, not only for Wendy, but for John and Michael as well.Then Wendy seems to forget all about Booth, and her plan to run off to see him, because her thoughts fill with Peter Pan, and going off to Neverland with him. Within minutes, all three Darling children are flying with Peter into the stars, and the novel reads very much like viewing the 1953 film, only things are scarier here and the characters aren't as endearing. Peter is menacing, John is a tool, Wendy is a poor little mouse who only longs to be ""a good girl,"" and Michael is present to humanize everyone by being a child. Need to sympathize with a main character? Give them a small child to look after. Supposedly, instant feels. That was how I viewed Michael, as a cog in a wheel to turn the strings on my heart. It didn't work though, and felt as manipulative as Peter Pan's mind-whammy magic on Wendy and everyone else in Neverland.I carefully read the first 190 pages of this book. The description of Pan Island and the world of Neverland were the highlights of this novel. Unfortunately, because the story is told through Wendy's point of view, and Wendy is dense, she spends almost the entire book in a mental haze, unable to realize that Peter has used his magic to make her forget where she came from, that she was in love with Booth, that she has a family and a home to return to. To me, Wendy's cluelessness got old, her naive thinking and her unrelenting state of being a simpleton made the story drag, and I reached a point that I couldn't put up with her anymore. So I had to start skimming at page 190, I was just fed up with Peter's constant ""naughty"" grins and the many, many kissing scenes. If you want a novel with a plot that is primarily driven by romance -- a love story that features a bad boy who is *definitely* bad -- this is the story for you.While Wendy does have a moment when she finally ""wakes up"" and tries to escape, she is so silly and dense that of course her plan is ill-conceived and doomed from the start. The author frequently employs ALL CAPS in her dialogue, and by the end of this book, there is a *lot* of dialogue written in ALL CAPS. Lots of screaming and mayhem. I was very much unengaged. I read this novel because many ers on Goodreads were outraged by Peter Pan being portrayed as ""a rapist"" and I wanted to see for myself what the author had written. With Wendy, Peter is in control of himself sexually. With Tink though, the human-sized Tinkerbell fairy who feels worshipful love for Peter Pan -- I think Peter probably rapes her -- though that is conjecture, as the reader isn't witness to everything that happens to Tink. In this novel, Tink longs for romantic love from Peter, and she is the character who suffers the greatest amount -- emotionally as well as physically -- throughout the book. Tink's physical and emotional brutalization is described in great detail, and it is a horror to witness. Even though I was skimming by that point, I took in each violent bruise and cut on Tink's body -- put there by Peter Pan in a rage -- with true revulsion. The reason I think Peter probably raped Tink as well as brutally beat her has to do with the fact that Wendy told Peter ""no"" to his sexual advances, Peter listened and left her alone -- and because Peter is such a violent rager, I'm sure he went back to Tink's house (the site of his almost-sex-scene with Wendy -- talk about a guy who knows how to emotionally abuse a woman, as well as threaten to kill her and the people she loves) and I think Peter had Tink give him what he wanted instead of Wendy. Since Peter had recently beaten Tink, enjoying a sexual encounter with Peter would not have been possible, just for her physical discomfort alone. While reading this book, I found myself wishing that the dialogue and the characters didn't remind me so much of the 1953 Disney film. I wished that this retelling had been bolder, that Peter Pan had been female, and the character of Wendy had been the male protagonist. I wished that Pan Island could've been inhabited by a kickass tribe of Lost Girls. That people in the story could have been badasses with heart, people I could care deeply about, instead of tools who treated each other like garbage. Worse than garbage. (Although the generals Oxley and Abbott have some standout moments, so I make allowances for them. I liked both of these characters. I wished they'd had bigger roles in the book.) Wendy Darling herself is such a meek little mouse. The author gives her a character arc by the end, and the reader witnesses Wendy finally take action to protect herself, but I was just so tired of Wendy by then. Tired of her, and tired of the incessant violence of this world. I am a reader who loves violence and darkness, bloodshed and horror. But in this case, the reader could see that Peter was using mind-whammy magic on Wendy, and the story dragged out her ""awakening"" to his manipulation far too long. Wendy goes from being in a complete fugue induced by Peter's magic to reclaiming herself in one short scene late in the book, and I wish the author had pieced that out more, and given me more of that, sooner. Show me a fighting Wendy, and I would've stayed engaged. The constant submissiveness and meekness was too much. For readers who found themselves hooked by ""Wendy Darling: Volume One: Stars,"" I'm sure that watching Wendy transform into a badass will be the biggest payoff of the next two books in this trilogy. I certainly hope that Wendy becomes the true kickass heroine she needs to be in order to escape this Nightmare Hell of Neverland and return home to London to her beloved Booth, with her brothers safely in tow. Given how faithfully this retelling adheres to the original themes of ""Peter Pan,"" I'm sure a happy ending will be in order. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 25, 2016","May 26, 2016","May 25, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25175898-stars

Of my paperback copy, which has a total of 375 pages, the first 136 pages are EXCELLENT. The main character, Cannie Shapiro, has a unique, entertaining life. Her voice is easy to read and distinct. And her estranged relationship with her father was especially well-written and made for superb, brutal reading. On page 136, however, Cannie meets a famous movie star, and they instantly become Best Friends Forever -- Like For REALS. And the novel veers into a complete fantasy land for almost 200 pages. This movie star is a fairy godmother figure, and she waves a lot of wands, money practically rains from the sky, Cannie suddenly gets All The Nice Things, and this section of the book -- the longest by far -- was not only unbelievable but seriously lacking in tension. I almost gave up on the book. But I pushed through past page 300, finally arrived at page 303, and the story picked up again. The final 72 pages were worth the struggle. Cannie has a dream on page 314, right after a tragic accident, with an image that made me cry. The sentences were *perfect* and this was my favorite page of the book.I debated listing this novel as a 3 or 4-star read, and decided on 4 full stars because I love Cannie's final message to the reader. Her journey of growth is excellent and I cheered for her. The lagging middle frustrated me though, and dropped into 2-star territory. I also felt deeply aggravated that Cannie qualifies as ""a larger woman"" or a ""plus-size woman"" even though she has a height of five-ten and is a size 16. Sorry, but for all the hype this novel receives due to Cannie's size, I wanted her to be an *actual* plus-size, and size 16 doesn't qualify. I also didn't appreciate the homophobia/anti-lesbian sentiments Cannie expresses in this story. She says some *really* harsh things about her mother's lover Tanya, burns Tanya's homemade Christmas gifts in the fireplace, and calls her ""the Dread Lesbian Tanya"" even near the end of the book (page 303). Was Tanya dreadful? No, absolutely not. I liked Tanya a lot. She was sweet, spunky, unique, and she loved Cannie's mother passionately, a woman who had been treated like absolute garbage by her husband for many, many years. Cannie's thoughts and behavior toward Tanya were cruel and completely undeserved, and Cannie's constant undercurrent of abhorrence for her mother's later-in-life turn to lesbianism really grated on me. That said, Cannie's powerful emotions were still authentic and true to her character, from her acculturated sense of fat-shaming her size-16 body, her jealousy and hatred of ""skinny"" women, her biting wit when she turned her own critical eye on society, and her scorching, self-destructive rage in the final section of the book. Cannie is not a perfect person, or a perfect main character. She is deeply flawed and possesses some really unlikeable traits. But she reads as a true person, warts and all. While I could've done without the rich movie star and the long trip to Hollywood in the novel, the beginning and ending were realistic and gripping. And in the end, Cannie's dream on page 314 made it impossible for me to give this novel anything less than 4 stars. I was so moved by that moment because I was embedded in Cannie's life, I sympathized with her, and that dream smashed my heart. In all the best ways, this book is full of good writing and good moments and a quality message, and the standout scenes made me want to say, ""Bravo!"" despite the issues I had with other parts of the story. I'm glad I finally read ""Good in Bed"" -- I can understand why my friends love this book so much, and why this novel launched Jennifer Weiner's fabulous career....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 20, 2016","May 29, 2016","May 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14748.Good_in_Bed

Winner of the National Book Award in 2002, this story is primarily focused on a young gay man named Fenno, who falls in love with a man who is dying of AIDS. This love story is so deeply nuanced, so subtle and absorbing, I found myself awed and humbled, both by the skill of the prose as well as the depth of feeling and character displayed by everyone in this exquisite novel.The book is divided into three parts. The first section, ""Collies: 1989"" is told from Fenno's father's point of view. The second section, ""Upright: 1995"" is told from Fenno's point of view, and is the longest. This section was extraordinarily brilliant, just took my breath away and made for compulsive reading.The third section, ""Boys: 1999"" is told from a female's point of view, a young woman named Fern. Fern appears in the first section of the novel, makes a brief and unnamed appearance in the middle section, but when I arrived on page 269 of the paperback, and discovered she would narrate the rest of the book, I felt angry. Profoundly disappointed. Maybe even betrayed. By the time Fern reappears in the last section of the book, she is pregnant, and dealing with the drama of telling the father of the child that he will be having a child. As a reader, I understand why this theme of Fern and her baby-drama ties into the rest of the book. I just didn't care for reading about Fern. Compared to the other narrators, Fern seemed so unexciting. Not as intelligent, not as witty or profound. Too weak and ineffectual to deliver the fireworks I'd come to expect. I tried to force myself to read her section several times. I read many pages closely, and skimmed the entire section twice, trying to force myself to become engaged with the novel again. I tried to force myself to accept that Fern's point of view was worthy to end the story. It is a massive reader failure that I could not embrace Fern's voice. I didn't want her to finish the story. I wanted Fenno to narrate the rest of the tale. Because I was addicted to Fenno, I'd fallen in love with him, and I didn't want to leave him. Fenno appears in Fern's final section. The reader can see his loose ends tied together, the answers to questions the reader might still have. (Unless the reader has already guessed the outcomes, as I did. This is not a novel with ""a plot."" This is a novel about family and love and the ordinary brutalities of life -- so the reader can guess ""plot points"" because that's not the intent of this tale, the story is so much deeper than that, so much better than that.)My apologies to author Julia Glass that I couldn't engage with Fern. I just didn't find her worthy of following Fenno's heart-wrenching, perfect voice. Fenno is a hard act to follow. Would anyone have been worthy of following Fenno? David, I think. Fenno's older brother. I wish I'd gone into his head for the final section. David would have provided the closing details about Fenno's life that Fern supplies in her section. Another part of my problem in accepting Fern's section is that I never really liked Tony, either -- Fenno's haphazard lover. When section three starts off with Fern and Tony together -- my brain felt this shift in POV like a violence within me. I felt so despairing, with a crushing sense of loss that not even Fenno's appearance on the page again could assuage. I just wanted to climb back into Fenno's point of view, and stay there, forever. My reader failing aside, this is an EXCELLENT book. Fenno made me feel All The Feels. This was a love story unlike any I've ever read before, and probably ever will again. If you love beautiful prose, and characters drawn with such terrific depth that you live in their hearts, you should read ""Three Junes."" This is a magnificent read.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 02, 2016","May 23, 2016","May 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/227593.Three_Junes

I needed to read past 150 pages before “Deep Blue” offered me something that held my interest.The plot of the novel is all over the place. The story opens like the Disney animated film “The Little Mermaid,” with a pretty teen princess preparing for a magical singing ceremony, betrothed to a handsome mer-prince and complaining about her spoiled life. Unlike so many other mer novels, this story is actually set in the sea, and the author sprinkles the story with interesting ocean life, which I liked. There is a *lot* of backstory and world-building history dumped into the first forty pages. The opening pages of the novel were especially rough, loaded with geo-political plot information delivered with pun-loaded prose. The writing level was much more attuned to middle-grade fiction than YA, and set a very lighthearted and silly tone for a novel that actually delves into some darkness. The main plot of the book follows the mer princess Serafina as she escapes a group of killers, teams up with five other powerful mermaids, and creates a magical fighting force to counter the destructive power of a mythical monster.One of my problems with the book was the jarring mash-up between scary moments and the pun-laden goofball humor. And it was frustrating how long the book spent on the silly, trope-laden (and overall pointless) storylines that made the beginning read like a retelling of “The Little Mermaid” on pun steroids. I really didn’t bond with, or care for, the uber-bland Serafina, or her best “merlfriend” Neela, the traditional chatty/annoying/slightly-manic female sidekick to the heroine. Neela is also a point of view character at random moments throughout the book—and there are plenty of head-hopping point-of-view scenes, which dragged the writing quality down as much as the constant puns did. My interest did pick up on page 34 for a hot second when the mean “merl” (girl) Lucia was described: “Lucia, with her sapphire eyes, her silver scales, her night-blue hair swept up off her shoulders.” That sentence was gorgeous—free of puns, and free of that frustrating pronoun “it” which the author loved to use. But Lucia appears only briefly in the book, and is then dropped from the story completely. Her presence was only required to solidify another “mean girl at the palace” trope, and served no other purpose in the story.What I loved about the book were the brief moments when freshwater mermaids were described. These mermaids appear in the story long after Serafina and Neela have set off on their quest, once they start encountering other “merls” (mer girls) to help them.Take this paragraph, on page 220 – this was the moment the book started to pay me back for all the time I’d spent reading—“Neela looked up. A freshwater mermaid floated nearby, brandishing a hockey stick. She was dark gray with beige stripes and spots. A spiky fin ran down her back. She wore dangly earrings made out of bottle caps and a necklace the likes of which Neela had never seen before. All sorts of goggish [human] things dangled from it: a doll’s head, a pacifier, a bottle opener, a lighter, a small flashlight, and a golf ball. Her hair, bound into two hippokamp [pony] tails that stuck up on either side of her head, was dyed an alarming shade of red. Her mouth was painted a matching shade. She hadn’t exactly colored inside the lines.” WIN. That paragraph was like a big pat on the back for me as a reader, a moment when the author seemed to say, “How about that, tiger—is that a nice payoff, or what?” Yeah, it was. That freshwater mermaid’s name is Lena, and she was absolutely my favorite character in the book. Lena is only featured in one scene, helping Serafina and Neela evade capture, but the passage was memorable and excellent and my favorite part of the novel. A few pages later, Serafina and Neela and another merl named Ling disguise themselves as “swashbucklers” to continue their quest. The princess girls put on costumes and dye their hair to resemble the uber-badass and catfish-loving Lena. Watching Neela transform Serafina into a swashbuckler (page 236) was another huge win: “[Neela] handed Serafina a long, clingy gray dress. She’d cut the arms off it and slashed the neckline. A loosely-knit black tunic went over it. Neela looped bicycle chains around Serafina’s hips and slid Grigio’s dagger through them. She put silver hoops in Sera’s ears. Next, she outlined Sera’s eyes and stained her lips with more black squid ink. Her cheeks got a silvery dusting of ground abalone shell. ‘You look so riptide, I don’t recognize you,’ Neela said, when she’d finished.”Serafina reflects on her new appearance as well (page 238): “For the first time in her life, she didn’t look like royalty. She looked fierce, edgy, and troublesome. A merl not to be messed with. And she liked it.”SO AWESOME.I wish this badass transformation had come *much* sooner in the book. Because Wow was it great and appeared long past the point I’d normally have given up reading.The story continues on for another hundred pages, as Serafina and her two friends meet the other three merls that compose their team of six. The introduction of these additional three merls felt very rushed and scattershot, and not nearly as satisfying as reading about Lena. These merls were all interesting characters, but their descriptions were minimal—maybe because the author knew she ought to be delivering more plot by the end of a novel, not introducing new characters every other page. But that is really the heart of “Deep Blue”—sooooo many characters, and new characters are even introduced and described in the final few chapters. That was the main reason why the plot felt like it was all over the place. So many scenes and characters in the book read like random asides, not like vital moments that drove the main story. The main story felt crammed in at the end. The book finishes with a huge cliffhanger on page 324. If readers want to find out how the six merls take on the mythical monster and a bad guy named Traho who is pure mwahahahaha-evil, they will have to pick up the sequel to find out. I’ll pass on the sequel, as I’ve had my fill of Serafina and Neela, and the pun-laden writing style that composes their world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 15, 2016","Jun 06, 2016","May 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18601430-deep-blue

I bought it immediately, as one of those gifts-I-would-like-to-borrow-as-soon-as-you're-done-reading-it. Problem was, the gift receiver went through a horrible breakup, decided boys were evil and the world was rotten, and promptly got rid of this book without reading it.I was so, so sad. Not for the breakup, because that guy was a tool. But for the loss of what I KNEW was a great book.I never forgot I wanted to read this novel. Some writing just calls to me, and though I've never read any books by Jenny Han before, the opening pages of this novel were a siren song I couldn't get out of my head.So in May 2016, a writer friend of mine bought the paperback for me as a birthday present, and I DEVOURED this breezy YA novel full of nice prose.If you enjoyed ""Anna and the French Kiss"" then this book will be another cute, fun read to add to your list. I actually liked this one even more. The main character of ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before"" is Korean-American, and this aspect of her heritage plays a role in the story, rather than just being a trait that's mentioned once, and then dropped. (Major points to Jenny Han for weaving in the extra details.) The novel is set in the teen world of upper-middle class America, deals only with inconsequential first world problems (will I ever fall in love with a boy? or learn how to check my blind spot while I'm driving without freaking out?? *harrowing!*), and I did find myself getting bored with the novel halfway through.So I called the book the Bubble Gum Universe, everything is just so Sweet and Light and Innocent in this story. If you want a novel that revels in affluence, doesn't feel any need to apologize for the financial good fortune of white suburbia, and never touches any of the darkness in life, this book will satisfy. The big Ick Factor going on in this story is that the main character once crushed -- and is crushing -- on her older sister's boyfriend, and who likes the idea of being romantically involved with a sibling's partner? Especially when you know the sibling and said partner have had sex -- that is a lot of ickiness going on.But this novel doesn't exist to be an Ick Fest. In the Bubble Gum Universe, the world is a sugary, happy place. Ugly things just evaporate here like rainfall in the desert, when the droplets disappear before they even touch ground. A strength of Jenny Han's prose is her attention to detail -- but that can be a liability for her as well. The piling-on of unneeded description and the drawn-out plot points (some letters go missing at the beginning of the story, and it's obvious to the reader who stole them, but not to the mc) -- by the last few chapters, I had to skim, I just couldn't deal with the slow pace and the constant uber-description by then. I was ready for the story to move faster, and hurry up with the obvious. The nuclear-family-drama had totally lost my interest. I knew how it would end, and didn't need to read the book's climax. But before I reached my skim-point, this novel DOES give the reader a GREAT payoff. I was delighted and thrilled by a certain scene involving some super nice kissing. *Divine.* And it was so well-written, I was immensely glad I stayed in the Bubble Gum Universe to arrive at that scene, and then see its aftermath.Though I did skim the chapters after that big kissing scene, and didn't read the last two chapters at all, I *DID* read the p pages for the sequel, ""P.S. I Still Love You,"" which were attached at the end of the paperback. And those p pages made me want to DEVOUR the sequel right away. So my thanks to Jenny Han for a sweet, fun read. This book was a pleasure, and I want the next one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 03, 2016","May 07, 2016","May 03, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15749186-to-all-the-boys-i-ve-loved-before

I'm SO glad I bought this book in hardback. This novel is a treasure.I admit that the Prologue worried me. In the three books I've read by Ms. Weiner, there were themes and plot pieces and character types that tied them together, like siblings in the same white suburban family, and this Prologue seemed like I was in familiar territory, so much that I worried the story of Rachel and Andy in ""Who Do You Love"" would feel stale, an author writing from a well-worn groove.But by the end of Chapter One, I knew I was in completely new, completely riveting new story turf, and I LOVED IT. Oh how I loved it.Ms. Weiner delves into the subjects of childhood death and disorders, poverty, classism, racism, crime, adultery, and the world of professional running -- intertwined with a love story that held me spellbound till the last page.Rachel and Andy take turns telling their story, in alternating narrative points of view, and the timeline flows beautifully, allowing Ms. Weiner to exercise her penchant for long descriptive passages and her profusion of tiny details with a plot that never stops moving. ""Who Do You Love"" features a magnificent ensemble of characters, but Rachel and Andy are the true stars, and the story never strays far from the two of them. They make awful mistakes. They do horrible things to each other. They fight, they give up, they create immense pain in their lives. I rooted for them the whole way. I was so gripped by their story, and by them. This book caught me and held me captive till I finished. I absolutely loved it.

YES. I absolutely read every word. CHECK.The opening pages start out with a bang, and then the plot drops to a low simmer, and takes time to rev up again. For me, with my mass-paperback copy, that occurred on page 61.What happens on page 61? The main character, Addie Downs, remembers an impromptu road trip/vacation she took with her childhood best friend, Valerie Adler, when both girls were nine. Val’s mom inspired the trip, and took the wheel. They drove from Chicago to Cape Cod and back in a couple days. They slept in the car, they went to the beach, they tried to have a seafood dinner but had no money. So Val’s mother turned on the charm, and a young man at the restaurant that night ponied up the cash for their meal.Here is a quote from their supper (p.68) —“Chris Jeffries, the shellfish constable — for that was what he was, not a policeman, as I’d first thought — had paid for a feast. There was corn on the cob and clam chowder and red plastic net bags filled with gray clams that Val and her mother called steamers. There was coleslaw and French fries and a tangled mound of thin, crispy onion rings, tall wax paper cups brimming with ice and soda, and little plastic dishes filled with melted butter. A dozen oysters lolled slick in their shells on a bed of crushed ice, and two giant lobsters sprawled over oval-shaped plates, leaking steaming pale-pink water. I watched as Mrs. Adler opened a plastic bag of oyster crackers and sprinkled them into her soup.”There is some more description of the bounty at the table, and what it’s like to devour seafood for the first time. Addie says (p.69) —“I ate a whole bagful of steamers and an ear of corn drizzled with butter and sprinkled with grainy sea salt. I squeezed lemon onto a raw oyster and then, following Mrs. Adler’s example, tipped the rough edge of the shell to my lips and slurped out the liquor and the meat. After my first few clumsy tries, I got the hang of the metal nutcrackers and the tiny three-tined fork, prying chunks of pink-and-white flesh out of the lobster claws and dousing them with butter, too, amazed at the taste of the meat, light and rich and sweet.”The girls go on to eat until they’re stuffed, and then have ice cream while Val’s mom and Chris Jeffries smoke and drink coffee. Later, the three of them sneak into Val’s grandfather’s house to spend the night, and Val’s mother steals some money from him to buy them bananas and doughnuts for breakfast. Then Val and Addie go clamming in a canoe they borrow from a stranger without asking (p.76) —“Val and I sat in the middle of the canoe. Mrs. Adler pulled off her tank top to reveal a blue bikini top. She pushed us into the shallow water until the waves lapped at the hem of her shorts, then hopped into the boat and began to paddle, propelling us past sandbars thick with bright-green sawgrass and cattails, heading out to where the marsh gave way to the rippling dark-blue sea.”I was so enchanted with the story by this point, I was holding my breath as I read. This is the kind of scene that makes me come most alive as a reader, when I’m blissed-out and delighted by the wonder of fiction.Once the girls have filled two buckets with clams, they finally take a break (p.78) —“Valerie and I lay side by side at the edge of the shore and let the incoming tide push the water over our toes… then our knees… then our hips, our waists, our chests. Finally, we floated, our hair waving in the current, hips and hands bumping as the waves lifted us and let us down, until Mrs. Adler pushed the canoe into the water and told us it was time to go.”Which totally reminded me of the scene of the two young girls in the beginning of Mira Nair’s 1996 film, ""Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love,"" when they’re swimming together, twining around each other, and then later, as grown women, they’re once again in the water together, under far different circumstances.Which is the same theme in ""Best Friends Forever"" — two childhood friends, driven apart by a man and other crap circumstances involving sexism and violence and society, who are reunited as adults to become friends again.I give ""Best Friends Forever"" a full 5 stars for being a fun, quirky book with interesting characters and a plot that didn’t take me to an entirely predictable ending. I admit that the kissing scene in the end did gross me out, as all I could think about was how rank the man’s breath must smell, because he was hungover and bloody, having spent the night asleep in his car before smashing his face on the sidewalk and passing out. Since Addie has to lay him “on his side, so that he wouldn’t choke on his own vomit,” before he wakes up later and starts kissing her, all I could think was “someone get that bro a toothbrush and a shower” and a whole lot of “ewwwwww” and “please tell me there was no vomit.”So that was very un-sexy, but then, the book doesn’t ever try to be sexy. The book is all about nostalgia and complicated memories and how people survive loss and pain. The book is GREAT. Sure, it falls into some common tropes, like the pretty girl has to be a ditz and the smart girl gets to fall in love — but what would fiction be, without a few tropes here and there? The question is not how many stereotypes a book can break, the question is how engaging the story is. And I was hooked by Addie, I loved her and cared deeply to find out what would happen to her.And for that gorgeous scene in Cape Cod, I am KEEPING this book. Because when a writer pens a scene that gorgeous, the whole book is a win....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Apr 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6066819-best-friends-forever

While I enjoyed reading the first half of the book, the latter essays -- starting with ""Fact vs. Fiction"" -- *really* moved me, frequently made me tear up and twisted my heart with emotion.I've never read Ms. Patchett's novel ""Truth & Beauty,"" so her essay about that book (in ""Fact vs. Fiction"") was informative as well as moving. I was overwhelmed with tears at the end of ""My Life in Sales,"" an essay about Ms. Patchett's experiences traveling on book tour. I learned that Eudora Welty is Ann Patchett's favorite writer in ""The Best American Short Stories 2006"" and that Ms. Patchett attended her funeral. The beautiful essay ""Love Sustained"" details the death of Ms. Patchett's grandmother, and the ""The Bookstore Strikes Back"" provides wonderful information about the independent bookstore Ms. Patchett opened in Nashville. If I had to pick an absolute favorite essay in this collection, the titular ""This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage"" would be my first choice. The final two essays of the book, ""Dog Without End"" and the closing essay, ""The Mercies,"" were also extremely powerful.

Which explaiThis is the first novel I've ever read by Kiera Cass, and in the Acknowledgments, Ms. Cass states, ""This is the first book I ever wrote."" Which explains a lot.""The Siren"" stars a deity called the Ocean who lives in -- and as -- the sea, and feeds on human blood. (Or, if not ""human blood,"" per se, than the taking of human lives.) Where did the Ocean come from, and why does she need to kill humans to survive? Questions the book never asks, and most certainly never answers. The Ocean is all-powerful, can sense individual human souls on her waters, and can take lives at will, whenever she likes. But for some reason, the Ocean has decided she needs to keep four human girls in terms of slavery, to sing to the ships the Ocean has decided to sink. Why does the Ocean need human slaves? If she can sink a ship anywhere, at any time, what is the point of having four human slave girls? More questions that this novel never asks, and doesn't answer.Each human slave girl is given a term of 100 years of service. If she doesn't want to be enslaved, she is drowned like the other humans the Ocean drowns at sea. As a Team of Four, these girls are made ageless and invincible, given the title of ""siren,"" provided with whatever they like in the material world (money, travel, freedom), and then once or twice a year, they are expected to go into the Ocean, sing to a ship that has been targeted for destruction, and then that ship veers a mile or two ""off course"" before the Ocean sinks the vessel. All the people aboard drown. Children as well as adults. Why does the Ocean need to change the position of the ships before sinking them? I have no idea. Logic is not the point of this book.The story begins with a 19-year-old girl named Kahlen, who is traveling aboard a large ship with her parents and brother, circa 1930. The Ocean's sirens sing to the ship, the vessel goes down, and Kahlen cries out that she wants to live. So the sirens come over and the Ocean makes her an offer -- stay alive and spend 100 years in slavery as a siren, helping the Ocean kill innocent people, or die along with her family members, who Kahlen is watching drown.Kahlen chooses life. In the next sentence, the reader is told Kahlen spends 80 years singing to ships and assisting in murder. She feels bad about it, but not bad enough to do anything to put a stop to it. Can the Ocean be destroyed? What did the Ocean feed on before humans evolved on earth? Could the Ocean go back to feeding on non-human life? Again, not questions the book asks, and certainly never answers. Instead we have Kahlen, who is now 99 years old, falling in love with a human boy who is 19 years old. Kahlen never reads like a woman on the verge of turning 100 though. She also doesn't read like a typical 19-year-old. Her thoughts are so very young and naive, she reminded me most of being a small child. Other readers have said that Kahlen sounds like she's twelve. To me, she read a few years younger, but I would accept twelve as far more accurate than nineteen.What does it mean to keep yourself alive if the price of your life is to murder so many thousands of innocents? What is the moral cost of the terror of death, when escaping the terror of death means the indiscriminate slaughter of others? This is not a question the book asks, or answers. The Ocean in this story is basically Hitler, and her sirens are her SS. Heavy, heavy stuff. But the story jettisons any need to delve into the complications of murder, and how so much killing would shatter a compassionate person -- would, in fact, twist them into a monster as the price of their survival. No, the story doesn't approach that subject at all. Kahlen is sad to have to watch so many people die, but then she spends a day baking a cake with a boy -- and BAM!! -- she falls in love. True Love. ""Bigger than soul mates"" love. Then she helps sink a cruise ship with a wedding party aboard. At the sight of the bride and groom drowning, Kahlen disobeys the Ocean for the first time ever, and runs away. She runs to her soul mate. Lots of childish, uninteresting drama ensues. The story goes on and on (and on), and you can probably guess that by the last page, Kahlen gets her triumphant Happily Ever After ending. The Ocean and the other sirens continue on with their lives as usual, sinking ships and murdering people right and left with no one on land the wiser. I really don't know what the purpose of this novel is. It seems to be telling me that as long as the hero of the story ""gets hers,"" then no one else matters. As long as the HERO is alive and well, safe on land with her True Love, then who cares how many other people on earth are dying needlessly. Those people don't matter. Only the hero, with her great love, matters. Honestly, as soon as I finished the first chapter, all I could think about Kahlen was that, were I in her place, I'd have rather died with my family than murder people to live. Like joining Hitler's SS, I'd either find a way to try to help murder Hitler, or I'd find a way to end my own life. To kill innocent men, women, and children to ""save my own life"" would inflict so much psychological harm, I know I wouldn't survive it. And if I DID survive it, I'd never forgive myself. Every day after, I'd see the faces of the dead, and I would hate myself for being so craven. For being so terrified to die myself that I was willing to needlessly murder others in order to avoid the same fate.The author shows Kahlen making ""scrapbooks"" with pictures of the people she's killed (a character trait that disappears right after Kahlen meets her True Love). I know Kahlen wouldn't need a scrapbook to remember those faces. They'd be seared into her mind, forever. Murder is such a horrific act, the mind stores that memory with strong emotion, and the only way Kahlen could ever forget the people she's helped to kill would require her becoming a sociopath. (Which, by the way, plays nowhere into this story. None of the sirens become sociopaths in order to survive their terms of service to the Ocean.)The novel also supports the view that murder is a just revenge upon other killers. In one place in the story, a teen girl is almost drowned by her father, chooses life as a siren in order to escape death, and then she seeks revenge on her father by murdering him. Only the cold-blooded killing of her father allows this girl to ""heal"" from the trauma he caused. While he was alive, she was sobbing and inconsolable. But after she murders him in cold blood, she is happy. Which bothered me deeply to read, and still does. In truth, I would give this book zero stars, rather than one, because the plot holes bothered me so much, and I thought the morality expressed in the story was beyond horrific. Other readers simply focus on the love story, ignore the plot holes and disturbing lack of moral depth in the book, and delight in the Happily Ever After. So be it, and to each their own. The writing style in this novel is okay, with straightforward, simple prose that is easy to read. A lot of readers have showered this book with 5-star s and gushing praise, so it obviously does a good job for them.

I often felt excruciating emotional pain reading this book, and suffered tears through every chapter. The details of reading about what rape victims suffer, as well as the horrifying treatment sexual abuse victims receive in the criminal justice system, university justice system, and society at large -- makes for some of the most difficult reading I've ever experienced in my life. Jon Krakauer's research and writing in ""Missoula"" are impeccable, and he penned this book with courage, passion, and grit. He is a fierce, unwavering advocate of reforming ALL justice systems to better serve victims of sexual abuse and make sure sexual predators don't continue to rape future victims with impunity, as they so often do now. ""Missoula"" sends a clear message that only by shattering the predator-serving myths about rape that abound in society will circumstances ever improve. And Mr. Krakauer does a *very* fine job of shattering these predator-serving rape myths. He examines the false beliefs and the cultural bias that creates them, as well as the justice system that has for so long perpetuated them, with unflinching veracity. This book is a brutal indictment as well as a call to action; an examination of what we've done wrong as a society as well as a triumphant message of what we've managed to get right. And where we can still go from here. I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE. ""Missoula"" is educational, gripping, profound. Deeply needed and important.

The first chapter is EXCELLENT. Beautiful writing. Super compelling opening. I was SO hooked.Then things go downhill. Fast. And this novel just turned into a trainwreck that necessitated massive amounts of either skimming or skipping chapters entirely.""The Coldest Girl in Coldtown"" stars a seventeen-year-old female named Tana who is drawn as a perfect human paradox: she has a MAJOR death wish, but she also wants to live. She has survivor's guilt from childhood, and even more survivor's guilt from the events in chapter one, and yet she doesn't behave as someone grieving from trauma at all. She's a complete doormat who puts up with horrendous behavior from a worthless ex-boyfriend, and she is also an absolute FOOL, even when she's not around someone in possession of a penis. Over and over, Tana points out how stupid her choices are, which was unneeded text -- it's clear to the reader what a fool Tana is, I didn't need that repeatedly spoonfed to me.Death is meaningless in this book. People are dying everywhere, and no one cares. People don't react to horror at all in this novel. Vampires can come and go from these Coldtown-prison places, killing at will, and infecting more people with vampirism, and NO ONE cares. Vampires get out and massacre people, then head back to Coldtown to star in Internet feeds and be online celebrities. It's like a world in which modern terrorists were allowed to massacre people, never face capture or trial, and instead become wealthy celebrity sensations with shows like THE REAL LIVES OF TERRORISTS and KILL WITH ABANDON AND LIVE HOT AND YOUNG FOREVER.The lack of morality or any kind of common sense in this book just left my head spinning. The novel's love story is your classic pretty-white-teen-female falls for an ancient-white-male-vamp-who-totes-falls-for-the-hot-young-teen-at-first-sight. The ancient white vamp in this story, Gavriel, is also strongly modeled after Anne Rice's famous character Louis, with a creator vampire who is strongly modeled after Lestat. The Louis/Lestat relationship in ""The Coldest Girl in Coldtown"" is nowhere near as interesting as Anne Rice's books though. I found the Lestat-copy vampire in this novel completely uninteresting to read about; he was introduced late in the book, and the plot was so disorganized and scattershot by then, I just couldn't bring myself to care. He was a vicious nemesis, and it was obvious what was going to happen to him, and I felt no tension whatsoever by then. The author writes with so much extraneous detail about story elements that don't matter at all to the plot, not even the pretty writing style could save me from skimming. Chapters that are written as flashback scenes, dream sequences, or from other characters' points of view were often skipped -- and even when I did read them, they felt pointless to the story. Perhaps the most horrendous statement comes at the very end of the book, as the hot ancient vampire, Gavriel, tells young Tana how much he loves her:""Allow me to explain how my whole life has prepared me for this moment. I am used to girls screaming, and your screams -- your screams will be sweeter than another's cries of love.""In regards to Tana, a main character with a death wish, who spends the novel behaving like a Too Stupid To Live protagonist, she sure picked a winner in Gavriel. This story was so nonsensical and full of plotholes, and the main characters were all so unlikeable, I'd rather live in a horrible Hunger Games district than anywhere near the world of this book. At its heart, this story is a classic ""taming and changing the monster"" love story that so many women seem to love. Tana's beauty and willful foolishness tames and changes Gavriel, who will then love her forever, happy to listen to her ""sweet screams"" for the rest of her life.

Author Stephanie Danler has penned a triumphant debut, and this book is an exquisite pleasure to read. The prose is out-of-this-world EXCELLENT.The story follows a year in the life of 22-year-old Tess, the narrator and main character, as she learns the job of a back-waiter/back-server in a high-end restaurant in Manhattan. ""Sweetbitter"" is a story about Tess growing up.She lusts and loves after a bartender she works with named Jake, a man who is a few years older than Tess, a complicated fellow of both animal and cerebral appeal. Jake has ""an enigmatic relationship"" with another server at the same restaurant named Simone, and the dynamics between Tess, Jake, and Simone fuel the central drama of the book.My one problem with the novel is that it always seemed clear to me exactly what kind of ""enigmatic relationship"" Jake and Simone had -- and since Tess's narrative voice is so insightful and intelligent, full of wry humor, honesty, and a self-deprecating authenticity, I thought Tess understood Jake and Simone the same way I did.Near the end of the novel, I realized -- with a mental explosion like sudden artillery fire -- that Tess did NOT understand Jake and Simone the way I did. Tess was actually really clueless, far more clueless than I'd understood her to be -- and I suddenly felt really old, disconnected from Tess and therefore the entire story, and I had to put the book down, and take a break for a while, before I could finish. I'd read most of the novel never realizing that Tess is a romantic, a young woman tied to the hope of a Prince Charming and a Happy Ever After and a one-man-married-to-one-woman normalcy that the situation she found herself in never once presented as a real possibility. She never saw Jake and Simone for what they are, but as the childhood archetypes of Lover and Friend she'd grown up with. The kind of acculturated identities and ideals we all have, and some people go on to emulate, and others do not.Jake and Simone are not living by anyone else's ideals. They are the living detritus of shattered dreams, fiercely connected and devoted to each other, loyal in a way that only those who've decided to give zero f*cks can ever be. I've known many Jakes and Simones in my life. I grew up in various worlds where they thrive. Tess has no backstory in this novel, and so I didn't realize that Tess and I did not share an understanding. Tess was much more optimistic and idealistic than I was at twenty-two. The revelation came as such a surprise, I felt disappointed and let down by the book. Caught in a deep and painful heart-stab of false identity.But then I let that pain go, picked up the novel again, and finished the book -- this time, reading with a new understanding that Tess is sweeter and far more innocent than I'd been led to believe, clueless in a dopey and endearing way as she pines for Jake to transform into Prince Charming. I found my intense enjoyment of this novel again, and loved the ending. Everything rang true through the final pages. The prose of ""Sweetbitter"" made my heart pound with excitement, with a pure sense of joy. The stakes in the novel are small -- and rest solely on the life of one young woman, her identity, her aspirations, her drives -- but the book is deeply rewarding, a work of beauty, thrilling and transporting to read.

T**This  contains spoilers****Please do not read this  if you do not want spoilers**""Not a Drop to Drink"" is a YA novel with three parts. The first third of the book is a dystopian survivalist tale. The second third is a romance, with lots of family-bonding, friendship-making, and cuddles. The final third shifts gears into a western, with a bang-bang shoot 'em up at the O.K. Corral -- otherwise known as the Harem That Must Be Destroyed. The teen protagonist of this novel, Lynn, has been raised by her mother, Lauren, to be an unflinching killing machine. If anyone approaches the pond by their house, Lauren and Lynn shoot to kill, no questions asked. Lauren has raised Lynn to believe this is the price of survival.Circumstances in the beginning of this novel are grim and terrifying. Lynn and Lauren live in a world that fell apart when Lynn was a small child, a collapse of civilization that began with a period of time called the Shortage. (Later, the reader learns the story is set somewhere in Ohio.) Lynn has been killing in cold blood for the past seven years, starting at the age of nine. When the story begins, Lauren and Lynn don't know if they have enough food and wood stockpiled to survive another winter. Horror casts a shadow over them both, and despair laces the pages with a blaze of urgency that made for gripping reading. A group of strange men try to ambush Lauren and Lynn in the night, and the two women kill five of them, causing the remaining men to flee. I was hooked on the story at this point -- this part of the novel was heart-pounding and *excellent.* Then things took a turn for the worse. The next morning, Lauren and Lynn strip the five corpses of valuables, and leave them out in a field. It's clear they've been disposing of bodies like this for a long, long time. Which means that the local scavengers in the area -- wild packs of coyotes that have bred with some domesticated dogs since the Shortage began -- have had access to a free source of food for over a decade. Even though there is *plenty* of human danger in the opening pages of this book -- for some reason, a small pack of three coyotes -- scavengers that have just been supplied with five grown men to devour in peace -- suddenly attack Lauren, a woman who is armed and deadly. The coyotes jump her, and Lynn -- who is called a sharpshooter repeatedly in the novel -- accidentally shoots her mom in the thigh instead of the dogs. The coyotes then pounce on Lauren, who bleeds out and dies. This is when the book started to unravel for me. When I stopped believing the words on the page. Coyotes wouldn't attack armed humans when there's already plenty of dead meat lying around. Lauren and Lynn have been feeding these scavengers for years and years -- and coyotes are NOT ignorant animals. This would be the equivalent of a pack of coyotes attacking a grizzly after the bear has just slaughtered five deer. The coyotes would go eat all the deer. Scavengers don't need to hunt if there is plenty of kill on the ground.And how can Lynn continue to be called a sharpshooter when she shoots her own MOTHER? That title should've been stripped from Lynn for the rest of the book after that. No one can claim to be a great shot when they fire a gun into the only person they love. The only person they've ever known in their life. That is NOT the work of a sharpshooter. A more accurate description of Lynn would have been, ""Sometimes I'm a crack shot, like when I'm sniping, but sometimes I mess up really bad and accidentally kill people I love."" But the story continues to call Lynn a sharpshooter. I did not understand this at all. It made as much sense as the coyotes attacking a top predator -- (Lauren) -- who has been providing them with free kills for years and years.It would've made far more sense if a *man* had surprised Lynn and her mom, shot Lauren in the thigh, and then Lynn killed the man with her rifle. As it is, Lauren, in teaching her daughter to kill everyone who comes into sight without question, simply got what she deserved -- a daughter who ended up shooting HER. Pretty much divine justice. Or poetic justice, a term which is used in the novel.(And honestly, if human civilization ever suddenly collapsed, thriving packs of coyotes would just prey on all the feral cats. Because every pet in the U.S. would be left to run wild, and the feral cat population would bloom so quickly, those canine packs would have plenty to eat. Feral cats reproduce faster than coyotes, raccoons, possums, etc. etc. And they make really good eating to coyotes.)But back to ""Not a Drop to Drink"" and the death of Lauren.Lynn grieves her mother's loss, and soon after, she leaves the property on a scouting trip, and encounters a five-year-old girl. Instead of shooting the child, Lynn suddenly ""grows a conscience"" and spares her, along with the girl's older brother, Eli, and the girl's mother. Lynn, who was raised to be a stone cold killer, who murders people and has never felt bad about that before -- Lynn now sees a child and -- bam! -- becomes a different person. I thought the story should've clarified if Lynn had ever seen a child before, if anyone had ever come to the pond with a child and been spared by Lauren's or Lynn's bullets. Because as it was, the arrival of this five-year-old, a pretty child named Lucy, read like a deus ex machina to soften Lynn up -- and this sudden growth of a conscience didn't feel believable to me. Not enough information was shared as to why Lynn didn't simply flee the scene when she saw Lucy, rather than stay. There was an emotional element that felt excluded on purpose, and I think the story suffered for it. Curiosity, wonder -- sharing those emotions in Lynn would've helped a *lot* -- because I just couldn't ascribe any such emotions to Lynn in that scene. The author assumes the reader will assume Lynn would have instantaneous compassion for a child -- but I disagree. You give me a stone cold killer, I assume No Feels for Anyone. Children included. Then there was the bizarre fact that even though Lynn has been raised with an ""I KILL EVERYONE"" attitude for years and years, living in complete solitude with only her mother, she still has gasoline for her truck and her chain saw. What?? Even if Lauren and Lynn were storing petrol in tanks somewhere (and there was no mention of *anything* about that in the book) it makes no sense that they would have gasoline all these years after the Shortage and breakdown of the world. If society had collapsed that hard, every vehicle would've been siphoned of fuel long before Lynn turned sixteen. And gasoline breaks down/degrades over time -- which means the only way Lynn and her neighbor would still have gas for their trucks is if someone is still making it and they're trading items for petrol somewhere. As it turns out, in the final third of the book, the reader *does* discover where the fresh fuel is coming from. There is a Local Trading Hub that is also a Rape Camp From Hell run by Lynn's biological father. And this Hub of Horror is all located within walking distance of the pond Lynn has spent her entire life defending. For some unexplained reason, Lauren never mentioned to Lynn that her father was a Satanic Pimp who lived just over the yonder. A man who smiles and drinks coffee while his lackeys rape women and brutalize everyone else in the area. This Satanic Pimp would also be the reason Lynn still has ammunition, coffee, and petrol so many years after the collapse of civilization. Lauren must've been trading for these items in secret, without Lynn's awareness. Lauren never warned her daughter of the Rape Camp From Hell. Never even informed Lynn of what sexual intercourse is or warned her that men rape young women. Information I mentally filed in ""Other Unexplained Things"" in this novel. Such as the fact that Lauren and Lynn seem to be purifying water with sunlight -- ?? I had trouble making sense of this. The UV rays in sunlight aren't enough to kill all microorganisms in freshwater. Or maybe they were heating the water with sunlight, to kill all the microorganisms -- which made me puzzle over the matter of evaporation and water-capture problems. Later in the story, Lucy is burning with fever, and a doctor plunges Lucy's body into the ice-cold pond water to break the fever. Um, what? Is that really sound medical practice? Isn't that one of those medical myths that people have debunked as unsafe? I just struggled a lot with these questions, the same way I could not understand why Lauren, who seemed like such a badass survivalist, would not bluntly inform her daughter of *all* the dangers men pose, whether with a gun or their fists or their penises. I also struggled to understand why a sixteen-year-old badass like Lynn wouldn't already know about the Local Trading Hub located within walking distance of her home. If she's gone to scavenge from houses before, in search of scissors and medicine and other necessities -- wouldn't she have come across the trading hub before the end of this story?But back to the plot line of the novel -- after young and adorable Lucy enters Lynn's life, the danger in the book disappears. The scarcity of food and wood, the fear of surviving a winter on dwindling supplies -- all of that worry is GONE. Now the house is stocked in full, there's plenty of wood and ammo and necessities (how? magic?), and the plot becomes focused on Teen Lite Romance, having Fun Kid Times and building snowmen, and other sweet moments of friendship and love. This is the long middle section of the novel, before the plot switches focus one more time and goes into western mode, with Lynn the avenging angel of death. Like a classic shoot-out in a Clint Eastwood film, Lynn plans and organizes the demise of the Local Trading Hub that is also a brothel full of sex slaves. Lynn allows her friend and her love, Eli, to wear a backpack full of gasoline into this firefight, in order to throw Molotov cocktails into the buildings. The reader would fully understand why Eli would do something like this -- Eli is from the city, he lacks survival skills, and it's assumed he also lacks common sense. What seems far more irrational is why *Lynn* would permit this. Lynn is supposed to have a strong education in firearms, which one would assume would mean she would understand what happens when a fired round comes in contact with a container full of petrol.Suffice to say, things do not go well in this shoot-out. Lynn vanquishes her enemies. But, in a brutal echo of shooting her own mother at the beginning of the book, Lynn's primary strategy of ""kill, kill, kill,"" eliminates another person she loves. The scene is rewarding and gory, but it also reminded me of the ending of the YA novel ""We Were Liars,"" wherein I found myself scratching my head and wondering why so many teens in YA literature are depicted as being so clueless about fire. I would recommend ""Not a Drop to Drink"" to any YA reader who loves dystopian survivalist fiction mixed with romance and the final showdown thrill of a western. The beginning of the book is excellent, and the shoot-out is delightfully complicated. For many readers, Lynn's evolution from a stone cold killer to a compassionate friend and mother-figure was completely realized and convincing, and the behavior of coyotes, the shelf life of petrol, and the curious nature of teenagers defending their home didn't hinder the strength of this story at all. The plot delivers a unique ending that is uncommon in a genre that often features Happily Ever Afters, and that scores the book high points as well. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 15, 2016","May 15, 2016","Sep 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13112869-not-a-drop-to-drink

The book disturbed me so greatly that four years later, whenever the title of this book came up in conversation or in s, my heart would race, and I’d get hit with a powerful surge of anxiety, which would quickly transform into a sense of outrage and anger. So I knew I felt lingering trauma over certain scenes in the second half of the novel.I decided I needed to look at this book again, and look at it far more critically than the first time I read “Hopeless,” when I assumed I was reading a light, high school romance. Because this is *not* a light, high school romance, not at all. A lot of horrifying and problematic material swamp this story in the last forty percent of the book, and all of this material comes out of nowhere, with no adequate foreshadowing as to the mature content readers should be prepared for.For my first encounter with ""Hopeless,"" I read with a book buddy who loved this novel. I shared some of my reaction, and tried to brush off the rest, assuming that I would just forget those scenes soon enough. But the scenes stayed with me, and so did my outrage. The second time I decided to read “Hopeless,” I asked another book buddy to help me through it. I warned her that she might love the book too, because “Hopeless” has a bajillion-kazillion 5-star s, has sold a bajillion-kazillion copies in ebook and paperback, and just because I have a negative reaction to this book, that’s only one opinion, and no one should be expected to share it. We all have a right to love what we love. I also worried that the book might traumatize her, but she assured me she could handle it, and that if she loved the book, she would make sure to be honest, and explain why.So off we went, reading and discussing and watching the drama unfold.And oh, what a journey this reread turned out to be. My single biggest epiphany is to say that “Hopeless” is drenched in the moralizing cultural waters of the Madonna-Whore complex. The societal divide between what a whore is, and what a good girl/virgin/Madonna is, define the entire structure of this book.Here are some Madonna-Whore phrases that saturate pop culture, to provide a bit of context for readers who might be unfamiliar with this terminology: Good girls don’t; She’s marriage material; Don’t give away the milk for free; Damned if you do, damned if you don’t; Be a lady in the streets and a whore in the sheets.In short, the Madonna-Whore complex defines a woman’s worth and morality based upon her ability to suppress or eliminate her sexual desires. Only when confronted with true love and/or marriage may a woman engage in carnal pleasure, because sex is, after all, how babies are made. The Madonna-Whore complex is heavily coupled with misogynistic, patriarchal views that a woman’s life is worth less than a man’s, and that a woman only gains esteem, status, and self-respect after she is claimed by a man—either as his girlfriend or his wife. To summarize the crux of this ideology: “good girls” will make quality partners and great mothers for a man’s offspring, but “whores” are immoral heathens, selfish bitches, and/or hedonistic home-wreckers no decent man should ever want to marry. A good girl is worthy of a man’s love, while a whore is a dehumanized object who may be used and thrown away. At the most basic level of understanding: a whore is unworthy of love.Women as well as men all adopt and embody the Madonna-Whore complex, to varying degrees, whether we want to or not. “Hopeless” is the Madonna-Whore complex on Olympian-level steroids. If you watched Natalie Portman dance herself to death in the 2010 movie, “Black Swan,” you’re familiar with the heaviest forms of symbolism of the Madonna-Whore complex. “Hopeless” is a literary version of mega-heavy and mega-obvious Madonna-Whore symbolism and story structure. The protagonist and first-person narrator of this novel, a seventeen-year-old high school student named Sky, is repeatedly defined to the reader as a virgin. Sky has never been penetrated, not with a boy’s finger or his penis. Along with being an undefiled virgin, Sky has also never felt any lust for a boy. She has kissed “four or five” boys (Sky is unsure of the number), but she only did this because her best friend wanted her to kiss them. After the boys go home, Sky’s best friend will let Sky come over, and they eat ice cream together. As Sky makes clear to the reader, “Ice cream was the only appealing part to making out with the guys.” Sky never felt any attraction for any of these four or five boys, and the kisses only made her feel “numb.” “I am *not* a slut,” Sky tells the reader in the first eight percent of the book. “I’ve never had sex with any of the boys I’ve made out with.”Sky’s best friend, Six, however, engages in sexual intercourse with the boys she brings into her bedroom. Six has also had many more sexual partners than four or five boys. As Six tells Sky in the first 17 percent of the book, “I don’t have an inability to say no to guys. I have an inability to grasp the moral ramifications of premarital sex. Lots and lots of premarital sex.”Six’s language is heavily coded with the Madonna-Whore complex of sex and morality, virginity and worthiness. Six states in a letter to Sky that she “doesn’t believe in commitment,” and goes on to say that due to the fact that Sky is still a virgin, Sky is not “a dirty slut,” and this makes Sky “better” than Six.The first half of “Hopeless” goes into a lot of detail describing the damaging effects of being labeled a “slut” in high school, and also explores Sky’s fear that something might be wrong with her because she has never felt lust.Then Sky meets an eighteen-year-old boy in a grocery store, and within a few minutes, she is overwhelmed with a powerful feeling of lust. The boy’s name is Holder, and he is one of the classic archetypes of male love interests in romance novels: the bad boy with a heart of gold. Holder is also physically gorgeous, has a dimple when he smiles, and soon he and Sky start spending a lot of time together.The story structure of “Hopeless” centers on the question of when Sky will lose her virginity to Holder, a “loss” that comes with high stakes. A woman’s goodness, morality, and purity can all be permanently ruined by the act of penetration. Since the reader knows that Sky’s “moral purity” is only at risk if Holder’s erect penis enters Sky’s vagina, Holder and Sky begin their sexual engagement with a lot of kissing scenes, to draw out the tension of when her virginity will be lost. Soon, the young lovers move on to heavy petting, and Holder gives Sky her first orgasm by kissing her neck and face in a slow, erotic manner. Early in their encounters, there is a lot of foreplay, which culminates in the one and only orgasm Sky has in this book. Over a month later, once Sky tells Holder she is ready for sexual intercourse, Holder’s commitment to foreplay vanishes. Throughout the novel, the story doesn’t use the terms “penis” or “vagina,” but there are several explicit sex scenes that describe condom use, penetration, and Holder achieving orgasm from vaginal penetration.The first time Holder puts on a condom, however, and attempts to penetrate Sky, she panics, becomes hysterical, and Holder stops trying to penetrate her. While he does help to calm Sky down, she is extremely worried that Holder will be so upset over her tears that their relationship will end. Sky believes she will “lose” her boyfriend because her sudden panic attack at such an intimate moment “made him feel worthless.”It must be emphasized that, due to the realistic portrayal of Sky’s “first time” in this book, which reads like so many “first times” of so many women, there was no foreplay before Holder put on the condom and positioned his erection to enter Sky’s body. Earlier, on the way to his house, Sky told Holder she was hungry, and asked him to buy her some food. Holder ignored this request, and just took her to his house to have sex. Sky then questioned Holder about why he told her in bed one night, while he was half-conscious and drunk, “I love you, Hope,” when that is not Sky’s name. Does he love another girl named Hope? Holder lies to Sky, refuses to give an honest answer, and then they start kissing. Shortly after they walk to Holder’s bedroom, Holder takes off Sky’s clothes and sets out a condom.Given the fact that Sky was clearly stressed out by Holder’s behavior, I thought her sudden panic to have sex with him was understandable. While either of them might have suggested Sky enjoy some non-penetrative orgasms instead, which would’ve lubricated her body a lot better and might’ve soothed her fears about penetration, the story ignored the lack of foreplay and fixated on disaster. After Holder leaves Sky alone in his room, Sky dresses (without locating her underwear) and then walks down the hall, looking for a place she can hide. Holder has a twin sister who committed suicide a year before the story begins, and Sky enters this sister’s old bedroom, left unchanged since she died. Once in that room, Sky starts to remember suppressed memories from her childhood, and the novel suddenly shifts gears. The story quickly changes from a simple tale about a girl’s fear of penetration and the loss of her virginity, into a hyper-melodramatic story of incest, child kidnapping, rape, pedophilia, domestic abuse, and suicide. All of this material is highly triggering due to the way it is handled, as well as the fact that it comes out of nowhere, is quite graphic, and exists for maximum shock value. Every plot twist and reveal in the last 40 percent of this book is as unrealistic as it is histrionic, since each horrible new development serves to make the characters sob, scream, and sob some more, all the way to the end. If you enjoy bathing in large copper tubs filled with the hysterical tears of main characters, this novel will provide a good two-hour soak.The first time I read “Hopeless,” I was shocked that Holder and Sky end up confronting her father so Sky can ask her father why he repeatedly raped her when she was a small child. The father confesses that he also raped a neighbor child (Holder’s deceased twin sister), and then he takes out a gun from behind his couch and blows his brains out.Blood, bits of brain, and other body tissue end up on Holder and Sky, who flee the house before the police can arrive. They go to their hotel room, scrub all the blood and gray matter off, and then they have sex. Their first time having sex was the night before, when Sky was able to overcome her fear and trauma from incest after Holder repeatedly told her he loved her. The next night, after witnessing her father’s suicide, the sex is drawn out in scene even more, and emphasizes their complete love for each other. As Sky tells the reader, they use sex to release each other’s emotional pain, as well as to bond together. “The two of us gradually become one as we silently express with our bodies and our hands and our eyes what our words are unable to convey. We spend the rest of the night taking turns expressing how we feel without uttering a single word. We have just wholly fallen into each other, heart and soul.”The first time I read this scene, I had such an intense negative reaction. I’d never seen the trope of Magical Healing Sex used to cure this kind of immediate trauma before. Also known as “Magical Healing Dick” or “Purification Sex,” this story trope uses sexual intercourse to “heal” people who have suffered some kind of emotional trauma. But upon my reread, I saw what I hadn’t the first time: that this Magical Healing Sex is coded as Purification Sex not only because of embedded patriarchal themes in the text, but because the story owes its biggest allegiance to the Madonna-Whore complex. Holder is Sky’s soul mate, true love, and future husband. His healing power is a function of his role as Sky’s morally righteous lover. Holder is therefore able to re-purify Sky through intercourse, and alleviate the stain of the “whore,” which Sky received after being raped as a child. By having intercourse with her future husband, Sky’s physical body is remade into someone worthy of love. In other words, sex with Holder can transform Sky back into a Madonna who is worthy of marriage.Readers who enjoy sexual morality plays, melodramatic plot twists completely disconnected from reality, as well as manipulative, controlling, and possessive bad boys, should definitely love “Hopeless.” Personally, Holder’s increasingly bullying behavior toward Sky throughout this book made me feel ill. He “grabs” her a lot, pushes her down twice, issues commands similar to the way you would speak to a dog, frequently calls Sky “babe” and “baby” in the second half of the book, and applauds Sky when she drops to his level, such as when she slaps him in the face “as hard as she can” and uses her kisses as a way to shut him up.I found all of the interactions between them highly problematic, indicative of what I would call an abusive relationship, not a healthy one. Though they end this novel with a Happily Ever After together, I foresee dark times ahead for these two as a couple. Reading “Hopeless” caused me to reflect on how deeply the Madonna-Whore complex is embedded in ALL art and culture, not just in this one novel. I also found myself wondering why so many women respond so strongly to Holder, even though he increasingly infantilizes Sky, especially in the second half of the book. Where I see misogyny, other women see true love, and it seems to me like Sky’s re-purified state is also a fresh innocence, a fresh childhood, and when Holder infantilizes Sky, he is not only being overprotective and possessive of her, but recognizing her return to a “purified/childlike” state. Holder therefore represents the safety and authority of a parental figure—a man who dictates orders Sky doesn’t hesitate to obey—as well as being the romantic ideal of a woman’s true love.I am happy to say that I no longer feel traumatized by this book, and was able to reread the suicide scene with Sky’s father, along with the Healing Sex Scene that follows, without being triggered this time. By thinking more critically about the unspoken themes and messaging taking place in this book, I was able to dissect this story and try to analyze why these scenes work for so many female readers, rather than close the book feeling harmed by them.“Hopeless” is one of the novels that pioneered the New Adult genre: stories featuring teenage or young adult protagonists with detailed sex scenes. I believe the movie rights for this book have been optioned, and “Hopeless” might arrive in movie theaters one day. I already wonder if future film s will discuss the Madonna-Whore complex in this story.

The story is so predictable, the reader can foresee all the major plotpoints long before they arrive, so I skipped from page 400 to the end, and discovered there was one big plot reveal I hadn't seen coming. I won't spoil the ending here, but I will say the book would have been *much* more interesting if Clary and Jace had known this information sooner. It's a great piece of emotional conflict that made me nod my head and think, ""Ah, that is cool, I like that twist.""City of Bones has much better writing than a great majority of the YA novels I've read lately, with moments of really great word choice and nice similes and very lovely description, despite the storyline and much of the rest of the prose being pretty overblown, melodramatic, and full of harsh tonal shifts. One moment, people are cracking jokes while fighting a demon, the next moment I'm supposed to be terrified someone might die, then it's back to wisecracking, then I'm supposed to be really scared again. Repeat, repeat, repeat. At no point did I ever believe one of the main characters, or secondary characters, was going to die, so the tonal shifts did not work for me.Given the book's popularity, along with the fact City of Bones has been turned into a movie and will also be a TV series, I can safely assume I am not the target audience for this novel. Clary and Jace both say and do many mean and nasty things in this story, things that made them extremely unlikeable, and Simon, Alec, and Isabelle were no better. As a reader, I know I was meant to see all five of these characters change and redeem themselves by the end, but by page 400, I still felt only irritation with them all, and the fact that the plot was so predictable made me call it quits.Still, there were many sentences I enjoyed in this story, and I love reading prose that utilizes pretty vocabulary and nice description.Since I didn't bond with these characters, I won't be reading the rest of this trilogy or the three books that follow (the second trilogy), but for readers who connected with Clary, and found Jace attractive, I can see how this series would be appealing. Looking ahead to the two book that follow City of Bones, it seems obvious that there is only one way the third book in the first trilogy can end, after Clary rescues her mom, her mom wakes up, and reveals the final truth that this first book set up as a plot twist. I definitely see a sweet happy ending for Clary and Jace, with the lovers united, their friends alive and well, and the baddies successfully dealt with. For anyone who loves YA urban fantasy full of wisecracking and catty teens who fight bad guys and never lose their sense of humor, definitely read this book, and fall in love with Clary, Jace, and this fantastical world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jun 27, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/256683.City_of_Bones

By the time I reached ""Psychological Operations,"" I thought I'd discovered the best story in the book. The connection established between the veteran Waguih and a Muslim college student named Zara felt so daring and new, such an honest and authentic intimacy in a genre known for callous objectivity and stonewalling, that I felt like nothing could top it. And then I reached ""Ten Kliks South,"" the final story in the book, about an artilleryman who wonders about the destruction wrought by the guns in his battery. This story tied in all the other stories in such a beautiful way, with such gorgeous words closing the tale, that ""Ten Kliks South"" shot to the top of my list as my favorite story in this collection.

These stories are fiction, but the truth is present and alive in each one.

Rani Lakshmi was the queen of the Maratha-ruled Jhansi State, situated in the north-central part of India. She was one of the leading figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and became a symbol of resistance to Indian nationalists.The novel ""Rebel Queen"" is not told from the Rani's point of view, however. This story is told by a young woman named Sita, who becomes one of the queen's Durga Dal, an elite group of female soldiers hired to protect the queen's life. The story begins when Sita is a child, details the events leading up to her need to train as a soldier, and then follows her life at court as a member of the Durga Dal.As the narrator and the protagonist, Sita is very dull. This is not a main character with a sparkling personality, great wit, or a keen spirit. Sita is shy, fixated on politeness and following rules, and lacks the boldness and excitement of characters who would have been far more interesting as protagonists and narrators -- such as Rani Lakshmi or another member of the Durga Dal in the story, a young woman named Kahini. How much more exciting this novel would have been, if the author had chosen one of these two females to narrate the story! How much I wish Ms. Moran had let them tell this tale instead!As to Sita, her sole ambition in life is protecting her little sister, and yet, when things go bad in the kingdom, a situation that is dragged out for many months, this little sister is nowhere on Sita's mind. Which was my central problem with the novel ""Rebel Queen"" -- Sita never felt like a real person. Her voice was so bland and meek, so void of anything even hinting at the conflicting passions an intelligent person in her position would suffer, that she read like an obvious construct the author created to tell the life story of Rani Lakshmi. It was as if Ms. Moran decided that the more boring and passionless Sita was, the more the reader could focus on the life of the rani. Sita never felt like someone who actually lived as a 19th century female soldier, and the plot twists in her life felt like the author pulling strings.This book provides a Western audience unfamiliar with India with information about what it was like to be a young woman in northern India in the 19th century. The story also gives the reader a window into the events of Rani Lakshmi's life, which is a noble endeavor. But this novel never gripped my heart. Sita was such a quiet, unassuming mouse of a country girl, devoid of great passions or any strong opinions or cultural insights throughout the length of the book, that I never felt moved by her, or worried for her, and the ending of the book left me cold. By the last page of the novel, I felt cheated that the story hadn't been told from the rani's point of view, because that was really what the author was trying to do with this novel -- tell me about this brave queen. Instead, by the end of the book, I saw the rani's court, and the rani herself, as a bunch of fools, and I didn't feel sorry for them when their whole silly lifestyle collapsed in bloodshed and heartache. This is a long book to read, and I'm proud of myself for finishing. For anyone who might pick up this book hoping to read scenes of women warriors fighting -- be warned -- there is *very* little actual fighting in this novel, and when fighting does start (near the very end of the book), the bloodshed is either glossed over completely or told in summarized dialogue -- as in, horrors shared with Sita, not horrors she actually witnesses. Readers who want a story about what it actually feels like to fight and die for a cause -- a story that contains the grit and horror of trauma -- might want to look elsewhere. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jun 14, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22609433-rebel-queen

A magician named Prospero walks backstage and discovers he has a five-year-old daughter. The child’s mother is dead. Prospero didn’t love the dead woman, and when he lays eyes on his daughter, he doesn’t love her, either. But he realizes he can use her. Train her as a tool. When she’s grown, she can compete as his proxy in a tournament with another magician in a fight to the death. Though the reader later discovers this fight is actually “a fight till exhaustion” and doesn’t involve any kind of physical combat at all—it’s clear that the stakes are high for this girl. Her name is Celia. Her father uses real magic, not parlor tricks with smoke and mirrors, and Celia has an incredible aptitude for using magic herself. While she learns to do astonishing and beautiful things, like change the color of fabric, and turn physical objects into birds, part of her training involves learning to heal herself. Prospero slices Celia’s fingertips open with a pocketknife, again and again, to force her to heal her cuts. When she annoys him one day, he smashes her wrist with a paperweight, and it takes her an hour to “set and heal the shards of bone.” Prospero is a real piece of work. His friend and fellow magician is a man named Alexander. When Prospero proposes to Alexander that they play a new game (or start a new magical tournament), with Celia fighting as Prospero’s proxy, Alexander agrees. He goes to an orphanage and selects a young boy named Marco to be his own proxy, a boy who has never known his parents at all. Alexander gives Marco magic books, sets him up in a private apartment, and tells him to get busy, he has a lot to learn before he grows up, and the tournament begins. After Marco and Celia are grown, they discover the venue for their tournament will be a circus, a beautifully crafted circus that both of them will enchant, enhance, and infuse with their wonderful magic. That was how The Night Circus began, and what a gorgeous beginning it was. I read the first half of this book compulsively, because it was obvious at the outset that Marco and Celia were destined to fall in love in the tale, despite being proxies in a tournament that will require one of them to die, and I was excited to see what would happen to them. However, by the time I was halfway through the novel, I realized the book wasn’t the story of Marco and Celia. It is the story of the magical circus. The circus is the main character of the novel, and all of the wonderful “people” characters exist to tell the tale of the tournament’s venue. So I started to feel really cheated, because the plot of the book starts falling apart halfway through, with plot holes and inconsistencies that grow and grow to extremely high levels in the final third of the book, by which point I was skipping large chunks of text and skimming for dialogue, just looking forward to being done. It didn’t help that long sections of the story were narrated through the eyes of secondary characters, a situation that became increasingly troublesome to me by the final third of the book, because I never grew as attached to the secondary characters as I did to Celia and Marco. I really didn’t like that my emotional focus in this novel was meant to be wholly tied to the circus itself, because, while I liked the circus, the setting wasn’t why I was reading the book. I also wasn’t reading this story because I was invested in the secondary characters. I was reading for Celia and Marco. The menace and cruelty inflicted upon Celia and Marco, which made the beginning *so* exciting and wonderful to read, was completely dropped once the tournament actually began, and with the introduction of so many secondary characters – including a pair of young twins who perform with kittens, and introduce the reader to more and more adorable and whimsical parts of the circus – things instead became extremely cutesie. The second half of the book didn’t work for me, though I admit the story works fine as a fairy tale. In fairy tales, motives and back-stories need no explanation, the plot doesn’t need to make sense, and things happen because they happen, with no reason required. But what works in a fairy tale doesn’t work for me in a novel. I wanted the villains to have a point, or at least face a consequence or two. I wanted to have an explanation for why two powerful men would spend multiple lifetimes doing nothing more than challenging each other by proxy. I wanted to know why Prospero, a man so lacking in ethics that he would sacrifice his daughter in a pointless game, would need to peddle his powers as a magician on stage, rather than just taking money from people by force, or at least using his magic to get money without troubling himself doing shows. The author’s attempts to soften Prospero and Alexander in the second half of the book didn’t change the fact that they destroyed people for nothing more than their own pleasure, since they had nothing to gain in the tournament. That made them even worse to me, not kinder or gentler. I also wanted to know why there weren’t more magicians in the world, if “anyone” with a bit of an aptitude for using magic can learn a magician’s skills from books. (Just think of what companies would do with this “common” knowledge, how much money they could make!!) While much was made in the beginning about Celia learning to heal herself, this plot point had no bearing upon the story at all. Celia’s suffering during the tournament is never physical. She suffers grief, and she suffers a vague kind of ‘magician’s fatigue’ in using her magic sustaining the circus, which leads her to make strange and bizarre choices in the second half of the book that made no sense to me. I was sad that she never heals herself during the tournament, because the set-up for this plot point was wonderful. In one strange scene, the financial backer and initiator of the circus, a wealthy man named Chandresh, suffers some kind of delusional attack in which he believes he must murder Alexander. At the circus one night, Chandresh hurls a knife at Alexander, who sees the knife coming and steps aside, and then watches the knife plunge into the chest of the man standing beside him, Herr Thiessen. Herr Thiessen is a close friend of Celia’s, and Alexander was talking to him when Chandresh threw the knife. Herr Thiessen falls and dies, and there are a few other tense events that occur simultaneously (a bonfire sputters out extra smoke and some people cough, and a kitten takes a tumble, cries out, and needs extra petting to be soothed), but other than that, life goes on at the circus that evening without further drama, despite Herr Thiessen’s sudden and tragic death. Chandresh isn’t arrested, Alexander isn’t questioned, and no one wonders why a man suddenly died with a knife through his heart. I wanted to know why Alexander, a powerful magician who can manipulate objects at will, did not stop the knife. That seemed as evil as everything else he did in the story. But even though people die in this book, and Prospero and Alexander do dastardly things, in the end, no one is bad. The villains (Prospero, Alexander, and the accidental-murderer, Chandresh) are the three people who created the magical circus, so the reader is meant to understand they are all good guys in the end, even though they did so many diabolical things. The author kept steering the story away from the harshness of reality, into a vague and happy world where kittens jump through hoops, there’s never a shortage of caramel popcorn, and people are all good at heart, even when they are scorned, used, and betrayed. No one lashes out in this story, no one is enraged or vindictive, no one seeks justice for wrongs committed for fun. If you crave stories with magical settings, interesting characters, hazy (or nonexistent) plots, and happy endings, this story will give you intense satisfaction. I thought the first half of this novel was a 5-star read, but the second half was so nonsensical and unenjoyable to me, I would have stopped reading. But I was book-clubbing this novel with my wonderful friend, so I finished the story by skipping all of Bailey’s stand-alone sections, and all of the remaining stand-alone circus descriptions, and skimmed other secondary character sections for dialogue. So I did technically finish this novel, and overall, because the beginning was so lovely, I give the book 3 stars. But by the second half of the novel, because the author spent so much time with a pair of cutesie twins and their kittens, rather than dealing with her plot holes, I found myself feeling aggravated every time those oh-so-cute-and-adorable twins and their kittens appeared on the page. I really wanted to love The Night Circus, because the first half of the book was so enchanting, and Prospero and Alexander were so perfectly diabolical. But the author just didn’t follow through for me. She set up a plot that didn’t feel executed at all. But the author did find a way for the circus to live on forever, and delivered a big happy ending for every reader whose heart was tied to the circus (which is also a happy event for the human characters in the story). So this novel delivered a fairy tale thousands and thousands of readers fell in love with, and I wanted to be one of them, but I failed. Because my brain is a real jerk sometimes, and wouldn’t let go of the plot holes. So bring on the movie!! I can’t wait to see what they do with the screenplay!! *excited!!*...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Jun 12, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9361589-the-night-circus

It's a violent beginning, and the violence increases after the reader learns Jeff has ridden into this small New Mexico town because he's on the run from the law. Only a short time earlier, Jeff shot a man to death in Albuquerque, a shoot-out that also took the life of a woman Jeff had a major crush on, and might have been falling in love with, but Jeff fled the city without burying her corpse or doing anything for her, because he'd just murdered another man in cold blood.I admit that's not the most likeable trait in a western hero, and watching Jeff beat a stranger unconscious for lashing a horse was also troubling. After the man hits the ground, Jeff leaves some money for the animal with some other guy who happened to witness the beating, and then Jeff takes the man's horse and rides off with it. The beaten man, as you can probably guess, wakes up later, finds his horse has been stolen, and rides off to kill the horse thief, aka Jeff Cameron. But when the man reaches Jeff's camp, the stolen horse cries out, wakes Jeff from his sleep, and Jeff shoots the man dead. Once again, Jeff rides away, only this time, his victim's two brothers start tracking him down. Not only to avenge their dead brother, but to retrieve the stolen horse.The bulk of this novel sets out to prove that Jeff Cameron is really a great human being, despite getting an innocent woman killed and then not even bothering to bury her. As Jeff goes from town to town with this horse he has taken, everyone he meets instantly falls in love with him, male and female. Men befriend him, offer him their homes, food, and property. Women offer him food and sex. Animals also love him, not just horses but *all* animals, and their attraction to him is portrayed as an instantaneous connection as powerful as the attraction strangers have to him. Jeff has no trouble making money by gambling wherever he goes, and with all the help he receives from strangers he meets, many pages of the book are devoted to the warm meals Jeff enjoys, dozens of hours spent with hot coffee, leisurely cigarette smoking, and light conversations with the strangers who instantly bond with him. At 30 years old, Jeff is constantly described as a very young man with his whole life ahead of him, but a 39-year-old, attractive widow who takes Jeff in for a time is considered too old for him. Later, Jeff learns the woman is barren, which I think is meant to soften the blow that her advanced age makes her so unappealing to him. Much later, after Jeff begins having sex with this woman, and has grown fond of her regular visits to his bed, he discovers she might have killed her husband for cheating on her with a pair of young twins. I could completely understand not wanting to marry anyone who has murdered their former spouse, but Jeff learns this information after his opinions about the widow have already been formed, when the only significant drawback about the widow was her advanced age. Jeff has no problems having sex with an alleged murderess, since he makes it clear he never intended to marry her to begin with.By the time the two brothers catch up to Jeff, near the end of the novel, a number of innocent people are hurt and killed by these men out for vengeance. The story seems to pick up again, and I was waiting for Jeff's killer instincts to kick in, to prompt a big showdown -- since, unlike the other men Jeff had killed in the story, these two brothers were outright murderers with no one to stop them. However, Jeff doesn't ever stand up to these two vicious men -- he runs away from them. They murder and maim to steal back their dead brother's horse, and Jeff goes to great effort to steal the horse back -- but then flees. The two brothers give chase. For the rest of the book, more people are murdered or put into danger as Jeff runs away from the killers. Jeff never goes after them, only runs, until the horse he is on is permanently damaged, and his friends step in and do away with the savage killers hunting Jeff down.It was hard to know what to make of this book. The Jeff at the end of the story was very different from the Jeff at the beginning, but the change seemed unexplained. Why had Jeff been so quick to beat a stranger unconscious for striking a horse, and had thought nothing of shooting a man dead simply for wanting the same woman he did (the woman Jeff didn't bother to bury) -- but then later, when Jeff's friends are maimed and murdered in reprisal for Jeff's actions, he does nothing to stop the killers, and just runs away?  The author clearly wanted to subvert the usual tropes of a western novel -- for instance, by allowing the hero's friends to save the day, rather than the hero himself -- but I wish Jeff had taken a more active role in stopping the two murderers who were after him. The Jeff at the beginning of the book had no problem taking decisive and deadly action, beating and killing people as he saw fit, but he never returns to form at the end. Why did Jeff become someone who chose to flee from confrontation, rather than meeting it head-on and serving his own brand of violent justice? What caused Jeff to change so dramatically? I found no explanation for this. I would recommend ""La Grulla"" to anyone who enjoys reading westerns, especially westerns that break away from extremely predictable plotlines, and try to offer readers an ending very different from what they might expect. Also, if you enjoy books that really romanticize the Old West and the cowboy lifestyle, with lots of easy scenes involving good eats, hot coffee, and smokes, then this book will satisfy your craving for a simple life in the supposedly-simpler times of the American West. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jun 12, 2015",not set,"Jun 12, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20333031-la-grulla

It's silly, it's absurd, and so full of plot holes, reading this novel broke part of my brain. For three years, the 17-year-old main character, Lyric Walker, has lived next to a giant tent city full of the Alpha, or ""First Men,"" a race of undersea people who are like those bizarre and frightening fish people from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Some of the Alpha are ""hot"" though -- like the mermaid-Alpha, who are called the Sirena. All of the Alpha/First Men possess legs while on land. Even though these 30,000 Alpha have a plan of ""invasion of the mainland"" and feel no compassion or regard for humans, who they view as ""bottom feeders"" -- weak and unworthy in all ways -- the U.S. government has let them camp out for three years at Coney Island. Since the Alpha solve ALL problems with brutal fights with each other, including fights to the death (these First Men make hotheaded Klingon warriors caught in a berserker rage look like the most rational diplomats calmly having tea together in a Paris hotel) -- the presence of these hostile aliens from the sea has turned the beach at Coney Island into a militarized zone that is all-out horrifying to read about. Humans who befriend the Alpha in any small way end up dead, killed by the extremely racist and ignorant bigot *humans* of Coney Island.The human bigots are spearheaded by a supreme nutso named Governor Pauline Bachman, who the author seems to have modeled on the real-life ""Queen of the Tea Party"" Michele Bachmann. There was nothing subtle in the book about the obvious comparison.Even though the Alpha have nothing but disdain for humans, someone (and it's not clear who, but perhaps some ""bleeding-heart liberals"" in Washington, D.C. are to blame) decided it would be a good idea to start forcing Alpha teens to attend high school, so the two races can mix, or something. This part of the book made absolutely no sense, other than the author wanted to recreate the horrors of ending segregated schools in 1960s/1970s America. Which is great -- except black students in America actually *wanted* to get an education, and the Alpha ""students"" being forced into high school on Coney Island do NOT want to be there. At all. The Alpha don't like to be in buildings with roofs (even though they live in a tent city, and tents have roofs) and the Alpha want nothing to do with learning human ways. So there is an insta-love/insta-lust plotline that gives one Alpha prince named Fathom a reason to learn about human culture. Lyric tells us how beautiful Fathom's eyes are from a distance (it always bothers me when eye color is described from a distance -- it's hard enough to make out eye color when someone is standing only a few feet away), and after we have the eye-color-announcement-bond, Fathom is drawn to Lyric the way all good insta-love boys are drawn to YA heroines, by a force beyond their control. (Good old insta-love, what would so many YA novels do without you?)Even though human children are being murdered on Coney Island by bigot humans, and even though any of these bigots could go and shoot up the tent city of Alphas, for some reason, all-out hell doesn't start until the Alpha teens start school (which is also the start of the novel). That's when a KKK-esque group called the Niners gets going, and there's all kinds of crazy violence, including a school shooting, and a human boy is murdered, but for some reason, the violence is focused on the high school and the high school students, and none of the Niners goes into the tent city with automatic weapons to wipe out the Alpha (who are extremely hostile and violent inside the high school as well, throwing people around, one of them even murders a high school girl by cooking her to death). The novel works hard trying to ground the story and its violence in reality, but let's face it -- if a group of hostile alien invaders who had nothing but contempt for America showed up on shore, if the U.S. government didn't wipe them out with a firebomb, then the vigilante humans would. These violent, ignorant bigots (the Niners, the Bachman followers, and all the other crazy nutsos out to kill in this book) wouldn't wait for three years to pass and then start shooting up a high school and murdering sympathetic humans. They would shoot up the tent city and kill the Alpha.You might believe that this book is primarily focused on all the violence in the plot, and the conflict between the humans and the Alpha. You would be wrong. No, somehow, you're just supposed to take it in stride that this extreme violence in high school is a normal part of being an American teen, it's just violence with ""fish people"" instead of your typical school shootings, and in the meantime, Lyric spends hours and hours reading children's picture books aloud to Fathom, in an attempt to teach him to read, and there are long chapters about Lyric's BFF Bex, who lives with an abusive stepfather and has to be rescued from him a lot. Bex keeps going home (on her own insistence) to her domestic-abuse victim mother, and then becoming a domestic-abuse victim herself. These two things -- the reading lessons with picture books and Bex's home life -- consume a LOT of pages throughout the first two-thirds of the book. It got incredibly boring.The ending is meant to be a really long, really drawn-out, high-action sequence, but for me, the action dragged and dragged and dragged. A bunch of plot points are saved for the end, and they fell woefully short of exciting. Mostly, my brain kept screaming at me about how THREE YEARS had passed since the Alpha showed up, and yet -- no one knew this ""grand finale"" information before?? WHY NOT?? There was no reason why so much of the most important plot information was withheld until the very end of the novel. It just made everything seem even more silly and absurd than the middle third of the novel, which was already tedious. The Alpha culture was repulsive. In every way, this race of sea people was barbaric and brutal, mindlessly following a leader who they knew was wrong, but happy to spill innocent blood and kill nonetheless. The humans were equally repulsive. Not just the bigot whackos, but all the ""good"" humans willing to sacrifice children for the sake of whatever the purpose was of ""integrating"" the school system with teen Alpha who had no desire to be there.In the end, I saw no reason to care if the Alpha lived or died. I think Coney Island was definitely better off without them, since all they brought with them was death and destruction. I also saw no reason to care about anyone on Coney Island. This place was full of nastiness, a place that was racist and mean before the Alpha arrived, and then became a festering sore of bigots and ugliness that grew worse and worse by the end of the novel. I was hoping I'd fall in love with this book. I breezed through the first 70 pages with the hope it was going to be a great ride. I love YA fantasy novels. But ""Undertow"" didn't deliver the information I needed to suspend my disbelief. It didn't give me characters I could empathize with and love. It didn't give me anything I could root for. When I reached the last page, and discovered the story will be continued in a series, I closed the book with a chill in my heart. I won't be reading any more books about Lyric Walker.

Amal also attends a private high school. The novel begins on the day Amal embraces her compulsion to be ""more religious"" by wearing the hijab. On page 8, Amal states she wants to do this because ""I believe in Allah/God's commandments contained in the Koran."" However, the command for *all* women to wear the hijab isn't in the Quran -- though the novel NEVER clears this up. It was one of the many things that bothered me about this book. I think it would have been far more honest for Amal to state she wants to wear the hijab because her mother is veiled -- but Amal doesn't include that point on her list of reasons.Even though Amal's ""religious decision"" begins the story, there is actually very little about religion in the novel. The bulk of the story follows Amal through her school days and free time, shopping and snacking, chatting with friends, flirting/friending with boys, and being a stereotypical spoiled teenager with money to spend and a lot of free time on her hands. While Amal faces trouble sometimes for wearing a head scarf -- at school on occasion and once when she asks about getting a part-time job for ""extra pocket money"" -- the book really felt like it didn't have a central theme. Since Amal is wealthy, has a large and varied group of friends, a loving family, excellent grades, and teachers who truly care about her and look out for her, the stakes in this story were extremely low, religion was very much a side issue, and I found the book a chore to read. After 290 pages, I was in agony, and started skimming. One of the points the book *does* make about religion is the different ways people can interpret Islam (though the word ""interpret"" isn't used in this novel -- something that felt disappointing to me). On page 90, Amal is expressing aggravation over her friend Leila's ""village mother"" for wanting to force her teen daughter to marry instead of finishing high school. (Leila has a different socio-economic background than Amal, and goes to a different school. The two met before Amal began attending the private school.) To Amal, Leila's mother is not following ""Islam"" but backward ""cultural practices."" Amal states, ""I don't care about understanding Leila's mother. I'm not interested in all that psychology crap. When you have a kid [Leila] who knows more about your religion than you do and is smart enough to be anything she wants, then in my book you lose your right to excuses."" Does Amal ever realize that wearing the hijab is also ""a cultural practice"" rooted in a certain interpretation of Islam? Um, no. Pages and pages are spent on teen texting, parties, friendships, flirting, and first world problems (studying for exams, whether to sign up for a debate competition or not, wearing makeup and buying new clothes and spending hours on fixing your hair and reading magazines) -- but when it comes to deeper issues, the novel is very much ""religion lite."" The world ""politics"" is mentioned in passing, as a reason for terrorism, but this book is not at all political, nor does it make any points about economic privilege. Like the topic of religious interpretation on the whole, the novel is silent about the deep, dark matters of humanity and conflict, religious or otherwise. Amal has so many sweet and wonderful friends, including a guy with a crush on her, a guy she has a massive crush on in return, there was very little conflict anywhere in the book. The biggest issue Amal faces -- over and over -- is the battle to be ""thin"" and ""popular"" in her private school. SO much of this book centers on body weight, body image, eating, and diets -- this seemed a far bigger focus of the novel than wearing a head scarf. Amal and her friends battle body-image and popularity-issues throughout the novel. If you want a book that shows teen girls going to great lengths to be pretty by being thin -- to the point where one of Amal's friends starts smoking in order to suppress her appetite -- then this would be a great book to pick up.I believe the author focused so much on issues of body weight, beauty, and popularity in order to ""normalize"" the main character and make her seem like ""any other teen girl"" -- but I had the opposite reaction to Amal. She was spoiled, often rude, and had so many wonderful things in her life that her constant snarky complaints and snappy attitude turned me off. Amal was a very, very different protagonist than the narrator in ""Ten Things I Hate About Me"", who was lower-middle class, had complex siblings, a dead mother, and a father who drove taxis.I would recommend ""Does My Head Look Big in This?"" to anyone who wants a ""YA lite"" read that focuses on stereotypical first-world teen drama with bits of Islam sprinkled in. This book would be great for anyone who has never encountered a Muslim teen girl before and doesn't understand that a Muslim teen in a veil can ""act just like any other teen girl"" and that she can have other interests outside of religion, such as reading magazines, looking at boys, agonizing over food and popularity, and can also spend hours on her makeup and hair. However, if you already understand that Muslim teens are diverse, and that anyone in a head scarf can be a ""stereotypical teen girl"" despite wearing a veil, then you might be better off reading ""Ten Things I Hate About Me"" instead of this novel. I certainly did. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Apr 29, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/79876.Does_My_Head_Look_Big_In_This_

The author saved the finale with Dwight Towers and Moira Davidson for the last page, but it was John and Peter who gave me the strongest emotional impact, and earned the book 4 stars. The ending aside, the vast majority of this novel is quite dull. The setting is Melbourne, Australia, in 1963, two years after World War III. The entire northern hemisphere has been wiped out by nuclear bombs and fallout (which killed everyone quickly, in a matter of days), but -- two years later -- even surviving *Navy personnel* are clueless about what happened. Eighty pages into the book, during a submarine mission, a scientist and an officer ask the captain, So what caused World War III? We never really heard -- and the captain says, Well Albania bombed first and then Russia and China let loose and then America dropped all these cobalt bombs, yadda yadda yadda, for paragraphs on end. As if no one would have discussed the end of the world before now. For two years, everyone in Australia has been waiting for the fallout in the northern hemisphere to reach them and kill them, and yet, no one has discussed what happened, or even understands anything about the spreading radiation. How it kills, how you die from it. Nothing.The men in the submarine cruise around for two weeks and stare at some empty cities on shore, then go back to Australia and live in a calm state of waiting for the fallout to reach them and kill them in a few months. Everyone on the continent does the same. An entire continent full of people all face certain death the same way: calmly. No one does anything rash. A few people get drunk and stumble around. The police don't mind, adopting a motto of, it's the end of the world, what can you do? Really?Does anyone *really* think this is how an entire nation would react to pending doom? Just go on living normally, and a few people drink a bit more? While I understand that it was this continent-wide calm acceptance of death that made the novel so chilling when it was published in 1957, on a writing level, this book is a mess. Not only because I find the idea that no one would mobilize some kind of indoor-greenhouse-air-filtering-complex to survive in complete bollocks. The author's hypothesis that all of humanity would just shrug off annihilation like, ""yeah, we're all gonna die, but let's go sailing and drink some orangeade and plant a few tulips and have a little party with scones first"" -- even if I accepted this theory that this is how all of Australia would behave in the months before worldwide nuclear fallout destroyed human life, this novel was still a huge struggle to read.The dialogue is forced, useless adverbs clutter the prose, the plot is lacking (to say the least, unless you like reading about folks drinking orangeade and having little parties with scones), the characters are one-dimensional. Sexism is rampant, and I'm not just talking about inside the story, it's in the author's writing style too. ""On the Beach"" is your classic this-was-written-in-the-1950s type of book -- which amazes me even more that I read this book in class in 7th grade -- circa 1992, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union. This book was my 7th grade class read and it is not even an example of good writing. On every level of sentence craft, this book is plodding and flat.While I understand it's unfair to criticize classics for sexism, what I DO criticize the book most for is the lack of good science. The military-scientific alliance in the 1940s made use of drones in testing atmospheric radiation levels in the mushroom clouds of test bombs -- and yet, it's like this book was written in a world without drones. Submarines can send out drones to test the air -- but drones are entirely absent from this novel. Also, radio connections destroyed by atmospheric pulsing can be repaired. We had great radio tech in the '50s. But this book is like, well, it's been months since WWIII, and we can still replace the nuclear reactors on our subs here in Australia, refuel our ships, but using radios to communicate with our citizens? Share news about what happened in WWIII and what dying from radiation poisoning will be like? Nope, none of that.This book is just not realistic at all. Would some people calmly accept death by nuclear fallout and do nothing? Sure. *SOME* people would do that. Would some people be so uninterested in the details of WWIII and their own pending doom as to plant tulips and drink orangeade and not bother with a radio or news or trying to survive the coming fallout? Sure. *SOME* people would be head-in-the-sand do-nothings. But an entire continent? I'm glad Nevil Shute's novel scared the sh*t out of people when it was published, especially folks like JFK, who had his finger on the trigger, sweating bullets, because OMG COMMIES OMG.I'm glad this book had an impact. Absolutely.But as a piece of creative writing, as a work of craft, I really struggled with boredom reading this story.One of the main characters is the mother of an infant. She spends her time being a classic '50s wife, fretting over the baby and household concerns, chatting on the telephone, and ""not worrying her head"" too much about the coming fallout or what her husband is finding out while he's touring the fallout zones in his submarine. She doesn't care about ""how equipment works"" or ""the science"" involved in the pending doom. This is exactly what I found most unrealistic in this novel. Most parents I know would be eager to join together with other people to design and build some kind of structure that might help their children survive, even if the odds were against them. The sci-fi novel ""Wool"" for instance -- that's a book with a much more realisitc vision of how humanity would react if the globe's air supply became too toxic to survive life in the open. Even if living in an underground city is impossible, people would still at least TRY to make it work. Necessity is the mother of invention, and it's amazing what people can create when their lives, and the lives of their children, are at stake.""On the Beach"" isn't trying to adhere to reality though -- it was written to make the reader mourn the end of all life on the planet, to make the reader grieve so much needless destruction, and to force people to understand that nuclear war would have far more consequences than most people realize.There is very little science in the book, and I didn't feel strongly for any of these characters. Even so, I was moved at the end of the novel. I found myself deeply grateful that the horrible ruin described in ""On the Beach"" has not come to pass. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Apr 24, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38180.On_the_Beach

Reza Aslan provides a""No God But God"" (published in 2005) is a brilliant and beautiful book, extremely well-written, with cogent and lucid arguments. Reza Aslan provides a history of Islam that is easy to read and highly enjoyable. His final chapter, ""Slouching Toward Medina,"" contains important information concerning the current Islamic Reformation, which Aslan maintains is currently underway, and has been since the collapse of colonialism in the 20th century. Aslan discusses the vital difference between secularism (""an ideology based on the eradication of religion from public life"") and secularization (""a historical evolution in which society gradually frees itself from 'religious control and closed metaphysical worldviews'""). He posits that the United States is ""a secularizing country, unapologetically founded on a Judeo-Christian--and more precisely Protestant--moral framework."" So the separation of Church and State in the U.S. is ""not so much the foundation of American government as it is the result of a two-hundred-fifty-year secularization process based not upon secularism, but upon pluralism."" Why is this so important to know? Because ""it is pluralism, not secularism, that defines democracy."" Meaning that a democratic society can certainly be founded upon an Islamic morality (much the same way the U.S. is founded upon a Protestant Christian morality)--as long as that democratic society is dedicated to following ""the unavoidable path toward political secularization.""The book's message, historical analysis, and thesis are equally informative and hopeful, shedding light on the darkest issues that haunt the world's theocratic authoritarian states. Middle Eastern countries opposed to secularism can focus instead upon a process of secularization--which allows them to maintain their Islamic moral framework and still allow for human rights and democracy. That still means that the dictators and oligarchs in charge of the repressive Islamic regimes of the world must lose their power, in order for democracy to take hold in those places--but Aslan's book provides a way for Islamic democracy to emerge organically in each location. Not because secularism has been enforced, cutting off religion from public life--because Aslan makes it clear Islamic morality is fully compatible with pluralism. Islamic democracy is not only the history of the Prophet Muhammad's community of Muslims in Medina, but also the future of Islam, once the ""false idols"" of ""bigotry and fanaticism"" have been cleansed away, and Islamic societies return to ""Muhammad's original vision of tolerance and unity.""

The plot twists are all very obvious and broadcast early on in the novel, though I won't reveal spoilers here.I wish I could give this book a higher rating, since it was easy to read and was meant to be very silly and fun, with more of a middle grade style than YA, though I was so bored by the final pages, I almost didn't finish. I expected to love this book because everyone I know has loved this book, but aspects of the story made me so enraged, I'll have to pass on reading the sequels. The concept of the story -- a retelling of Cinderella as a cyborg mechanic, set in a futuristic place called ""New Beijing"" -- is TOTALLY awesome. I loved the premise, I just wish I'd loved the execution.My problems with the novel focused on a few key areas that made no sense, completely defied reality as well as human nature, and made people who I was supposed to sympathize with reprehensible. I'll list my grievances, and try to be quick, since the longer I contemplate this novel, the more aggravated I feel.My first big problem with ""Cinder"" is that, while it is set in a place called New Beijing, the setting feels more like a futuristic Europe or United States, not an actual Asian setting. At one point, there are some dumplings mentioned, a Buddha statue, and there is a big party decorated with crimson paper lanterns and ""folding silk screens hand painted with designs of cranes"" -- but these details are so superficial and inconsequential, this book didn't succeed in taking me to another culture, or a culture that was supposed to be a blend of East and West. My definition of ""culture"" runs a lot deeper than table decorations, food choices, and speaking your surname before your given name. New Beijing is a tag line, and nothing more.My second huge issue is why in the world the people of New Beijing and the rest of this future world ever developed such a hatred of cyborgs, to the point where these human beings are considered completely disposable second-class citizens. The cyborgs in this novel have no powers, abilities, or advantages that would make them an ""other"" -- these cyborgs were simply human beings who had suffered accidents, and had their missing body parts replaced with (unexplainably heavy) metal limbs. The cyborgs in ""Cinder"" weren't a separate race -- they were regular people who needed prosthetic limbs and other body parts to replace human tissues that had been damaged or destroyed. Basically, the book is saying that, in the future, if your mother/father/brother/sister/best friend was in a terrible car accident, lost their right arm, and was given a fully-functional metal arm that they could control using their own thoughts, you would suddenly see this previously beloved person as unworthy scum. The medical technology used to replace your family member or friend's missing body part would make that person less human, and so unworthy of any common decency that if the state decided to kill this person (as happens in ""Cinder""), you would turn your family member or friend over for state-sanctioned execution without shedding a tear. Here in the real world, in 2015, scientists are working SO HARD to develop artificial limbs that people can control with their minds -- just like scientists have worked SO HARD inventing pacemakers and cochlear implants and (non-heavy) prosthetic limbs that allow maximum movement with minimal stress. But somehow, in the future, the human race will look at all of this medical technology as revolting. If you need a pacemaker, a prosthetic leg, or metal screws to hold your bones together -- well, prepare to be viewed as the equivalent of an African American slave in 19th century America. Your altered body has made you scum, and no one will protest your murder -- not your family, not your friends, and certainly not the royalty in charge of New Beijing.Why is the royalty of New Beijing allowing cyborgs to be killed? Well, because there is a lethal disease called letumosis, the blue fever, that has developed into a ""worldwide pandemic"" and there are now ""hundreds of thousands dead."" The cause of letumosis is unknown, as is the cure. Letumosis kills its victims in a number of days, usually three or four. Now, even though *hundreds* of people in New Beijing contract this disease every week, the government has decided all of those dying people aren't sufficient for testing an antidote. In the entire world, only ONE doctor is working on a cure for letumosis, a man who lives in New Beijing, and he has decided that he would prefer to infect healthy cyborg-humans with letumosis, and then test his antidote creations on their quickly-dying bodies, rather than go to the warehouse packed full of the soon-to-be-dead letumosis victims who contracted the disease in public.So this doctor is performing state-sanctioned murder in the name of medical research, and there are no protests, no revolts, and no rage against the horrors perpetuated by the monarchy. Because human beings with prosthetic limbs are worth so little, killing them means less than squashing a spider or killing a cow for a cheeseburger. I bring this issue up because Prince Kai, the Prince Charming in the book, is allowing these murders to happen. This is one aspect of his behavior that made him reprehensible.But his behavior gets even worse -- because the state takes everyone who contracts letumosis out of their homes, and stuffs them into a huge, open-room warehouse that smells really terrible, actually stinks of rotting flesh, and those sick people lie on hard beds with inadequate blankets, shivering, and staring into space while waiting to die. No music, no TV, no visits from family or friends or pets, no comforting food or drink, no medicines to soothe their pain, these people simply lie on a hard bed with a cheap blanket and wait out the days until their heart stops. Androids (little robots called med-droids) move around between the hard beds, and as soon as someone dies, the robots slice open the person's wrist and remove their ID chip. Then the mutilated corpses get packed up on carts, in heaps, and carried away, probably to a mass grave. There is no lock on any of the warehouse doors, either to enter or exit, and the smell of rotting flesh is so strong, Cinder can smell it before she goes inside the building. And yet, none of the letumosis victims ever flees this Complete Den of Evil, and no one demands they would rather die in comfort at home. Even more astounding is the fact that NO ONE comes to inspect this warehouse and make it clear that this vile building is a human rights violation, and that the med-droids are providing THE WORST HOSPICE CARE EVER. I've had my share of caring for the dying, and hospice care is not something I take lightly. No matter what culture or disease you are examining -- whether it's modern-day or ancient leprosy, the AIDS outbreak, bubonic plague, or even the more recent ebola crisis in Africa -- there are always, ALWAYS human beings who tend to the dying with love and mercy, even when it puts them at risk of dying themselves. If someone I loved contracted letumosis in New Beijing, I would NEVER turn them over to the state. No one deserves to die the way these people in the book die -- packed into a warehouse that stinks of rotting flesh. Lying there in pain, alone, with only the moans of other people dying in pain to fill their ears. I would keep my loved one at home, and strap on a suit with an air mask to care for them, like an ebola patient. Does Cinder ever confront Prince Kai about this deplorable warehouse situation? Does she ever tell him that these med-droids are not alleviating suffering, and that this warehouse is a complete LIVING HELL for the dying? No. Cinder never raises one word of protest. The warehouse remains open, and there is absolutely *no* outrage ever expressed by anyone concerning this horror. I stopped caring for New Beijing and all of the characters in this book when no one denounced this warehouse as evil and wrong. Any group of people with access to such amazing technology as New Beijing has, but who would treat their dying loved ones like this, with the sort of hospice care I would expect from Hitler, IS NOT A SOCIETY I'M GOING TO CARE ABOUT. That included Cinder and Prince Kai, but especially Prince Kai, because he had the power to close that House of Hell and provide his dying subjects with decent hospice care, but no one ever once looked at the situation as wrong.The unexplainable cyborg discrimination, the cyborg murders, and the Warehouse of Hell led me to have other, related problems with the book, but the only other issue I'll mention is my disappointment with Cinder's role as a mechanic. I was looking forward to Cinder using some really cool, really interesting futuristic technology in the book, but the only real mechanical details in the novel are given to a modern-day (""antique"") car with a combustion engine. In a world full of hovercraft and maglev tech, Cinder sets about to fix up a vehicle that isn't futuristic at all. More than once, she fixes handheld tech devices and other equipment by simply smacking them on a table. That's pretty much the extent of her skills. Cinder was a massive disappointment as a mechanic. The character Juliette, in the sci-fi novel ""Wool"" -- *SHE* was a BRILLIANT mechanic. I was hoping Cinder would be similar to Juliette, but Cinder's mechanical skills were as developed as the New Beijing setting. Off-scene, she fixes up an old car to use as a getaway vehicle, even though New Beijing citizens don't travel on the ground anymore. So not only would Cinder stand out and be easily targeted by the police tracking her down, she'd probably get arrested just for driving an old gas-guzzler on a street made for maglev vehicles. I realize most readers aren't concerned about hospice care, a realistic approach to human nature, or realistic medical research in a YA fantasy novel. ""Cinder"" is a reimagined fairy tale, and is supposed to operate in a fairy-tale world, where things don't have to make sense. Princes are handsome, rich, and single, fairy godmothers appear with sparkly wands, and magic saves the day.So if you can read ""Cinder"" strictly as a fairy tale, this book is great. My problem was that all of the sci-fi elements made me read the book as sci-fi, not a fairy tale, and the lack of logic in the major plot points of the novel put my brain into a meltdown of outrage and horror. After reading about such terrible things going on in New Beijing, I couldn't bring myself to care about a silly dress and a ball and whether Cinder would get to dance with Prince Kai or not. The fairy tale elements of Cinderella just fell apart beneath the weight of what a horrible futuristic world New Beijing was. This is not a society I want any part of, and if the author hoped to scare me about handing over hospice care to med-droids, and what kind of horrors would await the dying in such a scenario, then mission accomplished. But I'm pretty certain that's not what the author intended at all, or the characters would have pointed this out....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Apr 14, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11235712-cinder

I found this novel in a search for Young Adult mermaid books, but I would classify this as middle grade fiction, since the protagonist, Sapphire (or ""Sapphy"" as she is most frequently called), seems to be in fourth or fifth grade.The great bulk of this novel takes place on land, on the coast of Cornwall, where Sapphy lives with her family. One day, her father goes missing at sea, and is later pronounced dead, though his body is never recovered.The question of whether Sapphy's father is actually alive or not drives the plot of this book, though the reader is certain the whole time that her father *is* still alive, which makes it feel like the book has no plot at all. We follow Sapphy through her normal life on land, coping with her father's disappearance and her mother's financial struggles now that the breadwinner of their household is gone. While Sapphire feels drawn to the sea, quite some time passes before she actually meets a young Mer boy named Faro, and Faro shows her how to breathe underwater for the first time.After that first trip underwater, another long section of story passes by before Sapphy swims with Faro again. I enjoyed these two fleeting scenes of Sapphy and Faro underwater, but they felt incredibly brief in comparison to the rest of the book, which is mostly pages and pages of Sapphy's life on land, interacting with her mother and brother and neighbors. By the time the book arrives at something resembling action and danger, with Sapphy and her brother actually doing something, it felt like a delightful surprise, but it also felt a bit like too little, too late. I wish the entire novel could've focused more on the undersea world, and featured more of the action that seems to jump out of nowhere at the end. As to Sapphy's father, even though his disappearance drives the plot of the novel, the reader is no more informed at the end of the book than they are at the beginning. The father never reappears, but we know Sapphy is certain he did survive somewhere underwater, which is the same thing the reader already knows through the entire story. If you want to see Sapphy's father again, you'll have to read the many sequels, as I'm sure she decides in the future books to go and find him underwater, in the undersea world of Ingo.Having read a few other YA mermaid novels now, I think the writing in ""Ingo"" is better than many of the books in this genre on offer. It was also a relief to read a book about the Mer that didn't star a male Mer sexually obsessed with a female human, or obsessed with a half-Mer/half-human female, a la ""Twilight"" (a Twilight that stars a merman instead of a vampire). Those types of stories seem to dominate this genre. So if you're burned out on that Mer trope, you'll be happy to know that there is *NO* romance in ""Ingo"" -- other than Sapphy's lonely single mom trying to date again, which is a very different situation than a love story involving a protagonist. Besides, Sapphy is so young, if a male Mer become obsessed with her, the guy would be a complete pedophile. There is no creepy sexual subtext going on in this novel, and that's a relief. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Apr 13, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1022657.Ingo

""Atlantia""""Atlantia"" is a YA fantasy novel that plays with elements of Mer stories (or stories about merpeople) without actually being about the Mer. ""Atlantia"" depicts a future world in which air pollution has driven societies all over the world to create underwater cities, or cities encapsulated in thick walls that allow humans to breathe cleaner air underwater than they would on land. Don't ask me why the humans didn't simply build this air-filtering equipment inside thick, toxin-proof walls on land, rather than under the water, as there is no scientific explanation given for anything in this novel. The story features a lot of common Mer tropes, such as calling the central underwater city in the story Atlantia, and giving the characters water names. For instance, the main character is a 20-year-old female named Rio, her twin sister's name is Bay, their mother's name is Oceana, and their aunt's name is Maire, which is one of the ways to write the word ""Mer.""Maire is labeled a ""sea witch"" in the novel, though her magic is very limited. This isn't a woman with the powers of Ursula in Disney's The Little Mermaid. Maire is a siren -- another trope Mer stories feature. Mermaids are frequently described as having voices that lure seamen to their deaths and make people do their bidding, and explains why mermaids are often portrayed as amoral or immoral in stories.In ""Atlantia,"" Maire doesn't use her voice to kill people, but she can certainly influence people, up to a (very limited) point. In the first chapter, the reader is told that Rio is also a siren, one who has always been taught to repress the power of her speaking voice, and the novel follows Rio as she (somewhat) embraces her siren gift and (sort of) learns how to use it. The book could be loosely compared to watching Elsa ""let it go"" in Frozen, only without any singing, dramatic action, strong emotion, or adventure. In the first three chapters, I really disliked how the novel didn't stay in scene very long -- there was a constant jumping to backstory, and the backstory involved lots of direct dialogue, which confused me, because I thought I was in scene when I wasn't. The prose style of ""Atlantia"" is very pedestrian and uncomplicated (there are no breathtaking turns of phrase in this book, no poetic language at all)--but the first three chapters were still challenging because of the constant jumping into long sections of backstory.Also, though we expeience the story only through Rio's eyes, her emotions are so muted, unclear, and inexplicable, it was hard to feel anything for her, or care what happens to her. In the very first chapter, the reader is told that it has been Rio's dream since childhood to escape the underwater city of Atlantia and live on land. Rio and her twin sister Bay are allowed to choose--only once--where they will spend the rest of their adult lives: will they go up to land, or stay underwater forever in Atlantia? Only one of them can choose land, a rule all families in Atlantia must follow.Bay knows choosing land has always been Rio's dream, but then Bay steals Rio's choice, and picks land before she can.In an instant, Bay is gone, ushered up to the Above, and Rio is left with nothing. Orphaned, and with no other siblings or friends whatsoever, Rio's closest family member has suddenly betrayed her, but instead of feeling outraged by this cruel betrayal, Rio spends a lot of time crying, desperately missing Bay, and feeling lost. Anger never crosses her mind. Near the end of the book, Rio is finally given an explanation as to why Bay did this to her--but the reasoning is so flimsy and ridiculous, it was easily the lamest piece of plot in the novel. Bay's justification was even worse than the dastardly, murderous villain of the book, who kills and kills with abandon, and then gets dropped from the story as if this primary villian had never existed. The villain in ""Atlantia"" is given no consquences whatsoever, since the reader turns a page near the end of the book, and the villain is just never mentioned again. It was like the author forgot to tell us what happened. Logic is not employed in this book, nor are the elements of science fiction. Of the major plot points that bothered me most, I would have to say the disconnect between the people on land and the people living underwater was the greatest. The people underwater are the descended family members of the people currently living on land, and yet the author portrays the land humans as treating the underwater citizens as a completely different race.I'm sorry, but if land people today sent their children to live in an underwater city for several generations, no one would forget that they ""gave up"" their precious children and grandchildren to live and work underwater. If, however, the people sent to live underwater had originally been a different race of people than the people on land-- if the land people had captured and enslaved a different race of people to live in Atlantia-- then I could totally understand the diconnect between the two groups in this novel. BUT. That wasn't the case. These people were all family members, bonded directly by blood, and the elements of racism simply made NO SENSE in this book. Even if a few of the underwater people developed the voices of sirens, like Rio and Maire, and could manipulate people while speaking, they are still the descended family members of the people Above. ""Atlantia"" is solidly in the fantasy realm, even though there are no Mer, no magical sea creatures, and no details about living in the sea. If you want a book that explores life in the ocean, or what it's like to be Mer, this is not the book you are looking for.If you want a story about a quiet young woman with no friends, who spends a lot of time proclaiming she doesn't trust her aunt but actually hangs on her aunt's every word, a young woman who sort-of-I-guess falls in love with a guy while she struggles to reconnect with her sister, and does a lot of things that don't add to the plot, with a villain who just gets dropped at the end of the book like the author forgot there was a murderous villain killing people with abandon in the story -- if this sounds like your thing, then this is the book you are waiting for. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 10, 2015",not set,"Apr 10, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17731926-atlantia

It feels terrible to have to admit that, and go against the grain of so many rave s and awards and gushing praise for this book, so I want to explain as best I can why I felt nothing for either one of these two main characters, and didn't use up boxes of tissues weeping in delirium by the time I arrived at the end.I also don't want to spoil the plot of this novel for anyone who hasn't yet read it, so I'll avoid spoilers.The novel begins with these words, written in memoir-style by the main character, who is a captured female Scottish spy with the code name Verity: ""I am a coward. I wanted to be heroic and I pretended I was. I have always been good at pretending.""The root of my biggest problem with this novel is right there in the opening words -- Verity has already made it absolutely clear that she is an unreliable narrator, and that the reader can't trust a word she is writing. She has been captured by the Gestapo, and is writing a novel about her life while they interrogate her, and Verity tells us that she is giving up lines of code in order to get her clothes back, and avoid the worst forms of torture.When a narrator tells her reader -- which is the Nazi Gestapo reading her novel -- that she has ""always been good at pretending"" and is giving up ""sets of wireless of code"" in exchange for her clothing, as well as paper and pen to write a novel of her life -- well, as far as I was concerned as a reader, this was a recipe for my own personal agony. For the next 200 pages (almost 2/3 of the novel) I knew I was reading a bunch of lies and make-believe, as Verity spun her tale for the Gestapo to read. It aggravated me a lot, since it seemed obvious that of course she would be lying about everything she printed for her torturers to read. I felt frustrated that we never got a break from reading Verity's novel, so I could have some kind of scope on the extent of her lies and adjust to the story better. The author obviously intended the reader to read the novel twice, as if the reader didn't already understand that Verity is playing a game of ""gotcha"" here. Well, I understood that perfectly well on the first page, and 200 pages of ""gotcha"" made for highly unenjoyable reading.Why? Because I couldn't emotionally bond with a main character who was lying to me the whole time. There was no trust between myself and Verity, and that was deadly to me as a reader. Verity also shares several stories she was never even a witness to, stories that only involve her friend Maddie's life, further shredding any belief I could have that she was telling me something true.And here is my second-biggest problem with this story: I could never buy into the idea that the Nazi Gestapo would let a captured secret agent spend her hours in captivity writing a NOVEL. Especially since Verity's novel is full of anecdotal stories about her youth and her family, as well as the coming-of-age history of her friend Maddie, the female pilot who was shot down along with Verity in October 1943, shortly before Verity was captured. Verity tells us on p.57 and 58 that her interrogators recognize that she is writing a novel, and that they know she is writing about herself in the third person. In her stories, Verity frequently describes herself as extremely beautiful and gifted with extraordinary intelligence. And when she recounts her interactions with her Nazi interrogators, she is amazingly defiant despite her own mutilation and torture, and possesses the same laugh-in-the-face-of-death bravery of James Bond. On p.57, Verity yells at her most brutal interrogator, ""I am not English, you ignorant Jerry bastard, I am a SCOT."" I'm certain that this is one of the places in her narrative that is absolutely true, which means, not only is Verity actually saying these things, but then she's recording them for the Gestapo to re-experience while reading her novel, which she peppers with lines like, ""YOU STUPID NAZI BASTARDS"" (p. 5).Verity is clearly a superhuman superhero, a Wonder Woman James Bond, and this explains why so many readers love Verity's character so much. Personally, I couldn't stomach this main character's penchant for writing about herself in the third person about how brilliant and gorgeous she is, but to each their own. My issue with reading all of this was: WHY WOULD THE NAZI GESTAPO EVER LET A CAPTURED SPY WRITE A NOVEL? This is late 1943, and the war was going downhill for Germany by late 1943. Things were starting to look bleak. If they had a captured Scottish spy, they would want code, operation details, names, and coordinates. Not stories about a girl's coming-of-age during the war along with her best friend.The premise of the Nazi Gestapo allowing Verity to write a novel while she was being tortured for code never made sense to me. There was no justification given for this, other than one interrogator noting on p.57 that Verity is ""making use of suspension and foreshadowing"" in her tale. Which I suppose was meant to convey that he was enjoying her coming-of-age story so much, he was content to let her keep writing so he could keep reading it. Um. Ohhhhh--kaaaaayyy. There is also the fact that Verity is So Extremely Gorgeous that the interrogator might have been utterly charmed by her, and therefore didn't see her as an object, as an ""other"" to use, abuse, and dispose of as quickly as possible, and that he allowed her to keep writing a novel because he still saw her as a human being. Even though he is torturing her and other prisoners around her in gruesome ways.The author's given explanations of the interrogator being spellbound and charmed by Verity's novel worked for a great many readers who loved this book. For me, however, they were far too weak to support the level of believability I needed. The idea that the Nazi Gestapo would allow a captured spy to write a novel in late 1943 was not sufficiently justified, and contributed to the agony I felt in knowing I was reading a made-up story about WWII. I already knew Verity was lying nonstop, and the premise of the novel-writing was a flimsy fabrication, not something I could ever realistically believe ever happened.As a side note to that train of thought -- it doesn't bother me that the author made up many elements of the story -- such as the names of airfields and the name of the city in France where Verity was captured -- because I expect novels to have that kind of license. But to fail to justify the set-up of the story adequately wasn't a make-believe element I could be on board with as a reader. A third major problem I had with the novel involved the fact that ""Code Name Verity"" is labeled and marketed as a YA (Young Adult) novel. However -- Verity tells us on p.8 that Maddie is 16 years old in 1938, which means she is 21 in late 1943 -- when Verity and Maddie are shot down, and the events of the story take place. While Verity does pen several anecdotes involving a teenage Maddie, as well as anecdotes involving Verity's own teenage self, we know that Verity and Maddie are roughly the same age. So here is my issue: these are two young women in their early twenties -- and they do NOT classify as YA narrators. On a personal level, it feels very unjust and wrong that this novel was labeled YA, and won so many prestigious YA awards, when the main characters are outside the publishing demographic for the YA category, which is targeting young people between the ages of 13 and 18.In a similar vein to this point, I winced at the way Verity makes it clear on p.136 that she hasn't been raped during her torture and imprisonment. In the context of history, this dismissal of rape felt very false, like I was being coddled as a reader because I was ""reading YA."" It's made clear at the very beginning of the novel that Verity is ""giving up code"" in order to get her clothes back, and that she is also extremely beautiful. In real life, rape is always the first tool used in war, and quite often used in torture, a violation performed against women as well as men, but especially women. I have many speculations as to why the author made it a point to include a firm dismissal of the possibility of Verity's rape. Most of my theories center on the author's portrayal of Verity as a tough-as-nails-badass-female-James-Bond (because James Bond would never be forced to suffer ""the indignity"" of having his anus violated by one of his torturers) and also this issue of coddling the reader due to the story being classified as YA. There were two places in the book that read very quickly for me, and gripped my heart. The first involves the death of a young French girl, which Verity records in her novel. I thought that scene was very well done. The second heart-wrenching situation takes place in the final third of the novel, when Maddie takes over as narrator, and is keeping a journal of her war efforts while trapped in France. Maddie describes a raid to try to rescue some prisoners on a bus, and the Nazis start killing people, and then mutilate two men in a very horrific way. My heart ached for those men, because they survive and get loaded back up on the bus.The point of that scene, however, is to illustrate one of the novel's main points: how death is humane, and can be viewed as a noble rescue. I don't disagree with that point, and think it was a good and powerful statement for the novel to make. However, given that theme, the fact that those two men were NOT rescued with a humane death, their mutilation was especially haunting, and especially horrifying to witness. I felt the same way watching those two men as I did watching ""12 Years a Slave,"" in which Solomon Northup is rescued from Hell, while Patsey remains -- very much alive, very much subject to the continued torture and mutilation of her body at the hands of her captors.  I think ""Code Name Verity"" should have been classified as literary fiction, because I thought this novel demanded a lot from the reader. If I had read this book as a teenager, 80% of this story would have gone over my head. There was SO MUCH inferencing I had to do, both in terms of period detail and cultural knowledge (especially concerning British and Scottish history, their class system, language styles, and military networks), that I could never have made sense of much of this book as a teen. The disjointed storytelling, and the type of prose this book uses, would have been far beyond my reading abilities at 16 or 17. ""Code Name Verity"" isn't written like (the YA novels) ""We Were Liars"" or ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone,"" which both display a large amount of poetry in their sentence construction as well as in their use of simile and metaphor. ""Code Name Verity"" is a bit more like reading Alice Munro, in that Verity's novel is like a bunch of linked short stories tied together somewhat chronologically -- though I think Ms. Munro's prose displays more of a phonetic poetry in each line than ""Code Name Verity"" does. The inferencing level is often the same though, which is why I think this novel should have been labeled literary fiction, rather than YA. ""Code Name Verity"" dealt with big subjects -- war, torture, female spies, female pilots, female friendship -- and for that, I give the book 3 stars. I never bonded with either main character though, and reading Verity's unreliable-narrator-novel was like putting my brain on a cheese grater. This is a book I'm glad I read, so I can understand for myself what all of the fuss is about, and I would never discourage anyone else from reading it, because this book swept up so many major YA awards, and it will be made into a movie. The problems I had with the structure of this book will probably all disappear when it transitions to film, so I look forward to seeing ""Code Name Verity"" in theaters. Instead of Verity telling me over and over that she is beautiful, I'll just be able to see her on screen. Instead of all the events in Verity and Maddie's lives unfolding as backstory, I'll witness them in real time. And maybe the screenplay will give me a solid explanation as to why the Nazi Gestapo is letting a captured spy pen a novel in late 1943. That would be great.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 16, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11925514-code-name-verity

(Though it always helps to have high stakes and a strong plot in a book, of course.) The Age of Innocence is gripping because Edith Wharton is gripping — she employs a high form of irony at every turn of the page, and Newland Archer is himself a victim of “the patriarchy” as much as the “vapid May Welland” and “the dashing Ellen Olenska” both are. I love that. *LOVE* Because in real life, the lines are all blurred, and people who benefit most from “the patriarchy” are often also victims of the privilege and power structures that outwardly help them – and I like stories that deal with this duality.(And by “victims of privilege” I mean the psychological and emotional price of power and privilege — not so much a physical toll, such as lacking food, housing, safe drinking water, etc.)I found the story enchanting and timeless, one of those tales that is true in any era. The final chapter is so incredibly brilliant — those are the words that transform Newland Archer’s story from the tale of one man into the tale of any generation, and make this novel the Pulitzer Prize-winning tour de force that it is. *LOVE*...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jan 16, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53835.The_Age_of_Innocence

Would they be adopted by a kind and loving family, or would they face a childhood and adolescence of hard labor and servitude?” If you want more information about why these orphan trains were invented, and why hauling children out of cities into the rural countryside to be “adopted” by strangers was ever put into practice — well, you need to read the “About the Book” section after the novel, because that information isn’t woven into the story. And just so we’re all clear: many of these children were “adopted” by people who used them as slave labor. That is why this novel’s premise is so compelling — this is child slavery we’re talking about, and the horrors abound. However. This story is solidly women’s fiction, and it’s designed to be warmly uplifting, hopeful, and layered with wave after wave of redemption. Anger and outrage are not to be found in these pages. Resentment and fury aren’t conducive to the constant lemons-into-lemonade message pounded into this story. The main character of the novel, Vivian Daly, age 91 in 2011, recounts her journey as an orphan train rider in 1929. As a child, Vivian suffers terribly, experiences a number of horrors during the early years of her girlhood after losing her family, and then one day, by age ten or eleven, a decent middle-class family finally takes her in, and the rest of her girlhood, adolescence, and young adulthood is ordered, predictable, safe, and calm. At age 21, Vivian is magically reunited with her true love, a young man she met briefly as a young child, and two years later, Vivian suffers hardship again, but at the age of 91, she finds a wonderful happy ending. All is roses. The other narrator is a seventeen-year-old Penobscot Indian in foster care. Her name is Molly. While this is a fascinating narrative choice, and I commend the author for placing a Native American child into a place of prominence in her book, I found Molly’s voice, behavior, and emotional fortitude so incredibly unbelievable as a 17-year-old Penobscot Indian who’s grown up in foster care and who has no support network whatsoever that I was glad Molly’s narrative sections were much shorter than Vivian’s. Molly’s life plays a much smaller role in this novel, and I was very grateful for that, because nothing about Molly’s character felt true to her background. She read like a sad white girl to me, not like a child of mixed heritage who’s grown up in extremely un-ideal circumstances, facing poverty, loss, and abandonment issues all her life. But books are much more than their plots. There is also craft to consider, and the writing in this novel is very pedestrian. These paragraphs don’t zing, zip, or swerve with brilliant lines or great insights. These sentences don’t possess flavor or phonetic music as you read. There aren’t gorgeous similes and metaphors to make the reader pause with delight and read them again. This is a tale you read to learn what it felt like to be an orphan train rider, not a tale you read for stunning craft. Which is fine. I don’t have a problem with pedestrian prose, as long as the story itself is compelling enough. However. The author begins the book with a Prologue, and the first sentence of the novel is, “I believe in ghosts.” We are in Vivian’s point of view (since this novel is really her story, not Molly’s). As to the ghosts, Vivian continues, “Sometimes these spirits have been more real to me than people, more real to me than God. They fill the silence with their weight, dense and warm, like bread dough rising under cloth.” The Prologue is the most beautifully written section of text in the novel. These are all powerful statements, written with literary flair (I even quoted a line using a simile — another example of how this one-page Prologue is such a departure from the rest of the novel). Now, you would think that this novel would develop this theme of ghosts, and Vivian’s belief in ghosts, her belief in God, and why she believes ghosts fill the silence around her. But you would be wrong. Because there is NO FURTHER MENTION of ghosts anywhere in this novel. No further mention of God. Or anything Vivian believes concerning God and ghosts. This Prologue reads like something an editor asked the author to add at the beginning to “help suck the reader in.” It has absolutely no bearing on anything else in the book. So let me return to what kind of character Vivian is, if we’re not reading a novel about ghosts, God, and beliefs. Unlike the prose in this Prologue, Vivian is one of those narrators so common to women’s fiction — she is blandly insecure, silently yearning for approval and acceptance. She isn’t given to powerful surges of emotion, doesn’t suffer rage or despair. She silently frets. She longs for safety and comfort. She suffers quietly, without trying to bother anyone, and life rewards her with the comfort and safety she wants. Molly is much the same way. Despite her background of poverty, insecurity, and the bankruptcy of any support system, Molly is not angry and broken inside, not desperately struggling and stressed about what her future will bring, not suffering the ravages of grief and a crippled self-confidence – no. She is blandly insecure, has moments in her internal monlogues when she “feels angry,” but these moments are so muted, so stifled and brief, and never expressed as anything close to real fury, that Molly easily falls under that category of female narrators who “have to stay nice” or “readers won’t like them.” Which I understand. Writers want people to love their characters. I get it. However. This is a book about the orphan trains. And I would have liked for someone — anyone — in this book to have expressed some kind of outrage or horror over these orphan trains. Not all of the children put on these trains were “abandoned” — some were simply rounded up off the street and shuttled onto these trains like cattle. Separated from families who were still alive. Or given to people who beat them, starved them, abandoned them all over again. Or given to people who let them freeze to death sleeping in a barn, or outside on the ground. Or outright killed them by any other method of negligence. Young girls (and I’m sure many boys, too) were raped and suffered all forms of sexual violence. While I don’t mind books with overpowering messages of lemons-into-lemonade storylines, I didn’t like how the novel focused on only “the success stories” of adult orphan train riders, including magical twists of fate for Vivian, her true love, and the other train riders she knew. In this book, no one’s life is destroyed by these orphan trains, because we politely look away, and remind ourselves that hardships make us stronger. The children who died young – brutalized, raped, starved, and beaten to death – are no longer alive to speak for the atrocities they suffered, and this book makes it clear that is okay. No one needs to speak for the dead, for the ones who died young and will never be able to share their stories of redemption and make lemonade out of lemons. The survivors who made it into old age were redeemed, and that is what really matters. What matters is looking on the bright side of life. The silver lining that glows around any brutality, and should remain the focus no matter what. I recommend this novel for anyone who wants to learn about a piece of history with a large dose of sugar, positivity, and wishful thinking. This writing won’t tax you, the story is told very simply, and happy endings glow like radiant sunbeams all over the second half of this book. Magic is real. Magical twists of fate are how the world operates. Silver linings abound. And then, if you want a bit of historical information concerning the trains, there’s a very short write-up about them in an “About the Book” section at the end. So you can educate yourself, feel uplifted, and feel good about the world, knowing that anyone, anywhere, can make lemonade, no matter what lemons they’re dealt. However. If you are a reader like me, and would prefer a novel that addresses the soul-crushing hardship of loss, the horrors of building an identity when you have no family to learn from, and the despair of poverty when you grow up with nothing — well, this book might not explore those issues deeply enough for you. I’m glad the author chose to illuminate this piece of history though. Because I had no idea these orphan trains existed. So the book is a three-star read for that reason. I just wish someone had been horrified by these trains, because I certainly was....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jan 16, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15818107-orphan-train

The writing is excellent. The beautiful prose sucked me in right away and kept me turning pages. In the opening pagI really wanted to love this book. The writing is excellent. The beautiful prose sucked me in right away and kept me turning pages. In the opening pages, I felt a powerful ""God of Small Things"" vibe and so I anticipated the major plot twist of the story almost immediately. The ""surprise ending"" was therefore no surprise to me, but my disappointment didn't hinge upon that. Here's a one-sentence summary of the story provided by The New York Times: ""A grandchild in a New England clan with a private island off Martha’s Vineyard tries to piece together the story of a catastrophic accident that clouded her memory in this intense, cunningly constructed novel with a surprise ending that shatters.""Even though the ending didn't surprise me, I was not ""shattered"" by this book. Since I refuse to spoil this story for other readers, I will simply say that the ""catastrophic accident"" in this story is the result of some majorly ridiculous stupidity. I don't mean the reasoning behind the event -- I mean the execution of the plan that leads to the accident -- and I just could not believe that characters who I had come to think of as somewhat intelligent could suddenly no longer have brains when it came time to execute what they'd decided to do. There are four of them involved, and all four suddenly no longer have a brain at the same exact time. Their willful stupidity meant the ending didn't feel like a tragedy at all, didn't move me with sympathy or regret or sadness for them, since the ending became nothing more than a grim consequence for being so blatantly foolish.In searching for another voice to echo the strong sense of apathy I felt by the end of this tale, I found the words of Meg Rosoff, who wrote the  for this novel (May 9, 2014) in The New York Times:""This is an ambitious novel with an engaging voice, a clever plot and some terrific writing. In the end, however, its portrayal of a shattered family and the desperate consequences of silence and greed, feels oddly flat. I couldn’t help thinking that the terrible fate of the Sinclair family might as well be happening to a collection of fairy tale characters. Or to those preppy models in the Ralph Lauren ads. Did I care how they lived or died? Probably not as much as I should have.""Those words rang true for me. I wanted to care deeply for these four teenagers -- the ""Liars"" of the title -- and in the end, their stupidity in executing their plan robbed me of my despair. These children had so many things handed to them -- and in the end, they played right into the stereotypical moronic behavior most people expect of spoiled children of privilege. The most heart-wrenching moment for me involved the fate of two dogs in the story. I was deeply moved by what happens to the dogs. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 21, 2014","Dec 22, 2014","Dec 22, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16143347-we-were-liars

And that’s all this book is doing– talking about how science blinded itself for so long, and how some scientists are taking off their blinders. There are so many things I learned in this book. I learned that scientists still don’t really understand how female genitalia work. I learned how scientists ignored, for so long, how big the clitoris really is (which holds true for the public today). And how women have so many different pathways to orgasm. How even paralyzed women can still have orgasms. How women are much more able to orgasm without even touching themselves than men are. (Seriously. Women’s bodies are just amazing.) I learned that birth control significantly diminishes a woman’s testosterone levels, and scientists still don’t understand why that kills desire in some women, but doesn’t matter to others. And I learned about monkeys. I learned stuff about monkeys I have never read before. I was fascinated by these monkeys. And I learned that monogamy is actually harder for women than it is for men. I learned that the loss of desire is so profound in some women that they just feel dead inside. I learned all these things women are doing to try to regain their desire. How incredibly difficult that can be. I listened to women talk about their lives. Their real lives. And their sexual lives. I was simply amazed.

The inspiration for ""One Thousand White Women"" came from an actual historical event. As the author states in a note before the book, ""in 1854 at a peace conference at Fort Laramie, a prominent Northern Cheyenne chief requested of the U.S. Army authorities the gift of one thousand white women as brides for his young warriors. Because theirs is a matrilineal society in which all children born belong to their mother's tribe, this seemed to the Cheyennes to be the perfect means of assimilation into the white man's world -- a terrifying new world that even as early as 1854, the Native Americans clearly recognized held no place for them. Needless to say, the Cheyennes' request was not well received by the white authorities -- the peace conference collapsed, the Cheyennes went home, and, of course, the white women did not come. In this novel they do."" This is a novel with a strange collection of pleasures. It's like a mash-up of a female version of Dances with Wolves with the depressing sadness and absurdity of Little Big Man. The ending is brutal, so this is a realistic book, despite being such a fanciful tale. My favorite character was Phemie, a black woman who marries a Cheyenne warrior and decides to live as a warrior as well, riding naked on horseback and being a total badass. She was such a wonderful character, if the book had featured Phemie as the main character, this book would have easily been a 5-star read for me. As it is, the main character is a white woman named May Dodd, who has gone through a number of hardships before the book begins, and then tells the story of a handful of white women marrying into this particular Cheyenne tribe in 1875. Phemie is a minor character in the story of May Dodd's life. It took me a long time to like May. A long time. She was drawn in a very realistic way, and she was clearly a very pretty woman. I think I just found her intelligence level lacking, and reading her journal (instead of reading a story unfolding in ""real time"" in a novel) diminished my enjoyment of her tale.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction featuring 1870s America, and to anyone who enjoys movies like Dances with Wolves and Little Big Man. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Dec 11, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33512.One_Thousand_White_Women

The story follows an 18-year-old girl named Victoria, who I read this for book club, and found the writing to be strong, enjoyable, and easy to read. The story follows an 18-year-old girl named Victoria, who has spent her life in foster care and group homes, and ages out of the system to find herself homeless in San Francisco. How she creates a new life for herself, and heals the wounds of her past, comprises the plot of this novel. Flowers play a large role in this story, both as physical objects of beauty and symbols representing code words used in communication during the Victorian era. The author includes her own dictionary of ""flower meanings"" at the end of the novel, and the flowers in this book are quite stunning, evocative, and magical in the prose. One of my favorite scenes involves a description of jonquil (desire) held in the hands of a young man who falls in love with Victoria, and a scene in which Victoria assembles her first bridal bouquet: ""spiraling white mums emerged from a cushion of snow-colored verbena, and clusters of pale climbing roses circled and dripped over the edge of a tightly wrapped nosegay. The bouquet was white as a wedding and spoke of prayers, truth, and an unacquainted heart. No one would know."" Professional ers have commented on the sometimes gimmicky-feeling of the flower-messaging, a ""too-tidy"" ending, and how ""super-neatly"" the past and present weave through the story (often noting that the author has taught creative writing) -- but I didn't mind those things. I thought this novel was an excellent example of upmarket women's fiction, a genre in which endings are often quite tidy and happy magical events occur to balance out the grim despair of reality.My book club partners were not as kind to this novel. Four of them rated this book with 3 stars, and one gave the novel a 1.5 out of 5. They pointed out the same things professional ers did: that the book has a much stronger start than an ending, and that the ending wraps up ""quickly and happily"" and felt ""a bit forced."" Which is a fair assessment, though I still rate the book with 4 stars for overall enjoyment. I originally thought the main character was on the autism spectrum, as she is so prickly, opinionated, and focused on one subject (flowers) -- but Victoria has severe attachment disorder from her abandonment at infancy and life in the system. Throughout the novel, people are drawn to Victoria, and are deeply motivated to help her. My book club found this odd, but I thought the author was trying to show that Victoria was physically beautiful, as well as highly intelligent, and people feel drawn to those with a lot of physical beauty and intelligence. Our looks, especially, can take us far in life, and open a lot of doors. It's a sad truth to admit, but no less true for its sadness. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 28, 2014","Nov 04, 2014","Nov 04, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10032672-the-language-of-flowers

All of the people interviewed share information about how they help keep their bodies feeling good as they age, which can be more psychologically difficult than anything else. Body acceptance is something we either do or don't do, at any stage in our lives, and for people who identify with fitness and strength as their core characteristics, the changing identity posed by an aging body can be challenging. Anyone who is interested in aging, fitness in aging, maintaining strength as we age, and the psychological challenges aging places upon us, please consider reading this book.

Alma leads a long lThis is a book of slow, small pleasures, much like the study of moss the protagonist, Alma Whittaker, pursues throughout her life. Alma leads a long life, and this is a long book. The plot was so flimsy and predictable in places, I often found myself frustrated, or bored, or both. But the novel is beautifully written, and the fascinating, unpredictable parts of the story were so exquisite, they held me rapt, especially toward the end, after Alma left Tahiti. Sometimes I felt angry that all of the women in this story are so sexually frustrated and repressed, and that no comment was made upon this being a key issue contributing to the suffering of their lives. The men in this book lead FAR better lives than ANY of the women do. From the bold and brash Henry Whittaker, to the absolutely delightful Ambrose Pike, to the amazingly unique Tomorrow Morning, the male characters in this story are like male birds in nature-- full of color and brazenness, expressing a beautiful agency over their lives, a conscious self-determination in their behavior, while the women are drab, stifled, and often physically ugly, stunted by the roles their sexuality places upon them: spinster or sexually repressed wife being the only dignified options, with whore and asylum inmate being the options of complete shame. It saddened me greatly that Alma, in her final reflections on the role of her life, her theories, and her own significance, never reflected on this element of union-- of sex-as-union, or communion, or anything else in connection with the mysticism and divine unknown she and Alfred Russel Wallace discuss. Throughout the novel, Alma masturbates to satisfy the urges of her body, and while so many other elements of the tale were brought into a grand finale by the end of the book -- Alma's sexual urges were never brought into that whole. Perhaps the author didn't want to seem like she was pushing the view that ""sex is everything"" or something equally lame-- and I can certainly sympathize with that, yes indeed, which is why this book was still a 5-star read for me. There is also the inescapable fact that Alma Whittaker is a product of her time, and her reasoning is rendered with such beauty and detail throughout the book, it's easy to see why she draws the conclusions she does.So let me just add my own opinion to the mix, to counter the grim logic displayed in this tale, which I admired and rejected with equal passion.It is possible not to suffer at all in this world, by viewing each moment as a gift, no matter what is taking place. A lot of people resent that idea, so I can only offer up the book ""Loving What Is"" as an illustration of how that is possible, how normal people can live in the present, absent of suffering. Also, animal brains are pleasure-seeking devices, which means we are built to seek pleasure and happiness. This wasn't part of Alma's research on mosses, and while she does quote some great lines from Darwin, I don't remember ""pleasure"" being in any of them. Alma's body was made to give her pleasure, which she experiences throughout the book by masturbating, and yet, the pleasure of her body, as I said, doesn't feature into her grand final theory at the end. I wish it had. I understand why it didn't, but I still wish it had. This isn't a tale full of kittens and rainbows. It is a tale of sexual repression-- on sooooo many levels-- and what it means to embrace suffering in all of its forms. It's the tale of a woman who found her life's meaning regardless of anything she did or didn't experience through sex. It's a GREAT book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Sep 10, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17465453-the-signature-of-all-things

NeitheThis novel is advertised as ""a chilling tale of survival and redemption"" and as ""the intensely personal story of a young girl's coming of age."" Neither claim is true, and if you pick up this book assuming the jacket copy is accurately portraying what you'll find in this novel, you'll be sadly disappointed, or perhaps incredibly frustrated. But if you put aside the false advertising, and evaluate the story for what it is, the frustration and disappointment disappear. ""Hard Twisted"" is an artistic rendering of the TRUE STORY of a thirteen-year-old girl who suffered through an INCREDIBLE amount of hardship, first at the hands of her homeless, violent, and alcoholic father, and then at the hands of her father's murderer. The story begins in 1934, and follows the protagonist, the 13-year-old Lucile ""Lottie"" Garrett through a year of her life in captivity with a murdering ex-con who beheaded her father, kidnapped her, and for the next year of her life, the reader witnesses this man repeatedly rape her, beat her, impregnate her, leave her to the wolves when she miscarries her baby, eventually murder two men in front of her, and then land both of them in prison soon after.In real life, Lottie Garrett was tried as a juvenile in the state of Texas and ""convicted of associating with a known criminal."" It was assumed she should have been aware that this murdering psychopath was already an ex-con, even though Lottie's father was a homeless man, and he and his daughter had been homeless for two years prior to meeting this killer. No one ever told Lottie that this man had spent years in prison, nor was she ever aware that he had killed her father before landing in jail. And yet, after her year as this pedophile's victim, Lottie was sentenced to seven years in prison. Just take that in for a moment. A child who has known nothing but hardship and abuse, and spends a year living through all kinds of horrors with her father's murderer (the killer cut off her father's head with an ax, and then hid the body)-- this girl of 14 is put in prison for SEVEN YEARS. Why? Because she told the truth about what happened to her during her year with this killer, and, as stated, it was decided she ""should have known"" the psychopath who abducted her was a criminal, despite the fact that he lied to her and threatened her the entire time she was with him. Throughout the novel, we are not privy to Lottie's thoughts or emotions, which is why this book cannot be classified as a ""coming of age"" tale. To advertise any story as such, the protagonist must grow up in some fashion. In this novel, while Lottie does miscarry a child in the story, very few details are given about the miscarriage, and almost no details are given about her changing body. Even less information is shared concerning her thoughts and emotions throughout the entire story, and by the time she gives her testimony in court, it is clear that Lottie Garrett is as confused and childish in her thinking as she was at the beginning of the book. She has gained no new clarity about herself or her relationship with her kidnapper. She has not grown up, or come of age, in any way that I could determine. And she doesn't reflect on her prison sentence at all, whether she views this as a terrible injustice or not. Throughout the novel, Lottie Garrett possesses the intelligence and vivacity of a cow munching grain in a slaughterhouse, waiting for her turn to be bludgeoned, skinned, and rendered to pieces. Lottie is largely a vapid shell who serves the purpose of blinking stupidly out at the world, and through her eyes, an omniscient (and infinitely more intelligent) narrator provides the reader with beautiful sentences describing the scenery. Those beautiful sentences are the reason to read the book. This author, C. Joseph Greaves, is often compared to Cormac McCarthy, and here is an example of the prose in Hard Twisted, a scene involving Lottie and her kidnapper, many days before he murders her father: ""They ate corn bread and Karo syrup straight from the pan, her head floating in the amber lamplight and the whiskey and the heat from the open firebox."" (p. 30)Here is another example, this time of the killer's father: ""H.P. Palmer was a superannuated facsimile of his son, cord-thin and clear-eyed, his aquiline face fissured and deeply tanned.""Suffice it to say, Lottie Garrett could never describe anyone using the words ""superannuated,"" ""facsimile,"" aquiline,"" or ""fissured,"" as she would have NO IDEA what those words mean. She is 13 and homeless when the story begins, has been raised on the Bible, and expresses herself with the crude and stunted vocabulary and grammar of an unschooled southerner.Lottie Garrett is a passive observer of her own story, and most of the action of the novel takes place away from her, where the narrator can't describe what is happening in scene. It was a challenge to decide how many stars to give this book. My personal enjoyment of the tale made this novel a 2-star book for me, as vapid and passive protagonists do not inspire me to turn pages, and overall, I was frustrated by Lottie. I couldn't understand what she was thinking or what she was feeling, so her dull-witted passivity was hard to stomach.But I think this is the very point the author was trying to communicate. Most children who are denied an education, beaten and abused throughout childhood, and then kidnapped by a pedophile rapist murderer and forced through a year of incredible cruelty, would probably react the same way Lottie does-- clinging to the lies being fed to her, and never even realizing she could run away. I think sharing this story is a very noble intention, and the prose is beautifully written. So that is why I rounded up with my stars, and gave the book 4 stars total. I admire authors who attempt to make art from something as brutal and ugly and tragic as the life of this child. That said, I would like to add one more comment concerning this book. On p.209, ""the parson Sunshine Smith"" pays a visit to Lottie, and I read in the author's note that Sunshine Smith was also a real person. In the novel, Sunshine Smith pays a visit to Lottie along with two ""Navajo elders,"" and their weird and appalling visit prompts her miscarriage to begin. Lottie doesn't blame her miscarriage on the bizarre and frightening things these men do to her right before blood begins to pour from between her legs, but I sure did. The cause-and-effect seemed obvious, and these men seemed evil and sadistic as a result. I don't know if the author intended me to be so disgusted by these three men, but I was. They only occupy 4 pages in the book, so their presence is brief, but extremely shocking, and as horrifying to me as the fact that Lottie was sentenced to seven years in prison by the state of Texas.    ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 18, 2014",not set,"Aug 18, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13508113-hard-twisted

So it's a 2-star for my enjoyment level, and a 3-star in overall execution. The novel is named after a fictitious novel in the story, and the excerpts seemed really hokey (which was not a good thing, since the fictitious book was meant to be billiant, the life's work of a Holocaust survivor). All of the point of view characters in this story are crippled by grief, and the story follows them navigating through their grief and inability to let go of the past. They do not overcome obstacles, but simply endure them (often with little to no grace, but more of an open struggle), and the end reward is not strength or renewed life so much as a sliver of enlightenment and a small reprieve from the pressures of suffering.

I think the stories with Archie, Jane's alcoholic, diabetic lover, had originally overpowered this final story's ending for me, because I thought the story collection ended on a downer ten years ago. It was so nice to go back and realize I was wrong, and that I hadn't remembered the stories accurately.This book is such a pleasurable afternoon read. I love Melissa Bank's prose, as she writes with economy, humor, and grace. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,"Jun 20, 2014not set","Jun 23, 2014",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33926.The_Girls_Guide_to_Hunting_and_Fishing

I devoured the first 3 stories (the first half of the book) in two days. The first three stories were addictively good. I read them compulsively, and I hated having to put the book down for any reason. The fourth (and title) story of this book though... hmmm. I wasn't into the last story at all. It's the only story told from two different points of view, that of an aging recovering alcoholic named Francis, and an angry, bitter and irritating high school dropout named Devon. I spent days analyzing why I didn't like Francis or Devon at all. I felt horrible about this, because the main characters in the other stories were such deliciously complex people that I felt like a failure for not loving the final story as well. My conclusion was simply that Francis and Devon lacked the drive that the main characters in the other three stories possessed. Those characters all had burning goals, thing they wanted desperately. But Francis and Devon had no burning ambitions, no goals they were desperate to achieve, and they also seemed clueless on a level that made them uninteresting. Francis has drifted through much of his life in an alcoholic haze, and when he interacts with Devon, he is still so incredibly passive that his sections were a challenge to push through. And Devon is a middle-class girl written with what seemed to be a rock-bottom-class mindset, but I didn't find her believable-- that someone with parents like hers would behave like someone raised in poverty. Her parents also behaved with a rock-bottom-class mindset, and while this might be true to life, the details I needed the story to present to me to buy into this just weren't there. There was a disconnect going on that my mind couldn't bridge. The final story contains a brilliant pair of sentences that highlight a theme that runs through the collection (p.248): ""Through the trees the river shines under the sun, though he knows how dirty it is. Everyone knows how dirty it is."" The river, of course, is a metaphor for sex, as well as all of the other yearnings and difficulties in life all of the characters in this book are confronted with. So the most powerful emotional moment of the collection is contained within this last story.I own a signed copy of this book, and I'll certainly read the first three stories again. They are gorgeous, thrilling, and everything I love most in literary fiction. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 30, 2014",not set,"Jun 16, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18378015-dirty-love

This book is written with such beautiful characters, with such exquisite prose, that I fell in love with everything inside this novel. With the main character, Ursula Todd (""little bear"") and the delightful-- and delightfully flawed-- people who inhabit her incarnations through life. (With the exception of Derek, of course, and various other dark elements who cause Ursula great pain and tragedy.) This is a novel about family, and war, and nostalgia, and Britain. It's a novel about the rise of evil, the vagaries of time, and what it means to be bold and fierce and true to oneself. I could have lived in this world forever, with Hugh and Sylvie, Ursula's parents, with Mrs. Glover and Bridget, their cook and their maid, with all of Ursula's siblings (Maurice, Pamela, Teddy, and Jimmy... and poor little Roland at the very end), and with Ursula's flighty and flinty aunt Izzie, and with all of her pets, and great friends, and hardships and triumphs, and the layers and layers of detail that form the wonder and awe of reading this book. This novel made me tear up in so many places, especially whenever Hugh's name was mentioned-- oh, how I loved, LOVED, Ursula's wonderful father, one of the most beautifully drawn characters I've ever read in fiction-- and the depictions of the bombs falling on London during WWII made me want to weep. Kate Atkinson's ""Life After Life"" is simply a magnificent read. This book is so deeply moving, with characters who climb into your heart like they should have been born there, and a plot that is so intricate and thoughtfully woven, I was thoroughly dazzled by Atkinson's brilliance-- this is a truly brilliant book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 15, 2014","Jun 16, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15790842-life-after-life

It's the debut novel of literary fiction author Nicole Krauss, and the story is a long, rambling tale with haThis book took me a long time to finish. It's the debut novel of literary fiction author Nicole Krauss, and the story is a long, rambling tale with hardly any plot and not much focus. The writing felt very scattered, and the accumulation of random detail highly inconsequential. A 36-year-old man named Samson has a brain tumor removed, and loses all of his memories before the age of 12. He spends the entirety of the book drifting, hoping to find something to latch onto and give his life meaning. His wife, while beautiful and still in love with him, is-- for some reason-- not the person he wants to be his anchor anymore. He turns from her to befriend a former student named Lana (Samson was a college writing professor) and then he embraces a stranger with a plan to implant foreign memories into Samson's brain. The memory to be implanted into his brain is introduced at the very beginning of the book, a United States bomb test performed in the desert in 1957. For some reason, Samson is so enraged to be given this memory that he punches the man in the face, leaves the project, and returns to drifting in his search for meaning. He eventually returns to California, where he longs for his mother and an uncle from childhood to be with him, though his mother is dead and his uncle has dementia. I still have no idea what Nicole Krauss was trying to say in this book. Her thematic elements were so loose and scattered that nothing emerged as a take-away. The man running the memory project seemed very foolish to me, as did Samson. Samson's clueless wanderings made me feel the same way I feel about reading recovery stories from addicts: when people willingly make life far harder, sadder, and more depressing than it ever truly is. If the author was trying to convince me that empathy can never truly exist, this story failed, because despite the places in the book where Samson was lonely and trying to give voice to his loneliness, I simply saw him as more and more foolish. His actions became more and more pointless. If the author was trying to compare Samson's memory loss to that of his uncle's, an older man with dementia-- well, this story wasn't gripping enough or driven enough to get that across. Not everyone is fated to die with dementia, and Samson didn't sympathize with his uncle, only became frustrated when the uncle couldn't recognize him or speak to him clearly.The one part of the story I truly enjoyed was a conversation between Samson and a girl he meets on a bus during one of his drifting ramblings. The girl is reading the Bible on the bus, and she tells Samson about the story of Samson and Delilah, from the Book of Judges. I truly enjoyed the few paragraphs that involved this character's understanding of that tale. Overall, ""Man Walks into a Room"" was the kind of literary novel I least like to read, one in which closely-observed details are in abundance, but there is no drive to the story, and no meaning for the reader to gain by taking the time to read all of those closely-observed details. The protagonist doesn't have a goal other than to drift, so he leaves his wife and drifts through the whole book, and he is still drifting at the end. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 29, 2014","May 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44380.Man_Walks_into_a_Room

It gave me a much better understanding of the challenges America is facing, and how, with every day that goes by, the country's problems grow in exponential ways. Sometimes I felt acute stress absorbing these harrowing facts, but overall, this is a hopeful book, a book that states this message loud and clear: we're all in this together, and each generation is already aware of that fact.

The first half of the book details Ayaan's childhood and young adulthood in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. The memories she shares are horrifying, educational, traumatic, and insightful. For example, her description of her own excision at age five was one of the most terrifying things I have ever read in my life. The second half of the book describes how Ayaan ran away from her arranged marriage (she was living in Kenya at the time, and her father--who was absent for the GREAT majority of Ayaan's life-- met some random guy from Canada who had come to Kenya looking for an ""obedient"" Islamic wife-- i.e. a woman who would work like a dog and never speak or ask for anything as a slave). Talk about romantic... uh, NOT. While in Germany, waiting for her ability to enter Canada as this stranger's wife, Ayaan smuggled herself into Holland, and asked for asylum. She was eventually granted Dutch citizenship, and the remainder of her memoir details what she did with that citizenship-- working as a translator, as a research staffer in a political party, and finally serving in Parliament. The book also descibes the 10-minute film ""Submission: Part I"" she made with Theo van Gogh, who was murdered in 2004, and the security nightmare that ripped Ayaan's world apart as a result of that horrendous act. She lives in the United States now. I thought the most powerful chapter of this book came a few chapters before the end: Chapter 14-- ""Leaving God."" This chapter, which built upon the knowledge Ayaan gained from her childhood, young adulthood, and then her college studies and work in Holland, truly opened my eyes in new ways to Islam, Islamic countries, and how inherently barbaric and horrible any religious-based government-- especially a government based upon Islamic law-- truly is, and always will be. I have never been a fan of cultural relativism, and this memoir made my dislike of that philosophical premise much stronger-- MUCH stronger. This book touched my core, my deepest values, and I feel incredibly grateful I finally made this memoir a priority in my life and set aside time to read it. And I just wanted to share some final thoughts about female excision (female genital mutilation):Whenever I read about female genital mutilation, I'm filled with so much horror for the suffering of these little girls that I feel my hair turning white. Ayaan Hirsi Ali's clitoris and inner labia were cut out with an old pair of scissors when she was five years old (no anesthesia). FGM predates Islam, and it's such a horrible, sick, barbaric, stupid, STUPID thing to do-- to torture and mutilate children like this, and strip a woman of her ability to have a clitoral orgasm. I hate FGM with the fury of a thousand acid-spitting orcs.

Pages fly by, and her spiritual growth is so life-affirming, it amazes me that anyone could hate this book, or resent her for making money as a writer.

The story of the little boy giving blood near the end of the book was especially poignant. I think Lamott is very brave to reveal how neurotic and jealous she can be as a writer-- so neurotic and jealous that she offers a lot of advice on how other writers can deal with these things. The emphasis placed on writers-as-neurotic-creatures was the reason why this was only a 4-star read for me, rather than 5, because this book is really more like a primer on how to not be a neurotic writer, rather than a writer's toolbox, such as Stephen King's ""On Writing"" (one of my favorite books of all time). While reading ""Bird by Bird,"" I often found myself falling into the category of writer that Lamott would ""want nothing to do with"" in life-- i.e. someone who finishes one writing project and immediately starts another, rather than fixating on a lot of negative energy-- and even though her tone is meant to be humorous, it was often a bit too acidic and abrasive for me. I also felt extremely grateful that I don't suffer the intense bouts of jealousy and narcissism that Lamott paints as the fate of a writer's life. I wasn't sure if all those negative traits were meant to be hyperbole or not. All I can say is, I'm glad other authors find readers and success for their work, because their success gives me the hope that I can find success, too-- which is why I struggled to identify with some of the neurotic behaviors Lamott describes in detail here. Maybe because she has always had an agent, editor, and publishing house behind her, and I've self-published my work, I have a very different point of view on the trials of being an author than Lamott. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 14, 2014","Apr 19, 2014","Apr 14, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12543.Bird_by_Bird

I liked the character of Talmadge, but the two girls who show up in his orchard-- Della and Jane-- were like vicious, rabid dogs, very stupid and so incredibly ungrateful for everything he does for them, that my increasing dislike for them eventually became overpowering.

I'd include Angelene in this, too, as she carries Talmadge's legacy at the end of the book.I know that Della is not redeemed in this story (I asked a friend how it ended) and that makes me glad I didn't read the remaining pages.

They were all foul, stupid people, and the fact that the women were even MORE idiotic, oversexualized, or simply referred to as ""whores"" didn't help matters at all.

I don't know much about football, or theAfter reading Dwight Garner's rave  in The Times for this book, I expected a lot more from this memoir. I don't know much about football, or the NFL, so the opening pages read like a lot of gibberish to me, full of names I don't know and historical games I'm not familiar with, and it was clear by p.3 that I am not the intended audience for this book. The intended audience would be people who actually know something about football, not bozos like me, who were hoping to glean something here.Nate Jackson does not go into much detail about any of the events in his NFL career. His book breezes through his experiences, until, near the very end, he slows down and describes what it's like to get an MRI, or play in an NFL game, and I was like, ""Wait? What? Why are you describing this NOW? You've had oodles of MRIs by this point and played in oodles of games. I've already filled in the details myself. I don't need you to describe this stuff now. Why didn't you put this description about MRIs in the first 100 MRIs you received? Or described playing your first NFL game more?"" The end of the book felt like a roller coaster climbing up the first steep hill for the initial drop... that slow, laborious, click-click-click as the ride chugs along... only there was no fantastic drop to look forward to, just the sudden end of the book. Honestly, that's not what I call a ""strong finish"" for a book.I did learn some things. There is an NFL Europe league, where some NFL players play during the off-season (like Nate Jackson). There is also a domestic competitor to the NFL, called the UFL (United Football League) and the players on that league make only $35,000.00 a year (still higher than a first-year teacher's salary).Nate Jackson reads a lot of Playboy, watches a lot of porn, and enjoys visiting titty bars in this book. He paints a sad portrait of life as an NFL player (and life in general), which is probably to be expected when one's physical capabilities are a stand-in for the entire meaning of life. (I mean, seriously, this strikes me as so sad.) He compares an NFL player's life to a stripper's for this reason-- and not just because they are both entertainers (obviously!), but because they both ""live within stereotypes."" I thought, ""Don't all jobs come with stereotypes?"" I mean: really? If I say, ""fireman, cop, teacher, librarian, politician""-- doesn't EVERY ONE of those jobs come with a standard set of stereotypes? How is the football player-stripper comparison an epiphany?I finished the book because I've never read a book about the NFL before, and I really wanted to learn something about it. But it's clear I wasn't the intended audience for the book, because there were so many places where I just couldn't follow the jargon, even when I re-read the passage trying to make sense of it, and because Nate Jackson doesn't really describe his experience, he jumps from one thing to the next, leaving too much up to me to fill in. I learned that football players masterbate en masse before games (except for Nate, who prefers to ""conserve his strength"" before a game) and I learned that Nate Jackson was happy to sacrifice his body to play the game, and would still be doing so if his injuries hadn't forced his career to end. But I was really hoping for more. I was hoping to feel what it was like to play pro football, to feel the joy of the game. This book was more about the meaninglessness of it all, up until the end, when he started to get descriptive, and then it was like, ""Please, can we just wrap this up? You skipped over everything good earlier to focus on the negative, so waxing eloquent about the game is wasted on me right now. We've got 20 pages to go. Just get me to the last page already.""At least it was short and easy to read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Nov 2013,"Apr 07, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17349121-slow-getting-up

Me, most of all.Laini Taylor's Young Adult/YA fantasy novel, ""Dreams of Gods and Monsters,"" the third book in her ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone"" trilogy, debuted in 2014. I attended the launch party in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was a wonderful night. I started reading my signed hardback copy that day, and finished it the next morning.This is a very long book. In 2014, I loved it. I wrote a gushing, 5-star . For the purposes of honesty, I am leaving that  here, even though it makes me cringe now. In honor of my fond memories, I am clearing my rating, rather than giving this book a lower star rating. Lower ratings hurt the book's cumulative score, whereas a cleared rating doesn't do any damage.I have never had such a Before and After with an author before, not like I have with Laini Taylor. When ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone"" came out in 2011, I gobbled it up like candy, and gave it a gushing, 5-star . When I read ""Days of Blood and Starlight"" in January 2013, I hated that book so much, my whole body hurt. My expectations were low for the third book in this trilogy, but I was originally *thrilled* when I read this. I truly loved it, once upon a time.Then in 2017, Taylor released her YA fantasy, ""Strange the Dreamer,"" a book that won many prestigious awards, but which I found to be loaded with pro-imperialist and ableist content, among other horrible things. I wrote a long, one-star  for that book. I was so disappointed and repulsed by the content of ""Strange the Dreamer"" that the book made me cry. That was when everything changed for me, regarding Taylor and her books. In 2017, I knew that if I went back and reread the ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone"" trilogy, I would find the same problematic, damaging material that was in ""Strange the Dreamer.""And sure enough, I did just that. In the past three years, I have gone back to the first book, ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone,"" many, many times, and each time I do, I notice new issues, new problematic material, new things that just astound me with how blatant and awful they are.In March 2020, I decided to try to reread ""Dreams of Gods and Monsters,"" since I had been so praiseworthy of this book. The content is highly ableist and problematic. The story is also incredibly slow, loaded with tangents, repetition, useless exposition, and by page 383 (of 613 pages total), I had to DNF. I just couldn't force myself to turn another page, even though I was definitely only skim-reading by then.I'm going to share a few specific thoughts about this book and its content. I offer these reflections up for consideration only, not because I want to attack this book, its fans, or the author. I am criticizing the content of this book, and that alone. Laini Taylor's ""Strange the Dreamer"" broke my heart, but this book did not. This book is just a problematic slog, and I simply wanted to share information on a few of the book's problems.First, let's look at the ableism.All of Taylor's books feature an egregious amount of ableism within their main plots as well as their main characters. It's truly astounding how much ableist content is loaded into every page of this author's work.In ""Dreams of Gods and Monsters,"" Taylor's heroes, like always, possess beautiful, flawless bodies. Her heroes are both able-bodied and super-bodied, neurotypical and highly intelligent. Taylor's villains possess physical and mental disabilities, physical marks and disfigurements, and they are depicted in the most ableist exposition an author can possibly write.Here are some examples:""Orit glared. She wasn't beautiful like Liraz, like so many of the angels. Her features were ill-defined, her face full, and her nose had been broken some long time ago, smashed flat at the bridge by blunt force."" (pg 150)""Usually he found it worth the pain to cause others misery, but, as it happened, Jael's foulness superseded even the pleasure of torturing him, and Razgut was happy to oblige. He let go of him and flailed to the marble floor with a thud and gasp, becoming visible at the moment of impact. He pushed himself upright, his atrophied legs splayed to one side. 'You're welcome,' he said, a parody of dignity.'You think I should thank you?' Jael removed his helmet and thrust it at a guard. Only in privacy could the ruin of his face be revealed: the hideous scar that slashed from hairline to chin, obliterating his nose and leaving a lisping, slurping wreckage of a mouth. 'For what?' he demanded, spittle flying.A grimace teased Razgut's own hideous face -- a bloated sack of purple, his skin stretched blister-tight."" (pg 252-253)After Jael kicks Razgut brutally for impudence, Razgut laughs, and this material follows:""There was a crack in the shell of Razgut's mind. It had been, once, a very fine mind, and the crack was as a flaw in a diamond, a seam in a crystal globe. It spidered. It snaked. It subverted every ordinary feeling into some mutant cousin of itself: recognizable, but gone oh so very wrong. When he looked back up at Jael, hatred mingled with mirth in his eyes."" (pg 253-254)""[...] Razgut was a blighted, crawling thing, a corruption of flesh more goblin than angel. [...] The other tell of his [angel] ancestry was more dreadful: the spikes of splintered bone that jutted from his shoulder blades. His wings had been torn off. Not even cut, but ripped away."" (pg 254)*****All of these examples feature incredibly ableist prose. In Taylor's fictional worlds, physical disability, physical marks, disfigurements, and mental disabilities are only ever used to describe unlikeable characters and sadistic antagonists, the characters the story's heroes must vanquish. This is ""the disabled/disfigured person as sinister, evil, and criminal"" trope, and it is a mainstay of every book of Taylor's I've read.Second, Taylor's heroes often body-shame other characters, too, as when Karou longs to turn Lisseth into a cow in this book: ""*Bovine,* Karou thought. *A big slow cow for you.*"" (pg 48) Yes, Karou is discussing Lisseth's chimera body there, longing to resurrect this woman she dislikes into an *actual* cow's body. But Karou is also a human girl, possessing a body described as ""ballerina beautiful,"" super agile and super strong. To call another woman a ""cow"" in the modern world is fat-phobic and body-shaming, and that definitely comes across here.Third, I dislike how Taylor introduced a person of color in the last book of the trilogy, and made this character so bland and forgettable that many ers cannot even remember her name right after they finish the book, despite the fact that she is even a point-of-view/POV character. Eliza is a Black woman and an academic, and in the final pages of the book, she is also revealed to be a lesbian. Her romance isn't developed at all; it's just there, mentioned briefly at the end. Eliza's whole character reads like diversity checkboxing to me. Taylor had written herself into multiple plot holes by the end of book 2, and Eliza's whole character is an Act III deus ex machina to correct the numerous plot problems of the first two books. That's why the character felt like a paper doll with some diversity checkboxing thrown on like paint.Fourth, I dislike that this book introduces an asexual character (Liraz), and then puts her into a heterosexual romance to show how she ""develops and grows"" as a person. I can appreciate how well Taylor develops this romantic subplot in this book. The romance with Liraz and Ziri is truly compelling, and one of my favorite parts of this book (though I DNF'd before reaching it on my reread). Despite how much I enjoyed this romance, it still makes me uncomfortable that so often in novels, asexual characters -- main and secondary alike -- are paired up in heterosexual romances like this. Fifth, this book has a storytelling problem that I associate with a lot of first drafts I beta-read for critique partners, and it's when a writer skips over a major plot development, advances the timeline to a future point, and then narrates the major plot development as backstory, when it could have been written in active scene. ""Dreams of Gods and Monsters"" does this a LOT, and it is a big reason why the pacing of this book suffers so much, and makes the story feel like such a slog to get through. Active scene *always* speeds up the pacing, and if this book had been more carefully edited, I probably wouldn't have DNF'd on my reread.Sixth, the writing style is so purple in this book, it's midnight-indigo-stoned. Not only is there an absurd amount of repetition, and pages of useless exposition, but the individual sentences are packed with extra words, too.""Dreams of Gods and Monsters"" features an abundance of what I call ""preposition strings"" as well as ""conjunction strings,"" wherein sentences are strung together with word additions that read like too many beads on a necklace.Here is a conjunction string, in which Taylor is describing a bloody battle scene:""All around him is glitter and clash and snarl and stab and teeth and grunt and stagger."" (pg 306)Here is a preposition string:""There was a potency in the image that Akiva wished he could distill into an elixir for the rest of Eretz."" (pg 265)The book is *full* of sentences like this. When there is an overabundance of prepositions and conjunctions on every page, the unneeded words read as drag. This is why the red pen was invented. This book really needed a red pen. Overall, despite the fact that I DNF'd on my reread, I don't think ""Dreams of Gods and Monsters"" is a terrible book. I can still understand why I loved this book so much when I first read it: there is a lot of Karou and Akiva in this book, and I was heavily invested in them from book 1. Taylor delivered what I came for: Karou and Akiva in scene, interacting together. The compelling subplot romance with Liraz and Ziri was a delightful bonus.  But reading ""Strange the Dreamer"" forever changed how I read Laini Taylor. I can't go back to being the person I was in 2014, when I first read ""Dreams of Gods and Monsters."" I thought I would keep this book forever. But the time has come to let it go.May it find a new home with one of Taylor's many fans. No rating.*****My original, 5-star gush :This book is SPECTACULAR!!!! Heart-wrenching, breathtaking, laugh-out-loud, giggle-weepiness, can't-stop-tearing-up Oh My God GOOD. SO INCREDIBLY GOOD! Laini Taylor blew me away with her finale to the Smoke and Bone trilogy. I wish I'd re-read ""Days of Blood and Starlight"" right before reading this one-- a reflection upon How Totally Stellar and Involved the plot is in Book 3. This was as satisfying a read as ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."" ""Dreams of Gods and Monsters"" will live on my bookshelf FOREVER!!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,2,"Apr 19, 2020not set","Jul 06, 2020Apr 10, 2014","Apr 03, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13618440-dreams-of-gods-monsters

The word “empathy” features prominently throughout this book, and Ms. Jamison purports to share her wisdom on the subject, but I finished this essay collection feeling certain that this author doesn’t even know what empathy is.What I learned from this book is that people who grow up with a great deal of privilege, as Ms. Jamison did, are taught that empathy should be ignored or denied in order to maintain the status quo. While everyone in modern American culture is taught the same lesson—to project a stoic aloofness as a sign of autonomous power—“The Empathy Exams” supports statistical data that shows this lesson is a more rigorous and exacting ordeal for the affluent. And by statistical data, I mean studies illuminating that the poor score higher in measures of accurately reading human emotion and expressing generosity than the affluent. This is the kind of research that is often cited in TED talks and in popular nonfiction, but features nowhere in this book. Denying human nature, however, comes with negative consequences. ""The Empathy Exams"" is part memoir, part nonfiction, and the book details Ms. Jamison's struggles as a young woman who has been forced to ignore and deny her own body as the price she pays for her privilege. This is certainly not the way that this book is meant to be read. But within the first few pages, it was clear to me that reading against the narrative was the only way I could ever finish this book. Ms. Jamison's prose is as clever as it is vapid, and she is fond of grand, sweeping statements that range from the flatly ignorant to the comedically absurd. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about empathy. If, however, you are curious about the mindset of upper-middle class privilege, the disruption of empathy due to modern American culture, and the emotional suffering of a member of the upper-middle class, this book might be valuable to you. While Ms. Jamison does not detail her life or her upbringing extensively in this book, there is enough information to make a few important facts very clear about the author. She is:1. Able-bodied2. Neurotypical3. White4. Heterosexual5. Cisgender6. A U.S. citizen7. Upper-middle class8. Ivy League educated (she attended Harvard as well as Yale)9. A graduate of the Iowa Writers' WorkshopMs. Jamison also admits to obsessive dieting, food restricting, struggling with anorexia, excessive drinking, and dealing with what she finally—in the very last essay—identifies as ""an abiding sense of inadequacy"" (page 206), a sense of inadequacy that is the source of her emotional and psychological pain. As an adult, Ms. Jamison became an alcoholic and wrote a second memoir about her alcoholism that was published after this book. She may have already been an alcoholic while she was writing the essays in “The Empathy Exams.” This book contains evidence to support that assertion, but Ms. Jamison does not use the word for herself in these pages. Here is some memoir material that she does include here:As an adult woman, she traveled to Nicaragua and had her purse stolen; the thief also punched her in the nose and broke the bone. After she returned to the U.S., Ms. Jamison chose to have some very expensive surgery to reset the bone for cosmetic reasons. On another trip to Costa Rica, Ms. Jamison had a zip-lining accident, fell twenty feet, and broke her jaw. She was born with a heart condition that required some minor surgery and she once had an abortion. She also survived being dumped by a man she loved, the emotional trauma of which is discussed in her last essay: “Grand Unified Theory of Female Pain.”The nonfiction material in these essays details Ms. Jamison's attempts at examining situations in which other people are suffering from hardships such as poverty, imprisonment, diseases, or undertaking stressful conditions by choice, such as running a marathon. Ms. Jamison displays a relentless ability to turn anyone else's physical or emotional pain into a self-centered narrative about her own suffering. Whether this is because Ms. Jamison is a narcissist, or it is due to her alcoholism, or is a tragic function of her class privilege dehumanizing everyone she meets, there is a profound lack of empathy in these essays. This is a book that examines the author's own physical and emotional pain under the guise of empathy, a term that Ms. Jamison never even correctly defines. The book opens with the titular essay, in which Ms. Jamison claims that ""empathy is always perched precariously between gift and invasion"" (page 5). It is incredibly instructive that Ms. Jamison’s first description of empathy is to view it as existing in a space between something all good or all bad, as something that might be a personal tool to be used or something that must be eradicated. Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin would absolutely agree with that phrasing: to a fascist dictator, empathy is an emotional tool to be wielded over the masses to exploit a populace, and must also be completely destroyed to allow for atrocities. Ms. Jamison goes on to say, ""Empathy isn't just listening, it's asking the questions whose answers need to be listened to. Empathy requires inquiry as much as imagination. Empathy requires knowing you know nothing"" (page 5). It is clear that Ms. Jamison finds these statements to be wise and profound. Many of her readers agreed. Personally, I find her statements juvenile and ridiculous. Ms. Jamison consistently confuses acts of compassion and sympathy with empathy, when these are not the same thing. What this book never discusses or acknowledges is that empathy is a biological function that is hardwired into the neurotypical human brain. Empathy is not something humans need to teach each other, and empathy does not require asking questions, imagination, or “knowing you know nothing.” Basic empathy is simply the ability to recognize a feeling in another person and then firing mirror neurons. That’s it. Like being born knowing how to swallow, empathy is innate to the human mind, and is part of natural brain development in young children. But, like a stroke victim who can forget how to swallow, empathy can also be muted or destroyed by brain damage, or by the culture a person lives in. Fascists, for example, understand this quite well. As is the case with Ms. Jamison, her upper-middle class upbringing has muted, distorted, and possibly destroyed her innate pathways of empathy. Scientific studies bear this out. The more privilege a person has, the higher their chances of misreading or ignoring the feelings of others, which disrupts, limits, or completely halts the ability to fire mirror neurons. The less privilege a person has, the faster and more accurate their ability to correctly label the feelings of others, and the stronger the response in their mirror neurons; in other words, the higher their levels of empathy. Ms. Jamison does not discuss the science of empathy at all. She certainly does not discuss the impacts of class privilege on empathy, or that her own empathy is different from the people she encounters and studies in this book. Her tone toward the people she claims to empathize with ranges from patronizing to coldly neutral. Each one of these essays is written for a particular audience: fellow readers who have had their empathy pathways disrupted by culture, especially members of the upper-middle class who share any of Ms. Jamison’s other privileges, listed above.On page 157, Ms. Jamison shares a story about how she tutored homeless young boys in Granada. One night, one of these homeless boys fell asleep outside her front door. She found him lying on the concrete, and instead of letting him spend the night sleeping inside on her floor, Ms. Jamison “nudged his shoulder” and woke him up because he was blocking the door. The boy awoke and did as instructed: he left. Later, Ms. Jamison felt guilty about this, to the point that she wonders what “good” guilt is, and then answers it for the reader: “It makes us talk. It makes us talk about ourselves. It makes us confess. We want to purge something that even confession won’t justify” (page 159). That is the entirety of her answer to the question: “what good is guilt?”I cannot imagine a more narcissistic answer to that question. Here is what I wish Ms. Jamison’s vapid text had included: the fact that human beings are biologically structured to function in groups. We survive in groups, and empathy is a mechanism hardwired into our brains to provide for our survival. Cultural oppression, however, cannot operate alongside human empathy. Empathy is a disruptive force against privilege and oppression. All forms of oppression must mute or destroy empathy in order to exist. Guilt is not just a personal hardship individuals suffer. Guilt is a human imperative to seek another element that is hardwired into the neurotypical human brain: fairness and justice, also known as an end to oppression.“The Empathy Exams” is certainly not a book that discusses social justice at all. Ms. Jamison’s essays are all about the drawbacks of her privilege and complicity in oppression, as detailed in her own personal suffering, without ever acknowledging or understanding what she is talking about.She admits as much in “Confession and Community,” an afterword that was included on pages 227-232 of this book. Here is how she summarizes her own collection of essays: “Empathy is all about otherness, but my relationship to empathy was largely about me—my book, my career” (page 232). I agree with this statement, but I would substitute the word “largely” for “solely” to make this sentence more accurate. Ms. Jamison also discusses some experiences from her book tour in “Confession and Community.” At a book signing for “The Empathy Exams,” Ms. Jamison states that after she was done telling the audience about her treatment of the homeless boy in Granada, “a boy [in the audience] stood up and asked, ‘Why didn’t you let that boy into your house?’ I felt like saying: that’s what the whole essay is about. But his question seemed to be suggesting that my self-awareness hadn’t answered the question: it hadn’t dissolved any problems, only illuminated them more fully” (page 231). This is absolutely correct. “The Empathy Exams” does not define empathy, and it certainly does not discuss the oppression that seeks to eliminate empathy, and therefore explain why Ms. Jamison behaved so callously toward that homeless boy in Granada. Sadly, this is largely due to the fact that Ms. Jamison is someone who financially and culturally benefits from her privilege, and has a lot at stake in maintaining the status quo. She also has no understanding of the forces that create her own insecurity, or that “abiding sense of inadequacy” she briefly mentions on page 206. The only way to understand the terrible damage of privilege is to understand that it comes with the cultural idea that those who are born into privilege are innately more deserving than those who are not. There are roots of religious ableism in these concepts, as well as some other foundational myths, such as: that humanity is a perfect meritocracy, and that life is an event each one of us can control. There is also the lurking idea that those who are born to misfortune can “taint” other people with their innate undeserving; it is as if they are born with a virus that can invade “good people” and hurt them. Ms. Jamison made that homeless boy leave her doorstep because she believed, deep in her implicit bias and cultural training, that his misfortune might taint her, and she is terribly afraid of that happening. But let me return to this other idea of control, and the pervading myth that life is a controllable event. What is most clearly on display to me in these essays is that Ms. Jamison is shocked and appalled to discover that her life is not an event she can control. She doesn’t understand that she has even been taught this idea, or that this idea is a lie. She does understand that she is desperate for order, “desperate for a why” to explain the painful things that happen to her (page 205), such as her broken nose or her broken jaw. What Ms. Jamison never grasps is that every other person she meets is also desperate for a why, desperate for order, but that these foundational myths—that life is controllable, that birth is based upon innate merit, that life is a meritocracy, that “the undeserving can taint you”—are as damaging to the human psyche as they are seductive and easy to believe.Reading “The Empathy Exams” made me angry: angry that the amount of cluelessness and self-aggrandizement everywhere on display in this book won so many awards and received so much praise. Another part of me—a part that is cold and rational, and completely detached from the rage I feel in my gut—understands that had I been as clever as Ms. Jamison and born with her level of privilege, I might have turned out exactly like her: vapid and addicted to alcohol. It saddens me that for all of Ms. Jamison’s resources and privilege, she spent her adult life struggling the same way so many people I know in poverty have struggled: numbing her pain with a drug, and trying to find the meaning of life at the bottom of a bottle.I hope that at some point, Ms. Jamison figures out that empathy is a part of human biology, and that the things she wrote in this book about empathy are inaccurate. I would recommend ""The Empathy Exams"" to anyone who wants to examine the hidden price of oppression and privilege, and the destructive effects of justifying and maintaining an oppressive status quo....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Aug 25, 2018","Sep 21, 2018","Apr 03, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17934655-the-empathy-exams

The author basically pitched this story as ""The Hunger Games set on Mars"" with enough elements of ""Lord of the Flies,"" I struggled to read this book. The author basically pitched this story as ""The Hunger Games set on Mars"" with enough elements of ""Lord of the Flies,"" ""Game of Thrones,"" and ""Ender's Game"" mixed in to increase the level of violence and gore. A lot of teenagers are brutally raped, maimed, and murdered in this book. The violence is graphic and the main character, a young man named Darrow, perpetuates a lot of the brutality. My biggest problem with the story is that the author, Pierce Brown, dispenses absolutes through his main character as truth, and these absolutes not only rob the story of subtlety and nuance, but are simply untrue. For instance, Darrow refuses to take responsibility for the classmates he kills, instead insisting that he had no choice in the matter, an opinion that is repeated at the end of the book. I'm sorry, but the decision to commit murder is always a choice, and for Darrow to refuse to accept that he made that choice is wrong.Darrow also professes that he is ""made"" to commit murder so he will be forced to ""wear the guilt""-- another statement that is profoundly untrue. No one can force another person to feel guilt (or anything else, for that matter). To have a main character who makes such untrue statements in a YA novel-- shirking responsibility, believing guilt can be forced upon him-- frustrated me more than anything else.The initial things that bothered me so much in this novel-- like all of the world-building vocabulary dumped into the opening chapters (and which didn't really stop until halfway through the story), and the world-history/society-history/family-history information piled into the beginning, and the way Darrow kept moving from place to place, with numerous characters thrown in and dropped from the plot very quickly-- all of those issues calmed down by the time I hit p.300 or so, because by then, Darrow was locked into one environment, in a fight to the death.While Darrow does develop a new strategy for fighting against his classmates (and therefore, experiences growth and change), one character trait that never changes is his penchant for name-calling. Darrow, along with almost everyone else, frequently calls people ""pricklicker"" and ""whorefart"" and SO many other epithets meant to be intensely demeaning of others. These slurs always have a base in misogyny or homophobia, and Darrow is especially good at them. He behaves as a common bully throughout much of the book, and his abilities with verbal abuse are seen as one of his best and strongest skills. They are alive and well in the final pages of the novel.The graphic violence and epithet-laced dialogue are some of the primary appeals of this story, and have already won ""Red Rising"" legions of fans. Designing fiction to cash in on the endless appetite for dystopian YA stories involving children perpetuating violence against other children is a sure bet to make a lot of money. ""Red Rising"" will certainly be financially successful. After I started having problems with Darrow's philosophical truths in the book, I did some research about Pierce Brown online, and discovered he sold a screenplay of this book for seven figures before ""Red Rising"" was even available for sale. So I'm sure this book will be a movie soon. But Darrow is no Katniss Everdeen. He might make as much money as she did though. Time will tell. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 30, 2014","Apr 03, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15839976-red-rising

This book relates the facts, emotions, and opinions of what these soldiers witnessed and felt, as well as the violence inflicted upon those Iraqis who dared to help the Americans. The stories of Izzy and Rachel, two Iraqi interpreters helping 2-16, were especially crushing to read.Here is war in all of its horror, complete with the idiocy of this ""surge"" strategy. Chapters are highlighted with the words of George W. Bush, trying to convince the American public (and Congress) that continuing to send troops into Iraq is not complete insanity. I don't know how anyone can read this book and come away thinking that ""the surge"" in Iraq was anything but lunacy and carnage. George W. Bush obviously learned nothing from the Revolutionary War, as our soldiers in Iraq might as well have been British troops in bright red coats with brass buttons, marching in formation through the woods, while the rebels crouched behind trees and picked them off one by one, easy as eating apple pie. Only in Iraq, a $100.00 bomb in the ground can blow up a $150,000.00 Humvee and make mincemeat of every soldier inside, so the marching through the woods was replaced with driving around streets loaded with bombs in Humvees. That's what American troops faced in Iraq: a military strategy that completely ignored the facts on the ground. You wonder how U.S. commanders, and the politicians who listen to them, can make such stupid decisions. But they did. And thousands upon thousands are dead and maimed forever as a result. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jan 2014,"Apr 02, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6633912-the-good-soldiers

I had assumed that I would love reading this book, too. I remain acutely sad that I didn't. I have read this book only once, in January of 2013. I didn't enjoy it at all. I have never had any desire to open this book again, or reread it, not even to study all of the ways this book went wrong for me, as I am sometimes prone to do. Crystal Starr Light wrote a thorough  for this book that speaks to my own reaction very well --https://www.goodreads.com//show...We also had a great exchange the entire time she was reading this trilogy. I thought ""Days of Blood & Starlight"" opened up a number of gaping plot holes in all three books. Crystal warns that the content of this book might be triggering, and as a rape victim myself, I did find the attempted-rape scene gratuitous and triggering in this book. It comes near the very end. The scene horrified me profoundly; I broke into a sweat, started shaking, and had to put the book down for a time. Even just thinking about this book makes me recall how triggering that gratuitous attempted-rape scene was for me to read. This book did damage to me; it was harmful for me to read. My exchange with Crystal Starr Light about the problematic content in this book was cathartic; it allowed me to calm some of the pain this book caused me.I'm older now, and I've read far worse content in YA fantasy books since 2013, but ""Days of Blood & Starlight"" will forever hold a special place in my trauma-life as a book that scarred me to read. This is not a result of me being unable or unwilling to read about rape, attempted rape, or any of the other content in this book, because I often seek out books that deal with this content, especially nonfiction titles. My reaction was a result of how the author handled this material and presented it to the reader. The problem for me always arises from a Thought Experiment execution, when an author takes liberty with reality, or with a particular trauma the author has not personally suffered, and writes the event in such an unrealistic or appalling way to increase ""the entertainment value"" or perceived ""emotional impact"" of a scene. Sometimes, I forgive books for doing this. One of the facts of reading fiction is that authors write Thought Experiments with traumatic material all the time. Each of us has our own threshold and reasoning for engaging with horrifying content that is placed into a novel for its entertainment value. ""Days of Blood & Starlight"" was not a book I could forgive. I found nothing of value in this novel, for the reasons Crystal Starr Light details in her thorough . The ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone"" trilogy holds a big place in my life, as a reader and as a writer. I went to great effort to attend the book launch event for the third and final book in this series, due to how much I enjoyed the prose style in the first book, and in spite of this second book being such a negative experience for me. I absolutely fell under the spell of Laini Taylor's whimsical, lyrical style when I read ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone."" I can't look at a page of ""Daughter of Smoke and Bone"" and not feel again how much I want -- and still want -- to love these books due to the singular writing style on display.I didn't love ""Days of Blood & Starlight"" though. I absolutely hated this book. And after writing a  for Maria V. Snyder's ""Poison Study"" this week, I felt compelled to return to ""Days of Blood & Starlight"" and write something honest about this novel. ""Poison Study"" featured a rape scene that was far more gratuitous, violent, and repulsive than the attempted-rape scene in ""Days of Blood & Starlight."" But I wasn't triggered by ""Poison Study"" because Laini Taylor hit me first, with this book. Her work remains the only piece of fiction that has ever traumatized me as a rape victim. Much like Crystal Starr Light and her network of Goodreads friends, I am also an outlier in my negative experience with this book. The majority of my friends have loved this book and speak highly of it. I wish I could do the same. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jan 2013,"Mar 26, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12812550-days-of-blood-starlight

And he never disappoints me. <3But I was surprised, four years after first reading this book, by how much I disliked the great bulk of this novel. Dislike is not even the right word -- ""totally do not care"" is the correct feeling. The vast majority of this book is Super Apathy Land for me, and I skip entire sections with a disgruntled sigh, waiting until something interesting snags my attention.I don't enjoy any of Cath's fanfiction pages -- I skip all of them now, the inserts before the chapters as well as the material embedded into the story. I would rather drink a mud-slushee flavored with fish gut and rotten gizzard than read Cath's Simon Snow slash fiction. I don't enjoy Wren (Cath's twin sister) and I certainly don't enjoy Wren's general dysfunction, most of which revolves around trying to be a Party Girl and then crawling back to Cath as her moral compass. Anytime Wren's name was on the page, I was like 'oh please God make it stop' and would skip to the next section. I really hated Wren on this reread, and everything having to do with Wren on the page: the twin-sister relationship drama, the selfish mother drama, Wren's boyfriend drama, the vapid sorority-friend Courtney, the dieting and binge-drinking stuff... all of this garbage makes drinking a mud-slushee flavored with rotten entrails look way more fun than reading.Even the first time I read this book, I was never a fan of the scenes with Cath's dad. Not because these scenes aren't well-written, because I recognize that they're probably the most sophisticated pages in this whole novel. It just bores me to read about Cath's father. He definitely bored me into coma-level apathy on this reread. I am here for the Levi Show -- and the Levi Show starts on page one. I liked the early scenes with Cath in writing class, and I still enjoy her interactions and writing drama with her crappy class partner, Nick. These scenes are all highly engaging to me. Cath's roommate, Reagan, is also a lot of fun on the page. I love Levi as much as ever. He is so much wish-fulfillment packed into the body of a college boy, a boy who is so similar to a lot of boys I have known and loved in real life. But it really struck me, this time, that this entire novel reads like a short story. Everything is situational in this book. Cath is reacting to a ""negative/stressful"" situation: that of leaving her happy home nest for a college dorm. Cath has no internal motives for anything, other than nostalgia for the happy home she has ""lost"" by turning eighteen. As a reactive main character, Cath possesses no agency. She ""grows"" in this story only because she is forced to -- and that only happens because good/interesting people with agency keep colliding with her and going out of their way to help her in this wish-fulfillment college setting.This is a long book. It's technically New Adult, since Cath is facing her first year of college, but it is often classified as contemporary YA. I will always love Levi, though I'm removing a star from my rating, from 5 stars to 4, since I no longer have any interest in so much of this book.---- Original Review ---- (March 2014)Oh my goodness, I LOVE this book!!! Sooooo very good!!! I love Cath and Reagan and Wren, I love all of the characters in this book, and I LOVE Levi-- this book makes me want to run (not walk, but run) to Starbucks and buy a gingerbread latte and pumpkin bread, just so I can think about Levi some more. Levi and Cath together. This wonderful love story, this amazing book. I devoured this novel, stayed up WAY too late to finish it, and simply can't say enough how much I LOVE this story. So good so good SO GOOD....more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,Jan 2018not set,"Apr 07, 2018Mar 20, 2014","Mar 20, 2014",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16068905-fangirl
