But alas I think I’m going to skip the rest of the books in the blood of the south lands. This was in my opinion no where near as good as his previous work. Tons of page time was given to characters who were ultimately meaningless to the plot. The writing felt very different to the writing in the Forelands novels. The complexity of the forelands was lost here as well, and instead replaced with extremely repetitive sequences of towns being poisoned. Of course I like Grinsa and Cressene, but they didn’t show up until over halfway through the book and their story in this was just not compelling or interesting at all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 15, 2020","Mar 15, 2020","Aug 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1120984.The_Sorcerers_Plague

Which is a shame because I enjoyed The Wife and Sleepwalking. I enjoy unlikable characters. But there needs to be an ounce of self awareness in a novel like this to be able to pull off the plethora of first world problems colliding here. And alas, not a drop of self awareness to be found. The characters at the center of the novel all send their children to prestigious private schools, take lavish vacations, and live in the most expensive city in the country (one of them rent free because her in laws gave them an apartment), all on one income. The central conflicts for the characters revolve around the judgment and regret they feel for choosing to be stay at home mothers instead of working professionals. Which could have been interesting had the majority of these conflicts not been completely self made by the women themselves. The judgment they feel by other women is obvious projection rather than actual ostracism. Their regret never feels real because for the most part all but one of the women was never passionate about their careers to begin with. Even this would have been tolerable had they not been constantly congratulating themselves for doing what many families would beg to have the privilege to do. Congratulating their husbands for taking jobs with salaries and benefits instead of choosing the life of a starving artist (six figures? Insurance? 401k? Truly how horrible. How brave of them to accept such a difficult life with only minimal grumbles). Congratulating themselves for not complaining when they take advantage of free holiday activities provided by the city instead of vacationing to an island for Christmas (my god, doing free activities???? like peasants!!! And not complaining??????????????) On top of all that the writing was weak. And the characterization is as thin as humanly possible. The (admittedly thin) plot devolves into complete absurdity and cliche by the end. An unmitigated disaster of a book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Feb 12, 2020Feb 12, 2020","Feb 12, 2020Feb 12, 2020","Aug 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1235499.The_Ten_Year_Nap

All the characters are hiding secrets or discovering secrets about themselves. It’s exciting to try and piece together all of the elements and understand all the motivations. Raif’s moral dilemmas are compelling and complex. Where the novel fails for me is when the travelogue takes over.

And I say that as someone who loves a good travelogue fantasy. But a good fantasist finds a way to maintain the tension in the journey, and Jones really doesn’t do that here. Not sure if the net of intrigue or Jones’ stunning prose is enough to make me want to pick up the second volume. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 27, 2019","May 11, 2019","Apr 27, 2019",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2118655.A_Cavern_of_Black_Ice
