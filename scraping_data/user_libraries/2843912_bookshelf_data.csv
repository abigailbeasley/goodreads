Valerie Martin is a seasoned author, but if this is the direction her writing has taken, I'm not impressed. The 1954 brothel setting was unconvincing; it was more like a salon or fancy boardinghouse. All the grubby facts of the trade were glossed over or tidied up. The narrator and madam, Lila Gulliver, was stylish, polished, dignified, and vulnerable in all the winsome ways of a manor matriarch. The main story follows the beautiful, blind prostitute, Carità. Her appeal has a central-casting quality with PG ratings. Too much is scrubbed. Caritá was practically noble, with her aristocratic grace and patrician demeanor. Blindness barely impaired her; she could confidently do most tasks better than the unimpaired and sighted.Lila Gulliver’s ladies are fetching and charming, intelligent and assured. They banter about economic theory and political philosophy (one of the prostitutes is a college student). Caritá, a facile, fast learner, is rarely caught off-guard and uses words such as “piratical.” Carità meets Ian Drohan, a college student and scion of an obscenely wealthy family. Chemistry and pheromones ensue, and the pair become star-crossed lovers. Shit happens, and the scion is now a fugitive, yet he’s fixated with rescuing Carità from the secure and family-like brothel, even as dangerous mobsters are after him. If the author meant it as an irony, it was too on the nose. The plot plodded with a pace and style I’d associate with a debut novelist, not a veteran author. Martin justified, telegraphed, and explained each scene, rather than trusting the reader to imbue the facts with meaning. Moreover, Lila embarks on a rapid romance that was stuffed with coincidence, flimsy and far-fetched, with nothing new to add to the catch-all Cinderella story. The air is soft-focus and aromatic, performative and predictable, and too enlightened for 1954. I appreciate the author’s imagination--creating a fictitious island in an unidentified country or region where prostitution is legal. But her story was rather feigned and incredulous, failing to authentically illustrate the working classes of the time period. What is missing are layered, unlikable characters. Villains were too-obvious caricatures or straws, with overtones of YA crossover. It could have been more inspired if Martin had taken some risks or mined some new territory, or at least gave a sheen to tired tropes. It had potential in the opening pages but soon enough fell into cliché.The oldest profession in this tale has only positive direct effect on an individual or group engaged in it? Just seems dishonest, sit-com-y without the laughs. Too pat, when the working girl with previously zero resources now has more resources than the cultivated and wealthy patron. I had different expectations, less Disney and more Indie. It was hokey but entertaining--warm-hearted and sweet, pure escapism, an idealistic tale of indomitable valor, the women of little means unimpeded by their oppression....more",Notes are private!,4,16,1,"Apr 06, 2024","Apr 08, 2024","Apr 06, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/157981733-mrs-gulliver

Elizabeth S continues to mesmerize us with the stories of ordinary people--told in a deceptively straightforward voice, rich with irony and insights. In Tell Me Everything, two of Strout’s most delightful and ongoing protagonists---Olive Kitteridge and Lucy Barton---finally get up close and personal in Crosby, Maine. (Some folks blame Lucy for the skyrocketing price of housing---she is a successful writer that moved here during the pandemic). You won’t be let down with their meet-and-greet, either. There’s invariably a buffet of body language going on in Strout-world. Olive invites Lucy to come hear a story, true stories that need telling about unrecorded lives.  By now, Olive is ninety years old and Lucy is in her sixties. Lucy visits Olive in a retirement home where Olive now resides; I remember Lucy’s zippered boots and the way she blushes. Olive asks her about Bob, and Lucy tends to get cagey in response. And then Olive shares a story about family. In later meet-ups, there’s typically a segue, sort of like, “How’s Bob?”—legnthy pause, a smile, and then onto the astonishing stories of people you will feel like you know.I thought it was going to be a Lucy/Olive narrative, but it shifts. We still get Strout-filled awkward moments and desperately minor conflicts between those in the ensemble cast. But this is a Bob Burgess book most of all. Lucy experiences some personal Bob drama, but, alas, he is pulled in many directions at once.Bob Burgess is a semi-retired attorney who has also been in previous Strout novels, especially, of course, The Burgess Boys. It’s fine if you have never met him before, because ES will round him out and pull you into the Burgess weeds, not the least of which is a tragedy he shares with his brother. Married to Margaret, a Unitarian minister, he’s a little in love with Lucy. We know he doesn’t seem the cheating kind. Does the heart want what the heart wants? Bob doesn’t think he deserves to be the hero in his life—or even the main character. In Tell Me Everything, he unwittingly, humbly, generously, even reluctantly, gets to be both. Newbies to Strout can start with any of her sparkling books. If you read out of order, you’ll see some spoilers, but it doesn’t hurt too much. That’s not a huge downside. You’ll be immersed in every novel in any order. An elegant and gently spicy writer, she creates characters who breathe on the page. They can be crabby, too. Strout pens crabby, exposed characters better than anyone!Most of the drama in TME is quiet, restless, and inward. Small things lead to big consequences. A haircut causes a surprising riptide of emotions, an unforeseen disturbance that illustrates Strout’s genius in upending routine events. Angst—both existential and specific—haunts her sympathetic cast; unresolved issues can weave and wind and bend their mettle into melancholy. Bob is a sin-eater, says Lucy. He is drawn to people who are stuck in their transgressions. Tall and schlumpy-shaped, Bob has room in his body and soul to absorb the sins of others. He takes on a monkish criminal defendant accused of killing his mother; his ex-wife wrestles with alcohol, and his brother is a hot mess of grief. Bob is needed all over the place, but he struggles to connect with his wife.Whether you are new or familiar to the Strout-verse, you’ll be hooked from the opening pages.

Well-deserved!Everett is an angular writer, coming in sharp from all sides, but also circumspect, by not revealing all the underlying significance. Zack Wells, tenured professor and geologist/paleobiologist, is happiest playing chess with his bright, beautiful 12-year-old daughter, Sarah. Similarly, he is content contemplating an inaccessible cave in the Grand Canyon called “Naught’s Cave.” Hence, the implication of nothingness in his life. It's the old beat-up paradox that nothing is everything.Zach and his wife, Meg, are about to find out some bad news that will cause prolonged torment and a forlorn future. Dr Wells cannot prevent the inevitable tragedy about to befall his family, so he turns to a cryptic message found in a jacket he bought online. Someone is asking for help. Can Zach save a stranger in trouble?“…I had this palpable swath of melancholy that ran through me that I simply could not shake.” That’s a poignant thread that runs through this multilayered story, as is the potential for Zach’s melancholia to transcend---and, maybe not save him, but at least give him a purpose amid the worst horror of his life. (I know that the cover blurb and most s give away the forthcoming tragedy, but I urge readers to discover that for themselves.) While Zach's heart is shattering to pieces, he has an opportunity to be a salvation for people he has only learned about from a distance. If you've read Bolaño's 2666,  you'll apprehend the despairing situation in Ciudad Juárez.Telephone combines family drama, comedy, tragedy, mystery, thriller, and adventure. Everett doesn't exactly answers all our questions; rather, he largely leaves interpretation up to the reader. There are three versions/variations of this book. THREE! Zach has three versions of his life in front of him. And if we got three readers together who each read a different rendition, oh, what a curious event that would be!If you want to know which version you have, you can look below the ISBN number to see if it is A, B, or C. Or look at the gorgeous cover at the minor variations of the illustrated compasses (but you would need to see the three different covers online). There are also three dedications. A is ""For Henry and Miles."" B is ""For Miles and Henry."" C is just ""my sons."" (Mine is the B version.)The eponymous title is from the well-known game. You whisper a message around a circle of people and then have a laugh over how much the final message was distorted from the original. Why would Everett do this?I'll close on some thoughtful words by the author himself: “I’m interested not in the authority of the artist, but the authority of the reader.”...more",Notes are private!,10,46,1,"Mar 25, 2024","Mar 28, 2024","Mar 27, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51541232-telephone

HuckPercival Everett reimagines—no, inverts-- the classic saga of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  that resides in every American’s consciousness. Huck Finn and enslaved Jim’s adventures have been in print for 140 years. If you didn’t read it in American schools, you’ve likely still been affected by its content. Everett reappropriates that story, turns it upside down and inside out, and leans formidably forward by making this a story and POV of Jim, with Huck at his side. I am in awe and in thorough admiration of Percival Everett’s skills and fierce talent. My personal favorites, The Trees  (shortlisted for Booker in 2022), and Telephone  (a finalist for the Pulitzer in 2021) combine laconic protagonists, subversive wit, and tragic events. In James, he has made Twain’s classic his own historical fiction, and I applaud it as the contemporary bookend of Clemen's saga. He improves upon it by giving Jim agency. I predict that they will be teaching both books side by side in the coming years.“White folks expect us to sound a certain way and it can only help if we don’t disappoint them…The only ones who suffer when they are made to feel inferior is us.” This is Jim, teaching his daughter and other enslaved children a lesson in coded speech. Although they speak eloquently amongst themselves, they communicate submissively to white people in a ""slave dialect,"" which enhances their survival in a world where they are nothing but chattel. It also illuminates their resourceful intelligence as they hide (linguistically) in broad daylight from their ignorant “massas.”Additionally, the enslaved people pretend that God and Jesus are primary in their lives, when in actuality, as Jim states, regarding white folks, “religion is just a controlling tool they employ and adhere to when convenient.” How cynical it was that early American Christian identity was predicated on a proslavery theology. As in Twain’s original, Jim and Huck run off together from Hannibal, Missouri and ride the Mississippi River, beginning in a raft. The main plotline of the original text is captured, but comically and dramatically turned on its head. Jim leads a double life—one that he owns, and one that meets white people’s expectations. In fact, there are those that are more threatened by a Black man with eloquence than they are by a Black man with a pistol. Intelligence is Jim’s stunning subterfuge. He has a rich interior life, and in dreams, he debates slavery and philosophy with the likes of Voltaire, Rousseau, and John Locke. As an autodidact who enriched himself in Judge Thatcher’s library, Jim spends stealth nights in there poring over the judge’s books. His quick wit, thoughtful compassion, and deep humanity also become his ammunition in a hostile world. As the plot progresses, Jim and Huck grow closer, and more revelations are gradually disclosed. The major twist is foreshadowed early on, so it doesn’t come out of nowhere, and it changes the complexion of the story. As others have already noted, this is the novel that Everett was born to write.

Saint created it for the freed and formerly enslaved, a haven for those who recently had no personal agency.

I was pregnant wI watched the entire televised Waco siege of David Koresh (Lamb) and the Branch Davidians tragedy as it unfolded in March-April 1993. I was pregnant with my daughter, on temporary bedrest. Our technology was limited yet we thought it was vast. So what did I do? I read books and watched TV, and the Waco siege was the most compelling TV at the time. I was facing potential loss while loss was unfolding on our TV screens. Waco is 100 miles north of Austin, my home, a plain small city with not a whole heckuva lot going for it. Then Waco broke national and international news. That was huge then, in the 1990s, when not even Austin was on the ""destination"" map. Texas writer Bret Anthony Johnston says that this is not the life of David Koresh. Which, I'm going to interpret as--rather, this is the life of fictional characters, Roy and Jaye, and their friends and family. Or consider it as a re-imagining of David Koresh’s clone. I have read some of the non-fiction material on the whole damned catastrophe, and nobody has hit the right notes of truth more than this author.It isn’t just facts that tell a story about an event. It’s emotional and psychological truth that matters, and that’s where it counts for me. The main characters are Jaye, a fourteen-year-old girl and beaux Roy, also fourteen. Roy and Jaye tell their love story in alternating narratives, certainly borne from Johnston’s imagination, but the setting/melding of the calamity in Waco is brilliant. Johnston’s muscular use of language is sizzling, simmering. He uses robust and ripe words and phrases, very physical and forceful and yet sinewy and lucid. No word is superfluous; every sentence is nimble and supple---all five senses engaged, and a memorable romance. It's a page-turner, dear readers!A lot is said about the stars, in metaphor, personification, and just the boundless entirety of its space. This all happened before cell phones kept us connected without interruption, when we had to depend on being there in the room where the telephone rang. There was a lot more waiting, suspense, expectancy, or not knowing that went along with this era right before the explosion of iPhones. Time and space have been reclassified by mobile phones, and some of the magic and anxiety of being able to contact your most important person was wholly different then. “…I imagined a universe where a person could rearrange the stars to relay a message to someone else, a night sky inscribed in cryptic code, an illuminated language of loss.” How much would you sacrifice for a faith or glory, the abstractness of a supreme being? What would you do to save the person you most care about---and what is the meaning of “saved” to these characters? Is it religious, spiritual, emotional, or literal? Would you save your one true love first, or would you save what a charismatic leader calls your “soul.”David Koresh (OK, Perry Cullen in the novel), to some folks, was like Jesus, a prophet of the Seven Seals, a person who could probably quote the entire Bible. To his worshippers, he is inviolable, unassailable. He was also a pedophile, and essentially had babies with babies. But he twisted these people’s minds enough that they believed he was their savior, and everything he did was part of his God-given right.The story progresses with a pacey rhythm and I was on edge the whole time. Does this novel have more impact if you are familiar with the Waco standoff and siege? I do think my knowledge of the event and the minutiae of its moving parts created a particularly ripe suspense for me. However, it is Johnston that held all these facts together and wrote a compelling love story that is superimposed and braided into the dark events of the time. Those of us that followed the story in 1993 will have that whole scenario playing in our heads while we read WE BURNED DAYLIGHT.I also kept thinking of the Supertramp song, “If Everyone was Listening."" At one point, I put it on to connect to the most moving lyrics. It’s from the album, Crime of the Century—“For we dreamed a lot, and we schemed a lot, and we tried to sing of love before the stage fell apart.” It was like a play, Koresh as the mad clown, the compound his stage. “You don’t know what you’ve done, the finale’s begun.”The friendship/romance between Jaye and Roy was deeply emotional but held with subtle restraint. They must have been the two most intelligent, quick-witted people in Waco, their feelings for each other illuminated their vulnerability and their strength. Could it survive—one love on the inside, one on the outside? While Perry Cullen kept his flock close at hand—everyone on the commune had a job to do, there was no plumbing, and there were hard chores to be done—the drama of Jaye and Roy played out. Jaye's mother hauled her to Texas from California to be with Perry Cullen and his nutty flock. Jaye endured, she loved her mother, but she also kept a cautious distance to Perry, at the very least spelling out her boundaries to him, with a cutting tone, if that’s what it took. She knew he tried to groom her, and all the young ones. She was only fourteen, an attractive age for Perry. Yeah, he's  that.Jaye did things like sneak in Cullen’s room when he was gone to use the only telephone in the compound, to call Roy, and to do a bit of sabotage, like pour out Perry’s milk and put the empty carton back in the fridge, or eat his cheese. Lots of people went hungry, there wasn’t sufficient food, but not Perry. He had everything he wanted and more.The story is propulsive, irresistible. It engulfs me. You may break dates, disregard dinner, ignore everything else but the book. It’s so gripping, meaningful, and expressive that you’ll obliterate any obstruction between you and WE BURNED DAYLIGHT. It’s page-turning and maximum appeal, natural sounding, effortless, but you know he worked hard on it with dedication and no fakery. Johnston is a breath of fresh air, a fearsome writer and master storyteller, with tantalizing wordplay.Thank you to Random House for sending me an ARC to read and . It’s a hard act to follow. I’ve been a fan of Johnston since REMEMBER ME LIKE THIS, another ripped-from-the-headlines event written for specific and individual fictional characters. Johnston does that so well.

This particular breed of story is timely and yet commonly overlooked in much of literature. It concerns store-level employees in contemporary times. If it sounds plain for a story, you’re out to lunch! This is a spicy, savory slice of several lives, folks we meet everyday but often don’t realize.The diagrammed graph of the main and subordinate characters at the front of the first pages gave me pause---I wondered how I would keep all these people straight, differentiated. Well, Amy Waldman did that for me. Her characters are so distinct and leap-worthy off the pages that I had no problem separating and identifying each and every coworker, boss, and executive. Even if this novel gets a big publishing boost, I would hail it as a sleeper. I didn’t know that I would be in its grip from start to finish. The crackle, the subterfuge! It’s truly hard to put down!Once you open to page one, you’re locked down for the ride. The plot is seemingly simple. A staff promotion dangles for the daring or deserving worker bee at Town Square, putting sauce in the synergy of a big box team. The quirky or enfant terrible side of the devious parlance keeps us fastened to the story. The crew wants to engineer the outcome, steering the direction for their own choice of boss. That takes teamwork and strategy for the haul of several weeks.Defiance, opposition, and dog-eat-dog—as well as touching support that coworkers can demonstrate, rise to the surface of hearts and minds, and sometimes clings to the shallow and fallow, too. Waldman has a knack for illuminating an individual’s favorable assets as well as the dark side of cleverness. I was as invested in their lives as they were in their own chicanery. For them, it was a matter of survival.HELP WANTED is an ensemble comedic drama. The plot moves at a game clip, and serves to intensify the characters and themes. Is your stature at work important to how you measure your worth? How DO you measure your worth, and what kind of future do you want, v. what you think you are supposed to need? How can you jettison your impediments, and does your past determine your future? Can you overcome your regrets?Town Square prides itself on their diversity and progressiveness. But there’s demand to steady the times—to cut costs, eliminate overtime, and reduce staffing levels.This isn’t one of those momentous novels about changing or saving the world; rather, it’s about the world as it is, about human relations, and a big peek into the retail industry. I worked retail right after I got out of high school---back in the Flintstone era, and though technology has changed the process, the human side remains the same. We are all just people, trying to get along, or ahead, or just pursing a steady pay. HELP WANTED is a blast and a half, touching, tender, and tenacious.Thank you to Norton for sending me a finished copy for . I would not have known to select this for myself.

The stars are our ancestors, but the spiders are too. They are the weaving and the light.” Tommy Orange gets to the soul of Indian/Native spirituality, the whole nonlinear beauty of time and life and celestial grace.It's so rare that I just want to reproduce bushels of quotes from the book as the gist of my . TO’s passages are so elegant and infinite, I am deeply moved by his themes of assimilation, alienation, addiction, sobriety, suicide, stories, sickness, psychosis, isolated trauma and shared trauma, generational trauma, memory, death. I felt a collective consciousness with all the characters, because Tommy Orange puts people in his stories, not stand-ins. It’s fiction, but the characters are specific and dimensional, their interiorities a deep well. He gets to the heart of storytelling.“There are many stories for what happens after you die. You become light or become dead light of stars or you swim the river in the sky or you become the soil in the earth. Angels and demons and ghosts. Anything is a story we tell ourselves about a silence.”Within the author’s sublime language, he makes no bones about the pain of Natives. Like There There, Orange nails it when it comes to addiction, not just from a reportage kind of view, but inside, in the essence of a person who is suffering, screaming inside and yet somehow seeming to function, until they don’t. All the pretty words that Orange uses become solid, brick-like, when he talks about addiction.“That’s what addiction had aways felt like, like the best little thing you’d forget on the worst day possible, or the worst big thing on a day in a life you thought kept getting better because you kept getting high.”I am thrilled I read this right after reading TT. You don’t have to, they both stand alone, but together they are even more exceptional, as this novel is both a prequel and a sequel to  There There. The story opens with the harrowing Sand Creek Massacre of 1864, when the US Army slaughtered the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes. My heart was already in my teeth at that point.The descendant line is re-imagined by Tommy Orange. And the reader learns what happened at the end of  There There,  which was an abrupt bur inexorable cliffhanger of a finale.Tommy Orange also talks about the paradox of the 1924 citizenship bestowed upon Indian tribes in the U.S., how the citizenship was a euphemism for dissolving tribes, dissolve being another word for disappearance, “a kind of chemical word for a gradual death of tribes and Indians, a clinical killing, designed by psychopaths calling themselves politicians.”“Citizenship being granted will be a kind of victory too, because you will not have died in any of the wars or massacres, you will have survived starving and relocation, indoctrination and assimilation, you will have lasted long enough that they had to say that you too, our longtime, once mortal enemy, even you are one of us, even if its meanings, its rights, won’t come for decades, the seed will have become there, in the year you were born.”Tommy Orange put the Natives in Oakland, California on the consequential map; Orange is a national treasure. Keep on writing for us, for everyone, for your tribe, for your culture, and for those outside your culture. We are all connected. If TT was a 5 (yes, it was), then this is a 7, even though we don’t have the stars we can assign for it. We are wandering stars, all of us. I want to add another favorite quote of mine from this book: “Everything about your life will feel impossible. And you being or becoming an Indian will feel the same. Nevertheless you will be an Indian and an American ad a woman and a human wanting to belong to what being human means.”A massive thank you to Knopf for sending me this book without my even asking. You must have known it was written for me, a white, Caucasian, Jewish girl from Boston.

Tommy Orange brings t“She told me the world was made of stories, nothing else, just stories, and stories about stories.”There is SO much there there. Tommy Orange brings to life a Native population in Oakland, California (geographically, not far from San Fransisco), and he explores how stories intersect with Native lives. Muscular prose propels TT and he fans it with allegory. (And now I understand how last names with a color are Native names).TT is exciting and confrontative. I used that rather than confrontational, as he isn’t out to solely confront the reader. It just sobers you up with the confrontations of being human and marginalized. Orange isn’t fucking around. I feel that urgency of time through him, that it is crucial to share these stories, laced with myths and beliefs, the individuals plagued with multitudes of addiction, and how people can feel limited by their class, wanting to sidestep their Indian culture while others find joy in their heritage. Some Indians seek their culture out emphatically, especially when it has been removed from their lives by elder family members.I was struck by how TO can weightily foreshadow events without being heavy-handed. In fact, it demonstrates how things can go out of control in a macro way. There are all these microcosms of families with minimal control over their lives. They don’t do well leading their lives, and it ends up with astonishing levels of shame, brought on when they spiral into addiction. I applaud Tommy Orange for following through with his readers. I felt satisfied with an ending that leaves room for speculation. If he had ended it 24 hours later, there would be more resolution. TO took the road less traveled and is yet a compelling choice.Speaking of, when Gertrude Stein said, “There’s no there there,” according to TO, she isn’t talking about Oakland as a whole. She was referring to her neighborhood when she came back years later, and it was gone. Gone as she knew it. Some folks get reductive in interpreting what she meant.I had this ARC sitting untouched on my shelf for 6 years. But when Knopf sent me an ARC of WANDERING STARS recently, I knew that it was time. (I have a thousand books unread, because I accrue so many). Sure, I am now gobsmacked by this piercing book!More intriguing-- how time itself leans on the novel. It was published in 2018, and, in the story, an observation is made that the 1989 Bay Bridge collapse would have had a higher death toll had it not been for people staying home to watch the Oakland A’s play the World Series. And how they were really kicking it—or, actually, batting it. A three-year WS winning streak. But, that was told in this 2018 novel. Here is what chills me now, which I learned recently. Between then and 2023, three of Oakland’s major sports teams have been sold to other cities. What is wrong with this picture? Everything! But that came after the book. I’m so used to reading the latest books that I almost forgot the reminders of how reading slightly older books can be a chilling timestamp later on.This is an ineluctably climactic blending and ending of struggling Natives in a community that regularly eats them up and spits them out. But it’s no pity party. TO is talking about his own people, and he is not taking any prisoners. Now, on to Wandering Stars. I already went on too much about a book that has already been ed thousands of times over. But it felt fresh and alive and burning for me. (And that Chekov line [never stated in the book] comes true, of course).Although TT covers the Native population, it is accessible for all. It’s a domestic drama and thriller. It’s not just relentlessly Native, it is ruthlessly human. Thank you to Knopf and the Vine program for sending this to me six years ago! :) Late, but not never.

Yet, she is suis generis. All her own. And, there’s a little bit of Bee Sting ending but it’s a glass half full rather than a glass half empty. OK, I hope what I just wrote is not derogatory these days---love child and all that. I’m old school. Forgive my trespasses and just enjoy the transgressions of the characters. The flourishing story. You don’t get the whole palette for a while, which may frustrate direct involvement. But once I got on, I got on! Just know that you have to be able to live with a certain degree of uncertainty for longer than your usual comfort zone.Caoilinn Hughes just windswept me, she blew me away. Slowly, though. OK, she may be a niche author, because you get out of it what you put into it. This novel is not a sudden grab-you book. Not in the plotted-ness way. She doesn’t broadcast or state the obvious. She points you to the character she is writing about at any given moment. What you do is observe what they are doing. She’s a physical, vigorous writer. The characters are always DOING things. You learn about them and peep out the plot (and eventually, themes) by watching what they do, and there’s a lot of doing.And that baby. That baby Leo. He is priceless. I never wanted a boy baby until Leo! I want to see him get those candy fish. I wanted to get a spoon, and eat him up, or just inhale Leo.The countryside there in Ireland—most breathtaking ever. Now I must go and follow the path of these four sisters. Ireland has always been on my bucket list, now it feels more urgent. As I read, I saw the aperture on this novel open, following one dynamic scene after another. Eventually, they begin to gel. It’s fleshy and corporeal prose, but not pretentious or purple. Gradually, memories and past traumas are revealed, tragedies recovered when the sisters unite.THE ALTERNATIVES provides a forensic observation of character, from the outside looking in rather than putting it all in the author-to-readers head. It isn’t the plot that moves—it’s the sisters that move, and move the reader--where their eyes roam, where their hands go, their legs move. One sister, Nell, is benumbed in her feet, can’t feel them. She uses her knees on the pedals when driving! So, there’s four Flattery sisters. I know, dig the name? All have PhDs, but Maeve’s was honorary. Maeve is a culinary foodie chef, adventurous and experimental. When we meet her, she’s doing a catering job for a snob, and there’s food everywhere, the kind you’ve maybe never heard of, it’s so gastronomical. She is running around like crazy, it’s almost hard to keep up. Focus. I had to focus. She lives in London, is writing a book---having a bit of a tension with her publishers. She parks her houseboat where she can, so not always London. And her boatmate tenant is a mime who occasionally speaks.It opens during current events, with the eldest sister, Olwen, a geology professor in Galway, hyper-concerned with climate change and the planet. Its real, not a “trendy” thing for her. She drinks too much gin and it turns comical at times. Ol lives with her boyfriend and his two adolescent sons. The opening follows her and her students; she is soon on a fieldtrip with them. Her students love her, she is relatable and compassionate about planet Earth, and Ireland.Rhona is a mover and shaker in the political science world, and teaches at Trinity in Dublin. Leo is her one-year-old son. Nell is a philosophy professor in the States, in Connecticut. And she would be more on tenure track if she was more “academic-capitalist compliant.” But, yeah, no. She’s the benumbed one, also, and the youngest of the four.These distinct and disparate sisters don’t stay much in contact. They were orphaned early (Nell was only around 11, now she is 33), and Olwen had to finish raising them. Soon after the opening, and this isn’t much of a spoiler, Olwen disappears, which---things as must---it forces the sisters to re-establish contact and locate her. There are some clues, because Olwen is eccentric in Olwen’s ways. We all leave our footprints, no matter what.So, I’ve laid it out a little. It is full of action and adventure, but as I’ve emphasized, not in the usual plot-centered ways. It took me a while, to be honest, to get into the book. There aren’t any gimmicks, and Hughes doesn’t explain. So, you, the reader, are also the finder, or detective. It’s active reading, not passive sponging. You do arrive, with these four magnetic sisters, at a centered plot. Hughes’ writing is incorruptible, and the narrative advances without station identification or exposition, with subtext all over it. There’s a dusting of social justice, where Hughes’ love of Ireland is evident.Once I caught up, and the narrative hit its stride, I was rapt. I was transported to everywhere this novel went, all over Ireland, and to the border of Northern Ireland and England. From the small nuances to the big events, I was consumed. All you have to do is pay attention. (I do not suggest this on audio book. Well, I never do audio books but I think it is safe to say this isn’t meant for that). There’s a fellow I fell in love with, too. He’s not a main character, but he could walk off these pages and into my life any day of the week. I’m dancing with Caoilinn Hughes, following her every step, and every word she plays on the page. Hands down (or up), this will be one of my top books of the year. I’ve been indented with these sisters and this story and baby Leo. And that gentleman I fell for. Oh, and a slice of Dirty Dancing! Thank you so thoroughly to Riverhead for sending me an ARC to .

You can start with “To” or you can start with “Fro.” Either end is a beginning. Two different stories that yet merge in vivid but elliptical ways. It's also beguiling and playful. I started with Fro (it was random). Now that I think of it, I’m speculating that most people will start with “To” because we are familiar with saying, “to and fro” and not “fro and to.” Either/or, To & Fro is a stunning book of narratives.Annamae, in Fro, remains my best-loved character, this spunky, wily, and writerly young girl. I think she and her linguist mother enhanced or transcended the kabbalistic themes of Cohen’s story. That is, in Jewish culture (secular or not), letters and words aren’t simply letters and words (as we readers and ers can relate to, Jewish or not!). They are sacred, even the profane words.Words have power, a holy meaning within, not just the definition, but Word. They have a life of their own. There’s a theory that the universe was created from the Hebrew alphabet, that letters are equivalent to atoms or molecules. You don't have to know a thing about Judaism to enjoy this book. I am giving this interpretation from my life experiences. However, Cohen penned this for all readers. You may observe other aspects, features, or analysis than I have done here. It's universal, her themes of maturing and evolving. And, in doing so, pondering the ways we reach out to our mirror selves.Scholarly--or any readers--could make short shrift of my words, in trying to explain Cohen’s. But, since childhood, I have believed that letters and words have a mighty, colossal spiritual force. As I experienced the book, and the importance of words, letters, and books IN this book, I felt that To & Fro was a sort of “tikkun olam” --- Hebrew for repairing the brokenness of the world. There is a lot said about brokenness, as you shall see. “Who can say what’s beyond repair? They scare me, the broken bits, but I am curious about them, too.”The ellipses of the Talmud---the debates by rabbis about the meaning of the Torah, comes to life here. There is even a rabbi in Cohen’s book, in the Fro story. She asked the right questions! Annamae’s journal possesses an electric energy. She draws in it, too. What she includes is in the stars, the sky, the earth, the sea---everywhere. In her mind, her heart, her soul. She has a slice of mirror taped to the outside. Such an imaginary child. “One whole section was dedicated to the alphabet, page upon page where she recorded each letter and all its attributes: color, personality, age, hobbies, siblings, favorite food, gender. Some letters were very definitely girl or boy, some contained aspects of both, and some had no gender at all.”“To” is also kabbalistic. It’s a Fool’s journey. A twelve-year-old girl, Ani, goes on a quest, walks far away and meets new people that live and experience life in ways she hadn’t known before. She was searching for the ""Captain,"" who had cared for her for 5 years, and got off the path for him and onto a new one. She has with her a stolen kitten. Everyone in this book is learning, debating. In the To side, I sw the overlaps in both stories. Some in words, some phrases, and certainly themes. Ani cannot initially read (this could have been a hundred years ago—Cohen did a superior job of not revealing the year, or referring to it, it could be ancient or contemporary). But she engages with a group that studies and debates the stories of our life. Talmudic meanings.Cohen writes in clean, simple, but not reductive, prose. Don’t be deceived. Her themes and philosophies center on coming of age; individuals and communities interpreting the world around us; and translating the meaning of life—big themes done with sensitivity and precision. Even the ambiguities are meticulously portrayed. Cohen writes with care, with specificity of character. Her stories about storytelling are masterfully executed.“I’m a breath held by a larger breath, held on a current of air, drifting around above this house…”A big thank you to Bellevue for sending me an ARC for .

It’s a manipulation. It’s a way of containing unmanageable chaos.”I started with that quote since my favorite “I began to understand what a story is. It’s a manipulation. It’s a way of containing unmanageable chaos.”I started with that quote since my favorite kind of novel is when the teller is a writer who blends their private life with their writing life, and makes you stop for a minute to enjoy the turn of phrase they used to say it. It's written like you are reading the pages of a diary.This is the 21st century edition of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (even though Albee wrote a play and this is a novel). It’s equally cruel, more so, because the language is updated for a contemporary accessibility, rather than your mother's and grandmother's one (or father's and grandfather's!). In Woolf, husband and wife were both such flamboyant alcoholics, it matched the times and the way these stories of alcoholism were told—and it mirrored Liz and Dick’s marriage. Does this mirror a former Manguso marriage? LIARS version contains addiction, but a potpourri of them. The cause and the worst of coping mechanisms for their bad behaviors. Jane and John’s marriage was rife with verbal, emotional, and push-and-shove kind of physical abuse. It was hard to ""watch"" at times. Yes, Manguso's prose soars right to the rot. She is a whiz at depicting Jane's pain, so alarming that it took the air right out of me.I hear the “why not just get a divorce” complaint, but, in Jane’s mind, she is staying with her husband for the sake of their child. Biggest reason, despite the cliché. I doubt that anyone who stays for that reason would ever give that advice to their friends, though. Aren't we such contradictory creatures. I think she thinks that, and believes it, but Jane, like everyone else, has blind spots. If she had no blind spots, she would not be married to this man! Of course, the story is told from Jane’s perspective, not John’s. So, there you go. If Manguso is *Jane much?,* or maybe some of Jane, then she-- Manguso--knows you know—it’s pretty naked.One of the more eerie aspects of this novel is how the child is never named. Various descriptors used except for his name, usually “the child.” The generic names of John and Jane are obvious---there are so many marriages that are like theirs and go on for years. People are scared, financially and emotionally--and all other kinds of dependent. They are afraid of change, or they think that nobody else will love them, and they will otherwise grow old all alone.But getting back to the unnamed child. I’m still asking myself, and won't arrive at just one answer. Maybe Jane hasn’t acknowledged her son as a separate being yet, an individual apart from her. That she's completely lost if he isn't part of her, and not just genetically. Does Jane embellish, or say the opposite of what she means? She’s definitely pointed but not always on-point. She can be sly and slippery, that one. But she’s also been living with a man she feels is a sneering, contemptuous, dismissive toxic male. Is he as bad as she says? Is she as righteous in her indignation as she says, or is she playing the martyr? Or a little of both, maybe. I think Manguso, even if it is autofiction, is not asking us to find her fully credible (nor for us to believe that John is nothing but a complete snot). Jane states John makes a lot of money but is selfish and injudicious with it, too. According to her, he seems to both want his wife to take care of the child 98% of the time, but make more money than she’s making. However, he is a failed artist and Jane is a more successful one. Jealous much? That part is highly credible. There’s also room to question the insufferable pair of them! Question: why are their cats always vomitus? I think Jane should change cat food brands.Thank you so much to Hogarth for this galley. It was difficult to read at times, it’s 95% grim. It’s hard to enjoy enjoy, but it was revelatory, however venty, and a book Sarah Manguso needs to get out of her system. She and her Jane have a witty severity. Super jaded—no sugar here at all.

As in all her novels, she createsLiz Moore is equally compassionate about all of her characters, even the worst behaved, in this slow burn of a book. As in all her novels, she creates a deft, complex plot that weaves its way around her vivid setting. Moore consistently explores traumatic childhoods, addiction, crime, and the class system. GOTW takes place at a nature preserve that is portioned to serve as the home of wealthy families and their caretakers in the Adirondacks, as well as a summer camp for youth. The action happens between 1951 and 1975; the chapters alternate back and forth non-linearly between a storied cast and two storylines. In 1961, the beloved “Bear”— eight-year-old son of wealthy Peter and Alice Van Laar, goes missing on a hike. Fourteen years later, their teenage daughter, Barbara, disappears from the Preserve’s Camp Emerson. Moore combines a police procedural with a character study, amid a stark portrait of a community and the overlap of personal lives with work. Crime and character blend beautifully together. Especially engaging is Judyta (Judy), recently promoted from State Trooper to Investigator. If you’re old enough to recall the seventies, you’ll recognize what it was like for women trying to make it in a profession dominated by men. Judy was forced to balance her ambition and desire with her second-class status as female. T.J., the caretaker’s daughter, is an enigmatic woman who is now the camp Director. Friend or foe? Villain or hero---or anti-hero? Several layers there to unwrap. Most of the men in this novel are cretins, with a few exceptions.Alice, the mother of Bear and Barbara, and the wife of Peter Van Laar, is an alcoholic. After the disappearance of Bear, her life collapsed. Husband Peter is either at work, or detached from her at home. It is not surprising, as she was raised by an aloof mother who criticized and nagged her relentlessly. Peter treated his children as commodities, while Bear was Alice’s whole reason for being. Alice remains distant to Barbara, who mostly fends for herself. The fearless teen couldn’t wait until the start of her first year at camp. She befriends Tracy, a usually sullen and reclusive girl who gradually flourishes once Barbara befriends her.If you’re a Liz Moore fan, you already know that each of her novels are completely different stories, yet with ongoing themes of family and toxicity. The narrative abounds with loneliness, misogyny (especially in the 1970s!), detective work, and substances as a coping mechanism. Moore attends to her story with empathy and nuance, and she knows her era. No anachronisms, either! Her time period is spot-on. And it isn’t pop-cultured or gimmicky. It’s a finely wrought plot that centers on nature, nurture, community and individuals searching for connection. The author’s rendering of the privileged v. blue-collar is done with attentive care. A dynamic must-read for Liz Moore fans and literary fiction lovers alike.A huge thanks to Riverhead for sending me a copy to read and ....more",Notes are private!,12,40,1,"Jan 25, 2024","Jan 29, 2024","Jan 25, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/199698485-the-god-of-the-woods

There are so many plot and time twists that I was fairly wide-eyed leading up to and including the denouement. The author divided this thriller into five acts, and you’ll rip through this pretty quickly, despite the lingering opening. The playwright narrator enjoys teasing us by meandering from past to present, and just as he is about to make a salient point, he digresses into a comment or confession of a previous incident or his own motives.This locked-room-ish murder mystery takes place on a Greek island owned by one of the characters. They are all wealthy---Kate and American-born Lana are successful actors, Leo is Lana’s son, about to go to university. Jason is Lana’s husband, Agathi is more than just Lana’s cook—she is like a personal assistant-cum-family member. And Nikos is a monk-like caretaker and gardener. Elliot is the playwright/narrator.The group is invited by Lana to have a long Easter weekend on the island. After they arrive, you begin to gradually learn that some are friends, some are frenemies, and others are just disloyal brats to each other. The “fury” refers to the strong and furious winds on the island; there’s a goddess of the morning air and a curious myth that goes along with it, adding some atmosphere to Michaelides tale. Unreliable narrator themes abound amongst this group of “friends,” which will keep you guessing till the finale, and beyond.I thank Celadon for gifting me this ARC. I have read several other Celadon books that I absolutely adored. I don’t think it is fair for me to assign stars here, however. THE FURY is not my cuppa or my kind of genre that I would choose on my own. I haven’t read any of Michaelides previous books, either, so I have nothing to compare this to in his oeuvre. If you enjoy locked-room Agatha Christie-type mysteries, give THE FURY a chance, to see if it satisfies your taste. This is clearly genre, a crowd-pleaser with many twists and turns. I wish I could properly evaluate it, but clearly I’m the wrong person for that, so I don’t want to misdirect anyone to read it or not to read it.

Without being gratuitous, Rapp inAn epic novel that spans almost fifty years from 1951—2010, WOLF AT THE TABLE satisfied several of my reading urges. Without being gratuitous, Rapp introduces characters with various mental health disorders, folded into a domestic drama of six siblings. They were raised by a withdrawn war vet father and a stern, religious Catholic mother. The siblings are so unlike each other---Fiona is beatnik/hippie, Myra is earthy and solid, Alec is isolative and friendless (he sustained merciless abuse by priests). One died a baby, and you’ll read about the others. My takeaway is that the Larkin family represents a slice of American life--- a combination of candid, passive, violent, rebellious, conforming---there’s a gentle side and an underbelly of psychopathology. There's a serial killer in the midst, or should I say the mist? Accountability proves a tough road.Rapp understands the nuances of schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and sociopathy, avoiding clichés I’ve seen when a writer fails to do their homework. I suspect he’s had an up-close-and-personal experience from someone close to him. Either that, or he’s just exceptional on his research and execution. (One misstep—I’ve never seen an onset of schizophrenia at age eleven). As a psychiatric nurse, I am wary when I read about characters that I see every day. But Rapp predominantly passed the smell test. His maladjusted characters are credible and complex. WOLF is the landscape of the American Dream/American Nightmare.His main protagonist, Myra Lee, is the oldest of her siblings, and definitely the most well-drawn in the novel. Like me, she is a nurse, and skilled at working with clients who have psychiatric disorders and criminal behaviors. She is a strong and selfless individual, and was the glue of the family, certainly the moral compass. Readers get a clear view of her thoughts and feelings, and she was a fictional stand-in for Rapp’s mother, with poetic license.We meet thirteen-year-old Myra in 1951, on an after-church Sunday, during her only free time. She’s the one in charge of her sister Joan, who has Down’s syndrome, so she relishes this brief weekly liberty, when she sits in her favorite diner to read. A hidden copy of Catcher in the Rye is taped under a table, courtesy of an understanding waitress. A first edition copy of the Salinger book wends its way through the Rapp novel, symbolizing angst, alienation, connection, lost innocence---all themes that the author tackles in this novel.Immersed in Holden Caulfield, Myra gets interrupted by a handsome and charismatic older chap claiming to be Mickey Mantle, who assertively grabs a seat beside her. The persona of Mickey Mantle, like Holden Caulfield, also becomes a motif (along with a rare MM baseball card). He’s the first “wolf at the table” that we meet. A few more will follow.When WOLF is on point, it shines. It’s credible and immersive, and the last seventy pages were riveting. Occasionally it lagged, it could have used a trim in the middle and sides, (when I’d see the author flickering behind the curtain). Perhaps one more draft would have tightened it up. Rapp would wax burlesque, but then he’d get over the hump and reel me back in.

He accepts decent pay to oust Ivar, the only inhabitant of a remote island beyond Shetland---he has to “clear” Ivar from the island. John and his wife, Mary, are struggling to make ends meet, ever since he broke ties with the established church patronage system and joined the Free Church, which doesn’t yet have an actual church for him to live in and preach from. The small boat he is in for the last leg of travel tips over from a boisterous sea, but he ultimately lands safely, only to have an accident that renders him unconscious. It is Ivar that finds him and nurses him back to health. Ivar speaks a Scots language unknown to John, but as time passes, they each learn a bit of the other’s language, and begin to communicate. John is now feeling awkward about evicting a man who saved his life. I mean, yeah!This short novel is told from alternating povs, of main characters John, wife Mary, and Ivar. Ivar has a tragic past, followed by so many years of no human contact you wouldn’t blame him if he cried all the time. But he doesn’t—he knits, fishes, stays busy and staves off misery. He desperately misses other human beings, no shame in that. You will see what he does with a found photo of Mary. No, it’s not vulgar at all, it’s totally sweet and cheered me up. Despite Ivar’s loneliness, I thought he was inspiring and gentle. I was curious whether he would possess a few harsh streaks in him, living alone all these years. So, besides being a survival-in-the-wilderness story, the beating heart of it concerns humans being human with each other and the touches of sadness from living a lonesome life. Ivar wasn’t perpetually lonely because he stayed active doing things he enjoyed. I’d like to think I would be as resourceful as Ivar if I were all alone. But there are times when the lack of human contact is soul-crushing.There wasn’t a lot of emotional excitement at first, although it is adventurous from page one. Throughout the story, the reader witnesses the quotidian lives of John and Mary, their mundane but interconnected lives. Aren’t most lives mundane, repetitive, peppered with intervals of emotional highs? Well, this is a story that quietly leads the reader to the emotional highs--new experiences for John, Mary, and Ivar. It’s my first time reading Davies—she has a flair for interiority, and sets her scenes like an artist. Even when a character is active and dealing with the harsh elements of nature, we also sense the distilled essence of their private lives.Davies writes in a clean, lean, stark style, not even a whiff of an extra word. Her polished prose is measured, building to a surprising, unpredictable denouement. Climate and landscape move the tale along, with the roar of the ocean, silent banks of fog, and the explosion of birds covering the sky. Misty and hazy, it’s the summer season of dusky light, no complete darkness on these far north islands. CLEAR is a superb blend of outdoor survival and inward desire, slow to unfold but with a satisfying and touching finale. Be sure and read the author’s note and dictionary of terms in the Norn language, from which Scots is derived. Davies draws upon Jakob Jakobsen’s Etymological Dictionary of the Norn Language in Shetland, written in the early 20th century. There are multiple and infectious terms for the various kinds of mist, sea, waves, wind, and other features of nature. For example, yog is a heavy sea with short, choppy waves. Dalareek is mist rising from low-lying stagnant water. What an intriguing language!ADDENDUM Feb 7, '24. I keep thinking about this book. I originally had 4+ stars, but it lingers, I even had a dream about it, and the more I think back on it, the more longing I have for the narrative, the setting, the characters---well, all of it. The problem with rating a book right after reading it is that it is only in the moment. But, in this case, it is CLEAR to me that it is a 5-star book that deserves awards. The denouement initially seemed incredulous to me, which lowered my star rating. But, over time, for some reason, it ceased to matter.

At first, I had trouble getting on board, as it felt too much like a bland memoir (I read mostly fiction). However, as I rolled further into the Scottish Highlands in Parini’s shaky Morris Minor, with Borges as the Delphic passenger, I got attached to the pair of them, two unlike characters bonding over poetry, imagination, literature, and beauty. Parini was in charge, as Borges was by this time fully blind. I did find it odd that Jay, as a post-grad student working on his doctorate, had never read Borges (and a few other celebrated poets/writers), but I let that go. I’m sure that by now he has read Borge’s entire oeuvre. The “encounter” is 1971, and Borges has been left in Jay’s care after only meeting him recently. Jay is 22, studying for his PhD at St Andrews, attempting a dissertation and a meeting with poet George Mackay Brown in Orkney. A road trip through the Highlands together places Borges and Parini in some mad circumstances. I have been to a few of those places, so I felt especially warmed to the Scottish landscape, in all its grim and glory. Borges is in his early 70s and a bit bananas, which frustrates Jay but eventually wins him over. Borges’ madcap animus is infectious and edifying to the young hopeful scholar. Moreover, there are some quotes that shattered me in its relevance for today. Back then, it was the war in Vietnam that Jay protested—his Scotland move was partly to avoid the draft. His dear friend, Billy, has already been conscripted into this dangerous combat. Words about war from Parini:“A war is an enormous funeral, and one should proceed sadly into battle, in humility, with a bowed head, fully aware that one might never be forgiven. I knew I’d never for a second approve of any rhetoric about war that verged on the exultant. There was no glory in war, only shame for having lacked the imagination to prevent this stumble into the abyss.”Borges and Me is a touching Fool’s journey into clarity and minfulness. At first, it seemed that Parini was aching to get away from himself, despite his ambitious studies. By the end of his short trip with Borges, Jay had matured, learned some profound insights about writing and life. One insight that stunned me was how two people can each write an original poem, years apart, but words that move in the same sphere, from different times, different places--poems written by two writers wholly unaware of each other while paradoxically the unrelated poets liberate the poem from originality and into the same realm. A poem that “exists only when refashioned and re-created.” It sounds dizzying when I look back at my wobbly description, but when Borges explains it, it’s lucid and beautiful.“Light filtered through the mask of Borges: a pale yellow glow with its own enigmatic brilliance. One somehow felt more intelligent, more learned and witty, in his presence. The universe itself felt more pliable and yielding, more available.”...more",Notes are private!,1,14,1,"Jan 08, 2024","Jan 12, 2024","Jan 08, 2024",,,view (with text),/book/show/51997883-borges-and-me

And the way that Bradley keeps it in the spotlight is just genius.I can't totally explain why I DNF-ed this. I needed the narrative to have some peaks and valleys that I didn't feel were there. I got tired, but that's on me, not the author. I'm not assigning stars because I am not qualified. I read 150 pages, and learned a lot within its rather dense narrative. I encourage anyone to crack this open who likes mixed dystopian genres and a fresh take on time travel, such as how it affects the human body, both physically and psychologically.

This longing had me searching for a magical solution, and I was always just a sisterWhen I was a child, I wished that one day I’d be gifted a sister. This longing had me searching for a magical solution, and I was always just a sister away from my dreams-come-true. I’m a voracious reader, and BEAR registered high on my wish list, a story of two sisters, a year apart in age, who thirst for a better life. They possess concrete dreams for the future—a way to boost their financially strapped status while continuing to be devoted to each other above anyone else. Julia Phillips delivers a tense and meaningful allegory about family and expectations, an island story based on Grimm’s Snow White and Rose Red. If you haven’t read that fairytale, not to worry---you’ll enjoy this novel for its depth of character, unusual setting, wooded atmosphere, and submerged plot. Sam and Elena are in their late twenties, financially struggling to survive on San Juan Island, known for its wealthy visitors. The island is part of the archipelago of islands of northwestern Washington, a distinctive, contained non-urban place that attracts year-round tourists and mainlanders with vacation houses there. The sisters cling to each other for support as they lovingly care for their dying mother, who formerly ran a salon. The nail solvents used then eventually destroyed her lungs. The sisters plan to sell the crumbling, decayed house when their mother dies, and start a new chapter of their lives somewhere else. The house sits on land that’s worth a mint, so the young women will inherit a significant amount of cash when they sell. Elena bartends at a golf club and Sam sells snacks to mainlanders on the Anacortes ferry. Both feel frustrated by insufficient funds, and resentful of the well-heeled guests they cater to and depend on for tips. Their lives are routine and repetitive, restricted by a deficit of money and an ailing mother. Most days are predictable, habitual with boredom and eroded desires. Then, one night, Sam spots a bear from her perch on the ferry. The beast is swimming in the channel, apparently headed for Canada. How does the appearance of a bear change their dedicated plans and their day-to-day lives? Does it presage a magical fairytale fate or is it a harbinger of foreboding doom? Why does it show up on their property, and keep coming back? Safety is upended by the animal’s frequent visits, and Sam’s sense of dread is impugned by Elena’s exulted mood.BEAR is a parable of untold secrets that could tear the sisters apart, a narrative that haunted me beyond its astonishing finale. Phillips is a daring novelist who writes outside the box, colors beyond the lines, belies definition and invites interpretation. If you’re seeking all the answers, BEAR may not be for you. But for readers fiercely fond of an elliptical tale, this story will stun you with its furious, dark suspense.Thank you to Hogarth Press for sending me an early copy for ....more",Notes are private!,9,39,1,"Dec 29, 2023","Jan 03, 2024","Jan 03, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/196056205-bear

Elizabeth Crook (a fellow Austinite!) wastes no time in taking the reader on a trailblazing ride of the Lone Star State. The landscape is stunning and the superb storytelling left me breathless. If you want setting, characters, plot, and pathos to meet your demands and leave you wanting more, you’ve come to the right pace. And place!It’s Texas during Reconstruction, the times are changing but foul gangs will maim and murder you for their entertainment. Strong enough for a man but created by a woman, The Madstone is a literary epic of Texas, from the Hill Country to the Gulf Coast, and all manner of small and larger towns in-between. If you are a Texan or Texas-curious, or dig adventure and historical fiction mixed with well-researched facts, you’re in for a wild time, so saddle up and get ready for madcap violence mixed with mayhem and romance and a few killer kisses. Outlaws, renegades, a naïve young man and a very pregnant lady (Nell) with her young son (Tot) are now all running from or to something that’s teeming with danger. A cursed necklace stalks the heroes and villains and, oh, do you know what a madstone is? It’s a deer-belly organ of minerals and hairball, and, as legend has it, will prevent rabies if you’re bitten. Soak the madstone in milk and apply. Carpenter Benjamin Shreve is the 19- year-old steadfast, honest narrator, an earnest young man who has no idea that he is a first-class storyteller, too, but readers, you’ll see that in his heart-to-heart recounting, he captivates us with a story as tasty and juicy as a Fredericksburg peach!Ben doesn’t know, when he sees a treasure hunter squatting next to a privy, that his life is about to turn sideways. He witnesses a runaway stagecoach and, soon after, an unsparing shooting and white-knuckle getaway; our protagonist is in the wrong place at the right/wrong time. Ben is subsequently about to fall on his knees in love and dare to stand up to armed villains. This unexpected road trip opens next to the shit shack, where this Dickie dude unloaded his guts because the town sheriff here in Comfort, Texas was using the desired privy for similar purpose. The sheriff initially takes no pity when he arrests Dickie for public defecation. But Ben comes to the rescue and has his first heroic turn by saving Dickie from jail. After witnessing the shooting, and saving Dickie, and falling instantly in love with Nell, and compelled to protect Tot, Ben and Nell and Tot and Dickie are soon running from an East Texas gang called The Swamp Fox Gang. They are after Nell and Tot, and now Ben and Dickie. I was an excited passenger, following one fleeing event after another and hotly turning pages in this cat and mouse suspense. The Swamp Fox Gang doesn’t abide by the post-slavery laws of the land; instead, they prey on and torture freed souls. Nell is being hunted down by the blood of her blood for making a hard choice against the gang. The Swamp Fox gang includes her in-laws who are now outlaws, and other facts as yet to be revealed, so I will let the pages and Ben do the talking.I’m enthralled by the number of books that Crook devoured in order to tell Madstone authentically. I fear the future of phony research and lazy groundwork—writers using Chat GPT and AI instead of deep diving into the necessary historical background. But, readers, I am confident that we will instinctively know when writers are taking shortcuts instead of putting out the effort. Those books will be soulless and trifling. After reading a treasure like The Madstone, I feel hopeful again that truthful fiction will maintain a stronghold and the flim-flam writers will be exposed. The Madstone isn’t a perfect book—it could have been tightened up and a few pages shorter, but it was evident that Crook’s heart and soul went into every page, and the research she did made it that much stronger. She is a classy writer that earned and deserved the prestigious Texas Writer Award for this year.Thank you to Little Brown and Company for sending me an ARC for ....more",Notes are private!,10,22,1,"Dec 19, 2023","Dec 24, 2023","Dec 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123200277-the-madstone

THIS PLAUGUE OF SOULS sAs much as I am an enthusiastic contender for ambiguity in a story, I have to feel something organic and true from the center. THIS PLAUGUE OF SOULS seeps its message from the corners, but then quickly evaporates. The writer teased me relentlessly, but I’m not sure that he ultimately penetrated my literary desires. He is enigmatic and provocative, “plaguing” us on every page---with the clues of a deathly event that threatens Western Ireland, and a world-at-end possibility. Nealon, the protagonist, has just been released from prison and has swiftly arrived at his family home, only to find that his wife and young son are gone. Then he receives several phone calls from an unidentified man who wants to meet up with him, and who hints that he knows the location of Nealon’s wife and child. I was hot to know the details at this stage of the story.As the pages turned, I experienced a gnawing anxiety about whatever it was that I didn’t know. I thought that Nealon may have had something to do with this upcoming incident—or the outcome of the incident, which is perhaps why this man wanted to meet up with him. We do learn some of the scheme that Nealon was involved in prior to prison, but it seemed that the author was needlessly cagey and cryptic about when, why, and what was happening now, not just leaving us in the dark, but flashing the lights on and off, on and off, on and off. McCormack is a bold writer who stole my attention with his first page. However, it thinned out; he continued to needle me with some kind of (repetitive) foreshadowing regarding events, but I felt no joy at what seemed to be an empty hand. Or am I slow on the uptake? Big and perilous moments augur in all the cracks and crannies of the text, but the more the chapters proceed, the more vague the story. It’s like a horror movie that taunts you with menacing music but no real intruder is ever seen. I heard the drumbeat, felt the danger, but everything stayed behind the curtain.Instead of intriguing me, I eventually felt annoyed at the opacity of the tale. It’s fine to be convoluted and obscure, if there’s a purpose and some kind of closure. But the more it went on, the more it devolved into a paradoxically derivative kind of dystopian formula---but a formula without end. It’s baffling and occasionally shocking, in-your-face physical violence but out-of-sight global events. If this was written over ten years ago, I’d likely be hypnotized by what is going on—or not going on. But now it is a genre, and I thought that McCormack pulled it this way and that for effect, rather than telling us a coherent story. He showed us the stage, some of the props, and hid the main event. I’m probably wrong, but sometimes I speculated that McCormack didn’t have a full story, so he just kept setting the stage. Years ago, that would have been sufficient, it would have been new and invigorating. But now that dystopian novels flood the market, I want some singularity; there needs to be a deeper conflict or plot at its core here, not just a lure of one.I am impressed with the author’s prose and ability to make sentences roar from every direction, but it felt unfinished to me, like it is an outline for something that might one day be big. Exploding, perhaps. Is Nealon angry, distressed, depressed, or all of the above? What is steering the story, besides Nealon’s desire to get his family back? West Ireland appears to be on the verge of a transformation, likely a dangerous one, maybe technological terror. But I failed to comprehend how Nealon or his family fit in, or this other actor. I also wondered if the writer was taking the piss with us, or wanting the reader to feel deficient. Is it effective for the writer to convey that he is smarter than the reader? Yet I did occasionally feel the depth of a despairing plague of souls. ‘ “Your plague of souls unleashed on the world, skimming over border and time-zones to plant their pale flags on these new territories. Their new template coming to being in a new Eden, a new sovereignty prior to politics.’ “McCormack could pull off a zinger or two, a friction or intensity that sucked me in. That is when I was most into the narrative. But, generally the story sidewinded me. That above quote and a few others appeared to be pointing to emigration, boundaries, territories. But the pinnacle of the story escaped me and I wanted to reach the end for relief. Enjoy the prose and the hardass hints. Maybe that’s enough for now. I hear it is second in a trilogy.

Roxana Robinson delivers a captivating story of a “second-time around” couple aJust the word “leaving” triggers my thoughts of anxiety and isolation. Roxana Robinson delivers a captivating story of a “second-time around” couple at age sixty. It doesn’t matter that the description of their first romance (in college) was not too sexy. It’s sexier this time. It’s distinguished by the propulsion and voice, prose and velocity. I didn’t even notice several text problems that still need fixing until it was pointed out by another friend, such as the credibility of Warren and Sarah as young lovers. But we came away knowing that trust is a big issue for Sarah, and she couldn’t ultimately trust Warren to keep her safe back then. Warren takes his romantic cues from opera, he’s a mad devotee of the art, and so it is no surprise that he ran into Sarah forty years later at the opera house. Both fall madly in passion. And that is what drives this story---the pitfalls of their romance, the reactions of family that must be considered after such a radical change in your life.Problem: Warren is still married. Another problem: a grown adult daughter who disapproves. For me, LEAVING was a page-turning and heart-piercing family drama that unfolded in a tug of war with everyone's emotions. Roxana Robinson is such a hefty writer that I forgave some plot holes as she effectively lured me along. Despite the missteps, I was emotionally gripped. Robinson gave the story a sensuous finesse despite the obvious blemishes, and I fell in with the lovers' story. The author conveyed the notorious baggage that comes with your heart’s desires, and did it without inching into cliches.Dark at moments, LEAVING is a suspenseful domestic drama that deals with relationships, boundaries, betrayal, morality, and what we owe to others in our quest to fulfill our own desires. Sarah and Warren didn’t reach full relationship maturity as they grew older; if anything, it got more complicated. You’re still a fool for love, just—an older fool! There were times that I felt Warren was nothing more than a spoiled adolescent. On the other hand, he was trying to follow an honor code, but that is one of his blind spots: he thought he was being principled, despite the obvious---he was never all that virtuous. And he was frightened of losing the love of his daughter.In the end, after Sarah has gone through traumatic events and Warren struggles to get past himself, the story lands where it should, with some answers and more questions to consider. It forced me to contemplate and examine the arc of the characters. This is a largely internal, nuanced text that explores the emotional fallout of passion.I tore through the pages, especially the last quarter of the story. Dangling on the edge of catastrophe, the characters kept me holding on to their fates. I closed the book feeling both satisfied and hungry, falling in step with Sarah above the others, (I wanted to stay with her for a longer time). The cast lingered in my thoughts beyond the finale. Even now, I want to peek longer into their lives.In lesser hands, this story would have been torrid and melodramatic, but Robinson mined the characters with emotional acuity.

New Zealand author Catherine Chidgey is my new favorite mystery writer. In two timelines—1984 and 2014–protagonist Justine Crieve narrates her childhood and chilling trauma. It begins when she is twelve (1984), looking back on it thirty years later in 2014. Justine’s voice captivated me straight away; it was gentle yet candid. This is Justine’s Bildungsroman—the story of her youth, her bond with her widowed father, and notably, her complex status as teacher’s pet to Mrs Price. Enigmatic and alluring, Mrs. Price mesmerized many who crossed her path.There’s a bit of Cat’s Eye (Margaret Atwood) invective among peers, a competitive and combative air between friends. I was often caught off-guard, I didn’t know who to trust. A reoccurring challenge in Justine’s life is her seizure disorder, which had previously been controlled with medications.

Kuang is a Chinese-American writer, young, and blessed with talent. Her previous novels were fantasy, her characters were fantastical and exaggerated. In Yellowface, Kuang takes a candid jab at the publishing industry, for their repeated and performative treatment of ethnic characters. It’s metafiction on the nose, and the nose is pointed! Since 2020, publishers have pledged to represent ethnic minorities with authenticity, instead of pressing them into reductive and ornamental molds. Kuang’s twisty plot reveals her audacious theme, and her theme is a response to publishing’s failure to pivot as they vowed. The industry continues to tokenize people of color (YF focuses on Chinese American POC), presenting them as one-dimensional figures, sugary and saccharine and simple. It’s condescending and cringey. Ms. Kuang took a deserved thwack at the industry, and the outcome is a wild and frantic ride inside the publishing houses.Yellowface is suspenseful, plot-propelled, a cat-and mouse drama with satirical varnish. Kuang is a siren when she creates characters---I thought they might walk off the page! It has a staccato pace and a comical touch in all the fatal, tragic places. The voice is light, so the book isn’t turgid, despite the torment of protagonist June Hayward. June is a white American writer who wants success, awards, fame. She’s gotten, instead, a first-book flop. Her nemesis is brainy, beautiful, and self-possessed Chinese American Athena Liu, a celebrated novelist with a Netflix series on the way. Kuang created a complex character in Athena, breaking the stereotypical “good girl” that publishers crank out with Asian characters.Fictionally, the character of Athena allows herself to be tokenized by publishing giants in order to prevail as a celebrity best-selling author. Kuang pulls no punches--Athena is cunning and egocentric. And so is June, her white frenemy who steals her secret manuscript when Athena chokes and dies on a pancake (that’s in early pages). A lot of the suspense comes from Twitter screech, where people are not afraid to be their ugliest selves.The story moves at a game clip, and we watch June use her first and middle names for the manuscript she steals and cleans up from Athena, and now her heritage sounds more ambiguous. Her first name is Juniper and her middle name is Song, given to her by her hippie mother, but fortuitous for the moment—folks may think it is Asian, as the story, The Last Front (a bit of irony there) refers to a history of the Chinese Labor Corps recruited by the British Army and sent to the Allied Front during WWI. The reader is kept guessing as each new event raises the stakes for June/Juniper. The last 40 or so pages were a bit too much telling and it didn’t sustain the earlier pace or suspense, it got breathless but less credible, as the plot seemed to fall over itself at times. It was fervent and long-winded, with a lot of crowded add-on that was jammed with info. It’s a blatant irritant in what was an otherwise engaging thriller of competition and cultural controversy within an industry that yet remains covetous and veiled to outsiders.One of my favorite reveals is when Athena states she is ""ethically troubled"" because her parents and grandparents lived through the pain of their history, yet, in her privileged position of looking back from a comfortable life, Athena admits that ""I have the indulgence to look back, and be a storyteller"" (and get wealthy off their story). But June states, ""I've always found that line to be a cop-out...We're all vultures, and some of us--and I mean Athena here--are simply better at finding the juiciest morsels of a story, at ripping through bone and gristle to the tender bleeding heart and putting all the gore on display.""3.5...more",Notes are private!,24,79,1,Nov 2023,"Nov 08, 2023","Nov 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62047984-yellowface

An epic, sweeping, transformative, colossal (adverbs and adjectives are just not enough!) door-stopper of a book, a windswept and fiery, burning satire of a 1990s marriage between a modern couple in Chicago, Jack and Elizabeth. There’s a preoccupation with eternal love, health and well-being, the potent obsession with fitness and strength. How past years’ discarded identities generate the self of today, afraid or unafraid of tomorrow. Jack is a photographer, but his pictures arise from the chemicals and fixatives in the darkroom, not from the camera. Elizabeth is a scientist who peddles placebos to rejuvenate passion. WELLNESS spans twenty years forward, but reaches back, to their childhoods, shifting back and forth in time. Or should I say Time, since Time is essential here, it subverts the narrative and liquidates expectations. It’s about everything, sort of like Infinite Jest is about everything, and it’s a parabola, like Gravity's Rainbow is a parabola, but it’s neither the former or latter. The prose is gracefully placed on the page, despite the legion of info (critics would say info-dumping) that the text provides. Hill straddles the line between saying and pontificating, which may cause some readers to recoil.Hill has created his own radical, non-starry-eyed romance, a 90s mosaic of Gen X ideology, as Jack and Elizabeth assemble and inhabit their identities via several and ongoing selves throughout the years, to someday evolve or diminish into what they are now. The stakes, at first, seem fairly mellow. I mean, the worst that I thought could happen is a break-up. Hooooold on, about those stakes. Hill drove them hard through my heart. It’s heavy, at times I felt my throat closing up. This isn’t a book I could read non-stop, I had to take breaks to release the tension, otherwise I would explode!It's also about perception and paradox, connections and loneliness, greed and loss, manipulation and madness. The narrative winds through a buffet of subjects, and love is the polestar, and the threat. Love at first sight is endorsed and dismantled, but never abandoned. There’s so much breadth, from artists to investors, groupthink to prairie fires, children to ancestors, “forever homes,” the World Wide Web, health, sickness, and cures, social media, absence--and the faith in metaphysics, that our souls can travel at night.Paradox: “…that was a pre-globalized world, a pre-9/11 world, a pre-housing bubble world…when they all sort of understood implicitly that however much they resented and resisted the mass economy, they would also have little trouble eventually finding a job and livelihood within it.”Thematically rich in artful contradictions, as a new friend earnestly says to Elizabeth: “He practices the art of nothingness, while you practice the science of nothingness. You’re both obsessed with it: nothingness, emptiness, blankness, absence. Don’t you find that really meaningful?” And this touched my heart, a poignant guidance from the scientist that mentored Elizabeth:“Believe what you believe…but believe gently. Believe compassionately. Believe with curiosity. Believe with humility. And don’t trust the arrogance of certainty.”This book is so deep, vast, mind-bending, and provocative, I just can’t do it justice.

She hates her dreary days, her sleepless nights, and her menial job at a boys' correctional facility. It’s Christmas week, 1964, dank, glum, and bitter cold. Her father taunts and abuses her, and makes sexual gestures that were difficult and disturbing to read. He’s a danger to himself and others, but his cop frenemies are afraid of him, too. Eileen has to lock away his shoes to keep him homebound. Disgusted by him, by herself, by her troubles, she locks herself away in her room most of the time.Eileen's gallows humor and self-destructive ways will seize you from the start; her tense and twisted mind is irresistible. She paints her lips with garish lipstick in order to hide their true hue, which she says are the color of her nipples. She’s disgusted by any body parts that convey sexuality, but has a celibate crush on one of the detention workers, Randy. On weekends, she drives by his house and parks there for hours, never even sneaking a peek. At home she tries to hide from her father and drinks herself to sleep. She chews her food and then spits it out. She’s whip thin and undernourished, routinely denying what her body needs.Sexual appetites—any appetites, repulse Eileen. She considers bodily functions disgusting, so she tries to control them, deny them. Her diet, laxative use and clothing choices are all in favor of resisting maturity and becoming invisible. The trauma she’s endured all her life is devastating. It's no shock that she grew into a self-hating girl-woman. Still a virgin, Eileen assumes that sex will have to be forced and violent. “Of course I hoped to be raped by only the most soulful, gentle, handsome of men, somebody who was secretly in love with me.” She considers her sister, Joanie, a whore for running off with a boyfriend at age seventeen. There’s no one in Eileen’s life to serve as a role model. Eileen’s nasty, self-centered mother died years ago from cancer--Eileen reluctantly took care of her at the end.I grew up near Boston (this is near Boston) and remember the short days of winter, cracked and soggy simultaneously. That squelch when your boots hit the slush, and the snowy ice melting and refreezing, this cycle going on for weeks. Moshfegh captured it so meticulously, plus the weak light of day that glared at you despite its low wattage, the dark of New England winter nights—the absolute blackness of the season. The dour gloom of this story would be total if not for the reader's foreknowledge that Eileen does get away. She is narrating this story fifty years into the future, dropping small but rich details of her life over the years. Eileen’s hunger for liberty is captivating. Her exile at home corresponds to her menial job at a juvie prison. Her life is defined by confinement, isolation, and her morbid sense of self. She has a car and a decent bank account, yet she doesn't comprehend her own agency. She's stuck. Not until she meets a new counselor at the facility, an enigmatic woman named Rebecca, does she see an escape route. She is transfixed, intoxicated, enamored. She wants Rebecca as her BFF, she’s buzzed by Rebecca’s charisma, her infectious presence. Randy is discarded; Eileen has no room now for anyone but her new friend. She self-appoints Rebecca to lead her out of darkness.That is the story—Eileen’s sense of self, her captivity, her desire for release. I felt every minute of Eileen’s belief in her own incarceration. She’s convinced her isolation is physical. When she meets Rebecca, it's an epic moment for Eileen, her inflection point. Moshfegh taunts us with Eileen’s raw convictions, her shredded self-esteem. We wait painfully for her tortured gnawing to shift. Trauma and abuse are immobilizing, demoralizing, but we are creatures of hope and desire. Eileen (the novel) is wretched, pervy, and thrilling; Eileen, the character, is determined, inexorable. The story is drab, foul, creepy, and permissibly wearying, yet seductive and compelling. Moshfegh may be an acquired taste, it took me a minute to adjust to the style. Hot button triggers are deployed on every page. Eileen is not for everyone—trigger warning!...more",Notes are private!,7,67,1,"Oct 18, 2023","Oct 23, 2023","Oct 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23453099-eileen

All of her novels are absorbing; her characters cross boundaries in a way that has the reader always guessing where the emphasis of truth lies. If you’ve never read Cartwheel, it's based on the Amanda Knox story, but duBois puts her own spin on it, and follows her literary imagination instead of just journalistic headlines. Her creativity as a writer is realistic, vast, and her characters are driven, intense. Her latest novel will drive you mad with your own ignorance!Language and character strengthen the plot in this initially puzzling book, despite--or is it because of--the narrator, Angela? She sounds candid to a fault, telling her story from a confined space. I often wondered, because of past books I’d read, if she was like a main character in Happiness Falls by Angie Kim. Or the narrator in His Bloody Project: Documents Relating to the Case of Roderick Macrae by Graeme MaCrae Burnet. Or just a more educated Dorothy in Oz. She was a linguist kicked out of Harvard grad school. I was feeling my way blindly through much of it, trying to find an opening in a dense wall. If you can handle not having a handle…! We have to trust (or not) that Angela is telling us the facts from her disadvantaged point of view. Is she honest, does she have integrity? Does she have some wisdom, is she measured and controlled? Her story—how reliable is her telling?The reader doesn’t have an alternate viewpoint from anyone else because the narration filters all thoughts through Angela. She warmly talks to the reader, and the more she tells us, the more I wanted to know. Yes, she hooked me on page one, and that’s a talent. For more details, read the cover. No, don’t. I’ll say this. Angela is part of the group of linguists that believe language is the foundation of consciousness. The downside is that it begs the question of whether speech can be taught to someone who didn’t already have it in them.Angela needs a job--her husband died, she has a toddler, and she lives with her mother. She starts work at the Center, training to teach Sam (at his home), a young man roughly her age (late twenties) who is nonspeaking, non-communicative, with severe motor impairments, and who also lives with his mother in Medford, Massachusetts. Sam is fetching and charismatic--certainly to Angela. Her role, as therapist, is to teach Sam “facilitated communication”—a therapy program invented by speech pathologists, using a bulky device that resembles a typewriter. It was controversial but boasted some promising results (this is 2001). The student learns an alternate version of spoken words, using this speech device. Sam, her only client, reached all his milestones until age 18 months, according to his mother, when he just stopped interacting and acknowledging, and became an isolated island of one. He presents as an adult with profound autism. Is language inside him? Angela’s job is to teach him the new communication tool, and pull the language out of him.And this started a beautiful friendship. Angela will fill you in on all the drama. The more engaging she is, the more I wanted to hang on. It’s a slow burn, so don’t wait for some death-defying adventures, as the pain is all in the psyche. I hope I’ve given enough info to tittle your tattle. The pacing was occasionally not pacey, but it is a thoughtful, provocative, scandalous, and love-of-words book with well-drawn, quixotic characters.

I mean, she commandeered them, elasticized them, pulled them like taffy, then bent the language in segments. Then she crushed it together and ended up with broken glass and bloody fingers. I may not be making much sense here with my mixed metaphors, but I’m not equipped to describe this novel, this strange experience I just completed. You don’t need to know anything about K pop; in fact, that is part of the absurdist intent, I think. Yi took a juvenile vehicle—the screaming-fan fascination with performers, the one-sided relationship that ensues, usually with teens or young adults (but this protagonist seems older). They get to inordinately love and adore a person who they will never know. I bought this partly for the gorgeous cover and my instinct that this would be edgy and odd. Well, edgy? It falls off the cliff, collecting peculiar debris along the way, and aiming for the depthless bottom. It’s hollow yet filled with ideas. When she gets pseudo-intellectual, it is more in a mocking manner. The author knows what she is doing, I just wish I did, too, more often than not.I sensed a frolic with David Foster Wallace and a Nabokovian play with prose here, and some Katie Kitamura tone and atmosphere---all novelists that I enjoy, and can make sense of, mostly. In Y/N, (which means “your name,” as in insert your name, plug it in here, as is apparently done in fanfic), the author lost me at hello. Yet, I never wanted to DNF it. Y/N made me curious, and curiouser. That is why I’d run out and get her next novel, despite my inability to get fully on board this time. It’s a lot. And magnetic. Even when I was repelled, I was arrested.This strange world building by Yi is weird, and surreal, and unsatisfying, but that fault is mine. I feel too small to  it. Yi stretches language to excess, and she wants us to know she is being pretentious while simultaneously not caring a whit what we think. She’s broken the contract between reader and writer—she doesn’t want us to join her, and yet she viscerally penetrated me at intervals. Some of her prose is wild, noisy, blithely beyond the pale. “He threw back his head…exposing a limestone column of neck almost as long as his face. The cartilage supporting his larynx protruded like a spine. Blue veins ran up the neck and branched off across his mandible. Life swarmed just under his skin.” It’s only about 200 pages long but every sentence is a MOFO, with David Lynchian images. Y/N is wondrous in its style, and the images are what I hung on, which was almost enough.When I choose to let go and flow with it, I get subversive pleasure from the story. The unnamed narrator—an English translator for a puff food company--has a parasocial relationship with Moon, a member of a K pop band, after seeing him in one concert. At first, I thought Yi was exploring this one-sided passion, and how the corporate media helps to foster and fester these artificial attractions. I think she just wants us to think she thinks that!The failure to really grok this book may be mine—but, I do admire and appreciate its addition to literature. It never immersed me, but it often overwhelmed me.

The main protagonist, TNot unlike OPEN CITY, Teju Cole’s latest, TREMOR, reads less like a novel than a narrative of different voices and encounters. The main protagonist, Tunde, originally from Lagos, Nigeria, is a professor at a prestigious university in Boston (Harvard, likely). We don’t stay with Tunde at all times. Instead, we take scholarly and urgent strolls into other voices, persons, perspectives. It didn’t matter if I kept up with who was speaking, because it inevitably coalesces into a human ecosystem that demonstrates the connectivity between all our disparate lives.Novels contain (to varying degrees) an assembled story within the pages. Cole inverts the definition, and turns the narrative outward in conversation with the reader. The story isn’t contained within the pages alone. The author experiments with form, and while reading, I am crossing borders between fiction; non-fiction; storytelling; academia; chronicling; history; the Arts; and travel. It moves with a tight meandering that is loosely connected and pulling from all directions of life. We watch time slip away and get distilled within the same space. Cole’s brilliant mind keeps the reader fascinated by his journey through mortality.Novels have a separate life from the reader, they can exist on their own, logically. A book is an inanimate object that yet is a distinctly alive organism. Cole’s book, to me, actively relies on a third party, another human, to be a witness to his prosecutions (I mean that in a good way). TREMOR is less a novelistic novel as it is a meaningful interrogation of all manner of life. In a novel, there’s a conclusion, or at least a closing, perhaps a closing argument. What makes Cole a departure from my (albeit, limited) idea of a novel is that he often turns to the reader to be the other half of the story, rather than an outsider or limited insider. He inspires me to challenge my private assertions.Don’t read this for a story. There are multiple stories, multiple voices, like a curious wanderer walking through cities and countries, a series of holograms blended together. The style is enigmatic. “You” prefaces the main character’s entrances on the page. So it sets out as second person. But it changes as it becomes a collection of voices. Sometimes I didn’t realize we had left the character who refers to Tunde as “you.” After a while, it ceased to matter. This narrative has its own energy and force. The back cover offers up my favorite quote as if it read my mind. The author has a central thesis, which on page 14 is summed up regarding “history’s own brutality, which refuses symmetries and seldom consoles.” He illuminates how history doesn’t balance the scales. Invasions, colonializations, and wars aren’t symmetrically decided based on the last outcome. TREMOR is also like a series of irruptions, edifications, images. It took me longer to read than the average novel because Google and Wikipedia were often my friends. Don’t shy away from looking things up---it adds to the pleasure of reading. West African music, specific paintings, the art and culture of the ci wara are a few of the many ingredients that make up this masterwork. The book is reflective and explorative, with an ongoing examination into cultural priorities. For example:“We are all obsessed with preservation and we revere scholarship and curation. But we have not been concurrently taught to value the life-worlds of others, their autonomy, their ancestral rights. Particularly if the people in question are from the African continent, their ingenuity can be appreciated, their artifacts can be acquired and subjected to analysis, but their actual lives cannot be valued. What does it mean to care about art but not about the people that made that art?”Teju Cole will make you pay attention and observe and, hopefully, care about the people he talks about. He discusses so many points between the West (Europe, America) and West Africa. I was particularly intrigued by him raising the topic of the American obsession with captivity narratives, which largely began in colonial times, a tradition that saw its main task as protecting white women from dark-skinned invaders. He isn’t admonishing, but rather provoking us to think. The heroic rescue combined with these narratives made us ripe for films like the 1956 John Wayne vehicle, The Searchers.TREMOR is a rambling, but measured and well controlled and genre-defying novel that opened my mind and heart to history’s brutalities, yes, but also to a tender mortality that we can’t escape.

The unnamed narrator is a master of obedience, a side effect of herI’m Jewish; I’m familiar with direct and indirect indignities foisted on my tribe. The unnamed narrator is a master of obedience, a side effect of her upbringing, perhaps a perverse protection from antisemitism. What she ultimately does with her traumatic childhood and history of sustained victimization by others--and now scapegoated by an entire town, is riveting. At no time did I feel myself wandering away from the story, despite her penchant for Pynchonian dependent clauses (hers are lyrical rather than baroque). The protagonist is too compelling to ignore.Is it paranoia if everyone hates you? Bernstein uses already cultivated symbols and similes to subversive effect. It's another way of looking at the biggest crimes against Jews and moreover how it looks when the victims traumatize their own children in other ways. The unnamed narrator, who cannot speak the language of the northern country that formerly persecuted her people, where she went to take care of her brother after he was left by his wife, speaks to us with fierce clarity, beyond the silence imposed by a language barrier. Look under and behind her words for more understanding. “In silence, yes, for words have more than once led us away from the truth.” Her voice captivated me, which never wavers. It just gets stronger over time. A woman, once a journalist, highly educated but now doing a mundane audio typist job for a firm who is ravaging the planet, comes to stay with her successful, wealthy brother, to take care of him and his enormous house in this rural area. He soon takes off on a business trip, and she is at the mercy of the superstitious townspeople, who blame her for the death of farm animals, a phantom dog pregnancy, and other unfortunate events, usually to do with animals. Instances that seem generally innocent to her are viewed as provocative by these village-like townsfolk. She is scapegoated, a position she has found herself in before. She has no allies here; her brother is gone, and despite the age of cell phones and social media, he doesn’t seem to communicate with her while gone. When she comes face-to-face with these people, she finds them unreadable, but menacing. Isolation doesn’t protect her; they find a way to debase her without using words. “What was underneath it all, vibrating beneath the faces of the people I saw, something in their expressions?”What she has gleaned from living here is that these people kept “beliefs one needed to hold about oneself, stories one told oneself in order to live, to go on living with oneself, knowing what one was capable of, knowing the things one had witnessed, the things one had done.” Some things she says obliquely, but for good reason. Even through times she was (seemingly) opaque, more is yet revealed.While I was reading, I thought of literature that had a similar atmosphere or voice, such as Philippe Claudel’s Brodeck; the movie (original one with Dustin Hoffman) Straw Dogs (not literature but it was literary); and Orwell’s Animal Farm; and Shirley Jackson. Of course, it is none of those, but this epigraph written by painter Paula Rego that Bernstein used sent shivers down my spine:“I can turn the tables and do what I want, I can make women stronger. I can make them murderous and obedient at the same time.” I anticipate that every er will mention this, for good reason. It’s not about the narrator’s intentions; however, it does advance the paradox of weaponizing obedience after a lifetime of it. Can one’s lifetime of being a scapegoat be fortified to turn the tables? After all, we are Jews, are we not? Some of us? Just 2% of the world, which is less people than the dogmatist formerly known as Kanye West has followers on Instagram. This may be my #1 book of the year. It has made the Booker shortlist, and it is deserving. If it hadn’t been nominated (I bought it before the longlist came out), I would have called this a sleeper, a gem of an understated novel of ideas and events. Bernstein’s prose is elegant, beautiful, tragic, sizzling. You can read this short novel over and over again and keep getting more out of it.Bigotry, obedience, exile, complicity, silence—both enforced and by choice—deviance, and identity are some of the big themes in this book.“So much was refused in advance. So much transpired on a scale of time and space that was longer than a lifetime, wider than a country, vaster than the story of the exile of a single people. And bigger still.”...more",Notes are private!,4,46,1,"Sep 19, 2023","Sep 24, 2023","Sep 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123636870-study-for-obedience

As the novel opens in media res, Cormac James places the reader directly into their marriage-on-the-skids. Lil is doing some heavy lifting with boxes; Alba looks on disinterestedly, a bit of contempt in the air. There are so many layers of resentment between them that it would necessarily be a lot to overhaul. Amidst this, they get a disastrous phone call about their eldest son, Pierre. He is studying in Trondheim, Norway (the wives live in Catalonia) and has collapsed in the street. He is in hospital in an induced coma. They set up family to take charge of the younger ones and travel to Pierre’s bedside. An interior story, the narrative has two primary plots: whether Pierre survives, and will the marriage survive.  The story is staid, mature, what I call a true grownup novel. The peaks and valleys of the tale are understated, requiring the reader to pay attention to subtle shifts in mood or attitude in order to gain maximum benefit of story. Pierre’s crisis does not unfold like a “medica drama” but often functions as a theme or even a contrast to the marriage. Human crises, two simultaneously. Pierre’s is sudden and life-or-death, the marriage is long-suffering and losing oxygen day by day, over many years.This is a solid debut by Cormac James, a serious and solemn narrative that examines how inattention can slowly suffocate a marriage, and how, on the turn of a dime, a robust life can be on the verge of wiping out. Death of a marriage is as weighty to a life as catastrophic illness. Both need care to survive. James created an authentic downer of a marriage, where the partners constantly pick at each other, with squalid results. Petty disagreements become little infections, and lead to larger wounds. All this happening as they wait, with hope, for their son to wake up. The author turned cataclysms inward instead of creating a melodrama. Measured, tightly controlled, and gradually revealed. Be prepared for a phlegmatic pace, which I think was purposeful to counter the theme of a crisis at hand. Thank you to Bellevue Literary Press for sending me an ARC to .

I’m just so disappointed in the direction this author is going in. He has departed from his earlier literary novels to now write mainstream fiction. I’m not scolding him for that, and I’m grateful that he still cares about character—I mean, it is impossible not to like the protagonist Ren Hopper. And there are still lines of prose that hit the sweet spot for me. But, for the most part, this book feels uninspired, like Heller is possibly writing a Ren Hopper “book series” and this is #1. The story goes from credible to contrived. Every day, it seems, Ren Hopper, a forest ranger at Yellowstone, is saving lives, rescuing children, preventing murders, stopping an extremist group, and longing for his dead wife, in a circling order. It starts to be over the top, and I had so many eye rolls that I got a bookache headache.This novel deserves 2.5 stars, but I couldn’t see my way to round up. Perhaps if I’d never read one of his superb novels, like THE PAINTER, I wouldn’t be so disenchanted. After all, everyone likes a sorbet book now and then. But he dumbed it down too much in-between his well-drawn characters and periodic pretty prose. Not everyone agrees with me, though. After I read Bruce Katz’s beautiful 4-star  of this book, I felt a bit guilty and thought maybe I missed out a captivating story all because I wouldn’t accept that Heller decided to write a “genre” book.

I’ve been a quiet collector of his oeuvre, yet this is the first one I’ve actually read. Why did I wait so long? I am truly dazzled by the author’s ability to tell a mature and tragic love story by way of quick glances, at times, into his characters, set against a half century of Ireland’s history. And then filling in these gaps at the most surprising turns and times. Barry is certainly a highbrow author, but not with swagger. He paints this portrait of retired policeman, Tom Kettle’s, post retirement life in Dalkey (near Dublin) by going back, back, back into a bleak and sometimes beautifully lived life with his wife, June, and their two children, Winnie and Joseph. By the close of the novel, I was stunned into hearing the silence around me after the tumultuous storm of the story.Tom has spent the last nine months (the length of his retirement) keeping his wicker chair warm and walking around the city, swimming in the Liffey, appreciating the nature of Dalkey, like eyeing a perched cormorant near the river. He lives in a lean-to attached to a castle. Some of the characters who inhabit the story are real, yet others, usually preceded by a passage about a unicorn, seem to arrive from the fever dream of Tom’s mind, his unreliable memory and gaps. He has a sea of memories that wash over him, often occupy his days and nights, good and bad ones that overflow and threaten to take over his life. He's a widower, misses June madly; they were two orphans who met and loved each other to pieces.One day, Tom is visited by two young policemen who want his help in a cold case involving the murder of a priest. Tom, a former detective sergeant, wants little to do with it, would rather be left alone. But it stirs a resounding hot pot of agonizing memories, for him, about his wife, and within the community. Since finishing this book, I have dived a bit into the public figure of Archbishop McQuaid, a man who incited generational trauma for people whose lives remain forever traumatized by McQuaid’s cloaked deceptions. Old God’s Time presents two immensely appealing characters—Tom, and his wife, June, and how it invariably burned into the lives of their beloved children.The prose is stunning, the story is exquisite, tragic, and at times, with a touch of light-hearted bursts. This is not a book to read at a busy airport, or in noisy surroundings. Like the sweet cormorants that ever infuse the story, I found my quiet perch, too, to read this slow burn of a book. Stay attentive and you will be rewarded. I recommend a quiet place to read; it helped me hear that music was always playing in the background. When Tom's neighbor plays Kol Nidre, the genius of the story heightened for me.

And at the end, my fugitive heart flew out of my delicate chest and expanded, inflated, soared on puffy wings and a pagan prayer. The end. I’d rather finish there than spoil it for readers, as every single page bulges with new discoveries and the celebration of the novel form itself. The story takes place in a berg a few hours from Dublin, and Dickie and Imelda Barnes, once wealthy from the VW sales and garage business (inherited from Dickie’s father), are now struggling due to the financial crash. So, it is probably just a few years after 2008, but not specifically stated. Dickie and Imelda carry their secrets about like albatrosses. Imelda, in her late thirties, is and was the most beautiful woman in four provinces. As a young teen, she was the poor Cinderella waiting for her prince. She met Frank, Dickie’s younger brother--an athlete, a stunner, a charmer. She fell in love. And once you learn about Imelda’s family, you’ll want her to fall in love, too. But then tragedy strikes. We know this up front, what we don’t know is why Imelda married Dickie after all this. It’s all part of the masquerade and how the past keeps insisting on the present. And the future is already in crisis.One of its prominent themes is that you can’t dismiss the past, and you can’t take it down. You have to live with it in the present and reckon with it if you want to have a future. There’s a fable that Imelda, the mother/wife character, is reminded of. It is a Brigadoon-esque fable, (but from Irish folklore), where a man sees a door, opens it, enjoys a hedonistic experience, only to find that, when he leaves, it is 100 years later and his family is dead and gone. The present also kicks up plenty of dirt in this masterpiece. How does Murray do this? The past unwinds, then rewinds, then ferociously unspools, while the present comes thundering in like a flood. “Every moment was the moment when everything changed.”While the past rears its ugly head as a portentous cataclysm of the here-and-now, I wondered how the future would unfold. Murray is a spry reader’s writer, he’s a fusion artist--of how a postmodern novel can embrace the old form of a narrative and give the reader that sense of extended drama. Murray enfolds the art of the conventional novel and then, simultaneously, sticks a fork in it, blows it up, and then carries on and takes you with him. This book seemed to contain at least a thousand pages in its 643, yet I digested it as if it were only 100. There’s absolutely no fluff in here, no padding, no extra or waste. Every word needs to be there, each page contains multitudes. It isn’t the headache-inducing density type of text, it isn’t whimsical, either. It’s natural and imaginative in correspondence. Cynicism has no footing here, so the characters and storytelling are generous, irresistible. BEE STING is full of people at their most desperate, and consequently they leak their hidden desires, needs, and display impulsive conduct. The family is frantic from the endless fallout of the crash, and their fate intersects with the powers of the past. The humanity in this story is compelling, the dialogue, setting, and events grounded in a relatable reality, however wild and furious it gets. Pain and pleasure are mutual, often in concert. The setting is on a collision course with climate change—drought, flood, belligerent heat, other natural disasters or near-disasters. Imelda is selling off her jewelry on eBay to survive, and Dickie is rapidly declining—emotionally--all the while building a bunker in the woods with his peculiar friend, Victor. The family of four are all slipping gradually through the cracks, like getting buried in an earthquake.Imelda and Dickie’s teenage daughter, Cass, is hopefully headed for Trinity College in Dublin. She aims to ride on the coattails of her best friend, Elaine. Cass will do anything for Elaine, she’s in her thrall. Cass’ 12-year-old brother, PJ, is a science nerd, a video-game geek, who suffers from adolescent problems to the 10th power, especially as some menacing oaf is putting PJ’s life in danger, demanding money. Oh, and there is an Aunt Rose who is straight out of a fairytale, who can foretell the future.Each character has their own chapters/sections and are punctuated (or not punctuated at all) to match their thoughts, feelings, and approach to the world. Before you turn away from Imelda’s zero punctuation, know this: Paul Murray’s superb writing gently coaxes you to quickly imbibe his rhythm. You’re willing because it’s organic and authentic. The nature of Imelda’s character and how she thinks and talks seduces you right from the start. It’s like canoeing on accelerated waters---you will place your oars in the water to go with the flow. It’s not hard. It requires you to pay attention, but the sweep and movement of the narrative suck you right in.BEE STING has girth, it has weight, and the rhythm is musical, lyrical; the story had its hooks in me straight off. And I’ve never been so fascinated with a writer’s ability to pull the past into the center of the present. I keep going back to that point, I know. The stylistic mastery of this author blew me away. The microcosm of this story within the macrocosm of Ireland is finely polished, even when feelings are bitter and raw. I twinned with Murray, as if the words came from my own mouth. It was like me telling this story to me. You don’t need an audio book; this reads like audible language that you can hear, in your ears and in your soul. This is a brilliant book, my first Paul Murray, and I’ve already ordered the rest of his oeuvre. I won’t bore you with, “If you only read one book this year…” but if you want an unsentimental soap opera without the soap, which is credible and emotionally satisfying, with an ending that will have everyone debating, well, you’ve come to the right novel.Murray is sly and cheeky. I see the Franzen influence. I also see an incisive David Foster Wallace influence (INFINITE JEST) right here: “…we are paid in entertainment. The novel was the first instance in what in the twenty-first century has become a vast and proliferating entertainment industry, an almost infinite machine designed to distract us and disempower us. We are presented with a virtual world powered, literally, by the incineration of the real.”...more",Notes are private!,24,115,1,"Aug 26, 2023","Sep 04, 2023","Aug 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62039166-the-bee-sting

(Oh, digression--did you know that he also played with the band, The Remainders? That’s a band with other writers like Amy Tan, Dave Barry, Barbara Kingsolver, Stephen King, Maya Angelou and several others who played for charity and fundraising). Anyway, I mention his musicianship because I see it all over the pages of The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store. This is the first book I’ve read by McBride (definitely more to come), so pardon my schoolgirlish, giggly first crush for the way that his writing lifts me up, how his words and characters opened my heart, only to break it, and then put it back together in a most absolute and tender way. James McBride is a kind, gentle soul, and his writing reflects this—his ability to bring the world together in a novel. He honors humanity. We are all connected, and this author compels that naturally from his characters. Now, how great is that, yeah?I want to put this in your hands and promise you a magnificent reading experience. It starts off in a shaggy dog kind of way, with an ensemble of characters, several who possess whimsical names like Fatty, Big Soap, Monkey Pants, Dodo. And their names fit flawlessly to their nature. The story starts with a 1972 prologue—a human skeleton is found in an old abandoned well, and then the body of the story begins in 1936 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, a place called Chicken Hill, where Jews, immigrants, and Black folks lived side by side, sometimes in harmony, other times in discord, but here’s the thing—the goodness of people, the kindness of their hearts—that is what ultimately rises to the top. For the story to unfold, there has to be some sinister aspects, too—aren’t we still fighting the fight of ignorance, bigotry, corruption, meanness? But, in the McBride world, well, we also follow the long stretch of yarn as it wends around this way and that, through streets and backyards, dirt roads, onto hills and a shul and a church, through tunnels and a dance hall. And The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store.I don’t need to rehash the plot, but there are a few fun facts about this book worth mentioning in a . Such as, there are an abundance of characters introduced early on, and then again later on, before the plot actually launches. That’s the shaggy part. We don’t get to the plot too quickly—instead, Mcbride takes his time, builds the characters. They are already leaping off the pages by the time the plot rolls in. There are subplots, too, but in the end, they all weave their chords and come together. McBride may slow your roll at first, but it’s a winning bonanza of breadth and depth, from the smallest detail to the broadest design. Scenes that seem initially inconsequential become key notes later on. Early on, we meet the arresting Jewess, Chona. Chona is an unforgettable female protagonist—I’m keeping her in my journal of best. female. characters. ever. She is handicapped with a limp—but her limp doesn’t stop her strength of purpose, her fierce dignity, her bounteous benevolence, her gentle grace, and her consummate integrity. You will fall in love with her, just like Moshe, the theater and dance hall owner, did. Moshe and Chona dared to welcome change and inclusivity to their part of the world. At this time, in the 1930s, Black people were almost exclusively cast in menial jobs. But Moshe books Black jazz bands to play at his theater, and successfully includes all tribes together at the dance hall, who “frolicked and laughed, dancing as if they were birds enjoying flight for the first time.” Chona runs the grocery store, and extends credit to anyone who can’t afford to pay; she rarely keeps a record of their debt. The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store may lose money, but it is rich in goodwill and kindness.Back to this being like a musical book—a jazzy book. Jazz music conjures that raspy, soulful, edgy flavor, blended from a mix of cultures and harmonies. McBride embraces those diverse, insistent, zingy, soul-stirring rhythms and blues into the narrative threads of his novel. I can hear the swing and the chase, the boogie and the blues, the sounds that go everywhere at once and jelly roll the story within a complex set of fusion and feelings. It’s also just a damned good story!The narrative pulls you here and there, up and down, and when you meet Dodo, the sweet and barely teenaged deaf kid, your protective instincts will wrap yourself around him and never want to let him go. And, when Dodo meets Monkey Pants—well, this right there—the heart of the novel that will break you in pieces. At times, I had a wellspring of tears—not just for joy or anguish. Sure, comedy and tragedy fill these pages. But McBride’s natural humanity and gentle nature is the colossal, phenomenal heart of the book. The author steps aside, he doesn’t ever intrude. The core of the narrative are the characters. Their cacophony becomes a coda for living large.This tale made me want to be better, to do better, to open my eyes to all the missed connections, to fix the broken chords and forge new ones, and seek eternally to strengthen them. We are humanity, we are the essential substance to add love to the world, one modest good deed at a time.

The two novels I’ve reaClaudia Piñeiro is a crime writer sensation in Argentina, and I do plan on cracking open those murder mysteries in her oeuvre. The two novels I’ve read and absolutely loved, this one and Elena Knows, are not crime novels, but she does present them in a suspenseful way for the reader. Like the narrative style of EK, Piñeiro uses first-person pov that unfolds like a confession. Right from the start, you’re aware that she’s holding back considerable bits of information relating to the main character, even as she discloses her two identities. Until twenty years ago, she was Marilé from Buenos Aires, her home. However, she moved to Boston after a harrowing event, and subsequently became Mary Lohan. As she confesses her story, I was practically trembling. The past and present entwine seamlessly, and Mary takes us into her confidence with compelling intimacy. For me, the intensity of the tale built an atmosphere of existential dread, a danger ready to rise and roar at any moment.Due to the wisdom of her significant other, Robert, Mary/Marilé is returning to Buenos Aires, where the traumatic incident took place--and now the telling of it, --that inevitably shows the reader how the power of storytelling can distill trauma to its essential core. The way that Piñeiro entwines past and present is one of her many skills that make her such a standout author. The architecture of A Little Luck creates a riveting page-turner for the reader. I couldn’t know details fast enough! When Mary does disclose the decisive trauma, I was already in clutch-and-gasp mode. The more nuanced that the tale unfolded, the more I found myself panic-breathing! You can’t change the past, but can you repair the damaged pieces enough to influence the future?Piñeiro drills down to the potency of writing, of how storytelling can clarify trauma, the potential for healing and redemption through language. Robert introduces Mary to the heavies of literature, which adds to the author’s theme of reconciling through narration, while also highlighting the benefit of imbibing another culture’s adversities—how they are similar and different to your own. If nothing else, Robert aims to point Mary to a temporary exit ramp, a safe place to unleash some of her pain. Tennessee Williams, Alice Munro, Simone de Beauvoir, Hawthorne, among others, allowed Mary to observe the pain of others, and relate in a meaningful way. “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.”About Munro, Robert said, “She lies truthfully, like any good writer…and if she lies truthfully, it’s because she knows what she’s talking about.”Like Elena, Piñeiro’s latest novel is fraught with interior despair and emotional repression, but you may be more surprised here with the kernel of hope suspended in the story. The author has a keen sense of timing and knows how to restrain or expand a scene or a moment in time, and she kept me on the edge of my seat. There’s a balance of loss and redemption in these pages, or what Mary calls her “log book.” You could read this book in one sitting—I read it in two—but it felt like I lived a lifetime (or two) by the end. The finale was both riveting and satisfying.High accolades to Frances Riddle for translating as if it were originally written in English....more",Notes are private!,7,35,1,"Aug 10, 2023","Aug 12, 2023","Aug 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/75582270-a-little-luck

It's not uncommon for people on the spectrum to have no filter when they speak. It has its upside--she is always so honest! It has its downside if you are sensitive to frank speech like that. Sally was adopted and lives in a rural community in Ireland with her retired psychiatrist father. Her mother, a general doctor, died decades ago. As the novel opens, her elderly father is dying. He once told her that when he dies, “throw me out with the trash.” When Sally tries to take him literally, this brings the guards and the media raining down on her quiet, simple life. Sally and the incident become a widespread news story, and she’s forced to reckon with a larger community. Dark, disturbing, and, at times, deeply despairing, this narrative is a potent character study of people on the margins. Raw and blunt, like Sally, this twisted tale is told through two storylines—Sally and a character named Peter, going as far back as 1974. This is more than an Irish crime thriller; it crosses genres into a biting manifestation of how people don’t always mean what they say. Through the lens of generational abuse, the reader is sent down, down to the darkest events of Sally and her family's life.Sally has few coping skills—she pulls her hair out when distressed. Fortunately, she’s also an excellent pianist, and playing music calms her down. She’s not a people person, she enjoys her secluded lifestyle. When she had to go to town, Sally pretended to be deaf, and everyone did think her to be strange—strange Sally Diamond. Strange Sally doesn’t remember anything before the age of seven, which she thought was normal. She’s about to be thrust into a whole new world of meeting new people, starting psychotherapy, and learning more about her past. In the parallel storyline, Peter starts telling us his story, too, from New Zealand. The chapters alternate between Sally and Peter, and the puzzling gaps in the narrative gradually start fitting together. It is one mother of a book, with no easy bow to tie it off. Nugent’s precision in portraying Sally is so precise, so razor sharp, that it can be difficult to absorb at intervals. Nugent’s secondary and tertiary characters are also fully fleshed and exquisitely distinct. Her knack for penning chilling and damaged people is both hypnotic and upsetting. You won’t see that ending coming---but it is organic, psychologically astute, and unforgettable. I'll include a trigger warning, too. It's very painful at times, even hard-shelled readers will struggle.

Lehane put Southie (the mostly Irish part of South Boston) on the literary map in his early crime novels, and in SMALL MERCIES he achieves the pinnacle of his career. You are about to go on one of the wildest rides of your life (sometimes in a car named Bess)! Mary Pat is “built for battle” and will defend her turf and her family with relentless fury.It’s 1974. It was a hot, steaming, rainless summer in Boston, and temps were high not only in the skies but on the ground, between the white Southies and the Black citizens of Roxbury, both districts under a busing mandate to bring Black students to the all-white South Boston High School, and white students to mostly Black Roxbury. Forget the PC talk, (the word didn't even exist) and don’t expect Mary Pat to be the exceptional white woman who embraces desegregation. In fact, she demonstrates her own roots of being raised by casual racism, from racist parents who were like all the other racist parents in the district. They didn't question their bigotry--it was passed down generationally. Ergo, the entire South Boston population was on the verge of violence in these weeks before the first day of school. Something had to give, but was forced busing the answer? Lehane bravely tells a story of the racial divide, without sentimentality, without fear, and with an unstoppable plot. This is an unputdownable novel, not for the faint of heart. Prepare for graphic violence and plenty of moral ambiguity, as Lehane explores this time in history through the eyes of mostly the Southies, Mary Pat as the primary character. It’s the eve of protests, rallies, and riots, and Lehane flawlessly weaves in true pieces of history with his period piece. No need to cover the plot—that’s for the reader to enjoy as the pages turn. Mary Pat lost a son to an OD after he survived Vietnam. (I use the term loosely--he came home with trauma and a habit.) Her daughter, Jules, is seventeen and will be one of the bused students when school begins. Mary Pat has lived in Southie her entire life, she is a solid citizen of the community. Southie is guarded and run by the Irish mob (think Whitey Bulger)—the Butler crew, known as “Southie’s protector.” They will protect you, but you have to submit to their code, their ethos. This story gets explosive when Mary Pat collides with the mobster crew, while the busing mandate looms in the backdrop. She needs them to help her find her daughter, who failed to come home on a Saturday night. On the same night, a young Black man is found dead on the train tracks of a subway platform. The mob crew want to control Mary Pat’s actions, have her play by their rules, and let me tell you, you don’t want to get on Mary Pat’s bad side, either. The detective on the case, Bobbie Coyne, is trying to help Mary Pat. He refers to her as broken, but unbreakable. He knows her kind—the fierce Southie woman--but also recognizes that she is unknowable. She is as gritty as this tale, as raw as this story. Recently divorced from her second husband, she takes no prisoners in her quest to find Jules, and she’s scared of nobody.Racial conflicts, class clashes, and a gripping crime. Lehane spares no bigoted racial slur for the reader in these pages. There were times I could barely stomach these words, but Lehane is from Dorchester, and he knows the genuine language of the time and place. Mary Pat does recognize that her racism is inherited, that there is no “factual” basis for it. The language here is not gratuitous, but it doesn’t go down easy. The story peeks at redemption, and Mary Pat nearly vibrates off the page. Once you start, you’re hooked.

It’s “a writer writing about a writer writing about writing.”  So, is that cute, coy, cagey? Did Rachman pull it off? If it was a gimmick, he managed to turn it into a literary achievement. Rachman created vivid and contoured characters; they are all magnificent. He appointed the most amorphous of his characters, however, to play the lead protagonist. Dora Frenhofer, a Dutch novelist that achieved no lasting success, came across as indeterminate through most of the novel. But her particular story and the theme of how our stories or personal narratives get us through the day, the week, our lives, is potent. She’s in her seventies, suffering some mental decline, and wonders if she has one more book left in her to write. She's also isolated during the pandemic. I didn’t relate to her emotionally. Her flatness alienated me, her lack of spirit, vitality. She seemed dead inside, and had a one-note presence. While reading, I was often uncertain of which characters were real, and which were Dora’s creations. Was I supposed to be invested in Dora? The ending echoes with a resolve I’d not seen in Dora before, so I was curiouser and curiouser long after I finished reading! It’s a book that made me ponder. In these various interconnected stories, Rachman didn’t have a main attraction (but Beck was my favorite), and some characters fell off the stage. Beck’s personal story expanded through off-stage remarks and flashbacks. She is Dora’s estranged daughter, has the most charisma and easy wit, plus her morality was clear and infectious. She used to be a stand-up comic but she made better money writing for others. Anything she did I was on board with, she was lucid and touchable, palpable and sharp. She had gremlins, but she was open about them. Most of these characters, including Beck, were in the business of writing, which highlighted a metafictional marvel (Rachman) writing of a metafictional writer (Dora). THE IMPOSTERS, however, has something in common with his debut, THE IMPERFECTIONISTS, á la interconnected stories about writers (they were journalists, though). Tom Rachman is certainly an adventurous pioneer; connections, missed connections, and disconnects surge throughout IMPOSTERS. Each character generally gets their own story, which often overlaps with other stories or characters. Dora surfaces to a greater or lesser degree throughout the book. She’s fairly brittle and aloof, certainly eccentric. Maybe certifiably! Socializing with people is not a relaxing or enjoyable time for her. People are instruments or tools for Dora, as she uses them to create characters she writes. Then there’s Morgan, a character to pity. Most of us cannot identify with her, would have zero prospect of understanding the emotional suffocation of a woman who sustained that level of tragedy. But compelling! Her story was simultaneously remote and consuming. Then there’s Amir, with a dark, sad past filled with physical and psychological damage. Every character that populates this novel adds a nugget of enormity. It becomes as deep as it is jammed (with characters). A writer named Danny meets Nousha, a poet, and realizes that her social media footprint contains more followers than the amount of books he’ll ever sell in a lifetime. She shares another writer’s line that, “Literature is lying to tell the truth about falsity.” Inwardly, Danny always thought himself the protagonist, “but he was only a character actor in a show about her.” Another lovely line reminded me of the English rock band Genesis, from the song , The Colony of Slipperman on their theme album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway—in Rachman’s book the line refers to a writer, “wandering lonely as a cloud.” You really have to be a Genesis fan to catch that! Several characters heave about, get our attention, pause, depart. I, as reader, felt more like a witness than a bystander. It’s metafiction turned on its head, upside down, inside out. Indeed, I was gripped from start to almost-finish. Everything in my reading experience of The Imposters worked well for me except the road to ending. In the last nine or so pages I got stuck. I both did and did not want it to finish, and I saw what was coming. It concluded with a jaded bitterness that made me ask a few times who the real imposters were. My lasting impression of Rachman’s choice could be a reader’s problem (mine) but the author tidied up, even if cynicism crept in. (After all, Rachman created Tooly Zylberberg in The Rise and Fall of Great Powers, one of my most beloved female heroines).  Tom Rachman possesses a charming, sly wit, and can get into the weeds with his characters, and quickly! How does he do that? He doesn’t waste page space; every passage is measured and authentic, and he can introduce a character that readers can empathize with in a flash. Plus, stories about stories and writers never gets old to me.

On the linear level (which this novel is not), it comprises three generations of traumatized women, all stemming from Phil McDaragh, a (fictional) minor Irish poet, major womanizer, and scoundrel. He is celebrated for his published poetry about birds and other wonders of the natural world—the beauty arising ironically from his derelict mind. I was charmed to learn that Ireland’s birds are so small that most will fit in the palm of your hand. I got all electric at the thought. Plus, googling up the birds upgraded the reading experience. Kingfisher, corncrake, Bali myna—and snap, look up the ones you think you knew, like lark, blackbird, finch. I can still hear the cheeps and chirps emanating from the pages. Enright is a magician, a word bird herself, she can fly in many directions simultaneously and have it all home in. Of a bullfinch—“…I saw the bird and I wanted to undo language and let him be.” This is after her expansive description that ends with, “Words only obscure him. Even the name, ‘bullfinch’, seems a form of littering, like a sticky label fixed to his feathers.” That’s a light example of Enright and her meticulous conjuring. It’s pointless to try and capture her wit; it’s like those palm-sized birds—they materialize and then whoosh! Gone. And a word on the plot. There isn’t one that quite coheres before the end, but I adored her juxtapositions. The uncommon combinations of words convey the story better than a boilerplate or sweeping plot could do. Little seeds are planted at intervals, (such as, Phil’s granddaughter, Nell, who never met him, but is abused by his presence--really, his absent presence). Enright drops quiet little clues, and later she irrigates them with her spellbinding word serum. The plot is unlatched, like a basement bulkhead banging its bolt outside to the ground, with a winding time frame from above. Characters evolve as the narrative closes. Don’t read for plot, read it for the irresistible voice, the cast, the prose. I fell in love with how Enright bends language. She is as tender as she is pointed.How quickly structure, concision, and shaded depth contributed, and distracted me out of my comfort zone. Fiction can bring us fast into the moment, with immediate effect. Some of us readers may be disgusted or alienated by the things these characters do. Phil, whose wife is dying of cancer--and in fact she is propped up on pillows to “…facilitate drainage,” is a real dirtbag. He accuses his dying wife of stealing or concealing his nonsense wristwatch. Meantime, he messes up the bedsheets and blankets searching for the thing around her, and then quickly leaves. After that horrifying scene, I felt dread. Sadly (sadly?) I was also urged to continue. I had to know the outcome. There were tragic scenes that repelled me, you’ll have to read them in context. “I realized that every stupid, small thing I said that first night we got together had landed somewhere wrong in him, and it rose up now as a taunt.”TWTW tells a familiar story in the most singular way. The genesis of the trauma still lingers and threatens to dismantle all ongoing primary relationships. Abject agony is recognizable in any form, the hollow bottom of it, the things her characters witness in their past. Enright’s narrative is so active, so much happens the moment that you read it that you are astonished over and over. “The temper was always there, waiting for either one of them. When Imelda hit Carmel, it reorganized the pain.“And it was a kind of revelation, too. Afterwards, the world was very bright.”Shivered at times while reading. 5 weighty stars! The birdsong made me want to read the whole novel over again.

It concerns one young servant on a colonial settlement, devoted to her mistress and her mistress’ disabled daughter, Bess, but abruptly fled into the vaster wilds. The reason for her departure gradually unfolds while we follow her in the harshest of bitter winters of 1610 Virginia. Usually referred to as “she,” (real name Lamentations Callat, often mockingly called Zed), this young teen orphan braves the wilderness, enduring the punishing climate, starvation, sickness, and the fear of being followed by loathsome men and wild creatures. This is a survival story that soars to the metaphysical. It's a slow frozen burn to a shocking reveal, as well as a portrait of an American landscape not often seen from this perspective. Both earthy and philosophical, the narrative ascends to an inexorable conclusion, luminous and holy. “The world was all ablaze with ice, the world was on fire with ice.”It starts with a voyage from England to America, as the young servant girl journeys with her mistress and her mistress’ second husband, a minister that, to this reader, seemed icier and crueler than the raw and stinging winter of the wilds. The girl meets a Dutch glassblower on the ship, a gentle and kind individual, but is separated from him during the dangerous journey, and only has her memory of him to keep her warm. Jamestown is filled with pestilence, hunger, and hazards at every turn, even before she runs away. After fleeing with few items, she has to live on her skills and instincts. Exposed to the elements, she is constantly challenged by external forces, and her sick hunger is so intimate for the reader that we feel her digestive processes as if they were our own. Every moment was a hurdle for staying alive, the days and nights of lighting fires to keep warm, eating grubs or mud or darting for fish to stay her starvation, and conjuring companions from the past. Finding meaning in her solitude also became a quest. “Inside there was a darkness of the nothing of god.”The prose is hard, steaming, dark, raging, sublime. Simultaneously old-fashioned and postmodern, the narrative wends its way through our primordial selves. I cannot write up to the author’s power, it is so prophetic and wondrous and spiritual. For every nit or louse the girl removes from under her arms or her genitalia, from every hot, loose stool or inflammation of her flesh, there is also a deep rising of the divine within her soul. Groff braids the natural and spiritual world in a way that left me breathless, exhilarated. “Then she thought that perhaps in the language of the bears there was a kind of gospel, also. And this gospel said to the bears the same thing about god giving bears dominion over the world.” “And that god could change according to the person in the moment the soul was encountering god.”Lost and wandering, the fleeing girl must contend with the harsh realities of things she doesn’t understand. There are the chance but distant sightings of Powhatan and Piscataway people; the monstrous looking bears; and an insane, sadistic Jesuit priest also living in the wilderness and haunting her tracks. “If I stop I will die” is the instinct that serves her in this frozen terrain. This is a novel to read slowly but with fervor.

Les’ job as a scallop fisherman on a trawler is punishing, unforgiving work. He and his regular crew go by monikers that function as avatars—John Wayne, Stray, Hoover, Monk, to name some of them. This work appeals to emotionally broken individuals, allows them to focus on specific tasks to get through the day. Les withers from Marlene’s view, unable to confront the built-up resentment and unsaid words. Marlene is just as stubborn. Both find solace attending to others, embracing dreamers and cynics alike. While Les devotes his energy to his lacerating work, Marlene befriends a young prostitute and concentrates on mothering her. Sadness pervades the narrative, as Les and Marlene tug and twist and turn on their loss. The endless highway, neon signs, empty lots, and the depthless sea.

She’d say you got to abide with your darkness as if it were a scared child that wakes up in the middle of the night and needs to be walked back down to bed…You got to walk the darkness down.” It’s a harsh read, but it’s not without hope and capacity for redemption.Thank you to Bloomsbury for sending me an ARC for .

I felt myself floating in a chilly lake, with lush treesOpening these first pages of DAY reminded me how deft Cunningham is in minor key, so elegiac. I felt myself floating in a chilly lake, with lush trees on one side, perhaps mountains to the north. Now it is April 5, 2019. The changing patterns of sunlight fill the eponymous Day. Robbie-- brother, uncle, and friend, he’s about to move out from living with his sister and bro-in-law BFF. It’s a big change. He spends some free time with his fake Instagram account, a sort of avatar-ish projection of self but similar to his attainable self. Isabel, his sister, enjoys Wolfe’s Instagram and where the “parts” come from. Robbie’s a teacher who contemplates changing professions again, to go back to before, when he chose one fork over another. Can he? go back? Is a book epoch the same as a human epic?The April5, 2020 section emerged as the most immediate in tone and texture. I hesitate to call this a pandemic novel, as that suggests a medical setting or two. Day doesn’t feel medical, and the words Covid and coronavirus are never used. Virus hits the planet; Cunningham concerned himself with the contrasts of transitions. There’s before, then the transition from, and finally, surfacing. I’m no longer floating on the lake, I’ve walked out, shivering, and dried off, and made some determined choices. Overlaying all this was a human drama separate from Covid, and some of the conflicts and crises that these characters faced were going to be faced, regardless. The pandemic only simplified the linear part of their momentum. Maybe, in the novel, it all happened at night, in the bitterest hours; now it is DAY, and the sun leaves nothing to the imagination, you are transparently engrossed in your life. Admittedly, events didn’t always seem to be happening (in front of me), but had always happened. I thought of Henry James periodically, even if MC and James don’t use the same tense to memorialize these moments. There’s a sense of the past in the future and the future in the past. It’s pretty sad when the present eludes us. Then Robbie does past inventory, goes through his things and remembers ex- lovers by residual material possessions. One boyfriend gave him an insultingly expensive scarf hurriedly chosen from the airport on the last leg of their togetherness as a couple. It was a vibrant but soldierly blue.Isabel, Robbie’s sister, is contemplating leaving her husband, Dan, in 2019. She is bored and lonely with her once-almost-rock-star husband. Would their two young children adapt? I’m not sure they contemplate that directly. The adult characters were densely retrospective in this novel, in 2019. Then, it’s April 5, 2020 and they are forced to change everything from greetings to hygiene. Socially distance, work from home, take cover! I spun with it like I was in the spokes of their wheels, and in a continuous loop of thoughts. (Remember quarantine?) What did other people do, how did they cope? Is that a quaint sentiment, to capsulize a pandemic few years? The essential lives of these protagonists emerged more strongly than their pandemic lives. However dull my own descriptions of this book, my experience was anything but. Cunningham made me care about these characters, and then we take a bracing trip to Iceland! Iceland! Some scenes may start off rather static and sparse, but he fills it in so that it starts swaying, a 3-D shake dance as you live with their concerns. I’ll just talk a smidge about the kids. Nathan is an awkward ten-year-old who hasn’t figured out that he’s that awkward yet, so he’s still in with the “cool” guys. They sneak around playing D&D during the pandemic, which prepubescents would do. They don’t feel mortal yet. However, Violet at 3 is afraid to open the windows and let the monster virus in. She personifies it in her head, and it pervades her life. She’s also a typical little girl who loves the frilly costume dresses that her uncle gifts her. Violet will wear them out until they crumble, she’s fiercely independent in spirit, follows no peer.From 2019 to 2021, the various paths of this ensemble cast bring about expected and unexpected turns, all which comprise a contemporary novel of domesticity, with a classic kick to it. April 5th of each year emphasized the desire to connect and sustain; spring again, spring three times. The most we can do is observe their lives. It’s a little like life being a Zoom meeting we are pausing before pressing play again. The family is sharing a new certainty. They still have their times together and also apart. It’s possible they are learning acceptance, with a little resolve.Thank you to Penguin Random House for sending me an ARC to , and a real special thanks to Michael Cunningham for writing the book and sending it out to passionate readers....more",Notes are private!,3,25,1,"Jun 14, 2023","Jun 19, 2023","May 24, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123033397-day

Growing up in Massachusetts, I frequently went to the Cape with my family, enjoyed the marine wildlife, the birds (terns! There are terns!), the beaches and bays, and the magical atmosphere of Barnstable County. I was drawn to this book on that alone. The figurative and literal descriptions of all forms of life on the Cape was beautiful, remarkable. The wheel of life throughout nature—birth, life, decay, death.Brodeur’s novel takes place on the Cape, centering on the Gardner family, who live there year-round. Dr. Adam Gardner, approaching his 70th birthday, is a marine biologist, whose fading glory days include his expertise on humpback whales. He raised his daughter and son single-handedly, (who were nicknamed little monsters when they were kids) when his beloved wife died in childbirth. The biggest obstacle in his life is his struggle with bipolar disorder, which is well-controlled with medication—but now he’s decided to stop the meds in order to dive into new cetacean research. He intends to prove to the crop of new young scientists (and himself) that he is still relevant. Ken is Adam’s son, an aspiring politician with a wife and spunky twin daughters. His younger sister, Abby, is an artist, single, 38, and pregnant—she hasn’t told a soul yet. A couple from Boston, Steph and her wife, Toni, and newborn son, are spending their family leave here on the peninsula. Steph, adopted, has recently learned that Adam is her biological father. Having a baby has changed her concept of “family,” and she wants to explore whether to tell the Gardner family this news.It is summer 2016, and as Adam’s birthday celebration approaches, the family drama unfolds on the cusp of radical change. Against this majestic backdrop, family secrets are headed for a blindsiding turn. The troubles mount, sometimes like a soap opera. Just when it threatens to turn into melodrama, Brodeur pulls the reigns, usually keeping it real. The middle section lacked momentum, some of it felt like filler. However, the author’s depiction of bipolar disorder is flawless; she nailed it. I’ve been a psychiatric RN for decades, and have worked extensively with sufferers of this illness. Brodeur’s portrayal of Adam kept me engaged, even when some parts of the narrative read as garnish to me. The childhood trauma of Ken and Abby was also on point. The big sections are separated by months, and the text alternates between characters.

I also smell the forest, the flowers, the entire flora and fauna, the insects, the soil, the entire landscape of western Massachusetts, going back to the start of the novel, four-hundred years ago. Daniel Mason creates a profound narrative that ascends the setting to protagonist level, the house and the woods of this narrative carrying on history and ascendancy. Humans are transient; nature takes its course, and the primary house metamorphoses into sovereignty or supplication to the terrain. The people in this novel are beautifully wrought, and Mason gives powerful attention to art, mental illness, colonialism, slavery, grief, aging, poetry, music, and so much more. But, if the lives of these people are the television shot, it is fleeting, momentary. They get their fifteen minutes, yet are largely bystanders to the cycle of Mother Earth. I’m a native of Massachusetts and know the beauty of western Mass.,--the Berkshires, the Connecticut River Valley, the breathtaking views, the forests and its mighty trees. Mason’s book is compared with Richard Power’s, The Overstory, as both novels address the destruction of American forests. NW had me turning to Wikipedia and Google images again and again to look up the images of everything from bugs to bowers--a tremendous, encyclopedic adventure into the woods. Apple orchards have never been so beautifully rendered in an American novel, either.North Woods never feels stilted or overplayed, as the nature of life, death, and procreation was woven elegantly, masterfully through the story. We relate to the humans that dwell in this narrative, and we feel the marching of time through the natural world. Our lives are linear, while nature continues its seasonal rebirth. Human behavior has intruded upon the ecosystem, has altered the forests, sometimes in terrible ways. Nature, too, can surprise us with irruptive change. The impact of four centuries of time leaves much in its wake. Apropo of the narrative—the plot is propulsive, the book compelling, unputdownable, and deeply consequential to the theme. The way Mason integrates both is sublime. The yoking of the corporeal and spiritual is transcendent. Time is a constant refrain.A piquant conversation between author Anthony Marra and Daniel Mason (at the end of the novel) gives us insight into Mason’s connection of nature and mental health. The author is a psychiatrist (I am a psychiatric RN), and, while reading this tour de force, I often felt like it was written for me. If an author can evoke that for even one reader, it is a triumph. As I now leaf casually through the pages again, choosing any passage, I’m more aware of the novel’s eternal circle of Time. Mason is a literary treasure, you must read him for pleasure and purpose, for the rings of imagination, the majestic trees, the tiny bugs, the force of human consciousness upon nature—our capacity to grow and spoil, and to find solace in these beautiful woods of Mason’s mind.“Sometimes, overwhelmed, she retreats into the forests of the past. …and she has found that the only way to understand the world as something other than a tale of loss is to see it as a tale of change. …she’d dreamed about these ancient forests,… Skies blackened by bird flocks, valleys full of grazing moose and elk. The glens echo with the songs of long-lost warblers…, children singing in Mohican, wolf howl. Rivers so thick with fish that she could walk on them.

Inspired by a true history of events during the early 20th century, Harding’s narrative reimagines an island and its inhabitants off the coast of Maine, which the writer calls Apple Island (based on Malaga Island). As Harding reconceives it (a sort of factional vision based on the threadbare material that Harding possessed), Patience and Benjamin Honey arrived and settled there in the late 1700s. Benjamin was an enslaved runaway and Patience was a white Galwegian. They were poor and hungry, living on what the natural world has to offer, as well as mugwort tea, but over a hundred years later, Apple Island is inhabited by a diverse community, most who are Black or mixed race. The prevailing time period is 1912, the eve of destruction for all who live here.Esther Honey, the matriarch, is the great granddaughter of Benjamin and Patience, mother of Eha, grandmother to three. Her past trauma is a buttoned-up secret, only truly known by the one witness, Zachary Hand to God Proverbs, who mostly lives in a hollowed-out tree where he inscribes biblical scenes. He’s also an excellent carpenter and kind, gentle presence. The narrative describes the islanders’ day to day lives, although it opens with a hair-raising, bowel-splitting flood worthy of Noah’s. Harding adopts a playful style, whimsical wit, and moments of mystical wonder derived from the natural world. I often read the sentences out loud; the poetry and depth of prose has a teeming cadence that forces the reader to slow down, imbibe the language like notes in a piece of music—every word necessary, and uniquely lyrical.“As he lowered into sleep the salty pined breeze and cricket songs and schools of stars poured into and birled around his brains so the night became his mind and his mind the night and the mother owl watching over him swooped down from her tree and through his dreams.”Matthew Diamond, a missionary and retired schoolteacher from the mainland, teaches a range of subjects to the children on Apple Island. He possesses a physical revulsion to the Black adults, which he tries to hide. Matthew hates this about himself, but there he is, passively hurting those he promised to help. He escorts “scientists” who entwine their bigotry with what they mislabel the science of eugenics. These men bring their tools—calipers, metal rulers, measuring tape, and handle the islanders like some other species rather than human. The governor decides he needs to expel and segregate the community from the island for the “safety of health and humanity.” Matthew Diamond’s weak objections were overridden.Diamond attempts to paper over his racism with his savior plan. One of Esther’s grandchildren is fifteen-year-old Ethan, a gifted, budding artist. “How to get dawn, noon, and dusk all at once. How to get the heat. The forms and light and colors describe themselves to Ethan with perfect clarity and harmony, without explanation or reason, and he copies them down onto the canvas with the paints.” Matthew recognizes the boy’s unusual talent, and schemes to get him to the mainland to study with an old colleague before the big eviction. Ethan could “pass as white,” the missionary observes, and therefore would not be subject to prejudicial concerns. Mr. Diamond’s disgrace is his “incurable aversion to these people he truly believes he has been ordained to help.”The breezy, ruthless racism, the cruel conduct toward the islanders by depraved authorities is shocking and heartbreaking. However, Harding finesses his story with a singular flair, his language evoking a sweet, divine empathy and perhaps a bit of hope, the hope for us all to be a better version of ourselves, and to recognize the resilience of people who dwelled in the picture of their paradise, of Eden, until the worms and the snakes infiltrated Apple Island to cast them out.On the night before they send Ethan to the mainland, Matthew provided a sumptuous feast. “The islanders were so used to diets of wind and fog, to meals of slow-roasted sunshine and poached storm clouds, so used to devouring sautéed shadows and broiled echoes; they found themselves stupefied by such an abundance of food and drink. …And it seemed as if by sending him off to paint his beautiful pictures they all might…bankrupt poverty… as if they somehow might even starve hunger itself.”This is a novel to read again, and again and again. It’s a masterful portrait, like a painting in a gallery that you return to again and again, and get more and more of the picture each time you sit with it.

The call to war is passed from one generation to the next.Over a century of armed conflict and the struggles of two primary families—an extended family of Hungarians, a courageous aunt, plus a heartening West Virginian friend with his dog, Hector. It immersed me from page one, brilliantly through to the end. Krivak doesn’t waste time with hand-holding. He trusts his readers to imagine the world he reveals, and to be patient. Some sections have dates, some do not. Some chapters are clearly defined, others show a little cleavage, but is wrapped in shadows. How Krivak writes: He lights lamps in the darkness and personifies characters with urgent silence and inward longing. Disclosures are frequently channeled by inference. I slowed my pace and often re-read passages for the poetry of the prose and the deeper meaning beyond the page. Closing this trilogy with a potent narrative, his multiple protagonists struggle, enter wars, witness the formidable, and finally (or again) seek home. In their searches, in and out of war, borders are breached, fought over, shift. The borders are a poignant motif, a layered theme between families and nations. Sons of sons carry the weight of their heritage into combat.Families are ripped apart and reconnected; peace of mind occurs in welcome but brief stretches in the story, a reprieve between tense and tragic events. War is base, naked, soul-crushing. We read of men lost or captured in battle, in the World Wars, Vietnam, Iraq. The women these men love are at war with the wars, torn by waiting and lean letters, left to grieve the losses their loved ones endure, endure the losses left with their men.Like the Appearance of Horses is a masterpiece, the final and pivotal book in Andrew Krivak’s enigmatic trilogy. Darden, Pennsylvania is the multigenerational family’s central location—some are Americans, others immigrants who arrived from forbidding places. Not all threads are tightly pulled together, don’t expect a tidy ending, but rather an inexorable one. Epic and measured in tone, no word of this trilogy is extraneous, no chapter or character is superfluous, no event is merely incidental. The narrative is told non-linearly—not by the marching of time but through character, theme, and memory. “…he knew that while all blood, like water, flowed into ground, memory did not so easily lie down. …Memory, the thing fracted and upheld like a story within a story told in whole and in part…partook of some immortality, and lodged there within the soul like the inhabitant of a house left alone at the top of a hill…”A huge thank you to Bellevue Literary Press for sending me an ARC for ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"May 10, 2023","May 16, 2023","May 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/122448763-like-the-appearance-of-horses

Mexican Americans born here, but whose parents were undocumented immigrants, are now considered second class citizens, and soon won't be able to participate in most jobs, entertainment, housing, and the things that make a comfortable life accessible. I say familiar, because in the former guy’s administration, it was suggested that offspring of undocumented parents should be sent back to their parent’s native country (if it is a developing country). Brando Skyhorse depicts Iris, the protagonist, with astonishing credibility; his first-person narration deftly evokes the voice of a Latina woman born and raised in America, struggling to adapt to new policies. It could be anywhere USA, as the city is fictional (but resembles California). With vivid brushstrokes of magical realism, Skyhorse manifests the fears and fate of a strong and independent woman restricted from achieving her goals. Iris is happily separated from her husband and aiming for a new life in a gentrified neighborhood with Melanie, her comely nine-year-old daughter. The government now demands that those eligible must attain a wristband that scans electronically to prove your citizenry. If your parents don’t have citizenship, you can’t receive a band. As the novel progresses, I felt more and more outraged and haunted by reminders of the past, what my relatives went through as Jews in Russia, Western Europe, and, to a lesser degree, in the United States. Moreover, it invokes how Black people were ostracized and separated from white folks before civil rights legislation. Wearing a signifier, or refused one by the government, sends a bigoted message, the opposite of what Lady Liberty espoused. Skyhorse doesn’t preach his story, he makes you think about the changing political climate within the framework of an exciting dystopian thriller.As the story moves forward, it builds with terror and dread. A wall appears in front of Iris’ house, and continues to expand by the day. The wall composite alters over time, with peculiar and horrifying results. Iris is puzzled that others don’t seem to see it, other than her and Mel. In the meantime, Iris’ sister and parents are trying to adapt in different ways than Iris, but the outcome is potentially frightening for the entire family—to be ostracized from the country they call home. Day by day, their rights are squeezed from their lives. The government, as well as social media, are fueled with threats and hysteria mounted against the “unbanded.” The pace quickens and the story intensifies to a pulse-pounding nail-biter in the last 60 pages or so. The prose also alternates to Spanish periodically, sometimes whole passages. My two years of Spanish at university came in handy, but some readers may need an app or Google to translate. I expect some folks to complain or get frustrated, but asking myself why Skyhorse wrote it this way led to a deeper understanding of the story’s themes. The question of belonging is pivotally examined; eventually, Iris grasps that safety is the highest concern for her loved ones. What matters most for a family under threat of exile (and violence) becomes urgent and decisive. The finale is ripe for discussion.Thank you to Simon and Schuster and Avid Press for sending me an ARC to ....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"May 07, 2023","May 10, 2023","May 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62919813-my-name-is-iris

Tom Appreciating the little things in life, the joy of day-to-day existence, and the love for your family and your work is what Tom Lake meant to me. Tom Lake refers to a (fictional) summer stock theater in northern Michigan in the 1980s, close to the locale of the current 2020 timeline--- a cherry farm (and pears, and apples). The late eighties marked a luminous period for protagonist/narrator Lara, a time that she walked the fine line between adulting and adulthood, coming of age amid a torrent of drama that swept her up in its fury. And then there was Our Town,  the play within the novel that portrayed Lara’s life on the stage (and backstage).Lara is telling her three twenty-something daughters about her short stint as an actress in her twenties, and the brief romantic affair with Peter Duke, a famous movie star before he was a famous movie star. (And then there are the parts she keeps to herself.) The gorgeous cherry farm backdrop is like a staid but vivid character, with Lara, husband Joe, and the three girls all together for the first time in a while. Due to the pandemic, they don’t have the usual crew to help pick the fruit, so the storytelling unfolds as the family works the orchard during harvest time. Like the cherries, some parts are sweet, some tart, and all of it is juicy.I felt the air, inhaled the scents, the cherries, the land and the whole layout of the farm while reading. And there is the kindness, too, of this family, whose flaws are also part of their strengths. The chaos of Lara’s life as a young woman is juxtaposed with the serenity of her life now, and the two timelines fluidly alternate, sometimes gently, at other times with piercing intensity. And every storyline has at least two. So, when you read about Lara in the past, or present, you just can’t help sniffing around to see the connections, of what surprise is crouched in the corner or hidden behind the door. I verily slipped into Lara’s character and imagined what decisions I would make as her, given so many pressing options and dilemmas. Ann Patchett nails it every time, her characters are complex and her graceful pace is measured even when events are brutal. Lara is a radiant work-in-progress during her young years, many readers will see themselves in her. I was a local stage actor in Austin during my twenties, so I immersed myself in Tom Lake, pretending to be Lara acting as Emily Gibbs and then back to Lara again. The two timelines showed the difference between the fiery summer love of youth and the deep, tender, and mature love of family that you helped to create. The high points were explosive, even when they were pin-drop quiet. Lara’s low points stirred me almost to tears; I could feel her pulse against mine.If you’ve never seen a production or haven’t read Our Town,  you’re about to get a spoiler’s worth in the novel. But I think Ms. Patchett has surmised that most of her readers are already familiar with Thornton Wilder’s play. She coalesced Our Town and Tom Lake together in a way that reveals her refined skill of integration. Tom Lake and Our Town were separate but conjoined. I know that doesn’t make sense, but it will when you read the book. She also quotes Chekhov at pique (and even peak) intervals; she shares the Russian writer’s work with spare but specific devotion. I recently learned that Patchett has never owned a smart phone, and doesn’t herself do social media (she talks to the camera and her staff completes the rest). She has never used Google, or researched on Wiki—she does it the old-fashioned way. And perhaps she’s that slightly eccentric but lovely gentlewoman you see carrying paper road maps! She gives me hope. Tom Lake is thoughtful, deft, and life-affirming. (It isn’t a pandemic novel, even though it takes place during that time). There’s comedy, tragedy, drama—a look-back-at-your- own-life kind of book. It’s classic Ann Patchett. There’s this passage that really tickled me from the book. It’s toward the end but not a spoiler, it’s thematic with the rest of the narrative. Lara was so busy recounting the past for her daughters that she forgot to make lunch, which she said she should have been working on while talking. “The past need not be so all-encompassing that it renders us incapable of making egg salad.” Priorities!Oh, and the swimming!!!

Yevgenia (Evie) is a A mother-daughter relationship is explored in this disturbing story of hardship, poverty, longing, and intergenerational trauma. Yevgenia (Evie) is a white Russian immigrant and fiery alcoholic who came to the US by accident. Her sixteen-year-old daughter, Lara, is a Cuban, Black biracial teen who wants nothing more than a secure foundation at home, a demonstration of love and mothering from Yevgenia, and, at times, to find her father. The two are itinerants, never laying roots, with Evie escaping one place for another when finances and chaos get dire. The narrative lacks a coherent plot—it’s more a series of desultory events and scenes in a seedy trailer park-- but at the heart is a consistent theme of identity and belonging—the pursuit by a teenager of an indifferent and distant mother. The year is 2000, a new century but an old, stubborn playbook that Yevgenia wields.As the book opens, they are starting over (again) in the desert landscape of southern California, in a run-down trailer park of quirky and outcast inhabitants. Yevgenia dresses inappropriately and tacky for her age in order to emphasize and utilize her sexuality, and she parents Lara by pontificating nuggets of Russian literature--her only sacred bedrock of belief-- keeping notebooks of her edicts and philosophies, her legacy to Lara. She tries to taunt her daughter (a virgin) to have a sex life—even to compete with her. For Yevgenia, manipulating men is a serious game. Once, she left Lara for two years in the hands of strangers in order to run off with a man. She returned, unapologetic and ready for the next adventure.“My mother kept me, but she also tried passing me on to others, and that I won’t forget, despite her coming back. But when I needed her to let me go, begged her even, she wouldn’t. Not because she loved me, but because she needed company on her self- guided journey to misery.”  Evie’s life is a mess, but her books and her intellect define her. She quotes and lectures from various Russian authors as a way of substitute parenting to Lara, but it comes off as cold, cringey, and indifferent. She doesn't protect Lara from the pointed prejudices that her daughter endures, repeatedly. Yevgenia acts blind to race--she thinks everything is determined by class, and she has her own definitions of that, too. Yevgenia holds onto secrets that add to the many walls between them. She is often kinder and more compassionate to strangers than she is to her daughter. However, when it comes to physical abuse, she won't tolerate anyone laying a finger on Lara or anyone important to her life.Lara desires friends, but her overbearing mother intrudes on her friendship with Charles, a Black gay fellow student and aspiring writer. Yevgenia soon takes over as Charles’ informal instructor in the arts, often leaving Lara in the metaphorical corner. Lara wants her mother to mother her, to show compassion and love. However, when not working shifts at the bar, Evie is frequently drunk and vulgar, showboating her frank sexuality that Lara fears could be dangerous. This behavior often leads to a role reversal, Lara having to take care of Evie and ensure their safety. As the denouement approaches, violence is an inexorable interloper that forces Yevgenia and Lara to make clear and serious decisions about their relationship, as Lara definitively comes of age in a harrowing and inevitable conclusion. Don’t expect this to tie up in a tidy bow.The first line of the book comes from one of Yevgenia’s notebooks, a key kernel into her imperious axioms: “There is no release from life’s turmoil, so put your back into it.”...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"May 04, 2023","May 07, 2023","May 04, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60784787-a-country-you-can-leave

I soaked it up on every page—her lush prose and the passion for her characters. Ward bleeds her themes, her heart pumps with the essence of her story. Annis is the daughter of an enslaved mother raped by the white ""sire."" He is planning to violate Annis, also. The book tears open all the wounds you can imagine about being enslaved, and opens fresh ones with the casual savagery that enslaved persons suffered at the hands of their “masters” prior to the Civil War. It's sickening to even imagine what it was like to be ""owned,"" to lose your independence because of your skin color.Annis used to hear the white children being taught the epic Italian poem, The Divine Comedy, especially the first part, Dante’s Inferno. The first line of the Inferno is: “Let us descend, and enter this blind world.” Young Annis is a teenager who learned survival skills from her mother, skills to help her in this blind world of unspeakable crimes against humanity—but it was all legal then. Annis possessed some sense of agency only in these monthly sessions with her mama, in the Carolina woods where they had a large outdoor space. “The first weapon I ever held was my mother’s hand.” That is the opening line of the novel. But just as important as fighting was the storytelling. When her mother told her these stories, Annis felt their narrative power. “This our secret. Mine and your’n. Can’t nobody steal this from us.” No matter what happens to her body, Annis has the stories to hold on to, fables that rise to rectitude.When Annis’ mother is sold at the “slave market,” Annis must deal with the two worst personal obstacles ---lack of all agency, which has been a fact since birth, and sudden and profound grief of losing her mother. Compounding that is her own journey to being sold in New Orleans. The enslaved walk to their destinations, held by ropes, punished for minor infractions, all but starved, whipped, raped, treated like livestock, but worse. She walks from the South Carolina rice fields to the New Orleans slave market and onto a Louisiana sugarcane plantation.Prior to her forced exit, Annis met another enslaved girl, Safi, and the two had become deeply bonded. For Annis, without her mother or Safi, she is caught in a blind and bleak world of the damned. The landscape of her life is often infernal, forlorn. But the book is not wholly dismal. The tale is also about joy, and Annis descends in order to ascend. Symbols of Water and earth are also symbols of rebirth, of reclaiming what has been stolen, a descent into history and storytelling, spirits and soil, the family you came from and the one that you give rise to through your strength and resolve.Annis learns that her grandmother was a woman warrior married to a rich king who had many warrior wives. Every month, Annis’ mother took her to the woods and taught her to fight, to defend herself, to rise up. Mama educated Annis on the poignant saga of her family, to give her something that no slaveholder can take away—the story of her origin. Ward’s novel is a mythic tale about Annis’ hunger to resist and rise, to put into practice her warrior legacy. To thrive, and emerge from this inferno intact and victorious. Annis’ sense of hope springs from her imagination and belief in her own strength, to be regarded, and to regard. “She taught me that the ancestors come if you call them.”Ward used magical realism to heighten the mythical and fabulist framework of the book. I commend her for stretching the story to boundless limits, for using motifs of Dante’s poem and inserting her own magical elements. I admit to a gulf between me and the otherworldly mystique of these characters and events, perhaps the same way that the bible can distance me with hyperbole. However, I feel blessed to get my hands on anything that Jesmyn Ward writes. SING UNBURIED SING and SALVAGE THE BONES, both winners of the National Book Award, remain two of my top contemporary novels of all time. I won’t soon forget Annis and Mama Aza and the stirring, unruly cast of characters in this story.

Mr. Katō’s cranky privations wrap like rope around his hardened heart. His marriage has declined since retirement--they may as well live on different planets now. He silently blames her for petty woes, such as where she puts his tattered, broken, or smelly old things (a broken radio, his father’s old, worn slippers) or how she preps his meal when he takes his dilatory walks. And she hasn’t removed the threads that close the pockets of his pants! He inwardly criticizes her for his own flaws, and he grumbles about her lively new dance course. He’s convinced he wants a Pomeranian dog but decides she would bark at that, too. His frustrations are her fault, in his intractable mind. But what if he could reinvent himself, over and over, if just for a few hours at a time? Would that help dissolve the walls between him and his wife? “…the only thing binding them together, was the distance between them.” Could it alter his life for the better?With select individuals, Mr. Katō is quick to show empathy or engage in lively discourse. A taxi driver—a literal stranger—opens Mr. Katō’s cheerful and talkative side, and a homeless man he sees frequently on his walks keeps him absorbed. He contemplates his former colleagues, but usually tries to avoid them. One day, he is walking in the cemetery and impulsively propels forward and upward, as if his fingertips are touching the clouds. A mystery woman named Mie is cheerfully observing him, applauds and strikes up a dialogue. She subsequently offers him a part-time gig--to assume other identities for clients who request a stand-in actor. He’s to play a brief but significant one-time role in their lives. He accepts, after listening to a tape--like the flip side of Mission Impossible.On one occasion, Katō pretends to be an estranged grandfather, and was delighted by the young boy, Jordan, and his devoted mother. On another job, he’s a silent and clueless husband for a woman who needs to vent. In their roles, she takes him down a peg with a whammy of a demand at the end. At another event, he officiates a wedding, which includes a tender, heartbreaking bride. Readers, sometimes you will chuckle, or want to bitch slap Katō and his RHS—""retired husband syndrome.” At other times, well, you’ll have some sympathy. My only complaint is struggling to empathize with him. His role-playing bolstered his benevolence for the families he stood in for, but his participation sometimes bordered on saccharine. In his first assignment, I felt that his empathy for the biracial boy was tokenized by the author and shoehorned in for Mr. Katō. However, when he played the silent husband, his natural affinity for the part felt genuine, as did his gig as the wedding officiate. But his takeaway often seemed a bit superficial, or perhaps it hasn’t really deepened for him yet.The sardonic voice and lightly piercing prose readily underscored each other. Milena Michicko Flašar is a remarkable writer—I would follow her passages anywhere. Translated from the German, Caroline Froh made its meaning soar. The writing exemplified Katō‘s repression, and the inconspicuous, austere sketch of Katō’s wife provided her with, ironically, more definition, set against her husband’s caustic and ignorant criticisms. Does the playacting improve Katō’s rapport with his family? Is he more attentive? Sensitive? Evolved? Will he finally take her on the trip to Paris he’s been musing about for years, but stubbornly forgetting? Will he get that Pomeranian he so desperately says he wants? Flašar is superb at controlling moral tension within the pacing, and incorporating a bit of surrealism to shake things up. At the close of the book, I’m still pondering the outcome.Many thank to Forge Books for sending me an ARC to read and ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,May 2023,"May 03, 2023","May 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61885022-mr-kat-plays-family

Angie Kim’s powerful novel centers on fourteen-year-old Eugene, born with a genetic disorder--mosaic Angelman Syndrome, and autism. He doesn’t speak, and has many impulsive, self-stim and unusual behaviors that make it more difficult for him to communicate with others. As the novel opens, Eugene was with his father, Adam, in the park, but then Eugene came home by himself, upset and emotional, with blood on his clothing and under his fingernails. His brother, sister, and mother are perplexed, and as the first line of the first page states, “We didn’t call the police right away.”What befell Adam? Where is he? How can you get a nonspeaking fourteen-year-old that never talked, wrote, or conveyed anything in words—how do you get him to tell you what happened? The father of twenty-year-old twin brother and sister, John and Mia, and Korean wife, Hannah (who has a PhD in linguistics), Adam was the stay-at-home dad that brought Eugene to all his daily therapies. But Adam is gone, and it’s chaos for the family, and for Eugene, who is now even more confined in his language isolation.The story is urgent, acute and thoroughly researched. If you said it was non-fiction, or that Eugene was real, I’d believe it! I am a psychiatric RN who worked with kids like Eugene for twenty years, and wow—Angie Kim understands this lingual dynamic and renders Eugene flawlessly. The narrative unfolds through Mia, whose earnest voice is charismatic and passionate; my fingers burned just turning the pages. There is so much fuel to this novel, from the missing person plot to Eugene’s dilemma trying to communicate with his family. For back story that seamlessly glides through the narrative, we learn that Adam is preoccupied with the ”Happiness Quotient” and the desire to mathematically/scientifically measure happiness. He has charts, notes, flash drives, folders—he was obsessed with identifying the baseline and the stats.Angie Kim majored in philosophy before going to law school, which is evident. Her insight of logic and philosophy is impressive, and there are times that the novel read like LSAT exam questions—in a good way! The narrative flows lucidly, the passages functioning from the deepest, and sometimes darkest, parts of logic and deduction. When Mia is thinking/speaking to the reader, every synapse is ignited, so lightly and full of depth simultaneously. She balances her emotions with the analytical, reasoning part of her brain. Then there’s the intangible, mystical suggestion of the mind-meld, like static electricity, a cosmic consciousness connecting Mia and her brothers in the early eerie hours before dawn.This is the kind of novel I would leave on friends’ doorsteps. It’s amazing how edifying this story is. You learn without working hard, you’ll get educated while being wildly entertained. Angie Kim has a personal immigrant story of her own, which resulted in a disconnect with peers due to not speaking English when she moved to Baltimore as a little girl. Her experience is integral to the themes of this story. It’s about communicating, making your heart and mind known, firing up your curiosity and imagination, connecting with others, and being kind to people who don’t talk like you. It’s how to communicate with people who don’t speak, or write. She shows what it means to be human, all wrapped up in a family drama with a missing person mystery. HAPPINESS FALLS is refreshing, with an upbeat tempo, but it doesn’t skirt the everyday tragedies, little and big, that crash land on our friends, family, strangers, and neighbors. By the close of this book, you will feel a kindred spirit with every character in this story. I also ate up the nuggets of Korean culture, which was organically infused into the novel. Angie Kim rocks for her prose, story, and generous contribution to humanity. Eugene will steal your heart.If you haven’t yet read her debut novel, MIRACLE CREEK, you’re in for a treat.A huge thank-you to Hogarth for sending me an ARC for ....more",Notes are private!,2,41,1,"Apr 28, 2023",May 2023,"Apr 28, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/75495002-happiness-falls

Alice Winn became inspired after running across a historical treasure trove of documents: a digitized version of her boarding school’s newspaper from the early twentieth century, listing casualties from The Great War and the students who were killed or wounded fighting for Britain. The newspaper, as she showed in her book, had that old-fashioned large font, the Gazette-ish layout and direct announcements. The pedigreed students from Marlborough College put down their poetry books and highbrow hi-jinx and joined up, writing letters home that romanticized the war. Their valor carried them through, but eventually hit a wall when all their classmates started dying at the front. Winn peppered the novel with pages from the newspaper, which nearly seemed trumpeted (in an ironic and tragic way), but was actually quite raw in its frank portrayal of maimed and dead soldiers.The characterizations are A plus, palpably authentic. Her main characters, Sidney “Elly” Ellwood and Henry (Heinrich, half-German and half-British) Gaunt, meet at boarding school and fall in love, but aren’t confident enough to tell one another. Winn has a feisty and fulsome talent for meticulously depicting the people who populate the story. Even with a posh school of mostly rich white British teens, they are separate and distinct individuals. The ones who go to war experience shell-shock from such horrifying trauma on a daily basis. And, even then, she doesn’t render the same trauma behaviors. The shock and dismay and nigh unseeable trauma they witness—some as young as 16—swiftly removes the scales from their eyes. They go from boys to men in a matter of months. Winn nailed the humanity of the men and their response to the inhumanity of repeated killing.Winn’s prose is subversive, electrifying at turns. Some of the young soldiers are appointed to censor letters home, such as, “Mostly the men talk about the mud and the rats and God. We have to censor the mud and the rats, but God is allowed to remain…”In a historical note following the novel’s last pages, the author shares all the books she read to assist on the legitimacy of the book’s war content, and she stated that she folded various ones into some of her characters, events, and put words in her characters’ mouths. She writes with acuity and alacrity, fueling the authority of the narrative with her assured insight. War was the antagonist, unabating, unrepentant, unrelenting. Brave characters permeated the pages with sharp credibility; you will accept that these prep school students laid down their Tennyson for trenches (but quoted him between sprays of bullets). In fact, the title is from Tennyson’s, In Memoriam A.H.H., and Winn’s fearlessness is evident, too. She commits to her characters courage and vulnerability, so that their dialogue and thoughts are genuine, and their behaviors emanate from what they had become, and they reflect what faced them. Romantic scenes are eloquently quilled. Sex scenes are difficult enough to write between opposite genders (but at least there are centuries of examples to sift through). In the same-sex sex scenes here, Winn deftly roused the intimacy, made it do-or-die but nuanced, the consummate blend of verity and magic, devotion and candor and fire. Winn is classy, whether she is portraying love, lust, violence, or vulgarity.My only complaint could seem rather sizable, but I’ll go ahead and try to say it lightly. The plot was both on the nose and over the top. The front line, the trenches—that was all organic and likely to engage any reader. The plot wasn’t as singular as the character-driven rewards, however. The melodramatic moments weren’t necessary, and they lessened the impact of the moment. Those parts reminded me of some of the old B&W movies from the 1940’s—perhaps it was intentional, to evince an old movie, but it didn’t work for me.Winn also wrote a plot point that fit more in a Lifetime movie, not here. But she almost made it work, because her characters remained consistent; yes, her characterizations are fierce. But the performative parts of the plot—where they could almost break out in song (or sad song)—it distanced me when that happened. I think she was attempting to add gravitas, but she already had that. She could have just relied on her fully dimensional characters. I wanted to tell her that—that she didn’t need to amplify the plot like that, because her characterizations were just so phenomenal that it would have carried any dead weight in the plot. OK, so I wasted two paragraphs on why I assigned 4 stars instead of 5. I’m still thrilled I read this book. Alice Winn is immensely talented, and she can do the hard parts effectively, but taking the plot down a notch would give the right pitch and poignancy. If you dislike war novels, you will not dislike In Memoriam. This isn’t a book about strategy and war language and missions. Winn has constancy in portraying her people, the cast of provocative, young individuals that grow up both in spite of the war and because of it....more",Notes are private!,1,42,1,"Apr 20, 2023","Apr 28, 2023","Apr 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59948520-in-memoriam

April SaSometimes I need a breather between dense and heavy books, but I require an honest, organic voice when a narrator is also the main character. April Sawicki is that gal, a 16 year-old high school dropout from a bad parenting family but with good people skills of her own. Plus, she has guitar and songwriting talent. Her journey away from her hometown of Little River, New York starts in mid-1994 in Ithaca, where she finds her groove and independence, and makes her first female friend. The ties she cut in Little River prepares her to know the difference between authentic people and the phony ones. Her path is a little bit zig-zaggy, and there are certainly tears shed along the way, but each experience adds to her maturity and song writing as she captures her feelings and learns more about the people and places around her. April is brave and vulnerable, loving/passionate but afraid of settling for something less than her desire for accomplishment, as well as a bit commitment-phobic. She’s too young to settle down. The lifestyle of vagabond (ish)-musician suits her, and the story of her adventures is irresistible. It’s about coming into her own. “I feel like I am actually here. Like someone dropped my mind into my body and it’s a shock to the system. I think maybe they were only walking side by side before this and now we are here together, both parts of me.” April demonstrates keen insights, which both protect her and keep her moving along. There are definite snags along the way, as she meets people, reaches out, attaches and detaches. Some are people she never sees again, but others are the people she wants to keep around. She accumulates and sheds, and along the way she captivates almost everyone she meets. As reader, you become her biggest fan, or you become April! I swung from one to the other. When I wasn’t rooting for April, I WAS April. That’s how finely tuned her character was written. Like she popped out of the pages into my life.

It was a wild and haunting absorption for me, especially once the pilot light was lit an1940s Trinidad is not a place I’ve journeyed before in books. It was a wild and haunting absorption for me, especially once the pilot light was lit and the plot got cooking. The class differences were stark and chilling; the bad taste of British colonialism suffuses and persists. In this group of well-wrought characters, we are introduced to the barrack of five poverty-stricken families. The barrack is a rotting and tilting fortification of wood and tin, one that leaks and fails to protect from any extreme temperatures. The cast is almost Dickensian in its specificity of traits, but more eerie in atmosphere. Grief is front and center right from the start, and when death came before the opening pages, it never really left. The presence of prologue remains, and shadows the lives of those who forebear. The wealthy couple in this story is also tormented. It is a violent place to inhabit within these pages, on this farm and barrack. Even the big house, with the monied Changoor couple, Dalton and Marlee, is haunted by a portrait. Dalton is a paranoid monomaniac and Marlee has a storied, secret past.Down in the barrack, Shweta and her handsome husband, Hans Saroop, lost a baby daughter, Hema, before the conception of Krishna, their young son. Shweta cannot get over Hema’s death and especially the subsequent cremation, especially as Hans, who she has known since childhood, won’t talk about it. Hema is now one of the hungry ghosts, the dead who cannot be satiated. Krishna is bullied daily at school, has a spunky heart, nevertheless, and gets excited when his father brings home old issues of Popular Mechanics. The people he surrounds himself with also protect him—his cousin, Tarek, and a set of twins who are always rough and ready to brawl if someone messes with them. The barrack, however, continues to deteriorate. “The barrack was a fossil embedded in quicksand. No longer attached to an estate. Attached to any higher purpose whatsoever. And anything without a higher purpose was destined to be eaten by time.”In this exquisitely written novel, Kevin Jared Hosein delivers a transcendently tragic exploration of life and death in this time and within these people. Some worship in the old African tradition, and there are others willing to convert to Christianity, believing it will transform their lives into prosperity. I read in shock as characters I thought were upright are led astray by the promise of money and power. There are times I had to put the book down for a minute or two while I took some deep breaths. The big house on the farm and the barrack below mingle in an unforgettable and resounding tale that unfolds and reflects the art of oral storytelling.Recalling a situation about unlikable people he needed to endure, a character relates it to a bison and its flies. “While the bison grazed in the field, it would swish its tail at the gathering flies. There is rarely a moment when the bison wouldn’t have to do this, and so someone seeing the bison for the first time would think it just enjoys swishing its tail. It has gotten so accustomed to this dance that its facial expression never shifts while its tail, like an automaton, bats away fly after fly. He said that people might mistake the bison’s impassiveness for laziness. But such was a daily dance that became part of its personality.”...more",Notes are private!,4,22,1,"Mar 30, 2023","Apr 08, 2023","Mar 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61109596-hungry-ghosts

HOMESTEAD opens three years earlier, in 1956, when the Bureau of Land Management in Anchorage was giving away tracts of land to the hale and hardy. Lawrence Beringer, 27, a Korean War survivor from Minnesota, jumps at the opportunity for 150 acres near a lake. All he has to do is work it, make it thrive, successfully farm a crop. He decides on alfalfa, and then seeks a wife “for the sake of children.” Lawrence is stoic, enigmatic, and socially awkward. He meets Marie, visiting from Conroe (near Houston) at the Moose Lodge, and tosses a piece of paper at her (but I won’t spoil that moment of what inane thing he wrote on it). A day later, they decide to marry. Marie’s beloved sister, Sheila, who she is visiting, lives a few hours away from the Beringer homestead with her husband, Sly. Marie comes from an optimistic place. The story mines movingly, it burrows. Moustakis has written a haunting, sensuous, and vivid novel about marriage, turf, and trust. All within the dramatic landscape of Alaska, with its four stunning seasons. The chapters are separated by each of the twelve months, and cover approximately three years, beyond when Alaska becomes a US state. “Snow came and went, a promise and a lie, and the turned trees lose their finest gold and yellow leaves to the wind. The scrape of moose antlers on branches and the rustle of willow shrub, the rut, and the bulls in a fight over the cows, the hollow racket of antler thrown against antler, the echo through the low.”Lawrence and Marie dance lightly around each other, strangers still, Lawrence moody and guarded. One thing Marie makes clear—she wants her name on the deed when it’s time. Lawrence’s father, Joseph, unlike his son, is easygoing and accommodating. He travels from Minnesota to help the young couple build a large cabin. For now, they sleep, eat, and bathe in an adapted creaky school bus, and own a truck for transportation. Marriage, like farming, requires attention and effort for success. The Alaskan landscape, often overwhelming, unreservedly powerful, punishing, and unforgiving, is a character in itself. Taming it is a tremendous project—impossible, perhaps. You honor your spouse and respect the land, yielding at various times to both. There’s a measure of interiority here, well-balanced by the setting, physical labor, and plot.A past trauma grips Lawrence, which he hides from his wife behind an inscrutable shield. Vulnerability scares him, whereas Marie is keen to laugh and love and lean on each other. They both revere Alaska, despite some dangerous collisions with wildlife, and the day-to-day intersections with the landscape and their tenacity eased me naturally into the story. Marie, especially, reaches out with tenderness toward nature, and to her husband, and they both comprehend how small they are in contrast to the great Alaskan wilderness. It’s too majestic not to dominate, and it puts things in perspective. But there are brewing conflicts gone unsaid, and at times I clenched my fists and wanted to scream. The tension in the marriage is plainly palpable, but Lawrence has an almost pathologically avoidant personality, mostly due to his trauma, I suspect. The disquieting moments build on each other, leading up to a striking denouement.

As Landay probes deeper, the reader recognizes that it was just as much an examination of family dysfunction as it was a murder mystery. Landay approached his latest crime story in some of the same relatable ways—with a probe into family dynamics and the flawed, broken parents and children. However, this one failed to capture my attention. It felt derivative—even the detective with the port wine stain was something out of a previous novel I read. And a novel has to be exceptional, truly singular, to get away with a dead person speaking posthumously. Instead of handling it with nuance, I felt it was a bit strained and striving. Landay can write prose, and he certainly had a worthy premise. However, it seemed a bit long-winded and flat, a monotone-told narrative that aspired to delve into each character.

Over 36 million civilians starved to death, and the people were forced to hide their thoughts and beliefs, or risk torture and death. The post-Mao era continued the terror of the people and finally resulted in the protests and killings in Tiananmen Square. DO NOT SAY WE HAVE NOTHING is Canadian novelist Madeleine Thien’s epic, eloquent, and prizewinning novel--a pean to love, duality, memory, music, and the nature of stories and time. The fate of two families is depicted, and the merging of their stories is intricately bound together with their struggles.The classical musicians at the Shanghai Conservatory were forced to hide their thoughts and feelings, and they could not play music that had passion and individuality, unless it conformed to Mao’s view of tidy communism. If the musicians demonstrated their personal virtues, they were tortured, and their instruments destroyed. The cast of characters here hid the music they composed, and sang or hummed the notes quietly or silently. Their music was ripped from their lives, but not from their hearts, even as they were forced to work jobs that were in service to the communist government.Over 70 years of repression is covered in this novel, mostly 20th century but leading up to the re-opening of the Shanghai Conservatory in the early aughts. The duality of identity—the prescribed self and the true self—is the main theme, along with the beautiful music that the characters (many of them musicians) both created and listened to, with Glenn Gould’s Goldberg Variations (Bach) running throughout the novel, and a fictional Book of Records that the characters contributed to over the decades. It is non-linear, reminding the reader of the nature of time and the powerful, enduring nobility of music, as well as the confluence of politics and art. Duality is present everywhere in the novel, and the narrative thrusts us into two worlds at all times—the one authorized by the government, and the truth that we carry quietly inside.“The only life that matters is in your mind. The only truth is the one that lives invisibly, that waits even after you close the book. Silence, too, is a kind of music. Silence will last.” Thien does a remarkable, phenomenal job of balancing silence and music in the same thread, opposing forces that remain together.The opening lines are a pair in itself. “In a single year, my father left us twice. The first time, to end his marriage, and the second, when he took his own life.” The first pages introduce us to Jiang Li-ling (English name Marie Jiang) in Vancouver, where she lives with her mother in the early 1990s. A teenage relative, Ai-Ming, comes from China to live with them, as she was forced to flee the brutal attacks in Tiananmen Square. As the two girls grow closer, the family history is slowly uncovered. Marie learns that her father, Kai, was a concert pianist during the Cultural Reformation, and that Ai Ming’s father, Sparrow, was his instructor at the Shanghai Conservatory all those years ago. A set of notebooks called Historical Records serves as a motif and a frame for the story, and for a history that is both forgotten in a dense fog, and yet unforgettable, too. How these opposing concepts can be held together is actualized in the unfolding of the story. Lyrical, heartbreaking, tender, brutal, and staggering, this novel will stay with the reader for all time, like the Chinese history of its making.DO NOT SAY WE HAVE NOTHING won Canada’s top prize, the Scotiabank Giller Prize in 2016, and was short-listed for the Man Booker of the same year....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 21, 2023","Feb 27, 2023","Feb 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31549906-do-not-say-we-have-nothing

In FOSTER, FOSTER, by Claire Keegan, is a novella as spare and stark as Small Things Like These, both which take place in rural Ireland in the 1980s. In FOSTER, the nameless narrator is a child, sent by her impoverished parents to live with distant relatives in Wexford. The young child has no idea when she will be going back home again. Her mother is about to give birth to another baby, adding to their already large brood. Her father is a no-good loser caring for no one, thinking only of himself. He drops off our narrator to the Kinsellas, Edna and John, out in the hinterlands. They give her a dignified life, a room of her own, and space to breathe. She also has plenty of food at meal and tea times, enough to pluck from the earth, to cook, to eat and to permit her to grow. Secrets are discouraged and no one need be shamed. This artless story portrays a liminal period for a child that, simply by being herself, is enough to deeply touch us, to evoke our empathy with her steady forbearance. Spaces are never empty, voices are never alone, days march forward and give us more to count on. This new life contrasts with the girl’s former childhood neglect, and the pain of knowing that is sometimes intensified, even as this new family embraces her with affection. Keegan doesn’t implement time, but her characters modestly mark time’s graceless lethality, and its measure for mercy. The drama is between the lines, in the hush of the gesture, the unspoken depths. A secret is later revealed by a gossipy neighbor regarding the Kinsellas, and the child quickly kens the profound but featherweight fragility of life.

This story sIf you could autofiction fiction, and write it with an unreliable narrator, then Fiona Snyckers’ LACUNA could fit neatly into that genre. This story supposes that Booker winner J.M. Coetzee wrote DISGRACE as a factually flawed true story. The rape victim, Lucy Lurie, is the “lacuna,” the silenced voice of Coetzee’s prize-winning narrative. In response, LACUNA is Lucy Lurie’s feminist retelling of her rape, and how she deals with her subsequent trauma. Lucy’s personal anger toward and campaign against Coetzee figures prominently in her story; she identifies LACUNA as her “intertextual conversation” with Coetzee’s original work. “He turned my rape into a spectacle and me into a public figure.” Lucy attests that her rape was an ordeal that she suffered alone, and her post-trauma is not the way that he portrayed it—as a metaphor for post-apartheid South Africa. “If John Coetzee’s story is fountain pen on vellum, mine is menstrual blood on toilet paper.”You don’t have to be a close reader to note that Lucy’s references to DISGRACE are often counterfactual. She even altered by three the number of men who raped her. LACUNA is supposed to be told two years after Coetzee’s1999 DISGRACE, but Lucy’s retelling includes social media and other implications of contemporary life. In DISGRACE, Lucy had the baby, but in LACUNA, she terminated the pregnancy. By doing this, Lucy reinforces that her rape was a vicious attack upon her body, not an allegory. “You can’t declare the country free and ready to move on from apartheid on the back of a woman who has been raped. Your analogy itself is oppressive.”Moreover, Lucy is reclaiming her agency by narrating LACUNA in her own furious voice-- by turns ironic, angry, passionate, removed, and witty. Even Coetzee’s biographical information is feigned in LACUNA. He was already a celebrated author of many books prior to DISGRACE, and had accumulated a feast of literary prizes. But Lucy redefines his life, the way she felt he had done to hers via DISGRACE. She describes him as a previously unpublished writer, attempting for years to complete an unfinished book. Then, when her rape became widespread news, he appropriated it as a convenient plot device to finish his manuscript. He published DISGRACE on the back of her tragedy and became a breakthrough success. Lucy is obsessed with finding Coetzee and confronting him personally, even as she learns that he absconded to Australia.There are multiple layers to this intertextual dialogue between DISGRACE and LACUNA. But here, in Snyckers novel, Lucy proclaims, “I am nobody’s lacuna” and finally becomes the main character in her story, placing Coetzee as the minor one, the patriarch who is complicit in the abuse of women. By the end, I had to remind myself that Coetzee is, of course, no villain! DISGRACE is entirely fictional, and if not for Lucy’s opposing story, the reader would not have to pause and remember that. Fiona Snyckers wrote one heck of an audacious, complex, feminist novel.

Suffering from severe Parkinson’s, she requires the medicine levodopa in order for her body to do what her brain commands it to do, like get out of bed or walk. The med wears off quickly before the next dose is due. Her head hangs so low that she sees the ground, adding even more challenge to her activities of daily living. She wants to investigate the tragic death of her daughter, Rita, found hanging in the church on a rainy day, but she needs help to do that, as she is a widow without other children or a trusting support system. Elena doesn’t believe it was suicide.The present story is Elena’s journey across Buenos Aires on public transportation, in order to call in what she considers a debt owed to her, or at least to Rita. She is looking for a woman named Isabel and a place she hasn’t seen in twenty years, and is hoping that she can time it well so that the levodopa is at peak performance. Elena is determined to prove to the police and her daughter’s fiancé that Rita did not commit suicide. She needs assistance investigating, to probe and ultimately clear her daughter’s name. The reader lives inside Elena’s body, and we experience the galactic pace of Elena’s life under “this whore of an illness.” I don’t want to give away details of the plot, or what happened twenty years ago that makes Elena confident that she is owed a debt. However, there are ironies piled over ironies to unpack, gradual discoveries that will disturb and stagger the reader. This plainspoken trek across the city is a layered slow burn of a short novel that tips into a shocker of a finale. The central theme demonstrates the consequences of not having control over one’s own body, and the horrifying results that can play out over decades after being denied personal agency. Shown through mothers and daughters, it's executed through a glass, darkly. It’s clear that perception is often not reality, either. The pace of the narrative matches Elena’s disease, and the destination is what this journey is all about. Once you get there, prepare for the undoing. Piñeiro delivers with a gut punch, and it is all organic. It’s a stunner with consequence.

I finally got my hands on this second one, 1794, a year following the first grisly crime that Mickel Cardell, a watchman, solved with his pal, Cecil Winge, a consumptive lawyer. As with the first book, Stockholm remains one of the main characters in the book. You just can’t ignore the soot and the city, from the bottom of the low classes, the poverty stricken and forgotten, to the rich, arrogant, and often depraved. In this narrative, you will meet the most vile and twisted man to ever walk the earth. Mickell is back and ripe to find him, and you’ll be reacquainted to some familiar characters from book #1 as well as a new and memorable cast. At the center is a violent murder. And if you are familiar with this author, you know he does gruesome, grisly, graphic, and gritty with livid detail. 1794 is not as tightly written and taut as the first book. 1793 was worthy of a series of paintings, every word written of every scene was a masterwork of art. The prose in 1794 is not as finessed as WOLF, but it was still (mostly) a page-turner. It could have been edited due to some repetition and malingering, but I quickly installed myself in the narrative for its harsh and tragic story and portrait of Stockholm. Adventurous and character-driven, it will keep you on your toes, and you just can’t prepare for the astonishing denouement. Natt och Dag bends to no one but his own inventiveness.

Most s say that the three stories in the novel have only a tenuous connection to each other; I disagree. First, there’s her revisionist history that takes place in 1893 (where homosexuality is accepted and welcomed in the so-called Free States), with the map of our country completely altered—take a look in the inside cover, and you’ll be chilled. The map/boundary lines and names of regions are fascinating, and terrifying, (especially the South). Then the 1993 terra firma, and finally, the bulk of the book’s pages, the 2093 tale. There are also years in between and among. Moreover, each century’s map impacts the successive ones, despite the hundred years from one to another. Briefly, I thought it was all children of men, as the author brandishes her poetic license with vigor. But--about the connections between the trio of stories--I felt the dense fumes that each story left in its wake. If this novel of three novels were part of a “history” course, I would be able to confidently assert that Yanagihara provides a trio of epochal periods that shows the audacity of the colonial mind, no matter the century.There is already a trove of s—both endorsers and dissenters—so I don’t need to go into the details of the stories. The author compelled me from the first page to the last. The way she “reincarnates” characters will make your head spin (it’s a challenge to keep up!). The book contains old-fashioned services such as arranged marriages (in America), or the map as it is in her novel. From New York to Hawaii (and only a few states in-between), Yanagihara probes themes of love, nurturing, pandemics (but not Covid!), sex, identity, colonialism, to name a few. Survival is key in every motif. “No law, no arrangement, no amount of love was stronger than our own need to survive.”This book isn’t for everyone. At over 700 pages, there’s a need for patience. It waxes and wanes, waxes and wanes. Toward the end of the last story, the suspense becomes nail-biting, closer to a mainstream adrenaline rush of a tale. But, until then, the novel is more a fervent exploration of humanity—and what it means to be human—than it is a plot-based book. Yes, it could have been shorter, with a tighter pace.

I was at total ignorance. The problem with Mouth to Mouth is the zillion tells online and through friends that yada yada yada (I won’t reveal it)—anyway, it’s the book’s gimmick, for lack of a better word. Was it effective? Less so, knowing in advance that this particular narrative transition was coming, and it looked almost like a mechanical choice to me, or perhaps one of many options. Anyway, for me, the big thing that was supposed to make this book great and me applaud didn’t do that so winningly for me.However, I still recognize Antoine Wilson as an assured writer, a painter of nuanced characters. Even though it almost feels a little bit workshopped (overly so) and I wonder what would have happened if he hadn’t just pared it down to the essentials (according to workshops) because maybe he ripped some of the heart out, too. This could have been shorter, like 86 pages, or 53, and had more impact. The central events are repetitive, with nothing new about the character reveals. I kept turning pages because Wilson is still an impressive writer; I just think that the spark got denuded a bit. And the author staked a lot of his book on the destination eclipsing the journey.This is one of those books I don’t even talk about the facts or content of the book. I just felt like giving my impression. I would take a chance on a future Wilson book, maybe even with that same narrator. He was the real cipher here, too, and maybe that’s one of its many planned ironies. But I think he has more to say, and to grow, and usually I don’t like characters hopping around to different and more books. But I think the author could claymate him a bit more.

It wasn’t until I scanned some s that specifically stated that you don’t need to understand tennis to enjoy this book that I decided to go for it. And they were right! CARRIE SOTO is a smashing character in a champion story.In CARRIE SOTO, tennis is primary, but also the volley for TJR’s themes about the human condition. And Carrie Soto is so vivid, intense, and fully dimensional—known in the tennis world as the Battle Axe-- that she lived in my home and in my heart on every page. In fact, I even dreamt about her, she was that pressed into my literary soul. Carrie is single-minded, merciless when it comes to the court. Her unyielding nature, however, has its pitfalls; her personal life is the love you only get in tennis.It's 1994, and Carrie is 37, retired for six years. Still single, she trusts nobody enough to get close to but her agent, Gwen, and her father, Javier, who raised her himself (her mother died when she was very young). In his home country of Argentina, Javier made quite a splash in tennis until he was injured. He turned to coaching his daughter. He started teaching her the game when she turned two. Carrie is tightly coiled and at arm’s length from the rest of the human race. Her solitary life leaves little room for laughter. Soto was a ten-time Wimbledon champ and winner of more Slams than any other woman in history—until the new It-girl Nicki Chan surpasses Carrie’s Slam record in ‘94. Carrie decides to go back into the game to defend her record and show that she’s still the world’s best tennis player.The novel gradually fills in the background time gaps so that the reader pieces together what makes Carrie tick. A tennis phenom, she was also a walking time bomb—I kept waiting for the inevitable explosion. I did learn intriguing tennis facts that I ate up despite my indifference to the sport itself. Reid has an exciting way of revealing the game without boring the reader. And the sport is also a metaphor for Carrie’s drive, her spirit, her priorities, and her sense of self and self-esteem. As the competitive drive consumes Carrie, it absorbed me, too. Her obsessive nature was in her DNA.“I’m back at war, after years of not knowing how to live during peacetime. This is the only place where I make sense to myself.”Tennis was all that Carrie lived for. Reid created a stark character that the reader, by turns, dares to understand and occasionally wants to tromp. Soto’s fanaticism is also what defines her, and binds her and inevitably can blind her. She guards her emotions and steers her life away from others. Training and competing means meeting the world at large—but on whose terms?Do expect some untranslated Spanish—but these days we have google translate to make it easier, and it doesn’t distract, but rather adds to the novel. The climax is not super surprising, and a few other parts were predictable. But Carrie Soto, written from scratch, was an unabashed success, a memorable snd walk-off-the-pages character. TJR is a genius in welcoming readers like me, who know squat about tennis but is captivated by the story of what it means to be human—flawed, expectant, hopeful, scared, and served with a beating heart....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 19, 2022","Sep 21, 2022","Sep 19, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60435878-carrie-soto-is-back

He knows how to create the perfect balance—character-driven, plot-driven, atmosphere-driven, and page-turning. I’m not a series or trilogy reader, but this, for me, is an exception to the rule, and REINDEER HUNTERS did not disappoint. In fact, I’m so swept away by these two books, I can’t seem to get my feet back on the ground. It took me days to start another novel and tear myself away from the rural Butangen. By the way, this CAN be a stand-alone, but shouldn’t be. Read BELL first, not this one. This one not only contains significant spoilers (it has to, by virtue of story), it won’t allow you to experience some of the characters and events as they dramatically happened in the first book, and that’s just devastating for me to think about!Both books comprise myth and allegory and Norse tradition from the early 17th century, to the Hekne twin girls, and of course the bells that were forged in their name back then. REINDEER HUNTERS is partly a hunt for the weave that the twins made on a loom, a weave that vanished at some point. The first book primarily takes place in the 1880s and this one about 20-25 years later. That’s all I need to reveal about characters and plot. But, as an aside, the reindeer hunting that takes place inside the pages is staggering, too. And the Norwegian clime and geography is almost a character in itself.The story—at times, drawing in the mythical and allegorical—centers on some broad and specific themes, such as the truth of lore and legend; romantic love; the meaning of family (those we ache for and those we create); the class system; and our ghosts. The ghosts of the past, the ghosts on our heels, and the ghosts that are obscure but lay our fears open. What drives us? What is important to our lives? How do we live with regret and guilt? How do we redeem these mistakes? The setting is stupendous, even astonishing at times, as Mytting can make his landscape writing look effortless, and I was deeply engaged in every. single. page of this novel, and every emotion traversed my heart, my mind, my literary feelers. It’s almost painful to be done and have to wait for book three, however long that will be. Mytting created such a stunning world, and an epic scale story, that I spill tears just thinking about the beauty of this book, and his last one, repeatedly. Don’t expect every answer in this book, either. Some of it is interpretive, or shrouded in a primordial mist. It’s visual and finessed, with unforgettable characters that you’ll want to keep revisiting. You will be drooling for the third book. I sure am!And a shoutout to Deborah Dawkin for her superb translation of Norwegian to English.“He could stand and stare at a mountainside for hours before a patch would seem to lift away, quite suddenly, then move and become a reindeer herd on the run, and all they left in their wake were footprints that resembled two half-moons.

What a coincidence to be reading a novel set in a royal court and finishing it now, as the queen’s casket journeys the Royal Mile in Edinburgh (the city where Maggie O’Farrell lives). Just an opening observation of how surreal life can be at times, between my reading life and actual life at large. I’m not much for pomp and circumstance or novels of 16th century Dukes and Duchesses, but knowing that this author is a master storyteller and prose artist is why I bought and began this book immediately upon arrival. At first, it was difficult not to compare it to HAMNET (same basic time period), but as it moves along, I was able to see it as its own entity and separate jewel. It’s a masterstroke not to be missed by O’Farrell fans and those looking for delicious palace intrigue. I’m not much enthused by pageantry, cosplay, or costume dramas, but my first thought as I closed the final page was, “This is why I read fiction and hail it above non-fiction.” The author clearly understands how to bend the boundaries of history and excite us with the fruits of her imagination, while piquing ours. This book could only be the work of fiction, yet, be prepared to gasp a time or two. It also conveys a bite of realism. It gives rise to the maxim that I may be paranoid but that doesn’t mean someone isn’t after me. O’Farrell selected a member of the Medici family, a family well known throughout Europe and the world, really. Lucrezia, from Florence, daughter of a Grand Duke is our protagonist. She is 15 when she marries Alfonso, Duke of Ferrara, in her dead older sister’s stead. My favorite scene is when Alfonso sends her an engagement present, a painting of a stone marten, a lively scene that bounced out of the pages into three-dimensional presence. The author astonishes with her knack for teasing the senses—every single one. You will taste, feel, smell, hear, and even your ears will be provoked (when you learn more about the Ferrara court choir) and inspired.I won’t transpire the plot—just my enjoyment. This is a book for any season, as all of them are winningly portrayed.

A fan I was not of his particular writing style (he was paid by the word and you could tell!), but the expansive content of his stories contained pointed themes of wealthy v. poor, privilege, addiction, abandonment, and a lot to deploy on the foster care system. Kingsolver never writes the same novel twice—each is its own wildly different story. She’s a chameleon writer who demonstrates that fact once again with her inspired-by-Dickens but contemporized, Americanized version. Kingsolver’s talent all over it. Remarkable! This is Pulitzer material, even if Kingsolver is openly auditioning. It’s deserved. Nobody has cracked open the American foster care struggles like Kingsolver! It makes you think. It makes you want to serve.A picaresque and boisterous novel, Demon Copperhead is title and narrator, taking place from perhaps late 90s up to the single numbers of the aughts. It’s an odyssey of never-ending adventures, a Fool’s errand, a red-headed, green-eyed Melungeon in rural, natural world Lee County, Virginia, where cliched terms are on point—hillbillies (and some edification on it), meth heads, drop-outs, etc. But Kingsolver gave dimension to the often stereotyped, brought the lens up close, granular edition. Demon I fell in love with at first sight, he’s endearing. Other characters crept inside of my heart, like his friend Emmy and her mother, June, who came early in his life, Mrs. Peggot and Maggot, as well as Angus (Agnes), the football Coach’s daughter and his foster-sister and brother type relationship with her. And Tommy, one of his healthier relationships with another foster kid. Dori his bittersweet romance. Dark characters, too, like Rose Dartell. Demon was tall for his age, ends up 6’4” in his later teens. Able with art, drawing crowd-pleasing comics with exciting superheroes.What makes a family? As fucked up as these kids and adults are to each other, it gives them a reason to live another day. Some of these dysfunctional bonds go beyond judgment into a place where these underacknowledged and kicked-to-the-curb kids find fragile status. Drugs, poverty, and abandonment contribute to the awful messes they keep getting in, but occasionally a person with compassion enters their lives and gives them encouragement. The kids are street-wise and heart-broken too many times to count. Demon and his crew know hunger on a prolonged timetable. They’ve been discounted and condescended to, and failure is always a tragic option. And when a character in Kingsolver’s novel is dopesick, I felt it in my bones. Corpuscles. Demon shows the reader a wide range of emotions. “Here’s where Miss Barks” (his caseworker) ""didn’t grow up: foster care. She had no clue how people can be living right on the edge of what’s doable. If you push too hard, you can barrel yourself over a damn cliff.” It is a masterpiece work, once again, from Barbara Kingsolver.

I’m an RN, and I can vouch that TGB was authentic in every way. One of my favorite contemporary novels. For her latest book, Ms. Makkai takes on the true crime podcast fever of our nation’s listeners. She also poked around where these podcasts go sideways, the lure of the lurid and the deadest of the dead. This book was topical, meeting the moment when podcasts are all the rage, and it is difficult to parse whether you are listening to thoughtful true crimes on these podcasts or if they are being gratuitous. In her own literary potboiler way, the author wrote about a current film studies instructor doing a two-week stint as a podcast teacher in a boarding school. Bodie Kane lived through the murder of her roommate at Granby in New Hampshire back in the mid-1990s. She has some questions for a lot of people.The first 250 pages builds and adds girth to the main story, a few subplots, and the characters who inhabit the pages. The last 150 pages take that slow burn to a hot suspense. It’s clear that Bodie is traumatized, mostly by the murder but by other things, too. I’m a generation older than Makkai, but at a Q&A with Julia Whelan Monday night, she talked about how many creepy, perpy, pervy men, got away with it in the 1990s. I immediately related, as a Boomer, when I don’t even think that “sexual” and “harassment” could sit next to each other in a sentence back in my youth! Thank you, Rebecca, for including that character that we can hate on, who I can hiss at, as a stand-in for all the inappropriate behavior we put up with from men (including bosses!) before (and after) Anita Hill, and #MeToo. She carefully constructs a tidy whodunnit within a messy bunch of lives. She kept me guessing, and I’ll say that she stayed one step ahead of me, for sure! Makkai takes on Twitter rages and the sensationalizing of the ""prvilegeddeadwhitegirl"" like no other.The last 150 pages, and then—whew—the last 50 pages, had me doing calisthenics in my head and heart.

It meant that if you could define what was absent, create a map for the missing, that was also a way of knowing a thing.""This elegiac story captures rural China during the Cultural Revolution (circa the 1970s) and continues on through the early 1990s in an ancient rural village of the Anhui province and also America. The narrative weaves the tale of two families, specifically the young first love between a Chinese couple, Yitian and Hanwen, who hope for better things than farming or labor work. The epochal story alternates between time periods (mostly) from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and paints a vast but also confined landscape, and paints domestic dynamics that stem from a provincial upbringing. MAP is a sober tale depicting how cultural ignorance can destroy a family’s devotion to each other, from generation to generation. During the 1990s, Tang Yitian wants to put the ghosts of the past to rest, and perhaps turn regret into redemption.I don’t want to give spoilers, so I will just say that, after closing the book and reflecting on the themes and events, I felt sadness that such a simple, treatable human condition can rip apart the seams of family intimacy. Belinda Huijuan Tang gave a powerful portrait of both the ache and myopia resulting from lack of understanding, how knowledge deficits tore through love and erected walls between fathers and sons. Moreover, Chairman Mao’s rustication program of displacing people from Shanghai and other big cities to toil in rural areas added to the lack of agency that people felt at the time. Hanwen was one of those girls that came from Shanghai. Like Yitian (whose village she was sent to), she yearned for a higher education and successful job. Yitian and Hanwen met fortuitously while studying in the same secret place. They realized a spark of friendship together, and continued to meet up and study, reading and writing and discovering their feelings for one another. Both aimed to take the “gaokao,” a test not unlike the SAT tests in America, with ambitions to score high and go to university.We know from the opening pages that Yitian, in 1993, is a professor at a prestigious university in the U.S., married to a woman named Mali. His estranged father has gone missing from the Tang village that Yitian grew up in, and his mother begs him to come home to help find him. He hasn’t been home in a decade, and now has to face what he left behind. The title is apropos of the early plot details, but readers will also be piqued by the evolving narrative, which demonstrates the various ways that the title fits elegantly with the story. What else is missing, besides Yitian’s father? What tragedies broke up this family, and what happened to Hanwen’s dreams of success? How does history and ignorance play its part on familial bonds? Can we forgive what we may have destroyed? How do we emerge from buried tragedies? I frequently wanted to yank Yitian toward his past, back to the yawning future, to face and unlock his suppressed fears. It’s apparent that Yitian has difficulty living in the moment. Bliss remains at arm’s length, and his damaged spirit suffers from too much psychic damage control. He lacks the nascent spark that originated with his grandfather, who taught him the joy of reading and passion for history. The blessing of family has been replaced by the burden of sadness. But now, after all these years, Yitian is forced out of his tedium and dull comfort zone. He’s compelled to contact Hanwen to help him find his missing father. Seeing her again unearths the ghosts and shadows of his youth; this time, he cannot run away from his past, however turbulent and oppressive.Tang delivers a beautiful, aching story, and I’m impressed that this is her debut novel! Just a few complaints. The passive or conditional tense of the prose turned turbid at times. It figuratively—but also literarily--signified Yitian’s irresolute nature, which I appreciate. However, it also flattened my reading experience periodically, causing me to wander or grow restless on the page. It took me a while to feel liftoff. The plot turns were slow and ultimately predictable, but the power of the theme, of what damaged this family, truly made me gasp at the end. It would be a spoiler to reveal this nugget, which is the thread that connects the generations. I am a psychiatric nurse, and often work with children possessing certain challenges. Smart people can be left behind due to small offsets or differences, but a savvy adult can intervene and help them turn it around. I’ll leave it to the reader to discover the gaps in these generations, the missing pieces of the map.Thank you to Penguin Press and netgalley for offering me a digital copy prior to publishing.

In her last book, THE SANKES, much of the action took place in a creepy and deserted hotel, with oddball, twisted, and sinister characters. AMY & LAN is quite a departure from THE SNAKES, and occurs during a five-year period (2005-2010) on a rambunctious Herefordshire farm. The smallholding, Frith, is delicately illustrated in an ink drawing prefacing the novel, and serves as a physical guide for readers. Three sets of Londoner friends decide to take their kids and dogs and escape the urban life for country living. Best friends and seven-year-olds Amy and Lan (Lachlan) tell the story, in alternating voices, of their predominantly unsupervised farm life with their parents. Born just days apart, they describe themselves as two halves of the same whole. As the story progresses, Amy and Lan—and the reader—will observe increasing undercurrents of less than idyll realities. The bucolic countryside is fraught with restive tensions, mainly brought forth by the parents.The adults are often preoccupied with finances, petty conflicts, and self-regard, but the two best friends, although limited by age, still sense the prickly emotions that ripple through the farm. The story unfolds vividly, as the children experience agricultural and animal life on Frith. Whether it’s the slaughtering of their precious turkey, Virginia, for Thanksgiving (potent and traumatic!), the adoption of an orphaned calf, or the birth of one, life never gets dull for the kids. Moreover, everyone learns to participate in scything the grass to make hay (I actually paused my reading to watch a YouTube vid on scything!). Some adult characters are more defined than others, but all are seen through the lens of Amy and Lan, where the weight of the narrative rests. I’m not often onboard with child narrators in novels, as they can lean toward the precious or too self-aware. However, the author hits the sweet spot, and, through Jones, these two children tell an authentic tale. “Usually I don’t really think about me and Amy being friends,” Lan says. “We’re always together and I don’t even notice her that much.” One primary thrust of the novel, though, is how Amy and Lan, raised almost like siblings (or more like twins!), start to experience themselves as separate from the other. These heartfelt moments reminded me how brittle and brutal our childhoods can be.

One horrific incident in 1982 has come to define Stephen Rose’s life. He has not been punished except by himself, and is now a recovering alcoholic who missed out on raising his daughter with his ex-wife, Evie. It’s 2011, and he has received a letter from a place called the Commission, asking him to come in and tell his side of the story. He's not on trial, but Stephen has, essentially, prosecuted and persecuted himself for decades. The novel takes the form of the epistolary, as Stephen writes a letter to his 26-year-old daughter, Maggie, as a way of pursuing and achieving an atonement for his wreck of a life. “I sometimes think that’s what it comes down to, …ways of keeping yourself on the surface of the earth, of buying the minute or two you need to let the shadow pass.”The tension is the rotted pit at the center of the story, the event that was a heinous mistake, but that overshadowed and resoundingly affected Stephen’s ability to function as a reasonably healthy adult. At age 51, is it too late? The ex-soldier is placing his faith in this letter he is writing to Maggie, and in so doing, recounts events from his Quaker upbringing to his current existence as a lonely man working at a garden centre shop back at his childhood home in Somerset. “Imagine England without dandelions or daisies. Without buttercups!” Lots of extended botanical metaphors, like Stephen Rose, the protagonist.There’s so much UK and Romantic UK poetry and history that I lack personally and academically, so if you ARE exposed and experienced, you’ll have even more to enjoy. Also, you can be completely ignorant of Northern Ireland, IRA, and Troubles history specifically and yet enjoy the tale for what it is on a simpler plane. Miller is just a good storyteller, and nothing strains under his creation, although there are bleak and murky moments. The author is expert at staying out of his own way and merging reader with story. “Words have shadowy roots tangled around the roots of other words”, he says, “Pull up one and you pull up twenty more.”(Also, the third epigraph quotes a line from a Basil Bunting poem, ""Briggflatts,"" with the eponymous title of this novel.)A big thanks to Europa Editions for this elegant and elegiac novel....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Aug 11, 2022","Aug 17, 2022","Aug 11, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59969245-the-slowworm-s-song

The seasons change, the years pass, and the two misanthropes become completely cut off from their pasts, and transform into a singular unit. Throughout the novel, in third person pov, the reader settles into familiarity with Bell and Sigh through actions and habits. We don’t actually hear their words, but we know that they had become “thoroughly infected” by each other’s way of speaking. “They had each caught the other’s inflections and intonations. They slurred the same pairs of words together and identically mispronounced others. They skipped the same conjunctions, maintained the same timbre. By the seventh year, they spoke in a dialect of their own unconscious creation.”Don’t look for a progressive plot, but rather a turning of leaves, a rainbow in a puddle, waves thrashing, a mountain unclimbed, and the change from night into day, year after year.

Shamsie’s intelligent writing conveys the main events and the subtexts of their friendship. This is a largely subtle novel with gradual disclosures. If you are expecting explosive events and abundant action, you may be disappointed. Much here occurs below the surface of their lives, within their memories, proclivities, and sensibilities. The narrative is thoughtful and reflective more than exciting.The author slowly loops in how each friend’s nature creates the chemistry around their relationship, sometimes positive, but at other times, a recurrent darkness pervades, just under the surface—those subtexts that convulse and threaten to rupture.My topmost complaint is the lack of tension in the pacing and an absence of pressure. When the climax came, it felt a bit anticlimactic, and I was impatient for an organic thrust of emotion. The second half of the book was more expositive, and I kept wishing for more showing than telling. However, Shamsie’s deft sense of nuance remained with me when I closed the book.

Her postmodern style is not for everyone, as there is zip on any relation to formula, and the characters have minimal histories. Typically, authors conceive their characters’ behaviors on the childhood influences that shaped them, but Wolff dispenses with that and creates her cast from raw material, as if history is casually immaterial. She follows chaos where it leads, and she doesn’t lead them into a systematic plot. The inverse of deterministic framing, the sense of destination is torpedoed. Moreover, the moral center is a person who you will initially think is vile. Eventually, you “get” that Wolff’s structure is not to prove an equation. Instead, she demonstrates that existence is messy and mysterious. I was carried away by the narrative sensuality, Wolff’s fleshy and complex layers, the astonishing passages, and her bold, provocative images.Quick rundown of characters and situation—there’s Lucia (meaning “light”), an elderly nun with a missing thumb and astonishing history; a middle-aged female Swedish writer named Bennedith, who is in Madrid on an award grant for three months, and who suffers from body dysmorphia; a Spanish man named Mercuro who is grieving over his serial infidelity to his ill wife, Soledad (she needs a heart transplant); and an urbane woman who joyfully cares for her Alzheimer’s-stricken husband, despite the total care that he requires. There’s also the inclusion of a TV show called Carnality that is both a send-up of our social media climate and a malevolently-inspired lesson on prurience and punishment. Wolff combines and merges all this together, and more! You just can’t predict a thing, as far as the development of plot or the outcome. Certain themes, such as unbridled lust, repression, and our violent impulses, darkens this stark landscape with a Nietzschean nihilism and desolation. “Imagine a cross between the strength of a Belgian Blue bull and the evil of Hitler. Throw in a couple of armfuls of hatred for men and the concentrated essence of embittered womanhood, and that’s her to a tee” is an example of feminism turned on its head, images that stay with you even after you turn the last page.Speaking of turning the last page, don’t expect the author to wrap it up, or even to put it all together.

(But, to me, the least credible content of the novel. Teddy Wayne’s prose is both muscular and active, immersive from the first page to the ineluctable finish. And, OK, it takes no prisoners of the MAGA cult, but it derides blind, knee-jerk liberals, also. It’s not even that politicians are all hacks, but that media and politics brew hot, venomous stew. On a personal level, it’s a misguided father who loves his daughter beyond reason. Moreover, it shows how even a 46- year-old progressive thinker can still be wildly out of step with what feminism means today, or optics. The climax, to a degree, is foreshadowed, but that doesn’t make it any less entertaining. You’ve seen versions of this plot before, but Wayne’s narrative is powerful and proven, not trite and stale. Witty and dramatic. Also a quick read.“What will happen—“—is what we believe will happen. This chapter of history is ugly, but the next one is still unwritten. If we lose hope, we lose. If we think we can win, we will.

Each book is a little gift or surprise, a discovery on where it will take us. Usually I feel like I’ve added to the understanding of human behavior, or learned to love just a little bit more. However, in DINOSAUR—and this may be my fault completely—I failed to extract any meaningful theme and intrepid examination of human behavior, as she usually provides us. I felt a little flat while reading it, all the way till the end. As usual, her characters were not hard to empathize with. They are flawed and vulnerable, particularly Gil, the narrator. But, the story itself did not keep me pinned to it, or wanting more as I read. For me, this was Millet’s most mundane story to date. Perhaps I missed something, failed to observe the one nugget that tied it all together or gave it thrust and magnitude. As it was, the narrative never achieved lift-off for me. It kind of parked in one place on the landing strip and lacked the engine power to rev it up. DINOSAUR embraced relationships of various kinds, from friendships, to lovers, and to parents and children and role model behaviors. Gil, the understated spokesman of the story, has a tragic childhood story—his parents died when he was young, and he was raised by a miserly grandmother. When she died, however, Gil became wealthy beyond his needs. He spends most of his life caretaking others and volunteering/contributing to worthy causes. This novel is sort of a compendium of Gil’s experiences, particularly at this moment of time that he feels lost. He lives in an old restored “castle” and next door to what one could call a glass house, as one wall allows transparent peeping at all hours of the day. Gil becomes almost a member of the family next door, the parents and kids in the glass house giving him access. Through them, we learn how great a guy Gil is. A very weird section concerns the man responsible for the death of Gil’s parents, and I didn’t find it all too credible. I’ll leave that for readers to discover and decide for themselves.Although I didn’t truly connect with this novel, I thought it was smooth enough to finish it and see if it touches me in ways I wasn’t expecting.

His writing is urbane, mercurial, and atmospheric—compellingly noir. As a British ex-pat residing in Bangkok, Osborne’s Asian settings for his novels are enveloping and alluring. His characters are typically lurid or naïve ex-pats themselves, and often deeply flawed in that alien culture way that gets them in trouble. ON JAVA ROAD is centrally about a friendship between a British journalist, Adrian Gyle, who has lived in Hong Kong for decades (he calls himself a hack), and his good friend, Jimmy Tang, a wealthy local elite. In Osborne’s usual measured voice and tone, a disappearance interferes, or threatens to interfere, with their friendship. What I enjoy so much about this writer is how the language itself tells the story.Student protests against the extradition bill point the way to the darker side of Hong Kong politics. Adrian is covering some of these protests, and meets a rebel student half his age who is dating the married Jimmy. Adrian is intrigued by this woman, who is independent and unthreatened by Jimmy’s marital status and unimpressed by his wealth. However, when Tang’s power and potential betrayal comes knocking on Gyle’s door, Adrian’s investigative skills and inclination to delve further into sinister undercurrents in the city bring him to a precipice in his relationship with Jimmy.I was immediately installed in Osborne’s rich and textured tale, and, as usual, riveted by the moody and sensual narrative. I read him for the prose as well as the story. “…I wondered just how fully I understood the tight-knit warp and weave of a society like Honk Kong: incestuous, gossipy, given to rumors and backstabbing, its money all wrapped up in a few clans, always ready to flee to foreign parts if the going gets rough.” Mmm…tasty from start to finish.Thank you to Random House and NetGalley for sending an early copy for ....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jul 03, 2022","Jul 07, 2022","Jul 03, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56690360-on-java-road

Their personalities couldn’t be more opposite, and yet they mirror each other in ways that keep them entwined. Agnès narrates the tale; Fabienne has recently died in childbirth, which causes Agnès to reminisce back to when they were young girls. She is in her late twenties now, a bit melancholy, missing her friend more than many miss their departed spouses. It reads almost as a myth, a fairytale—a meta- fairytale, as you will discover as the pages turn. It’s the story of friendship, loyalty, love, fame, art, privilege, depravity, and obsession.They met when they were just goslings, so to speak. Geese are monogamous, by the way (which helped me in figuring out some of the symbolism of the book). Fabienne is aloof, while Agnès is more emotionally dependent on her friend. In fact, Agnès feels that she doesn’t need anyone but Fabienne in her life, to give it meaning, and has no desire to leave the countryside. The two friends (largely Fabienne) hatch a scheme with an adult teacher when they are just thirteen, and write a lurid, dark tale with his assistance. The book becomes a blockbuster best-seller. Since Fabienne decided that Agnès would claim authorship, Agnès is the one who travels the circuit, and subsequently attends a private boarding school in England (reluctantly), because Fabienne talks her into it. Agnès meets upper class, wealthy girls, an eccentric mentor, and learns a bit about the art and guile of sophistication. Class divides become more apparent to her, although her continued focus is Fabienne, and the desire to return home to her.“Morning and evening make a day. Days and nights make a week, a month, a life. Drop me into any moment, point me in any direction, and I could retrace my life. Details beget details. With all those details one might hope for the full picture. A full picture of what, though? The more we remember, the less we understand.”Goose kept me fastened to every page, in a way not unlike the girls’ lives together. There is a definite Sartre and Camus-esque existentialism to the story, a sense of the absurd, or the meaning and value of existence. It is clear that the friends shirk the material in favor of the philosophical and search for the distillate essence of life.

This talent is well on display in POET’S HOUSE, a narrative of people grappling with early, middle, and late life decisions. Poets/writers have their art that they hold up as their core passion, but within their hearts, Thompson demonstrates that we all share similar desires to make our lives meaningful.Twenty-one-year-old Carla is a landscape artist stuck in moving forward with a career path. A community college dropout, she is very bright, intelligent, but she’s wired differently. Reading comprehension is a challenge, because she doesn’t process words well (likely a form of dyslexia). But one day, while landscaping a famous poet’s house, she hears the poet, Viridian, recite a poem out loud, and bam!—Carla is captivated. A whole new world has opened up for her, and Viridian, the lovely, seventy-ish poet, befriends and wants to help her.Carla’s love life generally seems centered, but her vague sense of the future periodically interferes with plans, even with steadfast Aaron, her boyfriend. In the meantime, Carla is compelled deeper into the world of poetry and poets. Viridian is a superstar in that esoteric world, and her poet friends flock around her to support, cling, or just be in her company. Viridian had a past lover, Mathias, a poet who died many years ago. Apparently, he burned what was left of his poems, but everyone thinks that Viridian has secreted copies somewhere in her house, but nobody has ever been able to turn them up, and Viridian is mum. Even though she struggles financially, and the recovery of Mathias’ lost poems would earn her a windfall, she won’t budge. Her stubbornness is as enigmatic as her own past. She’s a tenacious feminist who insists on her own principles and resources. Carla indulges in her poetry crush that began with the first of Viridian’s poems that touched her:“I wanted to keep living this way, among people who talked about writing, sometimes frivolously, sometimes seriously, often both in the same conversation.”POET’S HOUSE is compassionate, exploring the struggles of lives, family, health, habits, and individuality. Strip the surface of our skin and feel the keenness below. Peel away the words we speak and write, and honor the heart and humanity from where they came. “You write poems because you want to take hold of an aspect of experience and examine it, push it a little further, find out why it speaks to you.

Like someone punched you in the kidneys or ran over you with a tank. But, yeah, I survived, and now it will make one of my top books of the year. What is true structure is: short chapters and years hopscotching back and forth. But, it’s ingenious, a serpentine path that would be confusing in lesser hands. Readers, her stitching of time and events is fierce, irascible, contorted, it works!This Norwegian noir chiller is an atmospheric suspense thriller, with lost hopes, missing persons, sadistic villains, and a tiger python named Nero, whose hisses are memorable, like whispered words. (Are snakes the only animal that needs no one for companionship?) Snakes have mastered the reboot; they shed their skins every few months, outgrow themselves, peel the hull from the vessel and exit left. Ulstein, in this impressive debut, creates a winding, twisted, crackling story about a protagonist who also sheds her skin, metaphorically, becomes a different person, legally, attempts to hide her heart in different places, to protect herself, appear invulnerable. For years, Liv trusted nobody but her snake, who, from the first, gave her the sense of “being suspended in midair above an abyss, an astonishingly pleasant sensation.”“It struck me that the snake skeleton was the essence of the human one. Apart from the head, the snake’s bone structure consisted exclusively of a backbone and ribs, not so different from the way a human skeleton looked from the waist up. Without limbs, snakes had mastered the spine.. …I tried to imagine what it would be like…to be nothing but a spine and reptilian brain and to slither slightly across the earth.”There’s a few flaws, after the denouement, where there was straight up schmaltz, which I rejected as being inconsistent with the rest of the narrative. How can the story unfold 90% with brutal neutrality and then switch abruptly to sharp sentimentality near the end? But I forgive these few blemishes, they almost seemed like trite afterthoughts to round out the story, but unnecessary. Despite these errors, I was riveted to every page, and never, ever got bored. Nero also gets a say, in the “reptile memoirs” chapters. “She was my only hope.

I just felt this “trus Days of Futures Past  From the first page, I was consumed, all in, content for the narrative to take me away wherever it went. I just felt this “trust,” or alignment with the author. The author who rose above the four narratives of this book, the four stories by men and women that are the sum of the parts that give us the whole. Fact and fiction overlap, and through these stories, the poignant truths have a way of appearing and resting in repose.It opens with a novel within the novel—a story called BONDS, by Harrold Vanner, written in 1937, in third person, about an early 20th century financier, one of those masters of the universe, Benjamin Rask, and his wife, Helen. Benjamin is wildly successful and Helen was a quiet woman who spent her time with cultural patronage, such as writers and musicians/composers. Andrew Bevel’s incomplete autobiography comes next, in MY LIFE (the second narrative). The third narrative is Ida Partenza’s memoir, and reveals how she is hired by Bevel to write his story. She’s a future published writer, daughter of an anarchist Italian immigrant, hired to help shape and write Bevel’s story.Bevel is widowed now, and wishes to set straight the story of his success, as well as his wife's quiet and “feminine” support and cultural benefaction. The way he expects Ida to capture it is almost mythical. In fact, these captains of industry and finance are practically mythological creatures themselves. After all—how does one man manage to control, move, and manipulate the market for “the common good” of all people? “Short selling is folding back time. The past making itself present in the future.”I won’t give spoilers, so I will circumvent trails that set upon the plot and path. But it was one of the most unusual designs/architecture of a story I have ever read. The underwhelming denouement is only a disappointment for a minute, because Diaz’ writing, themes, and emotional truth is what captivated me all along.The Bonds story evokes an Edith Wharton style and tone, matching the era that Benjamin Rask rose to power, the calm precision of sentences, the ambiguity we associate with artistic prose. As Ida describes, the writing “existed in a vague space between the intellectual and the emotional…Lucidity…is the best hiding space for deeper meaning---much like a transparent thing stacked between others.” Like much in this book, the reader will get the sense that the mysteries are hiding in plain sight. Or, as Andrew tells Ida:“If I’m ever wrong, I must make use of all my means and resources to bend and align reality according to my mistake so that it ceases to be a mistake.”Ida believed that Vanner’s presentation of Helen was largely illusory, and that Andrew Bevel’s version of Mildred was as equally deceptive, perhaps even sinister in its veil. Men taking charge of depicting their wives. Ida often hit Bevel’s nerve by suggesting clarity during his dictation to her. She also supposed that within the pages of both men’s narratives, the truth quivered. She just needed to probe, poke, prod, peer through the embellishments and reductions until the truth manifested itself.Diaz writes with such luster, refinement, and temperate ambiguity (when fitting) that I was riveted to the story. “…I’ve come to think one is truly married only when one is more committed to one’s vows than the person they refer to.” The magic of his writing blew me away, the ongoing paradoxes, his head above at all times, a dignity of prose that’s both natural and poised.“Can you believe it?

The heartbreaking duplicity fit right in with her father’s behavior and profession—a Tom Waits-y, Leonard Cohen-ish famous songwriter and singer who cheated on Emilia’s mother many times. He even stole lyrics that Emilia wrote when she was seven, and made it into his most famous and signature song. Now thirty-one (and beautiful), she feels unlovely as she makes her way to Rome by herself, a place she hasn’t visited since childhood. As betrayed as Emilia feels, she yet inhabits Rome in the most sensuous and sensual ways imaginable, gifting the reader with her natural charm and buoyancy, which readily flickers through her despondency. It's Emilia’a voice--both intimate and remote simultaneously. How? She’s artless and candid, a warm presence on the pages. She comes in layers, and we watch them peel away gradually as she walks the streets and piazzas of Rome. It’s been almost a decade since I visited Rome, and Emilia vividly brings it all back to me, so effortless does it seem. Francesca Giacco pumps fresh breath into this ancient city, blending the hills, paths, restaurants, shimmering sun and stone streets of Rome with the personal history of the protagonist, evoking magic and reverence. Emilia’s sorrows are delicately and stunningly rendered, her memories sharp and soft, paced and timed flawlessly. Her desultory moods and thoughts are also seamless images and perspectives. Emilia is a successful social media artist, while her mother paints pictures she never sells or gives away. Her brother, Jack, makes lots of money in a glass high-rise. Emilia’s life is given to us in poignant snaps and dips and tender shallows, all of it elegantly shattering. I could read this book again and again and cry in different places, and smile at the buttery sun, feel deepened by the magnificent sex. You will fall in love with her, it’s a love song to Emilia, and Giacco captures that ineffable essence of Rome.“The Tiber is a welcome sight. I grip a lamppost for a moment, extra stability, and stare at Saint Peter’s. Lit to glow, to suggest it never sleeps, gears of faith forever turning. I feel a weight could slowly be lifting, so gradually it seems there’s no movement at all.”...more",Notes are private!,2,13,1,"May 16, 2022","May 19, 2022","May 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58848149-six-days-in-rome

There’s plenty of potential in this tale of suspense and adventure. The island is historic and beautifully described, and the small cast of characters are colorfully depicted. However, there was a bit of a slow slog in the middle portion of the book. I enjoyed the day-to-day life on the island, but it periodically slowed to a crawl. Moreover, Vee, who had been married before, and is considered fairly cosmopolitan, possessed an implausible naïveté that was not credible.

At one time, some years ago, I glared when she was too self-aware. But now, with her latest book, I am deeply in love with her humanity and well-spring of ideas. The author’s word play was not performative, but rather explorative; I am wowed by its beauty and empathy. Ali Smith isn’t just a writer’s writer and reader’s reader; she may well be an empath. While reading COMPANION PIECE, I deep-dived into the spaces between words. Smith commands those white spaces by conveying a disarming wisdom. This story was of humankind itself. The prose, passages, paragraphs, pages—-they stretch out so that I see those spaces as openings, and fall through them. I cannot elucidate it with my own words, so I will use hers:“The trees spoke their language. The light and dark took turns. What I knew was my own absence. What I sensed, clear as ruined air, was the ghost of a chance, a different presence.”“a story is never an answer a story is always a question.”I used to think Ali Smith only wrote for the academically sophisticated crowds. But now I see that she writes for everyone—-lowbrow, middlebrow, highbrow, eyebrow…ok, she whispers to some, but to others it may be a yelp, a cry, a laugh, or a silent tear (in those white spaces). There is a sense of plot here, but the narrative strands circle around and back, which reminded me of David Foster Wallace’s structure (not story) in Infinite Jest. Things don’t have to begin and end on the pages, in the formal physical book. Smith kicks up a wind that turns into a vortex, and inside that vortex, the words and thoughts spin, and life circles infinitely. Her protagonist is Sandy Gray (a play on words right there!)—she is a queer artist that paints by overlaying words, letters, into an image. She’s way into her fifties now, been doing this a long time, and usually makes enough money to pay her bills. Her father has been in hospital for some time when the book opens. It’s during the pandemic, circa 2021, and he’s not sick with Covid (it’s a heart condition)—but pandemic rules apply. Sandy has been isolated for so long that, as the reader begins to understand, some events are real, but perhaps some arise from the surreal space of pandemic effects. It is often dreamlike, and non-linear. She receives a call from a former college classmate, a nodding acquaintance that once asked her to cheat for her. Now the acquaintance calls, all cringe-y familiar, and asks her for advice on an academic matter that created problems for her with airport security. The former classmate states she traveled with an antique lock and key, a Booth one. We also learn that this woman has twin daughters—well, one is non-binary. That’s its own world of mustering in the narrative.I don’t need to atomize this book for readers—in fact, I’m not that competent to do so.

I can do elegiac, but this is relentless, oppressive bitterness, with a few moments when I thought it would lift, and then I just felt the soot, the filth, the murk, the isolation of it all. It’s potent, like the manure that is described in the narrative, but the repetition of the protagonist, Samuel, went flat and blunt after a while. He had gotten paranoid, mentally weak, and a bit touched over these years that he was finally freed from a 25-year prison sentence, following a war of attrition in an unnamed African place that had been colonized, freed, and then ruled by a dictator. Samuel had left to be a lighthouse keeper and live on a sad island by himself. What mattered to him at this point?Samuel is getting old, he aches everywhere, probably from arthritis, and his memories aren’t pleasant. His only mercy was that he actually remembered them, but if I were him, I would rather forget the pitiful life led. He has guilt, regret, and sorrow for his decisions during a time of war, to his family, to his comrades, and to his honor, if there was any to lose. I felt suffocated while reading, and always soiled, as Jennings certainly painted the bleakest of portraits of a sewer-y place, a spongy-earthed, brackish island with mud and rocks in abundance, and depressing, wind-chilly weather. Things just rust here, and rot.The people described here, some dead, are not exciting or surprising. They are futile, lost souls. And reader, don’t look for redemption here, it’s not that kind of book. I am not sure who it actually “appeals” to, but the author is effective at prose and her characters are believable and even familiar in some ways, if you are depicting detestable, frightened casualties of the worst kinds of violence. Perhaps because of this slaughter that the Russians imposed on the Ukrainians, I’m having a hard time wanting to read or recommend this kind of book. This could be my own user error. These kinds of vivid but implacable fug-gy and swampy images got to me, after a while:“Its walls had crumbled, half the roof had fallen in. Inside were rotten wooden crates, empty bottles, rusted tins. Black words and images, scrawled in charcoal, filled the walls.” …”the shell of a tortoise…he wondered if the population had been eaten by smugglers and sailors, or whether it had been a pet of one of the slavers who had sailed these waters in the past, left behind to live on the island alone, and to die here, forgotten.” Death and incarceration as metaphor were never-ending in this tale, this sad allegory.But, at the same time, I trust Karen Jennings as a writer.

That is the central theme of this novel, explored via issues of identity—cultural and country--as well as through friendships, romantic ties, and family expectations. A desire to belong is inspired by the city of Seoul itself. Two main characters alternate narratives in a suspenseful, well-paced coming-of-age story that occasionally veers to “thriller” territory. Primarily set in Seoul, Wiley injected a sense of place that was by turns sensory, tangible, and ephemeral. Seoul also extends the target theme; the author lays out a city that, on the one hand, can be familiar in all its layout, and yet still be strange when immersed in it. How deeply can we connect with the people in our lives? How can we belong, be known, and yet savor our privacy?Min Ford is a Korean American from LA, and has always felt displaced in the States, so he moves to Seoul after college for a nice job with Samsung, helping Korean businessmen relate to American culture. He meets Yu-jin Kim, a young university student whose very conservative father is the Minister of Defense. Yu-jin lives in a carefully circumscribed world, designed by her father for her to achieve success, without veering from the rigid path. But, when Yu-jin gets to Seoul to attend Ewha Women’s University , a whole new world opens up, including two secret love affairs that are prohibited by her family—one would get in the way of success, her father would think, and the other would be an outrage to her family.Min and Yu-jin carry on a casual entanglement, no promises made except that it is understood that it will end when she graduates. Min is also intrigued by Yu-jin’s roommates, So-ra and Misaki (a Japanese student). So-ra and Yu-jin are besties, often inseparable. So-ra introduces Yu-jin into the world of the arts, a film course that Min decides to audit. Her father would veto this if he knew about it. Yu-jin discovers personal agency, and can’t seem to reconcile the life she wants with the life she is proscribed. She wants her parents’ approval, but realizes that she doesn’t want their life. We know early on that Yu-jin is dead, ostensibly by suicide. Min is shocked when he learns this, as she is found the day after they were together exploring the city. In his despair, he seeks to uncover the truth. Is it really suicide, or something more sinister? Her death begins to rule his life, his reason for carrying on. Grasping how little he knew her, Min is desperate now to understand her more deeply, posthumously, as he wanders the city in a mournful haze. He’s never met her family, but is determined to mine what role they may have played in her death. HE doesn’t believe Yu-jin would kill herself.Wiley paces out his story gradually but at an even clip, alternating between Min’s, third person pov, and Yu-jin’s first person pov. Wily lures the reader into both their worlds, especially Yu-jin’s, by drawing out her last years with a measured intensity. At times, there was a bit too much exposition, which strained the narrative; I could see the author behind the curtain, laboring unnecessarily. However, I was compelled by the nuanced layers, peeling away to expose a universal truth about struggle, and about the expression of Han:“’it’s a feeling of sorts. A kind of collective despair in response to being conquered and oppressed for long periods of time, over generations. To choose your own destiny—that’s what an individual, a nation, craves most. Han is a result of that most basic desire being crushed.’”Thank you kindly to Dutton for sending me a copy for ....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,May 2022,"May 04, 2022","May 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58678505-when-we-fell-apart

Dave is a Doomsday PreppWays the World Could End appeals to the inner doomsday of our bruised souls, and the roadmap to repairing our crushed hearts. Dave is a Doomsday Prepper (yes, it’s a thing!) and a high-functioning widow with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Or, as Dave would drily call it, The Label. His daughter, Cleo, is 15 and lonely for her mother, Jana, who died over a year ago. They live in the hills of San Juan Capistrano in southern Cali (a gorgeous place, if you’ve never been there), on a property far from anyone else. They love each other, but Dave’s impairment on recognizing emotions puts a few knots in their relationship. If you’ve ever wanted to understand the functionality of someone with autism, well, Hooper nails it! “…preppers are not only concerned with the apocalypse; they are concerned with preparing for any and all events that would have a major impact on a family’s life. In other words, it’s not just The End of The World they care about; it’s The End of The World As We Know It.”Each chapter builds on the last one, with sub-header sections that are compact and alternate between Dave and Cleo. As Dave gives us fun facts about the sexuality of giraffes or discusses the earth’s magnetic field (to name a few), and continues to stock his Doomsday bunker in the basement, you start understanding him more, and rooting for his success, for both of them to achieve rewards. At first, there seems to be only one thing tethering Cleo to Dave, and that’s Jana. The awkward father-daughter pair are forced to search deeper, though, in order to themselves feel complete. Initially, I wasn’t sure if I would connect with this story. The opening pages threatened to connote a YA narrative, or perhaps a too-giddy one, as it had a hysterical tinge to the voice. However, that all went away as the pages flew, and I realized how authentic and contagious this novel actually is, and how it grows on you in each successive chapter. Hooper has a flair for conveying Dave’s temperament. Funny, with a side of sad. Cleo’s story is a neurotypical teen girl’s coming of age, with some twists, but Dave IS a twist!Dave is unable to relate to the things that are missing in Cleo’s life, except, of course, her mother. And even that shared gap is stunted by Dave’s flat manner of connecting, the way he is wired to perceive and respond. What Cleo needs is a more contemporary relatable. She has her sidekick, Carter, plus a female role model at school, a counselor who actively listens and gives comfort. Then enters Eden, the new friend, the one moving in across the way. Two adventurous, thoughtful, reflective girls with a dynamite wit. Their relationship brings out the reader’s wanting side, the part of us who aims high and with a smile. Remember that time before you got jaded? Dave doesn’t need other people outside his unit of two. New people and situations provoke his anxiety. He just wants to get on with it—love the one person who he loves, be angry at certain folks, and stay within his circumscribed routine. And he tries to understand that Cleo is very unlike him. Cleo and Dave have some growing to do; life has recently been about grieving Jana’s absence. There has to be a way to mend, move on, and dial up the fun a bit. But when Dave finds out he will have new neighbors, his anxiety spikes. Is he his own worst enemy, or is he just being the dad trying to protect his daughter from catastrophe? Cleo wants emotional connection, romance, a future.WAYS THE WORLD COULD END is not without a familiar formula in its broad strokes. But I’ll take it, because it is wily, witty, and infectious. It was refreshing and honest, especially when Dave’s awkwardness betrays him during key moments in the narrative, and Cleo’s disarming little rebellions. It’s gentle, humorous, with a few dark moments that caught me off guard. “…I am predispositioned to being a neglectful husband and father…And though I can blame The Label for certain things, I still have to do what I can to improve, and sooner rather than later. Because there are so many ways the world could end.” 4.5 rounded upThank you to Keylight Books and the Turner Publishing Company for sending me a galley to .

She trusts the reader’s intelligence and doesn’t lead us forcefully or manipulatively. Her style is to reveal rather than to insist, and I felt I was reading within a radiance, or rarefied air, and it truly transported me. There’s a sense of the mystical and a tearing of the time seam, a blip, or a lacuna, and you slip inside and it’s a dazzling created world. It’s provocative and yet delicate. I would describe it as clean, lean, stark, sensory, and lasting. I could read it multiple times, it’s written with such clarity and yet also with enigmatic vitality. Speculative fiction without all the sci-fi technology descriptions. I nearly vibrated with the perfect pitch of it; the narrative just sings, like a soft but resonant aria. The question of timelines is explored from the 20th century to the 25th. There are three domed moon colonies that we colonize hundreds of years into the future—one of them is economically depressed, in a sense-- the Night Colony, a moon where the sky stays dark, due to a broken artificial lighting decision. The title refers to “the silent flatlands, near where the Apollo 11 astronauts had landed in a long-ago century.” In the future, in some hundreds of years later, some people are born and die without ever seeing Earth. Unlike a typical sci-fi novel, the author doesn’t concern herself with all the details of how they made moons habitable, just some. Yet the atmosphere still feels otherworldly. She captures it without weighing it down.If you read the author’s last two novels—The Glass Hotel, and Station Eleven, and then read this, you’ll see the threads that reach across them. From Glass Hotel, you may now see Vincent’s fate differently (in Sea of Tranquility). All my nerves prickled in this narrative, the way questions are answered, implied, speculated on, or winked at—in the past, present, and future. In all three novels, there are connecting filaments. I think this is her best yet, the consummate reader’s novel.The liminal spaces are filled with mystery, and an intentional gap. An exiled British gentleman in 1912 moves to Canada, and hears haunting violin music in a forest, an electrifying moment that seems out of time. What is that flash of darkness, and blinding light, which harkens back to Glass Hotel, and Vincent’s video? What is that whoosh? “What it was like to leave Earth: a rapid ascent over the green-and-blue world, then the world was blotted out all at once by clouds. The atmosphere turned thin and blue, the blue shaded into indigo, and then — it was like slipping through the skin of a bubble — there was black space.”A lonely character named Gaspery-Jacques Roberts has a mission, and his mission is related to Time, and investigated through rips in the Time fabric. Then there’s the writer, Olive Llewellyn, a protagonist in 2201 who wrote a novel, Marienbad, about the aftermath of a pandemic. Now she’s famous and critically celebrated, on a book tour, when a true pandemic hits! During the lockdown, she delivers “holographic” lectures on post-apocalyptic literature, and tours via a zoom-like manner. Sounds like Olive may be based on Mandel, who wrote this during the Covid pandemic. Elegantly referred to—when an author can portray herself so creatively, a wizard with projecting herself. (I tend to scream when an author is too on the nose, and names a character after her/himself). She does it without an ounce of self-indulgence! Are we living in a simulation? Do multiverses exist? Do different times exist simultaneously, and intersect? Many metaphysical questions streamed into my consciousness while reading. Periodically, I felt that Mandel accessed the collective unconscious with a galactic force that truly did rip the fabric of time. “We might reasonably think about the end of the world as a continuous and never-ending process.”Mandel has always blended the urgency and beauty of art with sickness that causes widespread mortality. Perhaps the nature of art is its endurance through the worst of human suffering. I felt the stirrings of hope, even when facing the end of the world. Art is continuous, resides outside of Time, gives us meaning, and the sense that even when the world is ending, it is also beginning....more",Notes are private!,5,46,1,"Apr 14, 2022","Apr 18, 2022","Apr 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility

Still aspiring, but getting there. Now, I’m not talking about plot (but there are some overlapping themes), and Songsiridej has a few steps to go to reach their utter brilliance of executing story, but I know that she will get there. This is her debut, which impressed and often riveted me; I have a strong sense that this author has a successful career ahead of her. This story of identity, boundaries, and the journey and search to fulfillment on all fronts is a winner, with a few flaws that mostly stayed out of the way.The unnamed narrator and protagonist is a thirty-year-old struggling novelist, queer, biracial (Asian and Caucasian, although that doesn't much enter into the story on the surface), living with her best friend (also a toiling writer) and former college roommate, Annie. They have gone down every adult path together. They aren’t lovers, and they both consider themselves queer, and their shared sense of adventure is infectious. When the narrator entangles herself with a man, a fifty-year-old wealthy dance choreographer, Annie struggles to understand, and tensions between them rouse. The identity of their queerness together is threatened, Annie believes. She can't wrap her head around her friend's attraction to a man, which causes problems in the women's relationship.The two friends live near Boston (Somerville), and the choreographer has two homes that take hours to get there—NYC and a place in the Berkshires. So, to visit the choreographer, the writer spends the weekends. I love how Songsiridej demonstrated the best friends’ relationship to be just as compelling as the one between the narrator and choreographer. To spice and complicate things even more, there’s the choreographer’s main dancer, a woman who the writer is attracted to, also. And the choreographer stands ready to exercise that, but not how you may think!The push-pull on both sides causes the protagonist growing anguish. And the reader feels it. Beyond that, there is sexiness and drama and drama-role-play-sex between the choreographer and writer. Is she going down a dangerously explosive path? Is the choreographer pulling a grenade pin on her? That’s a question I kept asking while reading. The unnamed narrator (as Kitamura has done) demonstrates her lack of self-identity, as well as how she doesn't name the choreographer. She’s not so much every woman as she is no one, lost in the choreographer’s desires, and drowning in her own. “When he first saw me, he didn’t react, my identity failing to register” is an example of the theme. Also, he mostly calls her Little Rabbit or Rabbit, his chosen identity for her.There's also the power of his status, his elegant stature, his body, and his willingness to support the writer in her ambition. His devotion terrifies her. ""Money and power and sex and devotion. ...I played with the four words like marbles.""There’s also a meta- moment or two, which I liked, the author exposing herself through her story, without it being distracting or intrusive. During a scene together, it is noted that Annie has always considered herself a writer of life, while the narrator is a writer of ideas. Songsiridej is absolutely a strong writer of ideas in this book. But she also shared that the protagonist, with her ideas, and concepts, sometimes has difficulty with the plot, making it work the way Annie’s does. And, perhaps this book, too, is occasionally stronger with ideas, themes, character, than with plot. There are a few moments, especially near the end, where the plot is executed in a stagy way. The storytelling isn’t a problem—it’s the execution at those times, so it feels a bit awkward or hammy. But, fortunately, the rest was so strong that I wasn’t too bothered. A few growing pains, sure, but I'm still thinking about this novel. As resonant and sensuous as it gets. Never bored, never once, it was a page-turner for me. One other note: I liked how Songsiridej created her male character as a choreographer (and former dancer), as his character facilitates the theme of space-- the boundaries as ever mindful with a dancer.Although I rate it 4 stars, it is a superb 4 stars.

I was immediately absorbed in her ability to craft a well-paced, layered, and multi-charactered murder mystery. She is spine-chilling, serious, witty, and literary. Her talent for detail and plot-shaping is never to be underestimated, and unlike “genre” mystery writers, she pays attention to every primary, secondary, and tertiary character. SOMETHING TO HIDE is something else! George took on the forbidden practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) that still goes on in certain London communities, by focusing on a murder victim, Teo Bontempi, who was a police officer, and her family. Moreover, she presented the Bankole family, teetering on the edge of setting up their eight-year-old daughter, Simi, for the criminal procedure. Lynley and Havers are practically secondary characters. That is how George shines. She knows that, to make a series productive, the main investigators of a series necessarily have to take a back seat to the crime and characters at hand. She swept me up into her story once again, master storyteller that she is.There are plentiful prongs, characters, and just enough subplots and side-plots to keep you engrossed and knotted. Nothing predictable here, as usual. I’ve learned not to try and figure out George’s conclusions before the finale; she will keep you guessing in suspense and tense admiration of her complex plot and formidable cast. Manifa Bankole, the mother of Simi and a boy teen, Tani, kept me dancing on the head of a pin, she did! How she navigates her Nigerian culture within a Western community shows her as a flawed, frightened hostage of an abusive husband and her own self-perpetuating ideology. The entire Bankole family will remain resonant in literary figures that impress me. Teo’s sister, Rosie, is another unforgettable woman, one cloaked in mystery and stealth. Wilson Nkata, now a consequential Detective Sergeant partnering with Barbara Havers and (the now) Acting Detective Superintendent Thomas Lynley. Their private lives play key roles in the themes of men wanting women to feel what they project onto them. The themes also encompass culture and identity, and the outdated, ordered rituals that keep women in second tier by family, society, and even themselves. George transcends the usual ticked boxes on racial issues by weaving the very fabric of their different cultures and upbringings. You won’t read anything reductive or eye-rolling, pandering or preaching. This book is a labyrinth that will maintain its hold on you until the very end.

In each era, a magnet high school drama teacher, Tyrus Densmore, is central to the story. Densmore is directing a stage version of Anne Frank in the 1980s in his entitled Annex; most of the cast members figure into the current times, also, where Anne Frank is again being directed—this time by one of the earlier cast members. Cyclorama—the theater stage suggesting unlimited space, is meta- inspired 40 years later. Densmore, now in his 70s, has some history he does not want revealed. In this cloistered space, where Langer does a superb job of creating the insular zone of a theater, drama unfolds, twists inward and outward, cycles around and circles back, from the eighties to now. But even more central than the damaged, disturbing Densmore, are the Franks and the other inhabitants who shared their hidden space for two years before being discovered by the Nazis. And, like a theater, the rules of using the space included silence for the many hours that they could be overheard, the insulation and rules for that space, and, #1—how Anne Frank’s diary propels, even today, the importance of chronicling our stories, and the power those stories have to change the world.How are the teens in two productions of Anne Frank connected so intensely to one theater director? Well, Densmore has the power to destroy lives. He isn’t Hitler, of course, but he is a deviant force, a charismatic figure that is responsible for generational trauma and the manipulation of many. Densmore brandishes his malevolence on a much smaller scale than Hitler. On the world stage, Hitler had horrifying influence, and for a long time, got away with amoral, murderous deeds. Evil comes in many forms, both small and large, but the stories that live on for eternity can contain the power to heal. Densmore’s fate, as the reader will see, lies in the hands of those that tell their stories. Or does it?“They were all survivors, weren’t they? Anne Frank said that what had been done couldn’t be undone, but the point was to make sure it never happened again. The poor girl had been wrong, though, hadn’t she? It just kept happening, over and over again.” Can the cycle be broken?Langer’s nuanced and achingly beautiful novel astonished me at every turn. I have a theater background (amateur, of course) that began in high school, so I was immediately drawn to these searching teens. Growing up (Jewish), The Diary of Anne Frank was one of my all-time favorite books. The desire to persevere, to determine my life and my narrative, to honor survival amid destruction—Anne’s relatable and personal wishes to enjoy love, to see light—is universal, ubiquitous.

TyleUnlike the Anne Tyler aficionados that I know, I’ve only read five of her books, but thoroughly enjoyed every one, especially Accidental Tourist. Tyler is queen of the subtle but strongly themed stories about family dynamics, primarily set in Baltimore. This, too, is about the weaving of family wins and woes, highs and lows that are both unique and familiar to each generation. Not much has to happen for her books to shine; however, I do believe that this one was inconsistent in execution. At the end I felt more satisfied than not, but was ready for it to be over.It starts in 2010, a short chapter that introduced one of the main family’s members, Serena. It then kicks back to 1959, a dad and mom, Robin and Mercy, and their two teenage daughters and young son. Here’s where it gets unbelievable, and I’ll be as specific as possible without spoiling. They consider the fifteen-year-old, Lily, as too boy-crazy, and rightly don’t allow her boyfriend on their week-long trip to the lake. Yet……Yet, when they arrive at the lake, Lily meets a 21-year-old man, Trent, with a car, and she is bowled over. Robin and Mercy don’t even vet him, or check out the story of his parents, who are supposedly close by. Robin and Mercy are not affectionate, no, but they aren’t strung out on drugs, either. They rightly didn’t allow her age-appropriate boyfriend to come, or to buy Lily a bikini for the trip, but a 21-year-old can just take off with her in a strange place on their first family vacation? This blatant oversight was bizarre.They ask Trent no interrogative questions except, “Are you a good driver, son?” and that’s it. And trust his answer! THAT IS IT! They allow Lily to spend every day, all day with him. So, this took me clear out of the story, because I know that there was nothing else to suggest this kind of misguided scene(s). Yes, the parents were emotionally unavailable, but they weren’t overtly unaccountable and unaware what a man wants who pursues a 15-year-old girl! But it wasn't even addressed, so we as readers were supposed to find this credulous.What parents in 1959 (or 2022, for that matter) would allow their 15-year-old daughter to take off with a 21-year-old man they don’t know, and not even ask him any questions?! I almost quit the story right then. I'm glad I finished it, as her character development and themes eventually engaged me. But much of the dialogue was stilted and seemed more like Anne Tyler mimicking Anne Tyler but not doing a very good job of it. It was insincere and Nacy Drew-ish, with too much, “Shall I tell them, dear?”-type dialogue, and straining to sound genuine. Fortunately, the latter half of the book was more nuanced, and I began to engage more deeply with the story. It was apparent that Robin and Mercy weren’t great role models, as they didn’t know how to show love, but, yet, they are reflective of more families than we may think. The aim of the book caught my heart, but the execution was inconsistent. The aspect of the story I loved concerned the perpetual interweaving of generations in families, like a French braid, with woven skeins of hair. Both Robin and Mercy could be cold to their children and even each other, but not realize it. They were not very self-aware. The children can’t wait to get away, try their own hand at rebooting their lives as adults, “…that’s how families work, too. You think you’re free of them, but you’re never really free; the ripples are crimped in forever.” “Little kindnesses.”“And little cruelties.”Thank you to Knopf publishers for sending me a finished copy to . ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Mar 14, 2022","Mar 17, 2022","Mar 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58065401-french-braid

All I knew about the family was that Booth was a stage actor. Actually, nothing about his family came to mind. But now, wow! I feel intimately close to his brothers and sisters, his parents. John Wilkes is not the main character in Fowler’s brimming character study of the Booths, and the author nailed it by choosing this way to deliver her story. There isn’t one family member that I don’t feel I can talk about with familiarity now, so deep did the author mine her story, her cast. Booth’s father was one of the most celebrated Shakespearean stage actors of his time, until one of his sons took up the mantle. The entire novel is Shakespearean, the way Fowler structured it, threaded throughout with lines from his plays showing up on the page in the exact right moments. This is a powerhouse of a great American novel. A great American tragedy.Another element that pulled me in was the old-fashioned third person POV, yet there was nothing fusty about this narrative. It felt fresh, with knowing parallels to today’s times, as well as particular character traits that almost had me believing that Fowler lived with the Booths! From Maryland, to Philadelphia, NYC, Richmond, London, and other settings, I felt that, no matter where the setting, I felt the insular, insulated feeling of the family, how the tight-knit brood kept others out, even when celebrated and well known in polite and high-toned society. There was a detached attitude to almost everyone outside the family; no matter how broad the travels and influence, the author showed how sequestered they were, how inside themselves they remained, no matter how social or cosmopolitan. The brothers and sisters—even Mother--had their favorites and expectations. Moreover, at their secretive heels, ghosts were constantly nipping. There were those that died as babies, and never stopped haunting Mary Ann, the matriarch. Births and deaths were momentous. One baby’s death: “There were no bouts of uncontrollable weeping, only an endless stream of silent tears. It was as if Frederick had taken her spirit along with him when he went, leaving only a Mother-shaped husk behind.” Or a birth: “Edwin is the family’s seventh child and…arrived with his caul still over his face. The caul has been saved in a small box in her mother’s cupboard. It has the feel of a well-worn handkerchief.”This is no saga—BOOTH is a momentous and character-driven story that will hold you in its grip from start to finish. Even history buffs will fall prey to the exciting and nuanced narrative, despite knowing the climax. But, is the assassination the only climax in this book? There’s more to this intrepid story than John Wilkes Booth, a peripheral character in his own story.Thank you for the free/gifted book from Putnam @PutnamBooks #partner...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Mar 07, 2022","Mar 13, 2022","Mar 07, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58502673-booth

She maintained that art is “turning nothing at all into something beautiful,” and hammered artists who sold out. Leaving the house to run an errand one day, Sol’s father never came back. Sol’s mother and grandmother never got along, so he was raised among constant conflict. We learn a bit of background in the opening pages; at this time, Sol was in his early thirties and fed up with his shallow, materialistic wife and life, including his own bad attitude. He got an in-person invitation to join an artist’s colony, The Coded Garden, far away from home. He accepted it, primarily because his life was currently empty and meaningless. He knew nothing and no one of where he was going. Lessons Sol learned from working at Pale advertising: “I was trained at the black ops boot camp to write in alliterative sentences, ever seeking the clever and the wry…the flat language of conformity and commerce, of self-actualization and self-esteem. A language that descended precipitously from Esalen to advertising to journalism to politics, pooling and cooling in the common American lexicon, where it rests now, stagnant and stinking.”The first part of the narrative is mostly satirical, dry, sudden, droll, absurdist. That’s a lot to do with Karolina Klein, who took no prisoners and held few things sacred, as well as knowing how to command power and manipulate others. It was “her refusal to modify language or subject…It was her wildness, her toughness, a perspective and humor that only suffering and abject terror can provide.” As she said, ‘”Against a survivor of the Holocaust, you cannot win.’” Almost every concept, thought, or creative drive that Sol had was a result of his Baba Klein’s persuasive authority. The story flips back and forth between the present and the past, which includes a past relationship that Sol has failed to reconcile.I haven’t even gotten to the Coded Garden yet, where most of the action and adventure takes place. The place was physically beautiful, a true Garden of Eden. I will leave most of this for the reader to uncover and discover. The director, Sebastian Light, is a cipher-like self-proclaimed leader of truth, beauty, and art. Even his name is pretentious. It’s hard to take him seriously, as he speaks and teaches in such clichéd language, a language that Sol understands and despises. Is Sebastian a legerdemain? I fault whoever wrote the blurb on the book for comparing him to Trump. That wasn't necessary. I think an overt parallel (or even a subtext of Trump) was wrong-footed for the story. It hamstrung it because it put a limit on imagination. There are a lot of men out there that share some of the basic traits of Trump, but it felt to me that the comparison was more aspirational, not relevant, and it interfered with that social contract between writer and reader. I am trying to be circumspect here. This central figure should have been more organically alarming. But it was too busy mimicking. I know that Maksik is capable of creating a character who is both villain and authentic, with provocative details. Sebastian Light often came across (purposely) as silhouette more than person, which could have been expanded on. Instead the satire falls flat because the character doesn't have genuine lift-off.The narrative becomes a lot more serious, with a touch of snarl, as the novel progresses further into part two, (part two is the majority of the book). I think Maksik handicapped himself with Sebastian, who was too shameless and odious to fool anyone. Were they fooled, the participants at this beautiful garden? Or would we sell our souls for room, board, and free feedback? A place to paint and all materials supplied? Maksik’s prose--his aphorisms and metaphors, wooed me, and Karolina Klein captivated me. Much of the Coded Garden adventure could do with more drafts; it didn’t feel ready for prime time to me.I think part two could have been more nuanced if the author had not encumbered himself. There are some other cagey characters such as Siddartha, a chiseled, body-perfect artist who befriends Sol. The other artists helped fill in the scene for the theme, but nobody stuck out as wow-ing me. The theme? What is art v noise, what is reality v fantasy—paradigms that slip into satire, and then gravitas added as a component. At times, it is both absurd and deadly serious. At others, a bit wobbly. The art colony story fell a bit flat for me. It would make an interesting companion book to Red Pill, by Hari Kunzru.Part three regenerated it for me, why my assessment is rounded up to 4 stars. You don’t know any finality until the very last line, which all boils down to Maksik’s use of language, tenses. Conjugate THAT! Brilliant, show-stopping but subtly commanding finish--- I’m still musing on it. The whole is better than the sum of its parts but some of its parts were surprising. Of course, without the context of the rest of the book, the last line won’t mean anything. But, as its conclusion, it jarred me, held me in a vise. I SCREECHED and I needed a personal debriefing! It was the incorruptible side of Maksik’s writing.If you are a Maksik fan, go for it. I’m glad I read it. But, if you’ve never read him before, start with You Deserve Nothing.

I was seeking aDuring these terror-filled days, I need a novel that will excite me, but in a calmer way than speculative fiction and disaster novels. I was seeking an environment of peaceful, everyday citizens. This novel came along at the perfect time! I have read several Huneven novels happily, and I knew she had the chops for a novel of manners. She captured the languid tempo of the unincorporated area of Altadena (about 30 minutes from LA). Setting, theme, pastoral vibe, and has a Middlemarch mood. But it claims its own story. A search committee selecting the next minister at a Unitarian Universalist (UU) church discovers how their different personalities clash or engage as they negotiate decisions. Moreover, the narrator, a writer, has a divergent or secret agenda—a less surface reason for joining the committee. Can eight people from Gen Z to aging Boomer agree on a candidate? The search outward presses on the need for a search inward.Readers are taken inside into the social contract of these diverse people; that’s where the drama arises from. Who would have thought that the search for a new minister at a UU church could be compelling even when, in our real lives, a madman is on the loose invading Europe, but it is. I escaped and fell into Altadena and the characters. For those not sure what a UU church is, it serves a spiritual quest rather than a religious one. There’s no creed or dogma, and has a liberal, progressive agenda toward social justice. SEARCH is a page-turner that inspired me to ask myself poignant moral questions about accepting others’ points of view and connecting with people so different from myself. I was all in in this bucolic place, the rolling pastureland, with farm animals, and a deep dive into personality. The etiquette and attitudes were key. The narrator, Dana Potowski, is a talented and modestly successful writer of several books—memoirs, recipes—although she is able to live an undisturbed life with her husband, Jack, their dog, Bunchie, and a few donks. She’s in her early fifties, childless, a restaurant er, too. She attended seminary school over 20 years ago, but with two paths before her—writing or becoming a minister, she decided on writing. Still nostalgic, she decides that she will write a book about her year on the search committee. The food ed by Dana or cooked by others made me hungry, too. I was also glad that she saved the recipes for after the final page, rather than interspersing them throughout the narrative. She keeps her agenda a secret from the others on the committee.Huneven’s narrative is about the year they spent meeting and selecting their new senior minister. Yes, it is filled with plenty of quotidian drama and personal upheavals—it feels intimate, organic, sometimes tense. The search committee working together brings out the best and worst of each other and themselves. The candidates are also intriguing. Jennie, the Gen Z on the committee, has fierce ideas for electing a female minister, instead of the standard “old White men.” Although all agree that the senior minister should be someone that reflects the diversity of life, the ingredients for what kind of person they need creates frequent flare-ups. Fractures and factions erupt, and every little drama is a new surprise. The conflicts that arise are mostly due to generational gaps rather than spiritual differences, although a little of that comes into play, too. And, oh, boy, those generation gaps can be utterly intense. This is a character-driven novel with lots of sizzling dialogue and introspection—convincing, authentic, and not one false note.A huge thanks to Penguin Press for sending me an ARC to ....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Feb 28, 2022","Mar 04, 2022","Feb 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58636923-search

In the digital age, in the near future in her latest, Candy House, Time can be recorded, saved, memorialized in new and stunning ways that may delight or horrify you. People are divided on this, or occasionally divided within their own selves. Candy House, like Goon Squad, is a work of speculative fiction, and takes place in the past, present, and near future, and shares many of the same characters. I can’t remember most characters in a book I read a dozen years ago. What I recall is that the music industry is the vehicle that Egan used to present her themes in GS. This time, she went full-on Black Mirror, where memories and the unconscious can be saved or retrieved with specific digital platforms that have been created. Time copied and uploaded, using conductor leads or implants or a weevil-looking tech substance (inside people), essentially. These platforms open up a moral question of whether it is kosher to “Own Your Unconscious” (the name of the platform created by entrepreneur Bix Bouton) or should you let sleeping dogs lie. You can use the Collective Consciousness to solve a mystery, close a case.“‘The collective is like gravity. Almost no one can withstand it. In the end, they give it everything. And then the collective is that much more omniscient.’”There isn’t a main character—it’s more ensemble cast. Time frame varies, events/stories don’t linger on just one year or decade. The brilliance of Egan is how she structures the narrative. The text is its own mirror, or the closest to it, of how any individual person experiences their own consciousness. We move through linear time, right? But, actually, as we accumulate experiences, our thoughts—and add dreams to that!—our full consciousness, from our first-person POV (the only way that I is I), does not move linearly. Our bodies do, but our minds, as we go through linear, physical tasks all day long—our minds whorl. We may be thinking 30 or 300 things at a time. Our inner life. And Egan is a true artist, like a Jungian artist of the mind. If I had read GS right before reading CH, I’d be moved by more connections. But Egan is gifted, and that meta- fact alone is part of the invisible aspect of the story structure. It is a reflection of an individual’s consciousness, all the layers, transposed to the page. This includes shared experience (such as, readers recalling both books).Nobody can truly connect in all that layered gauze, all 30 or 300 layers of them. When we find friends and lovers, we tacitly agree to connect on a number of these levels. Sometimes, depending on how transactional it is, it could be just one. That person may be a straw person in our lives, and vice versa. It’s a wonder we manage to connect! Anyway, that is the main thrust of this story, to me. Rather than being too much of a meaningful story about any one character (there were so many, I just felt she splintered the story like that on purpose), but rather, the novel itself was an agent—an agent of our conscious and unconscious selves. Reading it made me think about how many things I think about, or am creating, or planning—on hundreds of different levels, for every millisecond that I am alive. For Egan and for readers who read these books relatively close together, they are sharing an experience of “knowing,” and therefore the reveal of someone’s father, or one character assaulting another, for example--these mean different things to different readers, depending on their knowledge of the Egan-spectrum of these two bookended books. Let’s say you forgot most of GS or never read it. Then you read this as a stand-alone and have a variation of conscious and unconscious gathering of experience. Of course, every reader experiences any book individually. But Egan laid the novel out to parallel the transcendent but also opaque properties of human limitations--and boundlessness. To me, the anatomy of Candy House is human consciousness itself. You can’t present it in a pure form, but Egan sure did an artistic gambit! She achieved what she set out to do.Her prose is vigorous, her metaphors muscular, and her themes sublime. I especially relished the author’s take on the ramifications of all these minds and memories recorded, how it affects other industries on nuanced levels, and writing! The end of writing novels! Uploading all of everything posed an existential threat to fiction and non-fiction. You’ll understand it on a gripping and wholistic level once you read the book. ""Nothing is free!  Only children expect otherwise even as myths and fairy tales warn us: Rumpelstiltskin, King Midas, Handsel and Gretel. Never trust a candy house!  It was only a matter of time before someone made them pay for what they thought they were getting for free. Why could nobody see this?""Despite these dazzling features, I felt that the blizzard of content overwhelmed me at times, to the point of rendering the narrative, or perhaps me, inert. With dozens of characters and their stories, overlapping like so many Venn diagrams, there were times I felt fragmented under so much weight. And maybe that was the point. But I could have used a bit more story, and less stories. It took me longer to read than I expected; each reading required going back a few paragraphs to pick up where I left off. However, Egan never ceased to amaze me with her imagination and brilliance.Thank you to Scribner/Simon & Schuster for sending me an early copy to .#CandyHouse...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Feb 21, 2022","Feb 24, 2022","Feb 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58437521-the-candy-house

The made-up lands she creates are part myth, part fable, a sense of “other” while also being familiar. It takes no time to be installed in her sensually portrayed enclaves. The author’s imagination is vivid and ominous, precise and indefinable. It kept me bound to the narrative, from start to finish.Here is here, and everywhere beyond is “elsewhere.” The streets in ELSEWHERE have vaguely German names, and the town is a valley part of the high mountains. Any higher and you’re in the clouds. Periodically, at no discernible interval, a mother (usually of young children) disappears—it is the town’s “affliction.” Up, up in the clouds, to elsewhere from here. And it hangs over like an albatross. Are you a good enough mother to stay? That’s the premise and the hook here, in this story. Vera, the protagonist, is a deeply felt and feeling character, the sensitive mother of Iris and wife of Peter, the dentist. It’s her story, her eyes we see this tale through. Vera and all her peers and friends she’s known since birth live here, isolated from the rest of the world. They shop at the Op, which is a store that resembles lan estate sale emporium. However, in this allegory, it is a haunting place, full of the material things that mothers leave behind when they vanish. There’s also a ritual burning; the mothers’ photos perish in flames. So, this narrative is built around this remote, time-resistant community. Here, you have been taught your potential fate from the cradle, in all sorts of implicit and explicit ways.One day a stranger, Ruth, comes to visit. Her eccentric behaviors both intrigue and repulse some of the women in the town. Vera experiences a push-pull toward Ruth, a curiosity and empathy. When the stranger eventually departs, it isn’t pretty, but it is poetic and disquieting. It becomes a pivotal, liminal juncture for Vera, who gradually seeks to unlock the essential mysteries of her life.The tone/rhythm matches the fairytales we grew up with, a certain evanescence, a figurative quality, a morality tale with the potential of distilling into a cautionary tale. The middle part of the book crept at a more dilatory pace, but the prose, mystery, and opaque atmosphere kept me intrigued. The final revelations are both unexpected and inevitable. “Something happened here that happened no place else. We didn’t know why it happened, or how. We didn’t demand answers from it because our affliction itself had taught us that you cannot wrest answers from a mystery. We submitted to it.”A huge thank you to Celadon for sending me an ARC to read and .#CeladonReads #partner@CeladonReads...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Feb 15, 2022","Feb 18, 2022","Feb 15, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58725012-elsewhere

Even though we know the killer before meeting the characters, this novel is every bit as gut-wrenching and nail-biting as any whodunnit. In fact, this portrait of working-class struggle is a tense, ominous, and gripping literary thriller, I can’t get it out of my head. The central events occur close to Halloween, as the weather turns cold and the wind rises. There’s a tang of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in the air, a parallel to thirteen-year-old Marie’s favorite book.Ocean State takes place in a small Rhode Island town, Ashaway, an hour from where I grew up in Massachusetts. The primary focus is on a Portuguese American family. I grew up in a factory/mill town of first and second-generation Portuguese families, and came to appreciate their culture and community, which is sprinkled in lively ways throughout the book—the food, the fados. When O’Nan introduced the Oliveira family--mother Carol, a divorced nurse’s aide, and her two teenage daughters, book smart Marie and wild and wily Angel, a senior in high school, I felt them intimately, like they were in my living room. O’Nan never judges; he takes you into the hearts and lives of the people he writes about. The men in OS are at best generic and passive. The females are the dramatic protagonists, and the forces to be reckoned with. O’Nan’s ability to capture the female essence and sensibilities is stunning.The primary plot focuses on a love triangle between Angel, her wealthy boyfriend, Myles, and Birdy, a peer of Angel’s who is besotted with Myles. Both Birdy and Angel are popular, but in different cliques. As tensions mount, so does escalating danger. The era for all the drama is 2009, the fallout of the financial crisis. The mills have all been closed down, and many of the primary employees were Portuguese immigrants and their children, the largest population affected by the closing of the mills. Carol uses her now fading good looks to attract men (often losers) to lift her up. She hops from one guy to the next, drinks too much, and largely misunderstands the extent which Angel and Marie are damaged by her choices. Marie, the chubby academic striver, often resents her mother, and is jealous of her beautiful older sister, who she also dearly loves. When Angel is away, she snoops through her stuff, often finding things that intensify the arc of the story. Angel fears a dead end after high school, especially aware that Myles will follow his monied friends to college. She is desperately holding onto him, despite the fissures developing in their bond.Carol weakly aims to eke out some degree of stability, but is too self-absorbed to notice all the cracks. Her ex-husband, the girls’ father, is an inconsistent role model, often displaying puerile and impulsive behaviors. Carol’s widowed mother is still in the picture, and copes with her empty life by drinking and chain-smoking. Carol has a new beau again, and she moves her family into one of the abandoned homes on River Road, near the dank river and the deserted Line & Twine mill, where her grandmother used to work in accounting. O’Nan consistently conveys the forsaken elements of the town. In stark, lean prose, he shadows his characters with a jilted past and a murky future. You hear the eerie river and the moody ocean, haunting and foreshadowing. I can still hear the rumble of the dark waters at night, long after finishing the story.Ironically, the more the author informs us about the murder, the more thrilling it gets. Nothing ever feels anticlimactic, no matter how much we know. It’s a quiet and disquieting beast of a story, where violence erupts suddenly but organically. From the first line to the last, I was in its thrall. It continues to echo in my reading bones. “The road’s empty, the moon low, almost full, its pale glow casting shadows.

But “defenestrate?” You can’t really stretch that one out, unless you’re talking how far down out of that window, or who is being thrown. It’s always been one of my favorite words. It’s so specific, the image, a person and a window, and perhaps a hand sneaking out from the back. So of course I had to read this book, about a family curse that goes back a century, to an ancestor in Prague (a city where defenestration is apparently popular!) who gave a “gentle push” to a Roma stonemason. And there it began, the curse, and the burden now, in the 21st century, weighs upon a set of twins, Marta and Nick, Midwesterners who travel to Prague to try and figure out the web of this curse, because each generation brings on a new defenestration. After living in Prague for a while, Marta and Nick return to the Midwest, where Nick falls out of a balcony and is seriously injured. Oh, and their hero? Buster Keaton. I inevitably fell for this novel!The tropes of this novel are familiar—trust, family bonds, and the myths held strong through storytelling. “Fall” becomes an extended metaphor, a symbol of the rift and the wreckage of dysfunctional families, and the desire for an unconditional love and sense of safety that all children want from their parents. Unfortunately, Marta and Nick have been denied the security and unequivocal love they so desperately want. And, at this point, Marta is worried that Nick’s fall wasn’t an accident. This tragic heritage is destroying their lives, turning a family into a cautionary tale. As Marta narrates, the reader gains insight into their fragile and friable bonds, and the secrets and fears that shape them. As the novel progresses, the power of storytelling reveals itself as the window to healing. Renée Branum’s work invites the reader to freefall into the beauty of her prose and narrative.“Story can only open a need for more story, falling backward and forward across time, trying to map these histories that never quite reach a final understanding.”Don’t look for a bracing plot or an action-packed story. It’s character-driven, much of it interior, the prose delicately and elegantly apprehending the emotional heft of the characters. Nick, Marta, and their mother will often leap from the pages, so well-drawn were they, and psychologically realistic. Too, the city of Prague comes alive, the precision of its streets, lights, hills, and medieval atmosphere reminding me of my previous trip there. Not many writers capture Prague as well as Branum. At times, I wished for a more nimble pace, but I felt a satisfying leap of excitement and affection for the surging of the narrative and the nicely woven finale. It doesn’t end with a fall; you still have to land.Thank you to Bloomsbury publishers for sending me a finished copy for ....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Feb 07, 2022","Feb 10, 2022","Feb 07, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57693272-defenestrate

She acutely examines the innermost essence of any mammal she writes about, like the literary equivalent of a “whisperer.” I cried for these dolphins, rooted for them and loved them because of Schulman. Their characters evolved and were as three-dimensional as humans. In the past, Schulman has navigated big game, primates, polar bears, and now dolphins in this intriguing tale of the relationships between humans and animals, between scientist and subject, and also between men and women. Inside these pages, I was hyperaware of the delicate balance between study and exploitation. Cora, a mostly deaf young woman working in St Thomas in 1965, is hired by Dr Blum, who is studying dolphins in captivity on the island. Although she had never worked in science or with dolphins before, she quickly becomes a natural. Before long, she becomes an integral part of an experiment to teach the dolphins to speak English. Cora’s method is to have a house built for her and her chosen cetacean, Junior, a tailored house half filled with water for Junior to exist in, and some dry areas/rooms for Cora. A roof, flooded rooms, a veranda with walls—this was her “homearium,” as she called it. She lived in a bathing suit and spent 6 days/week training Junior. The scientists working on the project were men who overtly objectified Cora. Not only hearing impaired, she was small, lean, and attractive. The men eyed her with jealousy for her natural affinity with the dolphins, and they often treated her with contempt, just for being female. Schulman brought me back to the days of the subjugated woman with impeccable precision. (This was also the days when scientists could hurt, maim, even kill animals in the name of progress). The neural experiments done on these dolphins brought me to tears, as I truly fell in love with Junior, as well as the other dolphins in captivity. THE DOLPHIN HOUSE was actually inspired by a true study that was done, including the shame and oppression that was placed on the female who joined the group of scientists. As the novel progressed, I was more and more riveted by the bond that formed between Cora and the dolphins, and was also astonished and disquieted by the tyranny of men, like Dr. Blum, who get to write the rules and control the milieu. “He was the researcher, the established scientist, the showman. By standing here and talking, he claimed all the credit. She and Junior were no longer active participants who had worked hard and achieved the results.

TheVLADIMIR is a riveting, deliciously sexy but dark, mordantly funny novel that turns the scandal-ridden campus novel into a lusty female narrative. The setting is a small liberal arts college, check (aren’t most of them?), a discredited married professor, check (sound familiar?). But, the English professor, John, is not the main character. Rather, his wife (unnamed), also a tenured English professor at the same college, is the vehicle that drives the story. It starts as we learn that John has been reported by numerous former female students for predatory behaviors, although the affairs were “consensual.” And the narrator and her husband had an open marriage, so our protagonist wasn’t the weeping victim. She very much had her own agency, but, admittedly, she is embarrassed by John’s scandal. They had an agreement, but they had always promised discretion. At 58, she is also dealing with vanity—her age, her weight, her skin-care regimen, and the fear of completely losing her attractiveness. Enter Vladimir Vladinski, new professor, 40 years-old, with a recently published and expertly written novel. Our narrator hasn’t published a novel in over a decade, and the two novels she did publish weren’t well-received. Vladmir’s wife is a tortured soul, penning a memoir which received a handsome advance; apparently, she is also a powerful writer. The protagonist quickly becomes obsessed with Vladimir, who, without his knowledge, becomes her muse for writing anew. The narrator inserts herself into their lives and upends their stability. In the meantime, the narrator’s adult daughter has come crying home with a relationship problem of her own. And this is only a short version of the premise!The narrator is wry and acutely observant, which is partly why I enjoyed this subversive novel so immensely. Her voice is rich, sly, sexual, and brazen. Here is a memorable observation she made: “I’ve always felt the origin of anger in my vagina and am surprised it is not mentioned more in literature.” And she scorns women who don’t feel like they have their own agency, such as the students all filing complaints against her husband. In fact, much of the novel concerns how women perceive their own power, their personal agency as they go through life. Our narrator is also concerned with the changing mores, as #MeToo has changed the power dynamic between men and women; men pay reparations instead of getting away with their animal behaviors. In the meantime, John’s wife is planning a comeback in every sense of the word, and we wait in suspense for her seduction and her new writing to come to fruition.This is a biting, incisive, razor-sharp narrative that combines insouciance with disquiet, tackling or challenging everything from intergenerational affairs, male dominance, personal agency, envy, even motherhood. And more! The twists and turns that occur were sometimes jaw-dropping, and always nuanced, even when it was nakedly impudent and flagrant. Julia May Jonas doesn’t write like a debut novelist; her narrative is bold and propulsive in scope and plotting, her theme and characters pushed to the rawest edges of refinement. It’s not over until the final passages, the finale a perverse twist of capsizing comeuppance. “I was swimming in an ocean of electrical impulses.

Get a shawl or a blanket, and sit by a fire, because this coming-of-age story will chill you to your bones. The fictional town of Waitsfield, Massachusetts will leave a rime of frost covering you. There are constant moments of discomfort and dislocation, wrapped in generational trauma and abuse. Ruthie narrates her life growing up in the 1980s in Waitsfield. She has a mixed ethnic background of Jewish and Italian parents, who were class conscious but didn’t have class. Moreover, they were not attentive or empathetic toward her. They cared more about status than culture, as evidenced by books they bought just for “show,” but never read. When her parents bought a house in a “better” neighborhood, Ruthie became more of a chameleon at belonging. Ruthie felt the class distinctions and experienced the slurs aimed at her and others who weren’t WASP-ish. The city had moneyed and blueblood families that went back a few hundred years, the Lowells and Cabots, but some of those historical families were pretty penniless, as she learned. Ruthie learned to navigate the pretentions of others.Not even one fraction of melodrama, this is gruff stuff, rough, disturbing, and direct. The unconventional structure is a series of brief paragraphs, or vignettes, like snapshots. It conveys the story through impressionism; the use of language creates torpor and stark images that loom over Ruthie’s life and her story. It’s the accumulation of these snapshots that wallops the reader. There’s gravid dread between these pages, so prepare.Here’s an example of one paragraph, or vignette: “One night we all went to the movies. My mother bought a box of candy and a cup of popcorn and nothing to drink. She opened the candy and threw the plastic wrapper on the floor of the theater. I picked it up. She looked at me as if I’d done something stupid.”Rather than a linear or even alternating time sequence, the story unfolds via these multiple moments, at times fitful, that you, the reader, will patch together in a sum-of-its-parts way. As the snapshots accumulate and become a full picture, the nuances will also echo boldly. A lack of momentum does slow the pace, which is my only complaint. The vignette style can pile up on passivity. But there’s a compelling payoff. Manguso took a gamble, but ultimately I was satisfied. Just be patient. You won’t always understand the breadth of what is happening while it is happening, but it comes together by the finale. Inevitably, it is a shattering story.

The nation is polarized, deeply divided, the most it has ever been. Instead of disagreeing on policy or opinions, America is divided on what the facts are, what is real. There’s Earth 1 trying to save our democracy and Earth 2 living the Big Lie, producing the God King. And, certain groups pledge to ban books written by Nobel Prize and Pulitzer winner, Toni Morrison, and other great writers. And they want to burn them, too! What darker age are we living in? The darkest. And, in Hawley’s masterpiece, the forces are gathering, and suicide is on the rise for our youth.This is what our modern times hands us. No wonder teenagers in this story are committing suicide at an alarming rate. Some at-risk kids are at The Float Anxiety Abatement Center, placed in treatment by their parents, who are clueless about their children, but desperate to save them. But, as the nation veers out of control, it may be left to the kids to save the world. Enter Simon, the Prophet, and Louise, who escape the Center for an epic quest. The Prophet, once named Paul, tells others kindly that God speaks to him, and has given him directions on how to save others from madness. His anathema is the Wizard, a Jeffrey Epstein-ish character with billions of dollars to exploit others with his sadistic, twisted debaucheries. The Prophet persuades Simon and Louise to join him on this odyssey.Hawley is a pop culture maniac (in a good way), borrowing names from Stephen King’s The Stand, from Hunger Games, and other sources that provide a bit of vintage wit. More importantly, Hawley recognizes that the country is in shakedown, in a terror grip of disasters, social and geological. It's the Rashomon effect. The thought police are telling you that facts ain't facts. They are telling you that civil rights are taboo subjects in school--it might cause ""discomfort."" “The future isn’t what it used to be.” We live in the age where some folks believe absurdities, and can be convinced to commit atrocities. And the teen suicide rate goes up, up, up.This is a finger-burning, page-turning, adventure-drama, tempered by droll wit, relatable and well-developed characters, and a story about saving the world. Addictive and astonishing, you won’t be able to stop until the final page. And even when you finish, you’ll be thinking about it, talking about it, and sharing it with others. If you dispute reality, then you may not like ANTHEM.Addendum: the author breaks the fourth wall now and then, but he does it with very small seams “…your author would like to point out, dear reader, that the times in which he lives stopped being simple long ago.

I then had traveling to do, and allowed the novel to seep even deeper into my pores while I waited to . Although the story itself wasn’t wholly original to me—the need for victims of crime to rise above the infamy of the criminal, i.e. too often the serial killer is talked about repeatedly, discarding the lives once again (by the media) of the murdered--the voice, prose, and narration rose this novel to excellence and immersion. I was haunted by the voices of these women who were slayed by a ruthless and disturbed serial killer who murdered savagely and, for a long time, evaded justice. In Kukafka’s atmospheric narrative, I was reminded that we all too often remember the Ted Bundys and Charles Mansons and forget the names and legacies of those they killed. This novel is a tribute to the voices of women who did not survive, but who could have otherwise led full lives. It is they who we should remember, rather than lionize the dark and soulless murderers of life.The women in this story include the serial killer’s mother, a detective out to track him down, who also had a brief history with him as teens, and the killer’s ex-wife and her twin sister. These were women who all struggled to carve out a place for themselves and forge independence in order to achieve contentment. The story goes back to the 1970s, when women were just trying to emerge as separate entities from their husbands, and be taken seriously as individuals. The story is both engaging and realistic.

And that she has to fight to feel alive and to balance things out. So she keeps fighting. She said we’re all fighters, our whole family. Even the dead ones. They fought the hardest.”FIGHT NIGHT is about the glorious fight with life, to fight the stabs of grief and depression with the persistence and practice of everyday living. The fight for survival, and the fight to embrace, lovingly, all that existence has to offer, great and small, sorrow or joy. In a droll and tragicomic narrative, Miriam Toews cuts right to the heart of our hearts, and shows us, not tells us, a family of three generations of women waking up every day to the noise of lifing. There are so many glittering gems in this book, and brilliant characterizations, I found myself highlighting passages until the book was a magical, fluorescent glow. Even the minor characters are pitch-perfect.Grandma/Elvira is dying--her heart is giving out, but her humor prevails. “She has one foot in the grave. She’s not afraid of anything,” so writes Swiv, the nine-year-old Sudoku-loving narrator. She was expelled from school and is being homeschooled by Grandma. Swiv is writing a letter to her missing father---the entire novel is her missive. Her mother, Mooshie, is a pregnant actress, despairing that she drove her husband away. Distress was an early part of her life. Elvira and Mooshie were traumatized by their religious leaders, a generational trauma that permeated the whole family, with resulting blows for some of them.Through utterly unforgettable slapstick, cinematic scenes (Swiv driving a stick shift, Elvira dancing and tumbling-- splat, the blunders of airport travel, and MORE), the reader’s heart will shatter in sixty thousand pieces. And through it all, Elvira laughs and laughs in laughing fits, uncontrollable LOL moments that I found contagious and healing. Grandma’s defiance is vivid and endearing; I’ve never known a literary grandmother to leap quite so high off the pages before. “At some point in Grandma’s life someone must have threatened to kill her whole family unless she became friends with every single person she met.” No small accomplishment in writing Swiv’s character, either! She's spunky, messy, ferociously fresh.Toews nails it. She brings the absurd and the intimate and the cataclysmic together with masterful attention. Every. Single.

Talk was magic, it turned the world, it was power when you knew how to fuse it with what mattered and pull your actions taut inside it like arrows.”An octogenarian former president of an unnamed Latin American country is the locus of Carolina De Robertis’ latest novel. He was known as “The Poorest President in the World. ”As the story opens, the ex-president is about to be interviewed by a female reporter from Norway, one who seems to have an observant eye and a deep understanding, compared to many reporters he has encountered. He lives in a modest home, the same home he lived in (he rejected the presidential palace) while president. A former guerilla battling against a dictatorship, the ex-president had been a political prisoner treated heinously, left in a dirt hole in solitary confinement for years. But surprisingly, he isn’t bitter. He not only found the love of a good woman, but he also loved his country and its people, an ex-revolutionary that became the face of justice when he became president.This is a concise narrative, a fable-like allegory, with a big heart. The story of the president and the frog is revealed in the pages, not a bombshell revelation, but one of how a person can find hope amidst the worst conditions imaginable, and still retain a belief in the good of humanity. “We’re bound to each other’s fates by invisible threads whether we choose to admit it or not, and we deny those connections at our peril.” A short book you can read in one or two sittings, a book that also has tendrils reaching to First World countries, like us, who are in danger of losing their democracy.

The story takes no prisoners and isn’t too shy to be frank. And the title, with its comma--don’t just take it at face value. The author is in your face, sardonic, and relentless, but compassionate and even-handed in her story arc. Moreover, rather than mere subtlety, or sympathy for the trans community, Peters depicts just as much toxic dysfunction in the trans characters as with cis gendered folks. No kid gloves here! Don’t be surprised by a whiff of Sartre’s NO EXIT in this novel of existential eternity.We had an expression growing up, “Say it; don’t spray it.” Of course, that was referring to spitting while speaking, but it’s also what I occasionally criticize an author for—going too far to indict folks for ignorance, or being too didactic. Well, Peters sprays, but not officiously and not dishonestly. Yes, the reader who is unfamiliar with the trans community will come out of this knowing, very knowing, but also reflecting on a dramatic but often humorous story of three main characters. Peters knows when to pull back and allow the reader space to comprehend and absorb.Peters manages and controls the narrative with an exquisite hand. She leans close to the razor’s edge, yeah, she does a few gleeful twists, but she keeps it real and navigates the choppy waters with candor. The reader may squirm in discomfort periodically, but most important--you have the opportunity to come along. It isn’t condescending. My worst criticism is that she almost explains herself at times, gets right up there, but she is remarkably restrained. She knows when to let it simmer. I couldn’t take my eyes off the page, eager to return to the story between breaks. Even during parts that may feel “loud,” Peters is yet sublime in the details that make up the big drama. And she captures the grip of personality disorders with finesse, nails the essence of character every time. Ames is the most difficult character to convey, but I applaud the author. She did it with style and substance and measured nuance. Ames is a man who had transitioned to Amy for numerous years, had a relationship with another trans woman, Reese, and then, for reasons that are brilliantly captured in the book, transitioned back to male. Not because Ames wants to, but because it was too difficult. The narrative goes back and forth in the timeline, so that readers will truly understand what makes Ames tick, more than any other character. There are moments that I gasped and then held my breath, like when Ames, losing his virginity, grasps a riveting truth about himself.Reese is a trans woman who loved Amy, and hasn’t really maintained contact after Amy detransitioned back to Ames. Reese comes across at times as the drama queen--not cartoonish (like the queer community has often been portrayed in the past) but unnerving, wearing her emotions on her sleeve, barbed when she is defensive, and tends to desperately look for love. Her problem? She hates to be alone.Katrina is Ames’ lover, who never knew Ames had a trans life until after she becomes pregnant--Ames is the father. When Katrina finds out the truth--well, it does provide some tension for the reader. Drama and wit blend flavorfully together as Katrina tries to comprehend the deeper parts of Ames and the trans community in general. These are not stereotypical characters; they are piercing, alive, individual. No caricatures here. The central plot is whether Ames, Reese, and Katrina can all be parents to this child, an idea that Ames is putting forth to both women. His reasons are convoluted, borne out of his inability to square this with his identity. He thought of Reese, “Perhaps one way to tolerate being a father would be to have her constant presence assuring him that he was actually not one.” It’s untidy in all the right places, although it gets really raw at times, itching and burning and painful. Peters’ adroit narrative, her talent for portraying characters, gets under your skin and stings. She defangs the trans community by repeatedly putting them center stage, not by depicting them as noble and victimized, but rather writing a story of intimacy and evasion, and the relationship to being and loving a woman. What holds a family together? Do we attempt to follow the institutionalized version, the one we were taught since childhood? Or can we carve out our own path? Don’t expect a neat and trim ending. We are still searching for ourselves, and the author wraps that in rather than wraps it up. ...more",Notes are private!,2,10,1,"Dec 15, 2021","Dec 23, 2021","Dec 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48890225-detransition-baby

Ignorance is a good traveling companion, and the truth never produces happiness.”French author and distinguished linguist (and Oulipe president—look that up!) Hervé Le Tellier has captured the zeitgeist of today with a commanding and genre-bending story that merges philosophy, technology, and other –ologies. Fasten your seatbelts, readers, for a thrilling ride into the murky unknown. Prepare for turbulence, truculence, and a touch of time travel.

The author takes over 100 pages setting up the elements of the narrative and introducing the main and secondary characters. In lesser hands, that could be annoying, but Le Tellier pens them with flair. The title comes from the -meta book within a book called The Anomaly, written by one of the passengers, Victor Miesel. His thoughts are some of my tickling favorites. “Nostalgia is a scoundrel. It allows us to believe life has some meaning.” Le Tellier blends nihilism with romanticism--what a salty caramel!Peril and salvation, erudition and ignorance, paradox and verisimilitude—and more. There’s nothing less than humanity at stake. Whether you’re highbrow or low, seek mainstream diversion or brainy polish, there’s something here for everyone, or two.Leap into the offshore of Le Tellier’s mind; you won’t be disappointed.

The physical hardships of escaping a dangerous country to get to Western asylum eschews any glossing here, the ship at sea that takes the migrants may even make you queasy. All my senses were alive; I could even smell the mixed pungencies, and my heart was pierced with needles. ”Such were the myriad mechanics of initiation into the oldest tribe, the tribe of endless leaving.""Amir is a nine-year-old boy from Syria on the migrant ship, the only one alive when the shipwreck occurs near an unnamed tourist island, rendering it almost myth-like. He is rescued by Vänna, a local girl a bit older than him. Their sibling-like relationship evolves over time and will endear you to their struggle. The chapters alternate between “Before” the shipwreck and “After” he lands and is with Vänna. Complex prose often showcasing what seems like a reductive storyline, but just keep going and you shall be rewarded.Amir’s escape began long before his maritime passage, into the comic books of Zaytoon and Zaytoona. What captivated him was that the town always reset at the beginning of every new story, a way that any damage was mended. “…the thing that most amazed him was the sheer  lightness  of such a repairable world.” Amir wanted to live lightly, and hope was possible on a new and beautiful island.The villain in this tale is the colonel doing his job on the island, as he and his team search desperately for the boy that they knew got away. He had past experience in the field of misery, as a soldier trying to defend his troops, and failing, losing a leg in the process. He tried to balance his mind and body in the aftermath, “…unlearning the stubborn, seething rage he felt at both the people who’d sent him to the killing fields and the people he’d failed to defend. How he hated the people he’d failed to defend.”This is a novel whose final page corrects, or turns around, every mistake in plot pivots that I thought the author was making. I don’t want to say too much, other than stick with it, and trust the prose, which is both muscular and mature, to denote the author’s talent. You will be satisfied and remove all doubt about his abilities. I was all set to thrash El Akkad’s newest novel’s plot points as puerile, although the story was arresting and unputdownable, despite that! Plot turns, and anything that mechanically pivots the plot gave me a few eye rolls (schmaltzy scenes at intervals), but by the end, you will see what a brilliant novel he wrote, an emotional powerhouse (that I hope nobody tries to make a movie of or series). What kept me going was the surging and poetic prose, which contained worlds--every sentence an expansion of ideas, and vivid scenery, as well as arresting characters. I looked over some of the stunning passages I highlighted, and their potency was even more trenchant when read in full context.Every page will contain morsels that are tragically beautiful in its descriptions, philosophical ideas rendered under stress, and empathy for each character, and some of their sad outlooks. “The West you talk about doesn’t exist. It’s a fairytale, a fantasy you sell yourself because the alternative is to admit that you’re the least important character in your own story…your simplistic morality demands it. But the two kinds of people in the world aren’t good and bad--they’re engines and fuel…change your country, change your name, but in their eyes they will always be engines and you will always be fuel.” Intrepid, frank, and fully charged, this story of survival will remain with you long after you close the final page....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Dec 08, 2021","Dec 09, 2021","Dec 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53773242-what-strange-paradise

I was so. jealous. My perception was that, for each language you speak, you feel I have a second cousin fluent in 7 languages by the time she was 19. I was so. jealous. My perception was that, for each language you speak, you feel closer to that country. But what if a paradox is the truth? Speaking the language of a country unlocks the words, and the speech may no longer be impenetrable, but people still are. There’s often a divide between what we say and what we mean, in any country. The unnamed female translator in Kitamura’s stunning new novel (she’s vaguely an Asian and English phenotype whose mother is Japanese) accepts a one-year contract for The Hague ICC (International Criminal Court), as a translator. Typically, in that work, you are expected to interpret without judging, and only facilitate a personal emotional kick to their words if it came from the person you are translating. You must do it at a remove from yourself. Of the narrator’s newest assignment, translating a ruthless West African leader accused of war crimes and atrocities--she sussed out that he was an observant man, and that he deliberately kept an expression of impersonal interest. “…a man who conceded nothing and had nothing to conceal.” As a translator, if you don’t stay neutral, there’s a risk you will come across like a witness. Kitamura knows when to use granular specificity and when to get murky. Translation is symbolic of the ubiquitous interpreting of everyday life and relationships. “The fact that our daily activity hinged on the repeated description…of matters that were, outside, generally subject to euphemism and elision.” The narrator did not consistently feel in control to pieces/parts of her own life, however, or the things that happen to her and others. For one thing, she is highly nomadic, moved around as a child, never settling on a country. A woman without a country.Unnamed narrators emerge with some of the readers’ literary biases upheld, and are part of this translator’s nature. Elusive, evasive, enigmatic. Check, check. A SEPARATION was also written with an unnamed narrator, and it shares themes with INTIMACIES. But INTIMACIES has a different plot and setting entirely. Although both emanated ongoing themes of isolation, gauging life with a chronic identity crisis point of view, this story felt new, fresh, alive, but with recurrent disorientation. There’s a bit of indecision, irresoluteness, in the narrator. Over the course of two months (I think this takes place around 2011), does she evolve? You tell me, as it surely bears discussion! “I’d begun looking for something, but I didn’t know exactly what.”Her path to getting to The Hague seemed borne out of the need to get away from NYC rather than going towards something. It’s not that she loved The Hague, but it felt familiar, like other European cities she had lived in. And yet, “I’d begun to think the docile surface of the city concealed a more complex and contradictory nature.” In everything, its paradox, and in everyone, too, including our translator, with her sense of vague longing. Some authors hide behind ambiguity and decreased punctuation, then not live up to it or get in front of it. Not Kitamura. She knows the rules before breaking them, so that her protagonist becomes three-dimensional, even when she is a cipher to herself. I just finished Jonathan Lee’s new THE GREAT MISTAKE, another protagonist who is alien to himself. Perhaps we all are to a degree, but this woman is perhaps the archetype of a well-traveled person who is rootless, possessing gauzy identity, with telegenic looks (although she’s not in front of cameras), urbane. She lived in NYC long enough to know that everyone’s from everywhere, and that distinction flattens out after a while. (Just a side note that I aim to look at 2022 novels and see if, out of the pandemic, writers turned often to themes of alienation and loneliness).(This is not a pandemic book, btw, and nothing about it is pandemic).Only French and English are spoken at The Hague, so sometimes there are additional translators in order to translate someone’s Arabic, or Hungarian, or any other language into French or English first. There could be several translators in the room. As a tidbit, The Hague is the only ICC that is not in the United States.The aim at The Hague is to speak as neutrally as possible, but with the exactitude of the person you are speaking for. Like an actor, you set aside your personal inflections, and then you precisely mimic those you interpret. The Court language is arcane and specific, in order to make less errors. It’s necessary to understand idioms and colloquy so that you don’t misstep, too. Imagine how a translator’s mistaken translation could move borders, or remove them. This isn’t traffic court, this is war crimes, crimes against humanity. Maybe, like to my cousin, translators can learn languages easily and lucidly. Some people were made to translate, at least in their work.The protagonist’s personal life is the pits, far from the unflappable persona she must be for her job. Father just died (same in A SEPARATION, as with Kitamura’s vivid memories of her own life), and other discontents lead her to leave NYC for The Hague. She picked up Dutch by living there, and soon enough has a Dutch boyfriend, Adriaan, who is attentive and attractive but not unzipped-from-the-ex (who abandoned him for Lisbon and sent for their two boys later). So Adriaan is not what you would call great boyfriend material at this juncture. Our interpreter often seems (to me) to do various things and make frequent decisions with almost banal intent. She has not organized her priorities; therefore, her life frequently avails itself with dissonance. When her passions do flare up, I’m rapt--it isn’t where you’d expect it to be. Moreover, the translator doesn’t know and couldn’t accurately identify why she desires to be with Adriaan, in my estimation. She also gets caught up, intrigued, by a mugging that happened near her friend, Jana’s, street. All these small intimacies that are not the kind you’d want. A thousand little intimacies can overwhelm you.I was hooked almost immediately to this book. The protagonist is seductively vulnerable and fascinating, the bad guy is really bad, and you won’t have to wonder about that, but yet the author, in portraying this evil man, did it with nuance! That’s what held all the malice to his character, Kitamura’s subtlety. Well-placed cinematic scenes play out, favorably, and organically. We follow the translator through her personal and professional life, we note the contradictions, and it brought me closer to my own incongruities, alienations, and how I may shape my memories. There isn’t one false note in this novel. As always, Kitamura delivers.“It is surprisingly easy to forget what you have witnessed…in order to exist in the world we must and we do forget, we live in a state of I know but I do not know.”...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Dec 06, 2021","Dec 07, 2021","Dec 06, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55918474-intimacies

The unlucky protagonist, octogenarian Andrew Haswell Green, is shot dead on page three in front of his house on a Friday the 13th in November, 1903. Who is Green? A civic leader responsible for some of the most well-known public, cultural, and green spaces in New York--including the Greater New York consolidation with Brooklyn dubbed by some as “The Great Mistake of 1898.” But this book isn’t a Wiki entry, it's about an incongruent life. Lee's subject matter and the shooter (especially the shooter) by definition (a Black man) is way controversial to this day and age, and yet the author didn't shy away from it. I felt relaxed reading it because I knew that Lee was not trying to throw shade on people--only ourselves, when we repress our authentic lives. (It's not cliché in Lee's hands).Is there a scandal? This is what Inspector McClusky needs to determine. The president of the U.S. praised Green and is demanding justice. But scandals “were always looking for ways to spread their mass.” The president “did not want to get his shoes covered in shit, and Inspector McClusky did not want to lick them clean.” The killer is known; the motivation remains opaque, but full of possibilities, limited only by the imagination and the racial prejudices of the time. Lee is so utterly droll!The chapters alternate between the present (mostly the murder investigation) and Green’s past, starting with his childhood on a farm in Worcester, Massachusetts, and up through to the finale of revelations. However, if you are seeking a tense thriller or cat and mouse adventure, look somewhere else. This is primarily a portrait of a lonely man who remained a cipher to himself, most of all. He kept his emotional aspirations so private that they were never fulfilled.It did take me a minute to engage and see how powerful this story is done, as the entire history, facts, and setting needs laying out, and then the fictional elements, which are truer than fact (or need to be, if you want to be convincing). If that sounds confusing, let me clarify. Green is an obscure person, except for his civic life and tragic death. The author filled in the details to give the man, celebrated by his contemporaries, an inner life. Green did keep a diary of his time in Trinidad as a young man (one of the key and shining chapters for me), but for the most part, Lee created the persona out of the man, and it is highly persuasive. I went all in after reading a vintage Lee scene with an elephant that…well, really exposes the elephant in the room! I read the scene twice--it was that impressive and animated. I only wish there had been more exquisitely rendered scenes like that. In some ways, I liked his earlier HIGH DIVE a bit more for its immediacy and intimacy. THE GREAT MISTAKE is paced and depicted at a remove, purposely, I'm confident. A few times it flattened the story, or threatened to, and required my patience to get into it. But I was rewarded, duly.So who is Andrew Haswell Green, the man? That is for the reader to discover, although it isn’t particularly cryptic, at least not his individual nature. What Lee did was explore why Andrew Green did not pursue his individual longings and life, and how it relates to his background, his father, and his many siblings. The author also included characters that were the antithesis of Green in order to enhance the theme of incongruity to oneself, i.e. Green's repressive nature. At the same time, he insisted that the corruption in the city be decontaminated. He became the city comptroller, which fit well with his incorruptible nature.Staid, solid, a man who was yet a shadow of himself. Highly recommended for lit lovers! Don't read the Wiki entry until you finish the book, because it will give away the ""motive"" of the killer, and some truly great mistakes therein. A bit slow at first, and the ending just sort of loses steam, but worth the read. Droll, sublime, and might even be mistaken as a romance of early 20th century New York. 4.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Nov 30, 2021","Dec 06, 2021","Dec 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55502632-the-great-mistake

This isn’t autofiction or memoir, but Erdrich gracefully blended in recent history and facts about her bookstore and the landscape of Indigenous people in her newest novel. LE’s caliber of writing continues to touch me tenderly and deeply by knowing how to keep it real and keep it fiction. Her primary character, Tookie, leaped off the pages and into my living room. This once again clarifies that Erdrich is one of the finest contemporary novelists writing today. Erdrich is one of the rare authors that included her own presence and person in a novel without distracting the reader. And it felt narrated by the protagonist, Tookie. Erdrich was a very minor character and it did not feel like it came from her hand. Or, what I mean is, there was no authorial intrusion despite that she was the author who intruded! Instead, she was sprinkled quite lightly. The story just gets better, and better, and better, with each passing chapter, with each rounded sentence.Louise Erdrich got away with doing everything that usually would turn me off in a novel, and makes me want more! Like, a haunting? Pah-lease, I thought. I was wrong. It totally works, because it is all part of the absolute love and love-crush of reading, and what it means to be human, ultimately. “Sentence” is a word that the author uses to towering effect, which can start with words and end in a variety of definitions. The novel opens with an event leading to a prison sentence for an Indigenous American woman named Tookie, and then we are off to the Birchbark Books & Native Arts bookstore, owned and opened by Erdrich since 2001, where Tookie now works since being released. Everything about this book touches in an organic way, from the voice, to the environment, to the people in Minneapolis, and some of its history with Indigenous populations. Nothing feels preached or admonished or patronized to the reader. In lesser hands, that may have happened. Erdrich takes mammoth risks, and lands every sentence on the page with nuanced color. The title is continually incorporated, as with the love of books.I don’t want to give much of the plot away. Flora haunts Tookie at the bookstore, and it leads Tookie to her own reckonings, also. It’s more than just about a haunting, but that part turns out to be an enlightening story that is both original and familiar in its intimacy.Much of the story takes place in Birchbark books, with such visual details of the store itself, that if you don’t want to visit this bookstore after reading this book, well, I’d be very surprised! “Small bookstores have the romance of doomed intimate spaces about to be erased by unfettered capitalism. A lot of people fall in love here. We’ve even had a few proposals.” The front table of the store is constructed from the “poetic remains of a smashed sailboat…” and there’s also a confessional, obtained from an architectural salvage store, installed at the bookstore and now used to display a collage—an ongoing art project by one of the booksellers.A wonderful surprise at the end of the book—a list of books to read.

But two others from the juvie camp, Duchess and Woolly, have escaped by hiding in the warden’s trunk. Duchess “borrows” the Studebaker after plans were made for Emmett to drop them off back at the camp. Duchess hatches a plan to get them rich, and proceeds from that desire. Thus the journey is disrupted. Along the way, Billy and Emmett find themselves on a train, meeting a host of quirky characters.Billy has the brains and wisdom of a 40-year-old, which made it difficult for me to suspend belief. Emmett, seemed rather flat to me. I didn’t feel that the author differentiated the various voices clearly, so I was grateful for the chapters titled in the characters’ names. Overall, the plot seemed gimmicky and there were too many clichés for a writer of this caliber, as well as repetitive filler bloating the story. Moreover, I was expecting an open road kind of journey, but that came up short. It read more like a love letter to NYC under cover of its Midwest folksiness, and that bothered me. It was sentimental, with a gotcha type of ending that couldn’t possibly be anticipated, even if it was clever. And Towles also utilized tokenism, which tends to make me cringe. I’ll let the reader pluck that out, or whether it is notable to other readers.Despite my disappointment, I did finish the entire book. The plot made it impossible for me to abandon it, because I wanted to know how it turned out. I think this will appeal to adolescents more than adults who crave the literature that Towles gave us in the past. But, I’ll still be in line for the author’s next book.2.75 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 05, 2021","Nov 09, 2021","Nov 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57109107-the-lincoln-highway

I thought it was going to be one kind of novel, but instead, it is another, but I don’t want to give the plot away, although it is not a plot-centered novel. Haigh penned a character-driven story of some colorful characters living in the Boston area, and connected by various degrees of separation. At the center is the women’s clinic on Mercy Street in Boston, a clinic that provides whole health services for women, which include abortion and morning-after pills. We meet a variety of characters that work there, protest there, or are acquainted with either. Tension builds slowly, and unpredictable events occur. Haigh captures the loneliness and longings of everyday people.Claudia is the main protagonist in this ensemble cast, a longtime employee of the Mercy Street women’s clinic. She’s 43, divorced, and childless. She was raised by a grim and wretched mother, Deb, who took in foster children to pay the expenses. Deb’s last foster child, Nicolette, was particularly without morals, lived outside the law, and had a baby in her teens. Deb treated Nicolette and her baby as her flesh and blood, neglecting Claudia emotionally. Claudia was eager to get an education and carve out her own life, but was still tied to Nicolette when Deb died of cancer. Her commitment was to the clinic. For relaxation, she smokes weed she buys from a man named Timmy. A loner, Claudia reads trashy novels at home and watches old episodes of Dateline.Timmy’s life revolved around weed—selling it, using it, and having entrepreneur dreams once he did some big deliveries. He was a kind man who led a narrow life. In fact, all the lives in Haigh’s new novel are fairly circumscribed. Anthony is a man with a Traumatic Brain Injury who spends a lot of time on the internet. He looks for like-minded individuals, who believe that abortion is first-degree murder. At times, Anthony seems to be unspooling. Victor is an older gent with too much time on his hands, like Anthony. They connect online but have not personally met.The focus is on characters, not plot, and the story unfolds in increments. Mercy Street is the location that connects them all, but whether you sell pot, or work at a women’s clinic, you know that danger lurks in any corner. This is a meditative novel that includes some vibrant people and unexpected lessons in life. Mercy Street isn't as coherent or tight as some of her earlier novels, like Faith, but it is animated and engaging.Thank you to Harper Collins for sending me an ARC to ....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Oct 28, 2021","Nov 02, 2021","Oct 28, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58006995-mercy-street

He’s nevFranzen doesn’t so much create original stories anymore; he perfects ones that exist, and tweaks makeshift ones into masterpieces of fiction. He’s never better than when he focuses on family and dramatic domestic dynamics. CROSSROADS, which takes place in the 1970s, centers on pastor Russ Hildebrandt and his more Catholic wife, Marion, one of the most memorable female protagonists in eons (on that level of intensity). If for no other reason, read this to meet Marion. These are key archetypes and themes, and also convoluted and Shakespearean with a (tragi-) comedy of errors. Existential characters seek freedom from contradictions by adhering to Christian doctrine--or rejecting it.The title Crossroads could be called Blurred Boundaries. Russ and Marion and their four children--Clem, Becky, Perry, and Judson--are all highly intelligent and distinctively damaged. Generally, they live with poor boundaries. Reader, you’ll relate. Franzen doesn’t break walls, or puncture through ceilings with plot, but he will dazzle you with the authenticity of Marion, Russ, and three of their four children. Judson is the youngest child and the only one not fleshed out. (I think it is purposeful.) Depth of character is Franzen’s wheelhouse, and this narrative (a genre that he invented or at least contoured for the modern era) illustrates how lives bleed into each other, and who we are willing to discard on our way to become authentic and happy (or selfish and charlatan). Franzen practically created the modern domestic drama, and now he’s rearranging and adding the complication of religion.Crossroads is the youth group connected to the First Reformed church, where Russ Hildebrandt preaches (but he’s associate, not the lead). Rick Ambrose is the young, attractive, and hip new head counselor at Crossroads. His teenagers at the center admire, respect, and practically worship him. Ambrose and Russ’s antipathy toward each other creates much of this novel’s suspense; the roots of the feud are gradually revealed. The torture for Russ never stops, despite the fact that he created this quagmire. Franzen shows us religion (Christianity) through a laid back (not extremist) and compassionate lens. I’m an atheist and yet I was not turned off by First Reformed’s guiding principles and gentle approach to parishioners. You don’t have to agree with its doctrine to still respect the even-handed patronage (However incongruously, there’s still a struggle with hypocrisy by those that preach and parent).Crossroads is the first in a trilogy, which will likely take us through to the present, and possibly beyond, to a dystopian-esque near-future. The trilogy itself is allegedly named, A Key to All Mythologies, and I’m stumped how that fits in with Crossroads, the novel (which is assuredly fitting). Every primary character in this novel will stand at a personal crossroads. Some, like son Perry, will bring you to your knees. His infernal fall from child to enfant terrible troubled my nightly dreams as I continued to read.Romantic Love, sister/brother love, honor, addiction, betrayal, greed, adultery, rape, understanding, generosity, self-pity--all and more are explored. “It was strange that self-pity wasn’t on the list of deadly sins… None was deadlier.” Despite the degeneracy of a few characters, Franzen also counters the ugly with the softest, gentlest, and most forgiving grace that I remember from his novels Purity, Freedom, and even Corrections. The author’s empathy for his characters’ worst behaviors is crucial to this story. That is what allows him to explore his cast so thoroughly, and the deviances so particularly. Every time a segment ends on a character, I start off the next part wishing to go back to the character I was reading. But, Franzen is so talented a portraitist that by the time that a few pages pass into another character, I’m hooked again. That’s a skill that Franzen confidently possesses.God as a concept has some Navajo power and the story’s spirituality often encompasses desire for wisdom and balance, which contrasts with those seven deadly sins-- gluttony, greed, lust, envy, pride, and the rest. At the crossroads of each Hildebrandt--individually and as a family, moderation is crushed by dangerous indulgences. Now I’m eager for book #2. All the characters have a lot more living to do, and I suspect that the sidelined or obscured ones will carry more weight in the second book, their story blossoming. If it weren’t for the fact of a trilogy, I would have criticized the ending for being rushed and unfinished, but Franzen is setting up for the next book. (Still, no excuse for a teensy-bit of a sloppy ending). All is forgiven, because I inhabited this book for many hours, and I’m still having a hard time transitioning to another book.Starting around the 400 mark, there were about fifty pages that don’t fit the style and tone of the rest of the book. That part is a chronicle of Russ and his history with the Navajo tribe, and also how he met Marion. The tone was dry and flat, but the prose was still beautiful. I wondered if he removed his original work and replaced it with what read like journalistic entries.Cutting to the deepest theme hits the bone. The seven deadly sins serve biblically for the story’s underpinnings and fear factor of bad behavior. Can a hypocritical pastor nevertheless be effective at work? While the parents are busy with their self-indulgent mid-life crises, the children are all over the map. (This is not to disparage Marion’s past trauma). Becky is a natural leader with her cool head. Clem is dear to Becky but otherwise distant from family. He’s older. Judson, the youngest, was more of a sketch at this point. Franzen also blends in existential philosophy into the narrative. As Spielberg keeps looking for a father in his art, Franzen will eternally seek answers about existence.Where do we learn morality? Of course, from reading a Jonathan Franzen novel! This is his best character study novel yet. Marion just blows me away.

This time Also called Trailers, the embassy wives are the ex-pat wives (sometimes husbands!) that follow their diplomat spouses to various locations. This time it is Windhoek, Namibia, where the focus is on three wives, two from the US and one a local. Persephone Wilder is the self-appointed shepherd of the new incoming wives; her sexy husband, Adam is an embassy lawyer. Persephone drinks a bit too much, and wears nothing but white “Like a dove that had accidentally swallowed a uranium pellet.” Yes, this is a satirical caper novel. Amanda Evans was a hotshot of the Silicon Valley, and now she can’t even get a volunteer job in Windhoek. Persephone takes her under her wing. Amanda’s husband, Mark, is a Fulbright scholar supposedly here to research and write about the Nama Genocide. Generally, he feels inept. But he loves Namibia; he was here 20 years ago as a Peach Corps volunteer, and is carrying some tragic secrets and unfinished business. The novel unravels that era for the reader, and it is the most propelling part of the story.Then there is Mila Shilongo, a local wife of the minister of transportation. To describe her from Amanda’s perspective: “This goddess was half a foot taller than either her or Persephone; every limb seemed to stream from her body, graceful as water. Her skin was dark, polished, and poreless; her face, a masterpiece of planes and curves, centered by long-lashed eyes the color of maple syrup.” Mila takes no prisoners, despises Persephone, and is the most enigmatic of characters. Mila’s precocious 9 year-old daughter, Taimi, becomes BFFs with Meg, Amanda and Mark’s daughter, and they get into many antics together, providing a surprise twist near the end.There’s also a rhino project called “Tusk!” that Persephone pulls Amanda into--their quest to save the rhinos in Namibia. This includes going to Mila and her husband’s palatial farm, finding the sought after rhino, and sleeping nearby to protect it. Subsequently, posting on Instagram is a goal to lure potential supporters internationally.This novel is filled with schemes and dreams, and also illuminates that ex-pat behavior overlaps with the mindset of colonialism and the white-savior syndrome. But Crouch is not screaming “racism” in our faces. She’s not aiming to shame us with our ignorance. Rather, it is a comical and thoughtful look at the two Africas. As Mila reminds us, “There are many different levels of truth, here in Namibia.” A clearly unenlightened embassy wife states that Namibians “want to do things their way.” Although some overly sensitive readers may get offended by some of the edifying themes, I saw it mostly as square pegs in round holes trying to keep up a pretense of poise and partnering. There’s a lost love element that is wistful, too.

Edith lives in her warehouse/art studio in the UK (Cumbria?), called Burntcoat, where she creates her pieces for display in prestigious places. In this intense and passionate novel, told in alternating times of her life, Edith does attempt to make sense of a chaotic world through her narrative, where she talks to “you.” Hall does not reveal the “you” for a while, so just hang in there and enjoy the ride. Sarah Hall’s impassioned story swept me off my feet, like all her novels do!There’s a pandemic virus that mirrors our times called Novavirus, similar to Covid, but much, much worse. The story is dystopian, tragic, and despite a vaccine, so many have already died, as the symptoms are typically extreme. Sometimes Edith is speaking from lockdown, at other times, she speaks of her mother, who suffered a stroke, and who once told her “Those who tell stories survive.” She tells of a relationship with an immigrant chef with piercing tenderness and sensuous language. “When we pulled apart it felt like drowning. We could only breathe with our mouths held together.” Her love for Halit will burn all the way through your soul. If I needed an author to write a sex scene for me, I’d ask Sarah Hall to do it!When Edith isn’t talking about family, the virus, lovers, or haters, she reflects on art. One of her large sculptures is a 40-foot witch named Hecky, which can be seen on the motorway. Some people are repulsed by it, those who don’t accept her expressive art. “There is art, the item, or the concept. And there is the story of the art, which is not its interpretation, not its meaning.”Hall is exceptional at voice; whatever she says I want to hear. “…we see and read our small, inconsequential lives, and realise we are, in part, curator.” And curate she does! As Edith reflects on her life at the age of 59, there’s a lot to mine about Sex, Love, Death, Creativity, Virus, and Art. Yes, all in caps (to me). Look how she combines Virus and Art: “Perfectly composed, star-like, and timed for the moment of greatest chaos.” Throughout this chaotic era, Edith gives us an epic journey, beautified by her descriptive lyricism. When she talks about a person who “Eats the dark,” she adds, “and shitting it out on everyone.” Her metaphors can break my heart in a million little pieces or put it back together again.

This is the first Norton or World Editions novel I’ve read in a long time that didn’t succeed for me. It is an expressly ambitious story for a debut novelist, and the author fell into some of the freshman traps of writing. Despite his lovely handling of the Latin language and the themes of Daphne and Apollo woven into the characters of Tessa and Christopher, I felt that the narrative was a bit self-conscious and too clever for its own good. I chose to read it based on falling in love with the Bernini sculptures I saw at the Borghese Gallery in Rome. Prins certainly nailed the potential meaning of the art, as well as showing us that interpretation can be blind, even the accepted ones in academia.Prins is thorough with creating characters, and his theme of love v possession was intriguing. The author aimed to parallel the Apollo/Daphne relationship with a contemporary one in scholarly echo chambers. However, it took too long for lift-off--the story was protracted and needed another run-through/edit to skim the fat and smooth it out. The climactic scene, also, may be improved if they made a movie version, but the execution here was too contrived, and frankly turned my stomach. I don’t mind being revolted, but I was more disgusted than engaged. It felt excessive by the end, with a finale that was hammy and incredulous. Also, the author was all over the place with Chris’ character, the head of the Humanities/Classics department at Westfaling School at Oxford, and Tessa’s mentor. His nature wasn’t consistent, and the author would undermine himself by changing Chris’ personality to move the plot in a certain direction. I felt that the violence in the last third of the book was artificially discharged. However, Prins can write, and he’s also capable of using his imagination.

If you are seeking formula, this book isn’t for you. If plot is #1 for you, look elsewhere. This is character and theme-driven. Marie matures in the abbey, because she has mettle and noble blood, oozes charisma, and alights a little heretic inside her spirited soul. What she thinks about when not in prayer or doing abbey business:“And through the countryside, the women will tell stories, woman to woman, servant to servant and lady to lady, and the stories will spread north and south upon this island, and the stories will alchemize into legends, and the legends will serve as cautionary tales, and her nuns will be made doubly safe through story most powerful.”Just read it if you love literature and imagination. Plus Groff’s wordsmithing will make you melt. I love how she can take a setting, the ecclesiastic and monastic, 12th century, and give us the exaltation of religion but in the form of tone, character, atmosphere, setting, and narrative, too.

In the narrative, you cross thresholds of the past and the dead, and, in a lab, record for a future over the deceased one’s past thoughts. Then you submit it as a treatment instead of psychoactive medications. What if you had a credible method for communicating with the past, in order to treat mental illness? To clarify, you would be able to slip inside of previously recorded emotional states that Alyssa (now deceased) experienced years ago. Alyssa’s excitement state, which had produced a neural image designed by the specialized team, would be a new memory to burrow inside nine-year-old Robin, the new trainee, and be an embedded event. He would learn to be at and in that moment, an interbeing, through a process called Decoded Neurofeedback. Visual cues and prompts are sent by the program’s mediation system to the trainees. Eventually, Robin adopts Alyssa’s imaged emotions. The mapped one doesn’t need to be dead, but in this novel, she is. She’s Robin’s mother. Theo is his father, an astrobiologist who has taught Robin how to create other planets and to explore them together. Their favorite challenge seems to be the liminal states between light, shadow, and night. They mourn what is or is becoming extinct and feel sorrow for life forms that have stopped working together. “Until it’s exciting and fun and ecstatic to think that everything else has agency and is reciprocally connected we’re going to be terrified and afraid of death, and it’s mastery or nothing.” In an interview with Richard Powers a few months after the release of his Pulitzer prize-winning THE OVERSTORY, he said those words, which gives me the chills; I discovered it after reading BEWILDERMENT. It aptly applies to the themes.BEWILDERMENT is about the interconnectedness and the dependency (and reciprocity) of collectively existing, or inter-existing. If we are all connected, now and through all time, then we can restrict death to a rigid temporal definition, and glide past it to arrive at a past neural state. In this story of loss, saturated with gravitas, we gradually apprehend Powers’ use of eternal interbeingness, a concept first introduced by a Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh, in the 20th century. If everyone is subject to interbeing, there is an unbroken chain or nexus of factors all connected--the past to the present, and then to the future. In the narrative, neural images are maps of emotional states, especially the most excitable ones. Your emotions can be data points that take up space in a diagram. In BEWILDERMENT, these emotional states reflect the Emotion Wheel. To capture what is already mapped, you go into an Empathy Machine. (Just think about how Richard Powers--if you’ve read him--would weave in an Empathy Machine to his Renaissance brain). Theo’s son, Robin, is on the cusp of turning ten, and both of them are grieving the sudden and unexpected loss of their wife/mother. She is beloved, even idealized by Theo and Robin, but she also deserves her glory, she earned it with dedication to her causes, directing a ten state regional NGO. Robin is firmly entrenched on the autism spectrum, is highly intelligent and talented in drawing, and has a severe mood disturbance which can lead to impulsive aggression that gets him kicked out of school. Health and Human Services will come after Theo if he doesn’t get Robin (on meds) to curb his behavior. Theo seeks help from a prizewinning, celebrated neuroscientist and old friend of his wife. Theo is also jealous of Martin Currier for his accomplishments, one that includes an experiment done some years ago with Theo and Alys, mapping emotions from the Wheel that Currier told them to access. The exercise left Theo at the time with more questions than answers about his typically transparent but at times inscrutable wife.The story is about empathy and, in Robin case, finding more ways to keep his mood stable via Alyssa’s neural map. Robin could penetrate Alyssa’s prior recorded emotions. In the present time, you use Alys’ past to give yourself hope for the future. BEWILDERMENT is a cosmos of mixed-genre science fiction family drama. Psychology and sci-fi have secured a timeless place together via Richard Powers.Death is the darkness that swallows everything from that point on. Powers pushes that concept--death and temporality--by integrating interbeing to his narrative. The interbeing goes beyond the emotional mapping—Theo and Robin have been “visiting” other planets, suns, and astral places for quite a long while. If it sounds too sentimental on its face, it won’t be when he tells the story. In fact, the author’s linguistic vastness brought me to dimensions created by the fusion of language and drama. When I started the book, thankfully sent to me by Norton, I expected to finish in a few days. However, I found myself probing deeper and deeper by looking up various extinct life that Robin drew and also cosmological concepts. It may have slowed down my reading time but it didn’t reduce my pleasure. This is a book you eat in small bites, like a rich gourmet dinner; you don’t gobble it in quick gulps.

Rima is the child that sees what men do, what they are when filled with explosive violence and deadly gases. Planet of Clay is about acceptance, imagination, compassion, and don’t forget love. Rima survives by her self-reliance, creativity, and curiosity. She copes through art.Here on her own, Rima draws the shape and sound of words. She sees the colors of war, and is sometimes bedazzled by a lustrous shade of blue that come from the gases that kill; sometimes Rima sees a blur of dull grey, or only one color. It’s searing to apprehend that the novel in front of you is about a young person’s final journey, but for them it is not entirely sad.“Each one of my secret planets has its own importance, but the Planet of Clay has exceptional importance. This planet won’t disappear until I disappear.”Thank you to World Editions for sending me an early copy for .

Robinson wrote JACK last year, continuing the story of the Boughton family and placing a supporting character at the center of her book. Strout’s great mind thought similarly. Although this is another Lucy Barton book, Strout placed Lucy’s ex-husband, William, in the center of Lucy’s story this time, or central to her. In MY NAME IS LUCY BARTON, William was almost peripheral, his character nebulous. I was slower getting hooked in OH WILLIAM!, due to the idiomatic style and the digressions from what was already a desultory flow. But when I came to the finale, where Strout adds an exquisite, tender, and brutal insight, through a window (literally and metaphorically!), I just about fell to my knees and wept. It was so astonishing, and in the quietest way. What a breathtaking book! Reading Strout is a treat from the literary gods, and this one is no exception. Lucy’s character is many-faceted, and her observations are almost noble in their honesty. She is an outsider like her late husband, David, (who had grown up in the Hasidic community but had left as an adult). Lucy was raised poor, dreadfully so, and often hungry, without demonstrative love, or security, or warm support. She can relate to David in trying to fit into modern life as an adult, where popular culture drives everything. Certain deprivations never leave us, Lucy contends. Strout can often be so subtle that she repeatedly conveys Lucy’s low self-worth by using parentheticals when Lucy is perceptive. The story is (mostly) first person Lucy, and she will manifest her brainy poise, but she puts her own remarks in parentheses, giving them second tier importance. After all this time and a successful career as a beloved writer, Lucy nevertheless remains plagued by low self-esteem. She admits to feeling invisible most of the time. Did William understand where Lucy came from? Did he support her or exploit her? Good discussion material after reading the book, I think. Lucy is more discerning than she gives herself credit for.

Elinor Hansen, raised in North Dakota, is a military brat. Her father is Caucasian and her mother Korean--a spousal choice her father made, in order to marry a woman that would be subordinate to him. He wasn’t purposely cruel as much as he was limited on gender roles. Eventually, Elinor’s mother, Nami, left the family while she searched for a life of her own, and Elinor and her sister were subsequently motherless. Elinor has had a complicated life, and her return to her roots unfolds potently in this character-driven and theme-based novel. The limitless themes--from victim to survivor--would be banal in a lesser author. Elinor’s beauty and stature helped her financially--she had an early modeling career, a profession she recognized as superficial and driven by the male gaze. However, it helped pay for university and grad school in journalism as she entered her late 30s and early 40s, and allowed her to pursue a life of intellect and observation, rather than being the observed and acted upon. Now, in a first big assignment, an ex-lover/ex-professor has handed over an oil boom story of the Bakken to her, ostensibly because she grew up around there. Elinor is about to go “home” and discover that the murky sediment beneath the surface of the Badlands is more than geological; the oil boom has uncovered the ugly strata of male privilege and hypermasculinity, class divide, racial prejudice, environmental degradation, and the treachery of a lost humanity hidden under casual cruelty. Ruthless to each other, tyranny toward the land. It’s left to the few to amplify the beautiful.Yun covers broad themes subtly, without reducing it to topics. She lifts contrary and contradictory conundrums from the page into our lives, a universal experience, and executed without platitudes or stereotypes; Yun rules the unruly and untamed wilderness with a controlled narrative. She conveys our shortcomings with a blend of realism, idealism, and desire. Is past prologue? How do we relate to our planet and to each other? Is there a connection?If I tried to cover all the themes, I’d be writing a doorstopper. But one thing that clearly stood out for me is the way the author began and ended her story on the toxicity of male privilege run amok. I won’t give spoilers, only an observation that Yun’s bookended narrative does concentrate on the unrefined male gaze, and how that profiles a wide expanse of human behavior, the benevolent and the bitter. Our heroine, Elinor, is still navigating a rough landscape. The story, which both embraces and defies archetypes, does not go past the finale. You'll be disappointed if you expect reassurance of ""happy ever after""--after. Just like life, we are all passing through and stopping to get our bearings. Elinor came for a story of others, but she also learned a lot about herself, her own radius, her point on the dial. At 40-something, she is growing up, evolving in her searching and inquisitive way. Some readers might get justifiably frustrated at the end of the book. The action doesn't end abruptly but the finale gives us only a sneak peek of Elinor's new self-awareness. It was hard won, not an epiphany, and we do journey with her there. A complex story begins with a victim and ends when she becomes a survivor (I'm purposely being just a little reductive to make a point). I accepted it that way, with a tinge of envy for what I won't get to see. Elinor was real to me, so if she leaves and takes it all with her--her new self--I'm going to cry a little because I thought I earned her entire life. !!!! (A common reader eccentricity). Other readers may sigh with fury because they won't share in her next journey. We only follow her until she evolves; are we really supposed to see any more? “That’s probably why this land means so much to her. It’s a reminder of how complicated this country is, how great beauty and terrible ugliness have coexisted here from the start.” Elinor will stay with me and resonate for a long time.Thank you to St Martin’s Press for sending me an ARC to .

Do you see where this is going?” That’s all in the first paragraph--and, no, I did not know where this was going, but I was riveted to the spot. This is the story of 36 year-old Joan, a survivor, whose parents died at age 10, and therein raised by her knowing and urbane Aunt Gosia, who taught Joan how to be independent. But, as the reader learns, Joan has a traumatic history of sexual assaults and feelings of abandonment, the failing of a mother’s love and the longing for her father’s tenderness, gentleness. She calls herself a “depraved survivor.”“All present men are stand-ins for former men. And all men are stand-ins for our fathers. And even our fathers mean less than our own self-preservation.” I could just go on quoting from Taddeo’s book. It’s so compelling that I couldn’t put it down. She tells you she’s an animal, that she’s murderous, and she sees life through a prism of sex. But, actually, the more I read, the more empathy I felt for this damaged woman. Is she immoral? Amoral? That’s part of our suspense. How damaged is Joan, and can she take her life back? Although there are scenes of cinematic melodrama, Taddeo makes it work, as the events leading up to the finale are fully supportable.Joan leaves New York and moves to an off-the-grid part of Topanga Canyon in LA. She is looking for the enigmatic Alice. During the course of the novel, Joan is talking to “you” but not us, the readers. It will inevitably become apparent whom she is talking to. Initially, we also don’t know the poignancy of Alice. All becomes eventually clear, in gradual, tightly controlled reveals, and the novel never ever gets dull. Joan is real and realistic, so relatable, despite her horrifying past and risky behaviors then and now. This novel is both character-based and plot-filled. Oh, her characters! You could eat them alive! Especially Joan, who never misses an opportunity, when eyeing men, to land the event or brief encounter into the lens of her sexually laced philosophy on life. She’s quick, stark, and savvy. Her life unfolds to the reader in, as Marion Keyes said about this book, “like a series of grenades exploding.” Joan may be the most quixotic, captivating, hypnotic protagonist I have encountered this year, with a droll and macabre wit. “The young man at the cash register noticed me and then didn’t take his eyes off me. …He was picking a pimple on his chin and staring at me. There are a hundred such small rapes a day.” Joan’s afflictions, her pent-up rage, and her day-to-day choices may seem heinous on the surface, but, as the narrative progresses, it becomes easier to understand her. Even her difficulty relating to women has a source. “I’d often opined with other women and with men that every man has a degree of rape in him. Women didn’t understand what I meant. They were alternately disgusted and confused. They thought I was stupid. But the men didn’t. I think they were impressed that I understood.”It’s not often that my s are half-peppered with quotes from the book. But I can’t say it like Joan (like the author). How much can women sustain from the insults, demands, and presumption of men? Joan is still a work-in-progress, but that viciously strong identity is straining to emerge.

There are two time periods that alternate throughout the book—1978 and 2010. There are other years, too, but that’s sufficient to point to which decades.

The language is economic, with room for some provocative visuals and tense atmosphere. Nixon knows how to bide his time over a scene or tiptoe past us. He has tight control over his narrative; the story is fit, hale, and hearty. At times it is like a fable, other times a cinematic thriller, but constantly captivating. Here’s what Nixon has to say about memories, through a character:“…people…were like cameras recording reality from slightly different angles. Now she knew that memories weren’t reliable. They were shaped and folded out of assumption and supposition, put together piece by piece from what people expected to see and what they wanted to see… Memory and the hard facts about the past, seldom had much to do with each other.”This is a slow burn and breathtaking, and a breathable beast of a book!

People in Heiny’s story are stubbornly themselves, at times to a fault, and at other times to correct that fault.

But, at his woodworking shop, he has pieces there for months overdue to his inaction and totally laid-back lifestyle. Allergic to marriage, too. A rake, a lover, and a unicorn. There are a couple of characters on the spectrum, like Jimmy, who is likely IDD, but is easy to please, genuine, and lovable. He works at Duncan’s shop—Duncan keeps him employed--and lives with his mother. Duncan’s ex-wife, Aggie, is annoying and intrusive (but means well most of the time), Aggie, who still maintains contact and cooks like James Beardsley or Julia Child, has a flat affect and inattentive husband who Aggie mothers.

Mann wasThe Magician was a nickname that Thomas Mann’s children gave to him, for his ability to entertain them with a few rudimentary “magic” tricks. Mann was a German writer born in the late 19th century, who had lost his home, or homes, in Germany and elsewhere, during WW II. But he carried the Fatherland within him. The author’s narrative style in this “faction” book was primarily executed like non-fiction plotting. The last sixty pages, however, transcended that, and brought tears to my eyes as it evoked, emotionally, Mann’s acknowledged and internal contradictions, and his understanding of humanity. My favorite passage came late:“If he were to be offered a chance to say a final word about the human spirit, he would like to do so comically, he thought; he would dramatize the idea that humans could not ever be trusted, that they could reverse their own story as the wind changed, that their lives were a continuous, enervating and amusing effort to appear plausible. And in that lay, he felt, the pure genius of humanity, of all pathos.”Tóibín approached this story of Mann from an epic and historical perspective, saga-like but maintaining a sense that one was reading a biography rather than a novel. At times, it was rather dry, but the presence of Mann, his wife, Katia, and their six children (and later the grandchildren) brought about a liveliness that peppered the text with the pleasures and disappointments of family life. My main criticism is that, for most of the narrative, all was constrained within the borders of the text, and there wasn’t much to imagine, or wonder at, or interpret. Tóibín’s chronological and linear plotting kept the story contained within the borders of the pages, even while Mann traveled in exile from home to home. What I knew about Thomas Mann prior to reading this book was insubstantial. I knew he was a German writer who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929, and that he sublimated his homosexual desires, often into his stories. I had read DEATH IN VENICE, which was memorable in its portrayal of innocence, bittersweet longing, and death. But Tóibín’s insight and research into Mann translated largely into an epic story of home, or homelessness, and the fierce love and tremendous sense of loss of Germany by its citizens, after Hitler came to power. Mann did not believe that this vulgarian, this brutish bully, could really become Chancellor. His ascendancy was shocking to people like Mann and other intellectuals and artists. But his two oldest children, Erika and Klaus, and his brother, Heinrich, were outspoken and often in danger. In some ways, it brought his family into conflict, as there was a balancing act that Mann had to play. Denouncing Hitler publicly could be perilous to his family members. Mann was famous worldwide even before WW II. And Thomas had to live with the consequences of living in high style with his wife and family, even in exile, while many of his countrymen, including artists, musicians, and writers, were tortured, killed, or subsisting in poverty. Thomas and his wife, Katia, had to play it delicately, diplomatically, as they moved from home to home, country to country, as émigrés. The powerful people that helped the Manns also pushed him to behave and speak in whatever ways that framed their politics.The last section was tense and suspenseful, novelistic rather than biographical in style. Faction is a delicate poise between the creative and the facts, and Tóibín concentrated on the themes of family and home/identity/country. There is much tragedy that befell the Manns, and ostracism abounded around them. Mann’s two oldest children were flamboyantly progressive, not just politically. They were fluid on the sexual and gender spectrum, as well. All of Mann’s children were traumatized by life experiences--their own, or their partners, or friends. In the midst of the external events, Tóibín elegantly portrays the interiority of Mann--as writer, as man, as Mann without country.A big thanks to Scribner for sending me an ARC for ....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 20, 2021","Jun 24, 2021","Jun 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56897459-the-magician

Since the blurb promisedI’ve been Barcelona dreaming for over a year now, since canceling a trip to Spain and Portugal last year due to the pandemic. Since the blurb promised that this is a love letter to Barcelona, from the days before the financial crash of 2008,(Thomson lived there in the early aughts), I especially was eager to immerse myself in the narrative. That, and I remember his delightful KATHERINE CARLYLE. Thomson has a wistful clarity of voice and haunting atmosphere, which hooked me in straight away. BD is more of a triptych of novellas more than it is a novel. The stories connect to each other via slender threads, generally by a major character being minor in the other stories. Thomson’s gentle storytelling is often elusive, creating space for the reader to interpret the unsaid.In “The Giant of Sarriá,” a divorced English woman, Amy, meets a Moroccan immigrant half her age, a beautiful man named Abdel who she hears one night crying in the darkness. They embark on an affair, and he shares secrets with her about himself. His ethnicity instigates a snowball of tragedy. In “The King of Castelldefels,” an alcoholic has-been musician, “Nacho,” (Ignacio) continues to sabotage his relationships due to his unrelenting blackout drunk episodes. Finally, in The Carpenter of Montejuïc, a young Catalan literary translator, Jordi, continues to hope for the impossible--that his unrequited love interest, Mireia, changes her mind about him. In the midst of this is an enigmatic carpenter/artisan, who makes furniture that practically glows with its wood origin history. I just gave the bare minimum of each novella. What appeals most to me is the author’s ability to empathize with vastly different characters throughout, although one racist gets more (deserved) judgment than empathy. What did slightly disappoint me is that I didn’t feel the texture, atmosphere, and setting of Barcelona beyond some details of specific places (and some areas were actually on Barcelona’s outskirts). I say this because I have been swooned by novels that describe a foreign city that I haven’t been to, and portray it so well that I feel installed there, and I can visualize it. But there is some magic at times, like the view from the Ronda Bridge, the miasma of “exhaust fumes mingled with frangipani.”This is a quick read, and, at times, an almost hallucinogenic quality pervades the book, especially in the last story, with the mysterious and intimidating carpenter. And the author includes a Barcelona Soccer celebrity, Ronaldhino, which bridges fiction with reality, and adds to the narcotic effect, specifically to Nacho’s life, as others find him unreliable and a dreamer without much substance. The stories left me with more questions than answers, yet it also carried me away with its hypnotic events and alliances. Thomson also has a sly sense of wit.

I was offered an ARC of CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS, not expecting to love it as I did. It’s not that I don’t enjoy stories about Millennials--it’s just that sometimes there’s too much navel gazing or whining and stuck-ness in issues that can make my eyes roll. But Sally Rooney? She’s a delight! Navel gazing in Rooney’s book is organic and watchful. She writes her literary opuses as if they were screenplays. I’m not talking about just the filmic quality of the narrative. But in BEAUTIFUL WORLD, as in all three of her novels to date, you could pluck the breathtaking images right from the words themselves. The dialogue, characters, and story are three dimensional, and every scene pops and delivers and allows you to interpret on your own terms. BEAUTIFUL WORLD touches on themes of beauty, celebrity, social media, mental health, friendship, love, the continuum between friendship and love, and the fluidity of attraction. As always, I feel that the author connects deeply with the reader as she writes. Even when the tone is wry, tense, or accusing between characters, I feel that Rooney’s people are always evolving and in motion. Rooney isn’t rigid but she is decisive. Her cast comes with an implied background of unease, or lofty principles that they themselves have problems achieving. They are searching for love and identity, and also a culture class that they can brandish or even hide behind. This new novel revolves around two best friends, Alice and Eileen, and the men most important in their lives at the time.As in all Rooney’s books, one character is a writer (sometimes she has more than one). Alice has achieved literary fame after two novels (like Rooney, although I won’t make the mistake of thinking Alice is based on Rooney), and then had a mental breakdown. It is obvious that she isn’t that egocentric about her fame; in fact, she chooses a boyfriend much less intelligent than her who doesn’t even read books. Her typical form of communication with her best friend, Eileen, is email. They contain some scintillating content and background info, and move both character and plot along, or give the reader a bridge between times. So when Eileen and Alice eventually see each other again (Eileen is living in Dublin, Alice by the sea), you just know there’s a climax coming. (Eileen is actually living in the house Alice abandoned when she went into treatment). You feel the tension. And when I said that her novels are like cinema? I think this one is more theater, like a play. You’ll see when you read it, but the scenes usually include little details about the environment when a character is doing something, such as: “…sitting on her bed scrolling on her phone… On the floor, a discarded cardigan, her swimsuit with its straps tangled, sandals with the buckles hanging open. On the bedside table a lamp with a pleated pink shade.” The stage is set a particular way. It’s like seeing a play, where you are riveted to the stage, and the play and your life have merged. Simon and Eileen have known each other since childhood (he’s 5 years older than her) and their relationship was Platonic for many years, although Simon has always been hard to pin down. Felix is Alice’s new boyfriend, and there are a few stunners of information about him that are revealed early.If you are a Rooney fan, you’ve already read the book and are just checking out what other readers are saying. Is Alice really Sally? No, of course not, but it is a little bit meta-, as Alice does criticize people on Twitter for judging her life and her boyfriend, as if they know her. (I imagine many celebs feel this way.) Her readers do act on social media as if they are involved in Alice’s life--like her friend or cousin. Shows you how creepy we can be. We all do it sometimes--judge someone famous for making certain choices with their lives! But, Rooney doesn’t act superior when she writes a scene this way. Her nuanced portraits are unguarded, even when her characters are leery or calculating. Rooney mesmerizes when she points out their darker sides. What I wanted to say is that if you are already a Rooney fan, then there’s nothing I can tell you other than to read it, and you won’t be disappointed. If you are new to her, prepare to love her or hate her. She writes her familiar geography--Dublin. Her characters are mostly about her age, and like her character, Alice, she writes about friends and lovers. Rooney does that SO WELL! That is why she is so beloved. Scenes are vivid, like her characters, and I become invested in them. So when they feel a cleaving, so will I. And most Rooney readers will, too. She is wise, piercing, and intuitive with the narrative form. Her stories are convincing because the texture feels like authentic material.Rooney will follow a character into a murky tunnel and come out the other side with the bright sun shining or peeling off skin. She decides and we interpret. Or she can say it all in a few keen words, taking the context and subtexting the hell out of it. It’s almost always through the characters, like a play. Rooney doesn’t describe geography except to add mood/atmosphere to the story. Settings are in a room or a space, indoors or out, where you can feel the boundaries when they are crossed. Her characters are urgent with the world they live in, fearful and fearless simultaneously. And constantly thinking, feeling, desiring.“It was like God had put his hand on my head and filled me with the most intense desire I had ever felt, not desire for another person, but desire to bring something into being that had never existed before…I knew what I had to do, and I did it, that was all.”I’m so thrilled that Rooney has this talent to share with the world. I’m a superfan, a wide-eyed votary, so I can get away with saying…gulp…it’s a more beautiful world because Sally Rooney’s talent is in it....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Sep 27, 2021","Oct 02, 2021","Jun 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56597885-beautiful-world-where-are-you

I engaged early with the protagonist, who uses the name “Jane Smith,” and is built like a tall lumberjack. Right away, she informs that she is going to tell us how the world ended. She’s a cyber security analyst with a husband she calls Bear, and a teenaged daughter. I was compelled initially, but it didn’t sustain my interest consistently. I had to see what happened so I read the whole book, expecting that I’d appreciate the destination, if not so much the journey. With clues and mystery piling up, in this noir-ish fable with a physically clumsy amateur detective “Jane,” I started out intrigued. For me, most of the story felt exhausting and unwieldy, stiffly stylized and meandering. It’s as if I read a different book than those that enjoyed it.I think the combination of the noir detective and climate disaster dystopia turned eco-terrorism got too gawky, the way Vandermeer did it. He wrote his protagonist, a wife and mother, abandon her family for a dead woman scientist she didn’t know that left her a taxidermied hummingbird and a manifesto scattered like breadcrumbs, all to follow down a rabbit hole. While she saw the world was burning, the skies change to a chemical green tinge, and a murky pandemic invade the species. “Jane” casually cheated on her husband with strangers (even though she was introverted), engaged in casual violence, and watched others get casually beaten, battered, and killed. I’m confused as to why Vandermeer kept trotting out stereotypical villains and half-villains, who we obviously won’t care about, and set up scene after scene with these half-formed and half-baked characters. Some were caricatures that met cartoon fates. All the while, threaded through the novel, were the supposedly profound (?) words left by the dead Argentine scientist, Silvina, scion to a wealthy, powerful, criminal family. Criminal as in: wildlife trafficking and (maybe) bioweapons.Anyway, most of the stuff written by Silvina seemed rather trite and coyly abstruse. Occasionally, an author will disguise an inability to shine a light by keeping us in perpetual darkness. Vandermeer seemed that way, or maybe he deals better with the cerebral than the emotional, (which he then sentimentalized at key plot turns). The novel was often busy with extraneous details of hiding finding, texting, calling that were essentially meaningless after a while. Instead of enlightening me, I was drowning in the drawn-out repetition and sociopathy of it all. When everyone is a sociopath, what is really at stake? The world, I know--that’s what the author put up as the Holy Grail--saving the world. But Jane was constantly being beaten and bruised, either by accident or enemy. And we followed her step by step, car by car, and cars that trail cars, her and her “Shovel Pig,” her nickname for her jumbo handbag.I learned some things that the internet could have taught me about hummingbirds and salamanders, but the ultimate reveal of the bird and the amphibian were anticlimactic. As far as ecology and wildlife trafficking, what I learned was choppy and randomly sequenced, so I got lost in the weeds, or in the pervasive dark. There’s not much one can figure out, either, since new, essential facts are unveiled right before each small discovery, and the build-up of one thing after another and another gummed it up for me. That, and “Jane’s” lot and lode of injuries. Ouch!Then this over-the-top ending, which I think Vandermeer could have finessed more keenly. I can tell that he has talent, that maybe I’d like some of his other books. Perhaps this was a rushed quarantine-y book to meet the times. Or I’m just the wrong reader. The style felt forced and disingenuous. Of course others will find this exciting and adventurous, and I accept that I dropped out of caring about these characters left to save the world, even though I read the entire mythic tale, hoping to be converted. I’m sorry, Jeff Vandermeer, that I had to write this . I can tell that this writer cares about humanity and other living things, more than what is conveyed, extinct or otherwise.2.5 rounded down...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 15, 2021","Jun 18, 2021","Jun 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53359447-hummingbird-salamander

I knew very little other than that Camus was born in the French territory of Algeria--he was a “pied-noir” citizen. In this new Zeniter novel, a Millennial character named Naïma decides to try and find the answers to her family’s history, and her father’s journey here with her grandfather all those years before she was born. This novel contains a family legacy that is credible enough to be true, although it is written as fiction. It reads like a historical biography.Naïma works at an art gallery, and is currently disenchanted with the paths she has chosen, tired of living from hangover to hangover. She’s being sent to Algeria by her boss and married lover to locate an artist whose works they plan to display. Naïma does some critical research, and tries to unearth what keeps her father, Hamid, so mum about his childhood. Her mother, Clarissa, is French, and tells Naïma that she knows very little about those early years before she met Hamid. THE ART OF LOSING is a historical fiction that has the air of auto-fiction, and it is a lesson of displacement, the yearning for home, community, security and self-sovereignty that pervades the pages. You can lose when you are considered a “harki,” a pejorative term for the Algerians that worked with the French military to maintain peace. You are recast as a traitor.The chapters are filled with what you may imagine happens in war: dying, violence, fear, betrayal, courage, loss, and an absence that hangs over the survivors’ heads, the language barriers. Tragedy upon tragedy, and some are cynical, while others have hope, and some repress those years altogether once able. Redemption does peek from the gloom, too. There were times I felt bone weary reading the narrative, when it went dry, historically stiff. However, it was edifying and frequently touching.

The characters are Middle Eastern, display gravitas in their bearing--ancient and contemporary histories embedded into their bodies, their bones. This isn’t a war or political novel, but the characters are heavy with it, the provisional nature of things: homes, lives. Primary characters are itinerants that were born to itinerants. The protagonist, Arezu (Iranian American), returns to her father’s house (which she just inherited) in Marbella, Spain. Twenty years ago when she went, her father didn’t show up, and instead sent forty-year-old Omar (Lebanese) to meet up with his seventeen-year-old daughter at the house, explain his absence. Omar seduces Arezu, who’d never experienced sexual intimacy. He has her in a Svengali-esque grip the entire summer. Arezu is intrigued, lulled from her usual torpor, and responds to Omar. She’s frightened and emboldened, spellbound and repulsed, and adolescently confused. Arezu’s body went wildly sexual the summer that she was raped every day.If you have read the novel, MY DARK VANESSA, then you are familiar with an accurate portrayal of PTSD and sexual abuse, specifically sustained by a teen, as a target from an aggressive male with authority. Arezu observes Omar’s self-agency; she doesn’t believe that she has any for herself. Van Der Vliet Oloomi keenly conveys this trauma, also. The extreme contradictions; the shame; the humiliation; and the grief that stayed repressed, only to reappear decades later. It was a bit incredible that Arezu has a loving husband at home, that she has a healthy marriage, when the eternal Omar fallout still consumes her. The narrative is unrelenting in its psychic pain and private torture. Occasionally, I felt weary that all these idle moments incited these intrusive thoughts, especially being there in Marbella.Azareen Van Der Vliet Oloomi is an exquisite writer; I could quote a tranche of hypnotic passages, and will read any future work for its promise of poeticisms. I do think some leadership in editing would help balance out the different subtexts and subplots. For example, her friend, Ellie, the nomadic Israeli-American queer scholar, has an underdeveloped role, but at least her ethnic and sexual orientation statuses don’t feel like totems. I wanted to know more about her; however, she remained there, static, in the background. We get glimmers of her at intervals, but only attenuated glances.Arezu’s trauma-filled memories were relived, revived, echoed, and each time it was like a cruel death. Instead of cause for movement, action (even mental action), it represented ennui, inertia. This book could have either been a longer, more matured work, secondary characters expanded, or a novella--pared down without losing any substance. She has lovely sentences, but there are also places where she lumbers a bit—either unwieldy or evinced with a flat figure of speech.I recommend this to literature lovers, readers who can appreciate this level and specificity of trauma. It’s honest, raw, emotional. Heart-curdling at times, with painful precision. I finished the book still in torment, stirred up but not reassured of peace.

When I read3.5 (even if 2.75 for believability) I was looking for a sorbet book for the in-between, was hoping for a high-end but low-pressure novel. When I read that much of this story takes place in Austin, I sprung for it. After the first ten pages, I thought I made a mistake, but I continued, anyway. Glad I did, and allowed the story to build. I was delighted that the plot wasn’t trite or simplistic beyond the bare surface. This is largely a thematic story of love and trust. Hannah, a thirty-eight-year-old stepmother of a sixteen-year-old girl, Bailey, is forced to bond with her in ways that she desired, yet never achieved; Hannah was repeatedly rejected by the girl. Owen, Hanna’s husband of one year, always had faith that Bailey and Hannah would eventually connect. Hanna and Bailey remain the core relationship in the book.In the opening chapter, a middle-school messenger comes to the door with a note from Owen to Hannah. There are only two words written: “Protect her.” Owen, however, is gone, fled, run off, and Hannah has no clue to the whereabouts of her missing husband, or why he left. This forces the issue of Bailey and Hannah’s relationship to define and refine itself. Can they be a source of support to each other? Can they find Owen? Owen’s departure initially drives a further wedge between Hannah and Bailey. However, survival and the search for Owen depend on the two working together under baffling and dreadful circumstances.The FBI, a U.S. Marshal, and people at The Shop (where Owen works--a software start-up) pursue Hannah with questions and demands. Some at the Shop, like the owner, have been arrested for fraud and embezzlement. In quick time, it turns into a cat-and-mouse adventure, taking Hannah and Bailey from Sausalito (where they live) to Austin, Texas (where I live). The plot is exciting and packed with adventure, suspense, and thrills. Owen’s past, difficult to mine, reveals him as a cipher, with rumors of criminal behavior. All that Hannah can depend on is her faith in the two years that she’s known her husband. He walked into her woodturner business (like wood sculpting) and they fell in love soon after. Hannah has never doubted, not for a minute, Owen’s love and devotion to her and Bailey. Admittedly, the growth of Bailey and Hannah’s relationship is a bit twee, and the distance that is reported between them initially is not as edgy or intense as we are told. Bailey’s pseudo-hostility is transparent, too on-the-nose. We understand that Bailey has a big heart from the start--perhaps a more realistic animosity from Bailey would have been too offensive for some readers? The author seemed determined that we like Hannah and Bailey, unquestionably. Hannah never deters from excusing Bailey’s bratty behaviors, either, but she bent over backwards too frequently for belief. Despite plot holes and a big ask to suspend belief, THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME is entertaining and cinematic. I was never bored, and I was stirred by the closing scenes, too. Moreover, there's a polished delicacy to Dave's writing and a warm voice that appealed to me. It's a popcorn book, not literature.

And that is just the opening.Our main characters in this ensemble are the pilot and his wife, their young children (not on the plane), the airline crew, and Theo from the FBI. They will evoke empathy from readers as we also cheer them on. Avid Reader Press does not hesitate to call this commercial fiction, their maiden voyage with this genre, and I think they chose an entertaining story-- it's gripping, suspenseful escapism.I’m sort of fascinated by the whole airline industry, so for me it was intriguing to take a glimpse behind the curtain--and the cockpit. The urgent and demanding abductor commands the pilot to make a choice: either crash the plane of 140+ passengers and crew or the terrorist will murder his family (who he already has at gunpoint and handcuffs). What will the pilot say, how will he respond? What will he do?The beginning (and at intervals) is action-packed. The juxtaposition of down below and up above adds tension. The reader goes back and forth from the plane, to the pilot's family taken hostage, and then to FBI agent Theo, a nephew of one of the crew. Theo is on tenterhooks with the FBI, and knows he has to prove himself worthy of the Bureau to stay employed. The first 20% of the book is especially well timed and smoothly edited. The middle is where I felt impatient, when it got baggy and maybe a bit on-the-nose-sentimental, which could have been attenuated; it lost its sinewy touch at intervals. However, the story as a whole is exciting—asking that kind of moral question to a pilot, and then the pilot relying on the crew to help him pull off a miracle, is enough to keep me fastened until the very end.Newman loses some credibility when she urges her characters on with artificial sweetener. Her strength is action, not characterizations. The characters aren’t freshly portrayed--it’s Hollywood, not nuanced. Yet that didn’t stop me from that stone in my stomach and lump in my throat during the high adventure and fears. If this is made into a film, the right actors and director can deepen the characters so that we emotionally connect with them.This is a sorbet book that I’d rather not “rate,” but it is entertaining and this year’s fun guilty pleasure.

Yes, Miller has created an entire new world in RADIO LIFE, approximately 400 years into the future. This future life has risen from the ashes, so to speak, following a “Rise” or catastrophic disaster that destroyed the advanced world. So, 400 years from today centers on the Commonwealth, and the past-future world is the Gone World, and the souls that lived in it are “Ancients.” (Any persons alive before the Rise are known as the Ancients.) There are parts of a skyscraper of buildings, many which have sunk to the underground, or half underground. Should ancient knowledge be pursued or suppressed? That is one of the major conflicts of this story.Describing and inhabiting a future dystopian planet takes an imaginative but precise vision. The cover of the book is actually a quasi-decent example of areas of this new world, but you must read the book to dwell in it. Step into the Commonwealth (somewhere on the East coast), a tribe of people inhabiting a mammoth-sized stadium, who believe that knowledge is power. Their lifestyle and work supports trying to figure out the ancient fabric of society with the few clues that they have found, some that will tickle your funny bone. Words sometimes have other meanings, the Internet is long gone, and life is somewhat basic, technically primitive. Leaders of the Commonwealth have picked up pieces of information--some that help them construe a basic form of electricity, and other info or found artifacts that are used in useful and instrumental ways.The Commonwealth’s main rivals (more like enemies) are the Keepers, a tribe that believes that accessing Gone World knowledge is dangerous, and will lead to another Rise or cataclysmic destruction. The Keepers suppress history and will kill members of the Commonwealth to assert that their philosophy is the only ideology that should exist. Commonwealth members all have a role to play to protect their community. For example, there are trained Runners that routinely circumvent the enemy to gather information. One Runner gets trapped below a half-submerged building and discovers the Internet in captivity.There’s also an intriguing place called the Abbey, a group of monks that supposedly live apart from Keepers and Commonwealth, far away from either camp. The section of the novel is less developed, although characterizations are wholly satisfying. It was during this notable part of the book that I began to wonder if there could be a second book or series to RADIO LIFE. In fact, Miller states just that in his endnotes--that he would like to see his book as a first of a series. I would also like to see it as a cable series—it is so rich and visual. The world that Miller built is genius.There’s drama, adventure, laconic wit, as well as themes of loss, survival, love, friendship, betrayal, power, knowledge, and intellect.

Marian and Jamie become well educated in the natural world, where they spend a lot of time, and their uncle ensures that their literacy and creative spirits thrive. Besides Marian, Jamie has a story with many adventures, and his fate is inextricably bound with Marian’s.At an early age, Marian becomes self-sufficient and ambitious, especially after witnessing a husband and wife pilot team that visit for a show. She is determined to fly planes--and do whatever it takes to save the money (her uncle squandered much of their inheritance). Marian is disciplined, courageous, and highly intelligent, as well as physically strong. Moreover, she is devoted to Jamie.

However, at this time, Hadley is a work-in-progress--a navel-gazer, the acme of vanity, who confuses love and lust. Hadley leaps before she looks in almost every area of her life. She hardly “earned” her status--it’s more like she fell into place. The young actress is privileged, frustrating, and loveable. Yes, loveable. Fundamentally, Hadley has a tender heart--she just doesn’t know where she misplaced it.After making millions on Archangel, Hadley impulsively sabotages her superhero role (unlike her counterpart, Marian, who planned vigorously and resourcefully to achieve self-sovereignty against the tide of traditional gender roles). And due to social media, Hadley’s reputation is also in shambles. While at her lowest and most self-pitying, she is offered an opportunity to play Marian in a hagiographic film of Marian’s life. It’s a chance to mature, to step into a new role that could lead to self-agency and self-determination. After reading a book about Marian’s journeys, as well as some of Marian’s pilot logbook, she becomes infatuated with the brave female aviatrix who dared to circumnavigate the globe.The novel is about 75% Marian, 25% Hadley (this isn’t an exact figure, of course). Shipstead is astonishing on all fronts. Plotting, themes, character development, language, and pacing just vibrate off the pages. This epic and startling tale of two women, a century apart, illustrates the “great circle” of life in unexpected and exquisite ways. It also demonstrates that we can only have a limited view of other people's lives, which is framed by our own experiences. Hadley and Marian can be fierce and uncompromising, even as they paradoxically sacrifice-- for a desire to be seen, to be made manifest in magnificent and sublime ways. It’s a sweeping narrative that made me feel special just for reading it.I won’t go into the story details; it’s enough to say that Marian and Hadley’s stories intersect through the author’s masterful and elaborate storytelling talents. Shipstead’s meticulous research adds even more luster to this tale. Interspersed with the parallel narratives are portraits of pilots--mostly female--who have broken records and braved the impossible. For readers who would want to know beforehand--the tale also covers scenes of sexual abuse/assault, graphic at times but eloquently nuanced. THE GREAT CIRCLE will surely be one of my top 10 of the year.“What is the border between life and oblivion? Why should anyone presume to recognize it?”...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"May 05, 2021","May 14, 2021","May 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54976986-great-circle

With the help of that night-and-day trick, they could pretend that their life until now had been a dream.”When a book sweeps me off my feet and shatters me, totally, thoroughly, conclusively, the only thing I can think of saying is, “Oh.” But that’s no . This novel is epic. Still not sufficient. It’s about two women, the wife, Isla, a painter; and the lover, a renowned short story writer, Valeria; and the man they love, Martín, an Argentinian businessman married to Isla. Isla and Martín live in London, in Holland Park, with their three children. Valeria lives in Paris, unmarried with no children. She and Martín have been lovers for thirty years. The narration is third person limited pov, but primarily follows Valeria.As Martín lay dying in his home after a stroke, Valeria sits for a portrait for her upcoming book. It’s the first time Isla and Valeria have met, and Valeria concocted this plan--a portrait instead of her photo for the book flap. She asked Isla, who had retired from painting, to paint her, so that Valeria can be close to Martín. Valeria and Isla are both the same age, fifty-five. Valeria has kept her lover a secret, and does not plan to tell Isla, although it is sometimes very difficult to withhold. When Valeria meets fifteen-year-old Antonia, Isla and Martín’s troubled daughter, she immediately feels bonded to her, and Antonia is the first to initiate their friendship. If this all sounds like a soap opera, or melodramatic, I’d say it would be in a lesser author. But, in Bernardini’s hands, it is an exhilarating, tragic, nuanced, and uncommon tale of performance, love, betrayal, friendship, and mortality. Shrouded in open and closed secrets.Valeria lost a sister to cancer, Sybilla, when she was a young girl. Her father was an absent figure, and her mother, Theodora, struggled with herself, and with Valeria, after Sybilla’s death. They had lived in Rhodes, in Greece. But after Sybilla’s death, they left, and Valeria has never returned, nor has her mother. Julian wrote many letters to Valeria through the years, which she ignored and occasionally burned. Martín lost a twin brother at a young age, also. That story is revealed gradually.What brings all this together so intelligently and emotionally is Bernardini’s construction. It’s non-linear, although it is easy to keep dates and times straight. While the present progresses, the narrative threads in the backstories. Potent events allow us to glimpse or gaze into a character’s regard. What installed me even more is that Valeria’s short stories become part of the story. Sometimes we get lines of prose from them; more often, the theme/plot/characters that make up her stories bestows itself now. I can’t even articulate how powerful, POWERFUL that is. At times I twinned with Valeria, the way Bernardini so effectively braided in her written stories to her life. And not just Valeria, as many of her stories were ripped from Martín’s and his family’s life, as narrated from Matín to Valeria. Sometimes, Valeria’s stories came directly or indirectly from their decades-long love affair.Moreover, Isla, of course, was frequently a trigger for these stories—Isla from a distance, as Valeria didn’t know her. Even Antonia, and Martín’s dead brother, Rami, interlaced or enhanced her narratives. Valeria essentially borrowed their lives for her books; did she not have confidence in her own life? You the reader have a lot to chew on, as the author stirs provocative musing from a prism of perspectives. While reading, I seized legions of active verbs within my head, and buzzing cerebral activity. Bernardini mutually creates dynamic shifts and collective stillness. Days, hours, sitting for a portrait opens the setting for interior and exterior events to develop or rub against each other. And Bernardini makes London breathe its life into the story—the weather, the sky, the storms. One of the telltale themes is about performance. Is painting performative? Isla turned to performance art before resuming painting, after Valeria’s request. Valeria engages in colossal performance, from the request to be painted--as a ploy to get close to her dying lover--and the sitting itself. “The stool was in its place from the day before…Valeria walked towards it. It felt both like having to sit in a session with a therapist, and going onstage. It was intimate and completely public. The process of finding yesterday’s position…had already become a rehearsed performance.”The earthly and the sensual, the sacred and the profane give voice to this extraordinary story. And for readers, THE PORTRAIT illuminates the importance of stories, for our memories, for our past, to give a rich texture to great and small moments, those we had then, and those we are having right now. “Isla was looking at Valeria. Just as it had the previous day, her gaze changed as she assessed her subject. Valeria’s face felt like it was changing too, as she looked inside herself to become what she had been yesterday. Or what she intended to be from now on.”...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 30, 2021","May 05, 2021","Apr 30, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54303513-the-portrait

I’m still waiting to receive RADIO LIFE in the mail. There isn’t a Derek B. Miller novel I won’t read, because he is usually a terrific storyteller. In this newest novel of Miller’s, it is historical fiction portraying Sheldon Horowitz’s younger years, starting in 1938 when he is 12 and orphaned, prior to NORWEGIAN BY NIGHT. He starts quite a journey as a confused, courageous, but grieving adolescent bent on revenge for his father’s death, and finding his place in this anti-Semitic, oh so White-loving, Christian-obsessed world.Sheldon is in the car when his beloved father and WWI hero, Joseph, is run off the road. Was it random, accidental, purposeful? Sheldon believes it was targeted, and vows to get revenge. He is ripped from his roots in Massachusetts and goes to live with his taciturn but well-meaning Uncle Nate, whose wife, Lucy (Sheldon’s aunt) died in a fire with Sheldon’s mother just a year ago. Sheldon shares a room with his cousin Abe, a few years older than him. There’s also Mirabelle, Abe’s sister, and Sheldon’s first sense of romantic yearning. Sheldon’s best friend, Lenny, remains in Mass., and they keep in touch by letterwriting.Sheldon and Lenny are wise beyond their years, both intellectually and emotionally. It’s this preternatural gift for keen adult capacity that didn’t persuade me. It felt contrived, and in a YA voice that contradicted the narrative. It's in third person POV, so why make it juvenile? It’s also corny and sentimental, which I suspect was Miller attempting to channel the era, but it was terribly mawkish rather than convincing.The book read largely as a series of capers, following Sheldon, Lenny, Mirabelle, and Abe as they come of age on the eve of WW II. Abe is ruthless and has a plan for a counterplay against his father’s bigoted boss, who Abe thinks is setting up Nate as a scapegoat Jew at work (more insight than his father does). Lenny has aspirations to become a comedian. His rancor for the American aversion to enter WW II provides a provocative fount of material. Sheldon wants to catch and kill the mustached man who murdered his father, ran him off the road. As a future boss tells Sheldon, “You got a way about you…Like your brain’s always at work and there’s more going on with you than seems to be going on. Like you have this…rich inner life.” And that he does!I did enjoy aspects of this novel, especially as these kids try to navigate the chaos of life, with landmines like war, disaster, confusion, sexuality, and “crimes large and small.” The WW II scenes were Miller’s strength; I was captivated by their authenticity.The last 20% or so of the novel is its most convincing to me, the most compelling and tense. The author slides in “Tikkun olam” beautifully, for “repair” and “for all of time,” “or else the world.” Earlier in the novel, the importance of homing or carrier pigeons during war is folded in. “God chose us to receive the law and share it, not fulfill it by ourselves. We’re God’s carrier pigeons. Maybe that’s why everyone keeps shooting at us.” Sheldon believes in activities that improve the world, that God lovingly made an imperfect world, a Garden of Eden, where we should work it and protect it. Tikkun olam.In the acknowledgements, Miller stated he’d like to think of this book as “in conversation” with Chabon’s Kavalier and Klay. The problem with that is--yes, the comparisons to Chabon. Chabon is a different kind of writer-- über literary, and flawless with historical narrative. DARK, however, was scattered with anachronisms from the start. Miller said he purposely placed anachronisms in Lenny’s comedy routines, but that isn’t where it bothered me. It began on the second page with “Sheldon Unleashed” and also using “crazy” as a noun, which is contemporary slang. Historical fiction should be consistent with its time and place, with particular attention on lexicon/language. When these incongruities pop up frequently on the pages, it takes me swiftly out of the narrative, and over to the author behind the curtain.I also felt that parts of the narrative were strung together like Wiki pages, or with a long-winded lecturing tone. Some of the events felt cobbled together from stock files tweaked for this tale. And he broadcast and foreshadowed too pointedly. Instead of trusting the reader to comprehend what a character is feeling, he often trumpeted their state of mind as a scene played out, or overexplained, when I already understood the guise. He undermined his own irony.I realize my criticisms are plentiful. But if you are a Miller fan, it’s essential reading, and I’m confident that many other readers will enjoy this from start to finish. That’s the beauty of books, how it affects people differently. Certainly I am glad I read it, and there were themes of loyalty, revenge, betrayal, identity, and justice that enfolded me. As a Jew myself, I relived moments of ignorance and anti-Semitism by others, toward me, toward my parents, certainly toward my grandparents, (who came over from Russia). I bow to Miller for keeping the message going, that all humans are made to be equal. And that prejudice is ugly, regressive, and systemic.Thank you to HMH for sending me a copy to .

A German fGerman author Daniela Krien chose a superb translator, Jamie Bulloch, to smoothly translate German into English, which is a feat in itself. A German friend has explained to me the various ways it can go wrong, including finding appropriate word choices. These aren’t interlinked stories, like, say, Olive Kittridge. The five women’s stories that comprise this novel are linked more like Kevin Bacon, with six degrees (sometimes less) of separation. Yet, the author artfully crafted these five separate stories to roundly read like a novel. (I should know, as I am not a fan of short stories in general). The narrative is penned with a light touch, the author standing back from interference or sentimentality. Five women take on love with varied results.Paula, a bookseller, is divorced with a daughter, reticent to get involved again, concerned that she just can’t let go and be happy. Judith, a doctor, competitive as a rule and best friends with the more withdrawn Paula, is addicted to dating sites and has never been married or had children. Her horse, and horse riding, is her main squeeze. Judith’s writer friend Brida is torn between her career and her husband, Götz. They are passionate for each other in bed, but clash frequently on their roles as spouse, parents of two children, and career. They remain lovers even when Götz leaves her after too much conflict, and marries another woman.The last two women’s stories belong to sisters, so here it IS more interlinked. Malika is a successful violin teacher (had dreams of becoming a successful performer), and has been depressed since Götz left her for Brida. Overweight with poor self-esteem, she remains alone and without a partner. Her more selfish sister, Jordine, is a film actress with two children, but on the verge of divorce and pregnant with a third by another man. Their father has Nazi tendencies from before the wall came down.Each woman must learn to navigate their life with authenticity (and their roles as women) and resolve the issues they face that weigh them down. Friendships also play a vital role in their lives. Some stories, like Paula’s, is weighted with less intensity. Brida’s story, to me, was the most absorbing--that’s just a personal preference. She can’t give up Götz, but his needs impede with her writing, in her judgment. The sisters need to work out the burden that comes from their dysfunctional family. Judith is so independent and self- contained that it is difficult for her to acquiesce or compromise. These five women have universal desires.The prose is lean, reserved, and economical, with no wasted words. The events aren’t momentous for the reader as much as it is for the characters, but the polished prose and the intimate scenes combine to lure us into their individual worlds.“He satisfies her more than any man has been able to in the past. And she doesn’t love him. She’ll only confide her most secret desires to a man she doesn’t love.”A quick read and a must for literature lovers. 4.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 25, 2021","Apr 27, 2021","Apr 25, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54427159-love-in-case-of-emergency

But microaggressions? Not so White people grasp what overt, hostile racism and racial remarks are, and understand that they are hurtful and ignorant. But microaggressions? Not so much. Even if meant with “good intent,” many remarks said to Black men and women, or in general, like “You’re so articulate,” “Can I touch your hair?” or, “When I look at you, I don’t see race,” are notably meant as surface compliments, but are unconscious insults. OBG explores this territory, particularly the nuanced topic of microaggressions in the workplace, and the potent impact on Black women, especially (and Black men, too, but the focus in the novel is primarily Black women). The story, which takes place in an established publishing house in NYC, carefully navigates this territory in a workplace drama that encompasses, ultimately, another genre. That final fifth of the novel, with Victor LaValle-ish features, had mixed results for me.Nella is a Black 20-something woman raised in White dominated New Haven, Connecticut, and then attended a Public Ivy, UVA. Her boyfriend, Owen, is White, raised by two moms, and is usually a voice of reason for Nella. Her best friend went to Howard University and continues to (mostly playfully) admonish Nella for not attending an HBCU. Nella’s dream job is to be an editor, and for two years has been working at Wagner Books, where she is the only Black editorial assistant (no Black editors, either). Sometimes she does fret that she was hired as a token, especially when she initiates a Diversity Town Hall project that goes sideways. And she hasn’t gotten a raise, either.Nella sustains ongoing microaggressions from personnel, even from well-meaning colleagues who just don’t have a clue. And their most celebrated author, a White man who brings in the bucks for his bestsellers, writes a novel about the opioid crisis in Ohio with a stereotypical, cringe-worthy Black woman as one of the characters. Apparently, he thinks he is “woke” just because he included this Black woman, single, with five children and pregnant again. Grrrrr. Nella attempts to ask her editor boss on how to approach this topic with the author at their next meeting. Discover the upshot, reader!In the meantime, Wagner hires another Black woman as an editorial assistant, Hazel, a woman from Harlem who had been working in Boston prior to moving back to Brooklyn. Hazel shoulders a sweet-smelling, pungent hair product on her lovely locs. Nella never did learn how to care for her own pretty locs, and is embarrassed about this. Hazel and Nella become chums in the workplace, eat out together, and even socialize out of the office. Nella believes she has an ally, who can also assist her with her hair care issues.In the meantime, we go to a thriller angle here, too, when Nella is left a threatening message in an envelope on her desk, and becomes obsessed with discovering who the culprit is. At this juncture, as with the prose itself, it has a YA feel to the narrative. The language is fairly plain, nothing to wrap my head around and embrace. The issues are adult, but some of the dialogue and mini-reveals along the way have more of a Young Adult sensibility.However, Harris amps it up with the last 20% of her novel, and throws in a supernatural curve ball to expose the big reveal. I’m still trying to recalibrate, for myself, the nuanced theme with the LaVallish elements. I absolutely loved Harris’ central theme, and the differing approaches of a serious conflict. And the way it echoed wisps of GET OUT is true to the book blurb.BUT, I’d have liked to see her resolve this with more earthbound elements. I understand that this may be impossible, once she’s journeyed down this road, but that magical component kept getting in my way. I felt blindsided, but not in any red-herring way. It was difficult to merge it together, these genre-defying pieces. Moreover, the narrative had two Black women at war, of sorts. It took me a lot of inner talk to accept this manner of conclusion--but the conclusion itself was wicked smart! The finale eerily haunts me still, long after the last page. 3.5 rounded upSo, my two cents. I could envision this book as a cable series, where the big reveal is not the ending--maybe of season one. But it could open up to an ongoing storyline, where everything subsequent is full of intriguing possibilities.Thank you to Atria for sending me a digital copy via NetGalley.

Interesting events happen to Joe Sharkey, lifetime solitary surfer and champion, but as for Joe himself? He just didn’t come across as all that compelling. In fact, I found him rather unexciting and tedious. Theroux has a way with the English language--a linguistically flexible mind capable of thrilling the adamant reader; but, surfer Joe here, and his tale, was rather frustrating and redundant, with some hot spots that started to pull me in, but stopped short of embracing me. Theroux's authenticity in portraying Hawaiian culture and vernacular gave the story some rich color and tapestry, but, in the end, the tale didn’t take off for me, although I had some heartfelt moments with it.I learned quite a bit about surfing—a singular passion for some people--and where the finest waves reside. Waimea, in the Noth Shore of Oahu, is a surfer’s paradise (there are many surfer rendezvous in Hawaii, of course). There’s an entire vocabulary--very physical and metaphorical--that describe not just the waves, but also one’s body on the board, riding in the surf. Although I don’t surf, I am an active and ardent swimmer, and the ocean (or any body of water, but the ocean especially) is like a second skin. I’m more comfortable in the water than walking on land. Joe Sharkey is, too. Along the way, his parents may have aided and abetted Joe’s single-minded determination. His mother stayed drunk and insipid after the death of his military father, who was stationed in Vietnam, and taught Joe, “Consider yourself already dead, and you’ll be fine.”In fact, on land one night, at the age of 62, as Sharkey discovers he is gradually becoming a has-been, he accidentally runs into a man on a bicycle, and kills him, while his 30-something girlfriend, Olive, is in the car. His karma is run over by his dogma at that point, and his life becomes one miserable day after another. A subsequent tragic event that would have convinced me to flat-out leave Joe for good actually strengthens Olive’s resolve to save Sharkey from thorough depravity and decline. She’s selfless, sensitive, and nurturing (a nurse who is beloved by staff and patients), and I wish that Theroux had mined her character more than he did.Who are we, as a person? Joe has always been a legend and a raconteur, embellishing so many surfing stories and achievements in his life that it is difficult to pick apart the truth from exaggeration--even for him. His friendship with the equally grandiose Hunter S. Thompson adds a little spice to the story, although its poignancy is a nuanced thread to untangle closer to the denouement. Ironic that Joe has never read a book—and brags about it. He has one interest and one interest only--surfing. That may make him alluring to surfers, but it got a bit boring for me, as I wrestled with impatience for Joe to wake the fuck up. As he becomes tedious and redundant, I lost interest in him. You have to be willing to be in Joe's head for 416 pages. I went there, but it wasn't easy.After the incident, Joe starts deteriorating, to the point of either madness or dementia. He utters, repeatedly, “I ran into a drunk, homeless guy,” refusing to acknowledge that he killed the man, or that the man has an identity beyond drunk and homeless. In a desperate act to save him, Olive attempts to uncover the victim’s name, as yet unknown. Even when he kills the poor man, the local cops on the scene are more impressed about meeting the legend, Joe Sharkey, than about the fate of the man on the bike. The narrative takes us back and forth, nonlinearly, through crucial traumas and events in Joe’s life—saga-like, an anti-hero’s journey, episodes that weave together over the course of the novel. His character was drawn well, although many of the secondary and tertiary characters seemed flat. If you can deep dive into Joe Sharkey’s life, and find an emotional connection, you will be more likely to engage. There were universal aspects of the story and its themes of mortality and redemption, and absolutely stunning figures of speech about the ocean, water, the waves, and surfing.“He learned to predict from the swell what a wave would do, by studying a break, reading it thoroughly, the inner life of its push, as if each length of wave were a line of poetry, each set a stanza, with its internal rhythm, so that he could insert himself into it, not waiting for the wave to accommodate him but something deeper, meeting it on his terms, finding harmony, becoming the wave.""3.4 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Apr 20, 2021","Apr 23, 2021","Apr 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53968508-under-the-wave-at-waimea

When her characters speak, it is as if they are talking directly to me, and that I am in the room with them. It is this feature of her writing that keeps me turning the pages. The plot here was thinly veiled and awfully convenient at intervals, creating the sense that I was also seeing the author behind a gauzy curtain. But, her strong voices held my attention. I was consistently engaged and curious, despite the flaws. Her themes resonate, specifically the themes of parents and their children, and the complex layers it entails.In the middle of the night in Boise, a shooter comes in and kills and maims numerous people in the tatty but iconic Ray’s Bar. We are off to a bang of a start right away--you don’t have to wait for the “ripped from the headlines” too long; the opening pages will suck you right in, wanting more. Hooper is adept at maintaining an edge and suspense to each character’s plight.The main players are Angie, a new mother married to Cale, who was at Ray’s that fateful night. Cale was seriously injured, but alive in an induced coma at the hospital ICU. Angie had no idea that Cale was there or even missing from the bed. Joyce, a widow, is the mother of the shooter, Jed. He turned the gun on himself after his shooting spree. Tessa, a young woman taking classes at university and working at Ray’s Bar to make ends meet, was saved that night when Cale directed her to run to the storage closet. She has a law school boyfriend that isn’t quite meeting her needs, especially after the shooting. She feels lonely now, alienated from the community at large, and fears doorways and exits, which is understandable.The chapters alternate primarily between these women, with a few chapters dedicated to victims, and Jed. However, it is not a crime novel or police procedural (we know who did it)—rather, it is a narrative about coping with loss and the burden of guilt. Each woman is frightened, grieving, and is bewildered by these extreme turns in their lives. And yet, there is a common thread of shame and loss that connects them all after the shooting. Hooper’s ability to mine the small details that raise provocative questions, and her keen eye on human behavior--love, loss, guilt, ambivalence, emotional paralysis, and the profound need to connect--that is what riveted me. And the author’s authentic use of dialogue kept the narrative robust rather than elegiac. There was always a trace of levity to balance the story.Hooper’s weakness was in unfolding the Tessa “mystery.” It was supposed to be a gradual reveal, but it was too predictable, and I guessed it instantaneously. The other central mystery was too much of an unrealistic stretch to accept. That, and other contrivances to push plot points, broadcast a straining toward a scripted outcome, one that leaned toward twee sentiment at times. Nevertheless, a lesser author would have blown the whole enchilada with these flaws. However, Hooper’s characters--their voices--were so genuine and affecting that my heart was squishy and soft by the end (minus the Epilogue, which I think was unnecessary).

Now, with ONCE THERE WERE WOLVES, shCharlotte McConaghy’s MIGRATIONS was a visceral, tragic book that blew me away and smashed every bone in my body. Now, with ONCE THERE WERE WOLVES, she has once again demonstrated what a powerhouse she is with storytelling and language. I'm fiercely passionate about this book. I’ve never read her much earlier work, but I see I must get started! WOLVES shook the earth while burrowing in it, covering it, climbing every tree and digging down to its roots, and sweeping in the calls and the whole of the forest, as well as the enigma and beauty of wolves. Through nature and nurture, man and woman and beast, the author shows us what it is to be human. I was speechless at the end of this book.Inti and her twin sister, Aggie, look exactly alike, and their distinct individual traits balance each other. Aggie is the wild one, and Inti the more pragmatic and grounded. Their mother is a cop who lives in Australia, and their dad, a wilderness expert and hermit, has moved on to Canada. We don’t know much at the beginning, as the backstory of the four of them is gradually revealed in the course of the book. The present takes place in the Scottish Highlands, where Inti and Aggie go to live. Inti makes it plain to the reader, through her narration, that Aggie suffered brutal trauma in Alaska, and Inti has brought the both of them to the Highlands, where Inti, an expert in wolves, is helping to reintroduce wolves to Scotland, aware that the mostly truculent farmers in the area will not be pleased. Inti’s efforts to explain how predators are necessary for the balance of the ecosystem are rejected by the citizens, and a division of fear and the fearless ensues. Inti’s team leads the wolves, closely monitored by the latest in digital technology. The secret to getting close to the wolves, as the twins’ father once taught them, is not to follow the predator—the wolf—but to follow the prey.Inti was born with a rare type of condition, mirror-touch synesthesia. She feels sensations of others when she sees it. If Aggie strokes her own cheek, Inti feels it on her cheek, too. If she sees a human or animal being touched, Inti experiences the same sensations in the same place. When Inti sees violence done to another, that violence is done to her, too. She senses the pain and the blood, (if there’s blood). If she watches a violent death, her body undergoes the same sensations (without her actually dying). McConaghy does a masterful job at mirror analogies—Inti and Aggie, identical twins, have a mirror-like relationship. Inti’s synesthesia physically bears out mirror effects. Moreover, Inti’s condition renders it possible for her to echo how the wolves feel sensation, which is both curse and a blessing in Inti’s work.The morsel of plot I shared is sufficient; readers will want to discover surprises for themselves. If you already read MIGRATIONS, the style—which is similar to WOLVES, may establish some ideas in your mind as you read. I want readers to alight upon that journey, too. And oh, what a journey! These twins. Well, as all great stories do to me--I twinned with the twins, with the story. These aren’t your typical, pedestrian “twin” tropes. Not the binary experience you may suspect.And there’s a romantic interest--Duncan, the Chief of Police—unlike any cop you have likely met. He’s a conundrum, also--cerebral, analytical, confounding, and with a terrible trauma in his past.Twins, predator, prey, ecosystem, past traumas--a nuanced vibration of tropes, will take you on this formidable and often dark journey into the heart of human drama, sometimes despair, yet other times a tender flame of light. McConaghy lays her foundation with a complex architecture that nevertheless develops as if it were effortless on her part. Inti’s voice is authentic, sinewy, resolute, and a force that fused with me on the very first page. Both her and Aggie are unforgettable, a global humanity personified. Their commitment to each other is primal and primeval; any covenant to others is eclipsed by their bond to each other.One of my favorite books was WOLF BORDER, by Sarah Hall. Hall’s novel has a strong female protagonist, the astonishing descriptions of the natural world in England’s Lake District, which is close to Scotland (and which led me to visit both the Lake District and Scotland!), and the inexplicable and anciently rooted behavior of the wolves. Threads are weaved in both books, without McConaghy’s book being derivative. WOLF BORDER would be a superb bookend to ONCE THERE WERE WOLVES. What a pair they make on my shelf, gazing at each other.The most stunning aspect of the wolf’s nature has to do with their memories. As humans, we can only recall memories from our minds--and they may be flawed, shuffled, or restored with revisionist mutation. But not wolves—they can pass their memories down to their descendants in their bodies. How unfathomable is THAT!“‘I’m studying the cognitive maps wolves make of their territories. They pass these geographic and temporal maps down through generations, and know their land so intimately that they go nowhere unless it’s deliberately. Wolves don’t wander. They move with purpose, and they teach their pups how to do the same. They can share the visual mental images with each other.’”Thank you, thank you, twice over, to Flatiron Books and Macmillan for sending me an ARC to read and ....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Apr 13, 2021","Apr 16, 2021","Apr 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52183392-once-there-were-wolves

The narrator, Daley, takes us through three personal decades, from the 1970s until 2008, and every word, sentence, and passage is resonant and bare. I thought Euphoria was my favorite of her novels, but this one is so spectacular and emotionally loaded, but with the lightest of eloquent touches, that I bow to King’s ability to bring me to my knees.In some ways this novel was deeply personal to me. Deduct the Harvard, the drinking, and the WASP bigot, and my own father emerges. The way that Daley’s father, Gardiner, treated her mother reminded me of how my father pointedly vitiated my mother after their divorce. I grew up in Massachusetts, beaches were a prominent place for us, and I could palpate the novel’s vibe of the country club set. Even though Gardiner was a WASP and bigot, and my family was Jewish, my father would almost smirk like Gardiner when Gardiner said, like a mantra, “I wonder what the poor people are doing today.” My father didn’t use those exact words, but he had that same outlook, that only the wealthy matter. Charm, chauvinism, sexism, and snobbery were part of Gardiner’s (and my father’s) character. My father’s addiction was women; Gardiner’s is alcohol. Daley respected her mother’s open and compassionate worldview, but she often struggled to keep both her mother and father in one frame. As a young girl, it was difficult to balance her love for both of them, so much was the tension between the two parents. Daley’s parents divorced when she was eleven (I was ten), and I remember the gutted feelings of a child of divorce expressed by Daley--wanting to be in my mother’s world, but feeling overshadowed and judged by my father. Needing his love and support, too, but it was always his to take away.As an adult, Daley made a life for herself in Michigan, far from her roots, and created her own “family” and sense of community. She has the love of her life standing by her, a true best friend, and a career about to skyrocket in academia. Her brother calls her that her father is essentially broken, at rock bottom, and Daley has to make some split-second, hair-raising decisions. There were times I wanted to cry out, to save her from herself, and I almost believed I could reach her, whisper my advice, change the text.This book seared me, like hot ice, and sliced my nerve endings, carved through to my soul, eating little nibbles of me on the way. Within the piercing narrative I also felt hope, though, inching its way into my heart. King’s precision and detail made it vivid, and her epic story was relatable and universal, about what it means to love and suffer a family.“…none of my knowledge will help me win a fight with my father. He will cling to his position even when all reason fails him; he will cling to it as if it’s his life and not his opinion that is in peril. He will get vicious and personal, and every negative thing he ever felt about me will pour out of his mouth. …His prejudices are a stew of self-hatred, ignorance, and fear. If those feelings could be rooted out and examined, maybe he wouldn’t have to drink so much to squelch the pain of them.”...more",Notes are private!,8,54,1,"Apr 09, 2021","Apr 13, 2021","Apr 13, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7444174-father-of-the-rain

Gentry, a young man on the autism spectrum, and very well-versed in medieval vernacular, knighthood, sword fighting, and the whole kingdom culture, is even building a castle! Through a chance event, he has met Zee (Zhorzha), a hot-tempered and flame-haired young woman who suffers from chronic pain sustained in a car accident. Gentry is her sworn “champion,” her personal knight in shining armor; he even speaks in 17th century English. Gentry follows “Lady Zhorzha” everywhere without being a stalker. Moreover, he has several competing voices in his head—the black knight, Hildegard, and Gawen. He’s ever Zee’s champion and protector when Zee learns that, during a prison escape, some dangerous men have apparently abducted her sister, LaReigne, who volunteers at that very prison. Gentry is ever loyal of Zee, although she is formidable and cheeky. Zee’s family and personal afflictions make it difficult for her to trust or be loyal to others. This is their story.Zee sometimes lives with her mother, an invalid and hoarder (Gentry calls her the “dragon,” although not maliciously, and Zee could be dragon-voiced herself!). The profound clutter at the house is horrifying and piteous. Zee’s father was convicted for bank robbery and murder, and died in prison. They lives on a slender thread of money, always on the verge of being broke, stressed by ongoing medical debts. In fact, the novel opens with Zee doing a weed run to Colorado for some extra cash. When her sister and the escapees are undetected by police, Zee decides to take matters into her own hands. Gentry is right by her side; Zee can’t seem to deter him.I won’t give away the plot, except to divulge that it is offbeat, exciting, and page turning. Zee and Gentry are fully three-dimensional, flaws and all. Much of Zee’s worries concern Marcus, LaReigne’s seven-year-old son, who she dearly loves. Over the course of the story, the overarching theme is about loyalty and trust--the way we gain it, and also the way we lose it. Gentry has a loving “second” family—his biological family is noxious and hateful. And they welcome Zee with open arms, are delighted that Zee accepts Gentry’s eccentric chivalry.At the end of the novel, Greenwood writes a letter to her readers, revealing that she drew from her own hardscrabble life. As well as dealing with a hoarder in the family, she grew up in Kansas, knows poverty, and suffered from chronic pain. Her father was also incarcerated. Moreover, she studied the Middle Ages at university, which is evidently why she was able to portray Gentry so authentically rather than as a caricature. The author likewise said that Zee is an outgrowth of herself--a redhead who is big-boned and thick-thighed, and had fury over the American healthcare system—how it could ruin you financially. One of the most captivating aspects of this quirky love story is that Gentry and Zee’s relationship is not based on such outward features as physical attraction or infatuation. It is the deeper aspects of commitment, loyalty, and trust that must sustain in order for them to thrive. Gentry is committed to his chivalry, his championing for Zee, but Zee is reticent to give and to trust.I picked this book up because I absolutely adored Greenwood’s novel, ALL THE UGLY AND WONDERFUL THINGS, one of my favorite books of that year. Readers, you won’t be disappointed with Reckless Oath, as it is another palpable human story of the stuff we are made of--the baggage we carry, our fealty to loyalty, and how it affects our lives. Written in alternating chapters by different characters, the narrative will grip you from start to finish. “My lady spake in a great dragon voice, all damped smoke and fury, and I feared for her. She wore her anger like a cloak of fire that burned none but herself.”4.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,"Apr 05, 2021not set","Apr 07, 2021not set","Apr 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51151747-the-reckless-oath-we-made

At first, I wasn’t sure if I would engage, as the protagonist, a young Swiss man born into wealth, is an amorphous character, vague even to himself. I’m not fond of nebulous main characters, but I settled into it once I realized that this is a coming-of-age story, one that may sting. Friedrich, the protagonist, travels from the safety of his Swiss home to Berlin, to attend art classes, to manifest a calling and some confidence, and acquire an articulate and coherent self. Naïve, Friedrich thinks he can temporarily live in Nazi Germany and remain untouched by its menace; he wants to take in their strength, their tenacity. Friedrich is decidedly not anti-Semitic, nor does he agree with Nazi ideology. He believes he can pick and choose the attributes that he admires, and disregard the ugly Nazi dogma.Friedrich meets an enigmatic woman named Kristin, who was the nude model in an art class he attended, and was almost immediately enchanted, especially as she was so forward and friendly. Don’t read the blurb on the book, which contains minor spoilers, although not the devastating twist. And devastating it is! Over the course of living in Berlin, he meets new people through Kristin, including a flamboyant man, Tristan, who frequents a “negro” jazz club. Tristan, Friedrich, and Kristin go there to listen to music and dance, and Friedrich observes that Kristin may be an alcoholic.This is a romance with an edge. There are also graphic displays of violence, although not gratuitous, and not pervasive. Most of it is suggested, like the interspersed and italicized information bulletins about the “accused” and a “witness”—briefings of Jews that were captured and sent to the death camps, and some who managed to escape. It reminds you bluntly that Nazi Germany is to be feared if you are Jewish.The prose is stark, like the story. Even if you’ve read dozens, or hundreds of Nazi Germany stories—both fact and fiction—this storyline will shatter you--an astonishing denouement. I was demolished. For much of the story, I remained at a distance, at arm’s length, a vicarious onlooker to Friedrich and Kristin’s oddball love story. However, I never lost interest. I think Würger kept us coolly restrained from the story, until we weren’t--it equates how the German civilians were remote from the horrors that gripped the country, too. Looking back, we can’t imagine that Germans were oblivious to Hitler’s deeds. But, at the time, many were just trying to survive and emerge out of poverty. Gradually, Friedrich is directly shocked by unimaginable events, and I sympathized with his plight as the story unfolded.

I’ve always wanted to go there, and did make it to Scotland, but to go to Orkney or the Shetlands is a major trip in itself. Benson’s novel truly installed me there, with the protagonist, Ed Beech, a gentle giant of a guy, a builder with a love of cooking. He lives in Bermondsey (Southeast London), and after doing some work for Marcus, a wealthy businessman, Ed is invited to work on the businessman’s recently buried father’s house, to get it in shape for sale. Ed packs his truck and takes off for Stromness in the Orkney Islands for two weeks of work. The narrative covers primarily those two weeks. It’s a real sleeper of a tale--or should be. Witty and wonderful.Benson’s story isn’t a big, splashy suspense tale or epic drama. Rather, it is a finely tuned, spare and tersely written narrative about what is possible for two people from disparate worlds. The book blurb doesn’t spoil the reader’s discovery, so I won’t, either. I’ll just say that it was a delight to read. Benson carves out an atmospheric and intimate tale of people reaching out, even when others don’t.There’s a mini-mystery about a missing bowl, too, one worth twenty thousand pounds and made by Lucie Rie. The landscape is authentic, as well as all the places the book takes you, like the Neolithic Standing Stones of Stenness near Stromness, and the monolithic Setter Stone. Don’t be surprised if you also get hungry, with the delicious and hearty meals that Ed cooks up or eats elsewhere. And his new friendship with Marcus’ sister, Claire, is fetching and organic, in keeping with the intimate atmosphere of the book. Their meals are delicious and they go on small adventures; occasionally, Ed has to face his fears of big hulking ships and farm animals. He regrets his poor performance as a student, but possesses a curious nature. Well-traveled, Ed enjoys a touch of art and culture, and a satisfying beer. It's a quick and absorbing read, narrated by Ed. Here is an example of the prose:“My dad is Jack. He’s big and bald. Have a look at his neck. He likes his food. I’m Ed. I like my food, but in a different way to the way dad likes it. He likes it because it tastes good and fills him up. I like it because I like to think about it, read about it, cook it and eat it. I should also say that I’m bigger than Dad. People can see me coming. I don’t lumber in but I can be useful. I don’t work out but I keep fit. That’s being a builder for you…When I was at school I was called ‘Oi’ but only once.”Crisp, confiding, convivial, and clever without being cunning, Ed’s story and Claire’s bubbled up and made me smile a lot, and feel wistful. Ed and Claire are more amusing and refreshing than their work. It's their thoughts, dialogue, and action that will lure you in throughout.

Initially, it seemed a dystopian speculative suburbia story—the main events take place in 2027, and it is interspersed with media and scholarly reports 10-15 years later, after the fact (up to 2043), editorializing and analyzing the culminating events that led to “The Maple Street Murders.” The author’s style of writing was primarily sharp and terse; however, the denouement felt too blunt, too on the nose, and ungainly. And it started off as one genre, and ended up somewhere else. I won’t say which genre, as I don’t want to reveal spoilers. But, it starts with a groupthink type upper middle-class area on Long Island, where heat, a sinkhole, and mob rule bear itself out. It gripped me from the first page. The crescent-shaped neighborhood is pictured on a map, with the inhabitants listed for each address. Most families are white, with an Indian-American family, the Singhs. There is one gay couple, two women and their son. These variations seemed like tokens to demonstrate that the community accepted all races and lifestyles. On July 4, 2027, there are 18 families and 72 people. As the chapters progress, the zeal for living on Maple Street is reduced. Also, a sinkhole has appeared in the park, the hot bitumen spreading its guts and oil up and over the hole. The kids who play near there dare each other to get closer.Not everyone is accepted equally, which creates tension for the neighborhood and suspense for the reader. Rhea Schroeder, the Queen Bee of Maple Street, is a college professor living there with her oddball husband and children. Her dark past is gradually revealed to the reader. It is only because of Rhea that the Wildes aren’t complete outcasts. Rhea befriended Gertie Wilde, a former beauty pageant winner. Gertie’s husband, Arlo, is a former rock star and recovered heroin addict. They don’t fit in—their messy house, his tattoos, Gertie’s lack of formal education, and their kids. Julie is loud and impulsive, and her little brother, Larry, is on the spectrum and plays “pocket pool” in public (my words).After Rhea, drunk as usual, divulges too much to Gertie, she regrets it and ghosts Gertie. When that happens, the groupthink suburbia starts throwing shade on the Wildes, too, until they are truly treated as reprobates, complete with ugly rumors. The sinkhole gets worse, swallows, so to speak, a dog, people start leaving, and those who stay are like a Greek chorus or a mob. The adults deplore whoever Rhea deplores, and only some of the kids think and act like individuals (sometimes).Langan does a superb job of laying out her premise—the heat, the sinkhole, the gossipy, judgmental suburbanites, and the petty and tribal behaviors that pollute the neighborhood. I enjoyed the action and events up to the climax, where it broke down for me. It’s not that the author failed to set it up, but I thought she was more nuanced and would surprise us with a penetrating finale. Instead, it felt too busy, messy, dizzying, and pointless—something I thought that she would not do. Perhaps in a movie or series, it could work--all that chaos given proportion. I was disappointed, and it almost ruined the rest of the novel for me. It went from classy to the lowest hanging fruit. The innovative yet familiar beginning went with standard and easy. Also, the interspersed news and academic articles didn’t fit once I came to the end. It boiled down to red herrings or total misguidance, which was inconsistent with the rest of the story.

Yet, there’s a wink! wink! there, as the therapist tells us a lot about her/his own feelings, and background, and history. And if you think that Natalia, the patient, is an unreliable narrator, you may also find yourself questioning the reliability of the therapist’s version of events. It’s intriguing to read the ongoing therapist/patient relationship, and Finnish to English translator David Hackston brings Lindstedt’s clear and lucid prose to life.The therapist has a modern and self-made theory of “layering,” allowing the patient to “uncover different strata of memories and layer them up again.” In other words, create new associations and dissolve the threatening or damaging meanings to Natalia’s memories through the therapist’s methodology. The therapist does this by adding key words, supporting words, that Natalia is suppose to use during these exercises. As the novel progresses, the layering technique comes into sharper focus.Natalia is assertive and controlling. She brings a giant alarm clock to the sessions, places it on her chest, and, in a reverse-role quirk, she tells the therapist when the time is up. There’s also a mystery between them. An unusual painting hanging in the therapist’s office, translated to Ear-Mouth, painted by an artist who disappeared without a trace, once belonged to Natalia’s grandmother, she says. She tells the story of how her grandmother acquired it, when the paint was barely dry, and the therapist is intrigued. The therapist bought it at auction. There are subtle hints to how Ear-Mouth parallels the therapist and patient relationship.If you are queasy about graphic sexual content, you may want to skip this one. However, the significance of the pornographic details isn’t gratuitous. The layering methodology during these sessions brings Natalia’s issues into sharp relief—eventually—not just through the sexual scenes, but also through language, family dynamics, and environment. There were many times I was nonplussed or frustrated and impatient, because I thought I was losing the thread of where this was going. However, if you stay with it, which isn’t hard to do--as the story builds severity and tension—it all makes flawless sense during the denouement. The therapeutic sessions build successively on the one preceding it, although at times, Natalia seems unfathomable, yet so humanly troubled that you can relate to her.“I don’t know what your childhood was like, Doctor, but in my childhood we all rummaged around in paper recycling bins because we thought we might find something forbidden, something that we had no business holding in our hands. And, which, for that very reason, belonged to us. Adults kept close guard over their secrets, and that’s why we needed secrets, too. Besides, secrets weren’t secrets…if their betrayal wouldn’t have destroyed anything. Secrets need to have a destructive power. Do you understand?”Unique, and yet familiar, filled with the power of language, action, artistic and cultural properties, and the poignancy of a doctor/patient relationship.

That sums up the Nasr family’s approach, living apart from each other due to guilt, shame, and relationship issues. Mazna (from Damascus) and Idris (from Beirut) met in the 70s, while Mazna was doing local theater, dreaming of becoming a famous actress, and Idris was in medical school, pursuing a career as a surgeon. They met through friends, and Idris fell instantly for Mazna when he saw her onstage. Now it is (pre-pandemic) contemporary times, and Mazna and Idris have lived in Blythe, California for nearly four decades, and their three children are scattered around the globe. This is their story.The Nasr family FaceTimes and Zooms, calls and texts each other, from a distance, but the secrets they carry erect an invisible wall that they hide behind, and from one another. But now Idris’ father has died, and he wants to sell the ancestral home in Beirut. The urgency and the looming past create a reluctant gathering at the old house. The prologue, as well as subsequent chapters, often gives away a climactic event, so it isn’t about “What is going to happen?” Rather, the intrigue lies in the reactions, conflicts, and fears when secrets are mounting to the surface. Events are periodically predictable, but it doesn’t diminish the tension. It’s all about the characters and theme. Can you go home? What is home? How do shameful secrets destroy you, and when is it fitting to reveal these buried skeletons? Who can you trust, and have you betrayed or been betrayed? How does trauma affect the next generation? The narrative alternates characters and time periods, gradually filling in everyone’s backstory. Mazna’s story is the most blistering and dramatic.ARSONIST’S CITY is epic, emotional, tragic, and redemptive. Ava is the oldest child of Mazna and Idris, a mother of two little ones, struggling in her marriage. The middle child, Naj, left America for Beirut after graduating college, and became a celebrity rock star. But she knows the industry is fickle, whimsical. Moreover, she keeps secrets from her family, and sleeps around a lot. Mimi is the boy, the baby, but as an adult he is flailing in Austin, trying to make it as a musical artist, but jealously not up to his sister’s talent. His relationship with his long-time girlfriend, Harper, is stagnant.Mazna, Idris, and their three kids (and Ava’s two children and Harper) meet in Beirut in the house that Idris grew up in and wants to sell. However, the rest of the family conflicts with Idris, are horrified, and want the home to stay in the family. Throughout this summer of togetherness, the narrative reaches down deeper, and mines their lives, past and present. But it is Mazna’s story that gives the narrative its heft. And, even as she grew up during war between Syria and Lebanon, and the occupation of Beirut by Syria, Mazna experiences the war from a place of safety, as if she is witnessing a ten-car pileup outside the window of her own intact vehicle. This story isn’t about war, but it is part of the landscape and affects all its citizens. Mazna dreams of a career in America, a place she can be a serious thespian and play any role.“Films make people sad, Mazna is slowly understanding. They remind people of a time that is over or a time they’ve never been part of…Theater is the same. It’s heartbreaking because it will end, because people will become a part of the story and then be abandoned by it. She’s aware of this during rehearsals as she repeats the same lines…learning to let her hands flutter naturally, playing with tone and volume. She’s lying to a roomful of people. She is going to break their hearts.” Read it and weep!...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 18, 2021","Mar 22, 2021","Apr 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48930261-the-arsonists-city

The corporate interests of a (fictional) oil corporation, Pexton, has exploited their land and killed its children with surplus toxic waste. Oil spills, gas pipe leaks, and other deadly hazards and chemicals have eradicated half the child population, by slowly poisoning their water. The adults don’t get sick, and they bury their babies and the babies of their friends and family. The population feels helpless in the face of these oil tyrants, and one member is even in cahoots with them. This is the epic story of a people who choose to fight back, in small and, later, more activist measures by an unforgettable character named Thula.Mbue’s writing is lyrical and intimate, and is deeply satisfying to read. “We had no Sakani for guidance, no one to help us comprehend what we were living through, so we crawled from one day to the next, too weakened to rise. How could we have been so reckless as to dream?...Because we carry the blood of men who stood on a land between two rivers and received it from the Spirit?...If our forefathers had known of the oil beneath their feet, would they have so gladly bequeathed it to us? They thought we’d never know such degradation, because we carry the blood of the leopard, but if they had seen the extent of our enemies’ powers, their beliefs would have turned to ashes.”I said it reads like a fable, but the thrust of the story is true, for many in poor or unfortunate African villages, for people who lacked the sophisticated urbanization of first world countries that came to exploit them. But this story isn’t just about being victimized--the character of Thula, a bright and courageous woman, will disabuse you of that notion.

What a living sea of waking dreams, of nightmares. Australian writer Flanagan is suis generis, and unassuming, and the narrative so full of the vulnerable that I couldn’t help but weep. The story concerns Anna, her mother, Francie, her brothers Tommy and Terzo, and their dead brother, Ronnie. It takes place primarily in Tasmania, same as Gould’s Book of Fish. The time is now, but yet is speculative. Inside, Francie is dying, but outside, species are vanishing, the island is aflame, Tasmania is on fire, the smoke everywhere, obscuring everything. Inside, Anna notices a missing finger, also a vanishing. Outside, the noise—the construction is noisy, news is noisy, Instagram and Facebook are screaming. Fog, heavy fog is all around them. Anna looks down at her phone and up at her mother.This family is heartbreaking, the various tragedies powerful and weighty. And now, as their elderly mother lay dying, they refuse to allow nature to take its course. I was a hospice nurse for several years, so I get it. But you don’t have to be a hospice worker to comprehend the misuse of medicine here. Out of shame, guilt, irony, and fear, the family insists on extending her life via modern technology/medicine, instead, they are extending her death. A living corpse. Francie is vanishing, birds are vanishing, snakes, trees—but the phones and social media are very much at hand. Time is burning.“Everything seemed to be in danger of slipping away once inside; time went too quickly…days passing in hours, or time did not move at all, and seconds took decades to pass…plastic gurneys, strangers in scrubs, patient monitors, ventilators, defibrillators, ECG machines, anaesthesia machines…beeping machinery…as if the entire system existed not to keep the patients going, but, rather, the patients existed to keep the system going.”The novel is about more than Francie dying/not dying. Francie’s condition on the pages is like a valve that opens or a dam that bursts and a vehicle for the reader to peer further inside the paradoxes and sadness of this family and the state of the planet, without platitudes or judgment by the author. The author stands back, doesn’t interfere, although it is his construct and architecture of voice and narrative that shatters and indwells the reader into this epochal, earth-shaking story.Flanagan is a master of language, cadence. Periodically, no periods. Unpunctually, no colons commas semicolons. The clarity comes from the spaces separating words. The very opacity enumerates specificity. I often read it out loud, to hear it more effectively, like dialogue in a play. The ambiguous and outwardly toneless, flat, or obscure sentences are in fact some of the most distinct, nuanced, and specific. If you locate the author’s intended emphasis, you’ll perceive its precision and theatrical, poetic grace. You can’t rush in with your own presumptive cadence. Of the sentences not punctuated, let go, and you arrive where he intends for you to pause, to stop, to exclaim, to flutter up or tone it down. What to do with the spaces between words? To remove the space, so to speak? To emphasize it? To soften it, shout, pause, or stop? It’s part of the tone and voice, and a phenomenon of the story. Follow Flanagan’s lead, not your own. You’ll read it best when you’re vulnerable.Beginnings, endings, life, death, climate change, extinction, love, loss—if this sounds too broad, in Flanagan’s hands it is masterful and assiduous, and most of all, emotionally compelling.

Well, the sharply rendered and accurate/organic human elements are spot-on, and the psychological and psychoanalytical aspects were deeper than I expected. My only complaint is that the sci-fi parts were not necessary. I won’t give away what that is, but I thought it made plot turns too handy, when it would have worked as ongoing metaphor instead. But I did thoroughly enjoy the book!The narrative covers trauma and secondary infliction that triggers the primary trauma. It also features a subject matter that is only starting to move into mainstream consciousness—intergenerational trauma. I think the author could have more deeply emphasized that aspect, rather than highlight it and then detract from its intricacy by injecting implausible elements. Romano-Lax could have been more powerful by sticking to credible actions and plot. She did such a superb job of creating a complex tale of trauma without melodrama for most of the story, which drew me in from beginning to end. The thrumming pace kept me in its groove.The sprinkling of Annie Oakley sections shined, and contains surprises. Her trauma from a train accident ignited earlier trauma. It isn’t about her sharpshooting qualities; it’s about who she is as a person trying to reconcile her past abuse. The main and contemporary character, Ruth McClintock, survived her mother’s death from cancer, her sister’s suicide, and a break-up with a fiancée following a terrible car accident. Her journey to normalcy is fraught by unresolved issues that obstruct her from moving forward. She’s just a young woman trying to get her head on straight after a ton of extraordinary bad shit happened to her. She’s portraying millions of others who are crippled by severe trauma.“You can’t go forward without going back…You can’t go back without going forward.” This is a sensitive portrayal of individual and linked trauma, and the associated feelings of confusion, desire for revenge, anger, and emotional paralysis. Moreover, the tone of the story is sincere, while the toll of trauma on the characters is scrupulous and articulate, assured and solid. Romano-Lax weaved in the historical ""faction"" brilliantly. But, more importantly, she focused on the intimate connections of trauma to seemingly unconnected people, and their personal sense of disconnect. Moreover, certain secondary characters understand how trauma can be trivialized:“You and I both know what happens to genocide that’s already been processed and monetized by Hollywood so many times that it doesn’t give modern people nightmares, when it should.” “It feels wrong to pull some of those emotional strings. It’s too easy to make people squirm and hurt. Harder to make them think.”You can’t deal with the present until you resolve the past, and the future is dim if your present is untenable. The characters conveyed that organically. So why the tacked on magic carpet ride? It came off as twee, too cute for the grounded earth the author was on. The irony is that I think Romano-Lax underestimated herself by leaning on sci-fi elements. In a less skilled author, I’d give 3.5 at the most.

It isn’t for everyone, but it hit a sweet spot for me. It was unfamiliar, foreign, colorful, erotic, and otherworldly at times. The protagonist is a Black American professor, Shay, who married an older Italian entrepreneur, Senna. On his urging, they buy a vacation villa in a small (fictional) beach village, Naratrany, in Madagascar, as newlyweds in the latter part of the 90s. They are both multilingual (but don’t speak the island languages), and live in Milan, but return to the villa during two month-long vacations annually. The novel covers over two decades in their life, especially at their villa, Red House.Before I talk about the book, I’ll mention the structure. Each chapter has an intriguing title, my favorite being Elephants’ Graveyard. At times, I felt that I was reading a series of vignettes, although there was always Shay as a through line and it followed a mostly linear flow. But some of the chapters could also be lifted from the book and made into it’s own very short story, so I wasn’t surprised when I found out that at least one was actually just that, in the New Yorker. But it didn’t diminish the story for me.Shay feels awkward at first, being a “mistress” of a house with the Black staff subordinated to her—much connection in her head with slavery. She does make a good friend in Bertine the head housekeeper, who notices that Shay and Senna fight a lot (they only squabble in Madagascar, not in Milan), and Bertine steps in to help Shay. This is when it gets exotic and speaks to the animism beliefs of the island inhabitants. Shay attends a ceremony that had me holding my breath a few times.Over the decades, Bertine remains Shay’s closest confidante. Senna is often on fishing expeditions or business ventures when they are in Naratrany. He’s got libertine tendencies—he and Shay are very different individuals. They have two children, who travel with them during the vacations, and grow up with native Naratranians, ex-pats, and Europeans and others who came to the island. The children aren’t a prime ingredient of the narrative; mostly it is about Shay and her perspective, experiences, and relationship with Senna and the way she interacts with her staff and others on the island, especially Bertine, my second favorite character.Madagascar is a complex place with layers of class structure and social sensibilities. And sex between islanders and people of other cultures plays a large part— part of survival, too. Often, the story questions its own morality and perspective, which is done with ease in third-person limited POV. No narrator broadcasts or tells you what to think or judge about the characters--only as it pertains to Shay’s own learning curve and evolving comprehension. Moreover, it is not a traditional arc storyline—you just have to follow it wherever it leads you.Andrea Lee is both erudite and allusive in her prose, often including snippets of French or Italian (some on the island speak French). There are also superbly incorporated references to songs, poems, and literature from all over the world. I felt smarter as I progressed. :) Mostly, I enjoyed the unique assortment of individuals and concerns of the various characters that come to Red House, which is the focal point of the novel. Lee’s sense of place is scintillating, sensual, gripping, as are her figures of speech and descriptions.“Madagascar has its own fabulously complex identity…Building on such terrain has consequences: attachments root and expand in unexpected corners, the way that a tough network of sea grapes can cover a whole beach.”If you are up for a strange and fascinating journey, with a vivid, chimerical, spirit-infused culture, and a reading experience that bends beyond the usual borders, I recommend you give this book a go. The final page, in its action, may have been a bit twee, but I understood it in a more sublime sense, too. Themes of heritage, family, acceptance, love, and betrayal are addressed--juicy to the core, but nuanced, and dream-like at its edges.Thank you to the publishers at Scribner for sending me a copy....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Feb 26, 2021","Mar 04, 2021","Mar 05, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54304139-red-island-house

The author has written a raw, elegiac character study that is affecting, memorable, and rare. Fuller impressed me with her sense of place in Bitter, the rundown mansion where you can smell the rotting fruit in the garden. In Unsettled Ground, the lush backdrop is a humble cottage on the fringes and surrounded by the natural world, which has always been familiar and welcoming to 51 year-old twins Julius and Jeanie. The setting, like in Bitter, is almost a character itself. Prepare for an unhurried tale of subdued emotions, gradual reveals, and a mixture of implied and lashing violence.The twins have always lived in the same rural place with their mother, Dot, on the outskirts of English society, literally and figuratively, a marginalized family constrained by pecuniary circumstances—and yet, they have managed to carve out a life that is independent, resilient, and content on their terms. Moreover, Jeanie plays guitar and Julius plays the fiddle, so there is often music in the abode. They tend the garden and grow their own vegetables (no coincidence that their last name is Seeder), which they sell from their garden and to an upscale deli. Julius also works odd jobs for straight cash. The Seeder's father died years ago, which will be poignantly revealed in stages, for us and, to an extent, the twins. Since his death, the landlord, Rawson, has allowed them to stay at the cottage rent-free. In the opening pages, in surreal prose, Dot dies suddenly from a stroke, another trauma for Julius and Jeanie to bear. Rawson’s wife, a bitter and haughty woman, informs them they will now pay rent. Exacerbating this, when they discover the cost of the funeral, the outside world infringes on their peace. Fuller keenly exposes the shame placed upon them, and the steps they are forced to take to bury their mother. Jeanie prefers her interdependence and solitude with Julius and Dot and their dog. However, Julius is increasingly drawn to the outside world and romance, which threatens the close bond and interior life they have led, and which Jeanie strives to keep. Both have fragilities that are well described. Yet their strength, music, and imagination have always defended them, and they prevailed in their daily routine. But now that Dot is dead, the center is disturbed, and the exterior becomes interior. Their resiliency is challenged, imperiled.Folks have different coping skills, and Julius and Jeanie are no exception. What Fuller does is embed you with these disenfranchised characters, so that each insult to their wellbeing, every wound, becomes re-bruised. The song says, “The first cut is the deepest,” but the twins know that every subsequent laceration is a sharp refrain. What will sustain here--that’s the overriding question. Their effort to reach beyond their usual borders creates synergy with the reader; you will deeply feel what’s at stake. And Fuller’s prose will transport you to painfully sequestered emotional places, like this quake from Jeanie:“The creature is in her throat. If she opens her mouth wide enough and screams, it will come sliding out, newborn and slippery, ready to fight.”This is for literature lovers who are prepared for a quietly disturbing tale. Plenty of unsettled ground. Fuller is a master of language and voice.Thank you to Nanci at Tin House for sending me an ARC....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Feb 23, 2021","Feb 26, 2021","Mar 02, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53341634-unsettled-ground

They often merge and blur for me, many devoid of distinction. But then there’s Kirstin Valdez Quade, who created an imaginative, exciting, and richly textured story that conveys the fearsome weight of familial love. The Padilla family in rural New Mexico threaded its way into my heart and I hurt when they bled, wept when they cried, and rooted for their hard won humble triumphs. As I inhabited them for a year in these 400+ pages (that fly too fast), I became a resident in their lives. I didn’t want to leave them; I dreaded a final page. It opens with 33 year-old Amadeo, a single drifter, jobless and alcoholic, still living with his mother. He has decided that playing Jesus this year in the annual Holy Week celebration will provide redemption for his lost soul, which includes a simulacrum of the crucifixion. (And Amadeo is the same age that Jesus was on the crucifixion.) He’s a failed father about to become a grandfather to his 16 year-old daughter’s baby, and he is ill-equipped and full of shame for his inadequacies. Angel, nine months pregnant, has had a falling out with her mother, Marissa (Amadeo’s ex), and comes to live with Amadeo and her beloved grandmother, Yolanda. Yolanda is the rock of the family, who sacrifices her own wellbeing to a fault. She enables Amadeo’s immaturity because she, too, is lost on how to help him. Everyone has a dark past, and secrets are kept while mistakes are made. Each hopes that baby Connor will be the glue that brings this rocky family together.Valdez Quade’s characters are so brimming, alive, authentic and sympathetic that they affirmed what it is to be human, flaws and all. Angel, struggling to protect and nurture Connor while obtaining her GED in a teen mothers’ program, has conflicted feelings about her own parents, who failed to be positive role models while she was a child. “Watching her mother with her son, Angel felt compassion that vexed her, because she doesn’t owe her mother anything—compassion least of all. Is this what motherhood means? Being suddenly able to pity the adults in your life?”Roles are periodically tested, opposed, and reversed. Family members withhold, fall apart, come together. Get ready, as you will be installed in everyone’s head and heart from start to finish. Themes of love, betrayal, substance abuse, parenting, and the question of redemption prevail throughout the novel, with characters that are both universal and specific.

Mihalic sets up a suspenseful narrative, as far as keeping the reader on edge throughout the novel. The story is not boring--it is rather exciting--although melodramatic--and I suspect that any reader will be turning the pages with anticipation and horror, as the author intended. My concern is that the text and voice do not contain the gravitas and nuance that would be necessary to convey for a child such as this one, abused repeatedly since age six by the person she should trust the most. That is what kept me out of the realm of believing that this was credible.A friend suggested that perhaps Roan is an outlier, with her ability to keep it together; moreover, she is able to have a healthy relationship with a loving boyfriend. He isn’t just a caring, compassionate, attractive teenager—he is wise beyond his years. Girls such as Roan are plausibly unable to have a healthy relationship, especially with no therapy, no emotional/familial support, no security, and, in DARK HORSES, the expectation to win every horse riding competition that she is in (and often does). I suppose that there are a few blind people who can drive—but is that the stakes that this author is trying to set up? If I were a sexually abused teen, and I read this book, I would feel even worse about myself for failing to accomplish what Roan does. There’s no screed that obligates the author to write this in a specific way, but I was still hoping that she would aim at a more realistic portrait of what to expect of this protagonist. She’s more than a mere survivor in DARK HORSES. Every day, she gets stronger (and again, without the help of therapy or family support) and more capable. She hasn’t told her boyfriend about her father raping her on a daily basis, but she straddles both worlds carefully.Roan describes the pain, physically and psychically, and some of her more complex, incongruous emotions, but it felt author-inserted rather than authentic. But, if you have never encountered someone like Roan, you may be piqued, as Mihalic excels at pacing and structure. It also leans toward a YA voice and approach, even thought the content is for mature audiences—perhaps it is meant to be inclusive. What the author lacks in subtlety and credibility, she makes up by being more graphic as we move to the latter part of the novel. However, these graphic events happened to Roan for the past ten years (she is 16), but by saving the most harrowing scenes for later in the story, the reader is manipulated into feeling that the stakes are higher and more urgent toward the climax, when they have been just as emergent all along.Story-wise, the only reason that Roan doesn’t report her father is that she doesn’t want to give up her goals of being a professional champion horse rider. Her father is wealthy and owns this horse farm, which allows her to pursue her dream. So—but for her aspirations, she would turn her father into the authorities? In actuality, girls don’t report their fathers for more complicated reasons of guilt, shame, and fear. This reduced it to a rich girl’s problem, even though the author didn’t intend that. Considering Roan’s circumstances, and how damaged she is, she is way more level-headed and emotionally appropriate than most girls her age that aren’t abused. No problem with boundaries, no cutting or other self-harm, no actual suicide attempts. Even when she drinks, it doesn’t exceed amounts of many rebellious teens. It feels contrived so that Roan can possess some kind of verified self-destructive behavior. Ironically, however, when Roan is triggered, she usually gets more determined and resolute as the pages turn, even though she hasn’t had an ounce of expert help.The interval that she keeps her boyfriend at arm’s length is to keep the secret, and she keeps the secret so she can be a champion. There’s compartmentalizing, sure, but that survival instinct that kicks in often leads to disassociation in girls suffering this ritual abuse; but with Roan, it keeps her externally poised, sufficiently enough to continue the charade. The author wants too reductive a dissonance between her truth and the fiction she lives. To depict contrast? She’s just too unflappable to the wider world. Notwithstanding the abuse, she successfully achieves at just about everything. It doesn’t bleed over messily as it should to be convincing. No adults see any signs—the social worker at the hospital was a plot ploy more than substantive.I don’t know who to recommend this book to, other than young, naïve teens, to introduce them to this subject matter. I’m conflicted there, too, since I didn’t feel it was genuine—Roan had the cynosure of all eyes. The author was attempting to demonstrate that Roan was perceived as an envied teen although a victim of daily assault--the contrast. And then a Hollywood ending, a Cinderella finale, which is disingenuous and undermines the subject matter. I just didn’t buy it. Mihalic has talent, and I would like to read a novel by her with a different premise. She certainly has a gift for pacing, rhythm, and structure of a suspense story.Thank you to Scout Press and Netgalley for an advanced digital copy...more",Notes are private!,0,19,2,"Feb 03, 2021not set","Feb 06, 2021not set","Feb 22, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50892208-dark-horses

Every page seems to have a motif, metaphor, or parallel in this eco-climate-fiction bildungsroman. This red-haired, ironic, vulnerable, and reckless young protagonist spends the searing heat-wave summer of 2013 answering calls at a distress dispatch center, answering, “Emergency police, fire, or ambulance,” making sure to keep her voice neutral and impersonal. She’s the thrice-great granddaughter of John Oxley, an explorer from the 1800s who spent much of his life searching for the mythical inland sea of Australia (millions of years too late—as it had dried up that long ago). That mythical inland sea is now a dry, hot red centre. The protagonist indulges in blackout drinking, unprotected sex, and hazardous hook ups with an ex- whom she fictionally named Lachlan, like the sea that Oxley traveled. Oxley and his ilk, who “believed in the warm, wet center opening its legs out there is the heart of the dead, dry country,” is a perfect parallel of the male violence to the land during 19th century exploration, and the predatory male that is often accepted now, by women who “ask for it,” as the narrator hears a co-worker spew. There’s a lot of symmetry in this novel that ties the narrator’s body to bodies of land and water. Bodies hot, planet ringed with fire. And everyone/thing defies their parameters.As she saves up to leave Australia for California, a place she chose “because it is nothing to do with me,” she engages in evermore self-destructive behavior as she recollects key events of her childhood—her father’s drug-addiction, his abuse of her mother, her mother’s heavy drinking, land destruction in the fires of '94, and the protagonist’s current precarious but regulated relationship with her mother now. Although the climate disasters of 2013 are heady, I was swept away with how Watts drew the portrait of her main character—so intimate and also simultaneously veiled and apart, especially dispossessed of herself. She knew that she was reckless—the bruises on her body from sex, chunks of hair loss from stress, and her emotional state from being with her ex, and yet she tries to treat it all as endurable. Lachlan is an insufferable, indecisive young man, who sleeps beneath a poster of Patrick White. He is also a struggling writer, and holds her back emotionally, as she allows it. Simultaneously restrained and yet lacking boundaries in this endless summer of emergencies, “Emergency police, fire, or ambulance.”You could write a thesis on this novel, heavy with allusions and paradox, but teeming on every page, I feel, with the narrator’s search for safety in the danger, a strong line not to cross. “My mother could not give me a self-contained narrative. ...In a narrative there would be a clear ending. The scene would fade to black, the curtain would come down, the paragraph would break. ...But our lives contain no line breaks...real life is just sheer bloody continuity.” “The excruciating thing is that time carries on and you love them anyway.”Watts brilliantly closes in on the theme of bodies and boundaries, both personal and earthly, and the accelerating crisis in both. Male predators, casual misogyny, penetration. We’ve ravaged the land, and climate crisis is raging with disasters; the young woman is calling out soundlessly for help as she watches this unfold. The heat climbs and fires jump their containments. No boundaries, no safety. Hair on fire. A phenomenal novel I could read again and again and get something new out of it every time.

Her mother fiercely controlled Rachel’s calories as a child with a refrain that, “No boy will want you” if she gets chubby. It was extreme and cruel, and now, as a 24 year-old adult trying to make it as a stand-up comic in LA, schlepping through a battle with loneliness and self-imposed strict calorie counting, she spends her days counting the hours between bites, and trying to deflect her intrusive mother’s calls. Rachel despises her therapist, her mother, her life, and her low self-esteem. Then she meets Orthodox Jew Miriam, who loves her own mother and is blissfully overweight. Rachel subsequently tosses her restricted lifestyle away for the chance of love--from Miriam, and Miriam’s close and friendly family.If I were a Gen Z reader, and not a Boomer, I might have grooved with this novel, unrestrained. It’s got familiar coming-of-age tropes and a mostly formulaic arc, (with a few surprises), charming for 20-something readers looking to relate. Lots of quivering sex. I admire Broder’s talent for characterization and her self-directed ending.However, it felt like her storyline/plot/narrative was an idea in search of a voice. The voice often sounded disembodied from the characters, i.e. there was no true chemistry between any of the characters, although Broder created an imaginative cast. The story felt assembled and constructed, the writer's craft of harnessing voice with characters and story incongruent. But it tried, and the author truly has talent and nerve. She wrote many quotable, witty and poignant passages and dead-on observations.“I wanted another mama, a fictional one… …My wish for that mama had always been a response to an absence.”Melissa Broder also shines in her use of Jewishness with Yiddish and Hebrew axioms, totems, and taboos (I was raised Jewish so it hit home). I laughed out loud with references that brought to mind my own family. Themes of independence, gender issues, and family dysfunction was raised both comically and gently affecting; however, Rachel's struggle with food was expedited too softly, too swiftly for a lifetime eating disorder.I don’t want to seem negative in my assessment of this novel, as I readily turned the pages in my empathy toward Rachel and Miriam. Broder imbues a bit of manic Portnoy and other Semitic, psychosexual writers with vivid description, and she understands the 20-something lifestyle and landscape. Moreover, she tackles universal problems with a rabbity flair. MILK FED is a satisfying novel for Gen Z-ers.

Both those definitions categoricallyForegone, as dictionary definition: 1) that has gone before; previous; past.2) determined in advance; inevitable. Both those definitions categorically apply to Russell Banks’ latest novel, a story of the past, present and the inevitable. Banks’ use of the lexicon is searing and powerful; every page that you open has quotable passages and sentences, and ultimately refers to the protagonist, Leonard Fife, and his memories. A Canadian American documentary muckraking filmmaker, Leonard Fife is dying of cancer, and he desperately wants to tell his wife the truth of his past. As he does so on camera, in a documentary about him, he pleads for his wife, Emma, to be in the room, so he can tell the unvarnished truth.“Because in private he can’t keep himself from lying to her… …In private, one to one, he has complete control over everything he tells her, as if he doesn’t really exist… …When they’re alone…it doesn’t matter if what Fife says is true or false, because everything he says in private is both true and false and neither.”Fife is practically a myth himself, a legendary documentarian who, as an American, evaded the Vietnam draft, and has stayed in Canada all these years hence. His past is full of secrets, however. The cancer has freed him—there’s no more ambition, nothing to promote, nobody to impress. The man he mentored is the ambitious one now, making the film this time, of Fife. But Fife has gone off script, and is exposing the bare, stunning memories of his life, all for Emma’s ears. And, in telling Emma his story and correcting the record, he’s trying to stay alive. He knows he has only weeks or days to live.“Time, like cancer, is the devourer of our lives. When you have no future, and the present doesn’t exist, except as consciousness, all you have for a self is a past. And if…your past is a lie, a fiction, then you can’t be said to exist, except as a fictional character.”The above quote is the central grasp of this story. If our past, which doesn’t exist, is an artifact of our memories, and our memories aren’t linear, but rather, are fragments strung together, then what pieces of our past are true, and what is a fabrication of our minds and memories? But if all you have for a self is a past, and the past is fictional, then what are you as a person? Fife has no future; he’s at the precipice of death. His only way to “exist” is to be true to Emma, so that he can remain real, and not fade to black as an imagined or invented person.I have a particular passion for novels that are focused on the worldly, the temporal, and how our retained memories are braided into Time. If we can either make up a past, or misremember it, then does it exist? Banks explores this in a deep and often disturbing way, twining existence and memories into one another, folding and unfolding, raveling, twisting, weaving, and binding it all together—sometimes as a ligature, or a noose, and at other times a release, a final feeling of freedom from the fabric or fabrication of our lives.Thematically and artistically, and with muscular prose, Banks is a giant among readers’ writers. My only disappointment centers on a conspicuous and paramount event, an incident that I recalled before it happened, because I perceived it would happen in a lesser author, but not Banks! But he did--he coopted a plot point from a 1969 movie, Alice’s Restaurant (a comedy with heft). My letdown is that Banks was either (on this one feature, but a primary feature) lazy or perhaps he incorporated the Guthrie plot point unconsciously. Either way, it stunned me. However, this is a resonant, beautifully tragic novel that deserves its praise and the audience of literature lovers.Thank you to HarperCollins for sending me an ARC for ....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 18, 2021","Jan 21, 2021","Jan 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53746816-foregone

Arnott vividly blends a provocative parable with the extreme, dystopian effects of climate change, a terror that has upended our lives by encroaching closer to reality than myth. Narrative, characters, theme, and story combine the conventional with the strange. Think of a redemptive eco-thriller--a survivalist fable with a clear moral compass. Despite the predictability of the finale, it is a captivating tale of an interior journey framed by a magical bird.It starts with a short fairytale that serves as prologue or preface, chapter “0,” in which envy creates destruction. A gentle farmer’s lands have been ruined by climate change. One day, she is trapped in a flood, but is saved from drowning by a bird made of water. The water bird, or rain heron, subsequently saves her farm and causes it to flourish. A young boy on another farm is jealous, and strikes after the rain heron, but is blinded by the bird’s ice beak. The heron departs, the kind farmer’s fields revert to barrenness again, and the farmer eventually dies from untreated first-degree burns. The young boy’s father finds her. From this fable come themes of blindness (real and metaphorical), greed, survival, and disaster. And humanity.The story then opens, also in third person, in chapter 1, after a coup has occurred. A surviving young woman named Ren lives alone in the wilderness and intends to protect the rain heron from cruel soldiers that are attempting to track it down and bring it back to their generals. She meets their lieutenant, also a young woman, Zoe, who forces Ren to take her to the heron after poisoning and intimidating her repeatedly. The next action resembles the first fairytale, which angers Zoe into a shocking action, which I will leave for the reader to discover. Zoe quickly takes the caged heron and leaves with her soldiers.The fascinating complexity of Zoe is the thrust of the next section, now told in first person by Zoe, the only character with I, me, my. Zoe is not your typical fairytale villain; rather, she eclipses the archetype and evokes sympathy from readers. Her backstory and early life emerges from the shadows as the story moves along. Her adolescence in a fishing village reads like a fable, also, with blood and squids and ink that comprise the premise and wages of the inhabitants. A “northerner” intrudes on the village intending to steal their secrets. This section was so wildly imaginative that it raised the novel to five-star status. It arrested me with its beauty and darkness.Zoe and her soldiers remove the caged heron, and take the long journey to the generals. Arnott’s talent in describing the landscape shimmers with violence and beauty. The animals have human parallels at times, and some of the humans have animal natures.The magical beast, the water bird, the rain heron persists. The bird represents both the endangered and the enduring. Throughout the story, these concepts rise and break the surface of the plot. The squid adds color—astonishing and radiant, and the color adds lucidity. Arnott’s story gripped me, with its riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.

Telling you the genre would be providing a spoiler, because the genre remains evasive and equivocating until close to the end. There are clues, winks, and a MacGuffin or three along the way. When it turned grim and uncomfortable, I felt comforted by trying to guess the narrative’s classification. It’s murky, it’s dark, and requires that you ponder the characters’ flaws in manners, customs of class, and the fractures of their racial insight. The author also offers glimpses of the future (not available to the characters), not to kill reader discovery, but rather to pique our curiosity and add that low level buzz of paranoia. That is what keeps us anxious and disturbed throughout—what happens in the near future? As far as the theme, I would ask: what defines safety? Is it home, family, neither? Is it a fluid concept with no landing place? Are we more trusting of our family, our familiars, or do we depend on the resolve of strangers that share none of our enmity? Behind each question is another, even more cryptic question. The narrative takes you into hard corners and tough spaces, each chapter installing your further into the balance of crisis and normalcy. Amanda and Clay, successful NYC parents, decide on a vacation with their teenage kids to an Airbnb in upstate New York, rural and far away from the closest neighbor. Each of them has an agenda that comes closer to clashing as conflict comes calling at night. At the moon hovers, sights and sounds have an almost hallucinatory effect on the reader and characters.

I slipped gently into Grushin’s twisted, clever, and lyrical morality tale--a supple and exuberant allegory of women, their choices, and their consequences.What happens in a fairy tale that ends with, “And they lived happily ever after?” That’s more of a prognostication than a destiny. In THE CHARMED WIFE, a princess is not living happily ever after, and against all odds, she aims to undo her fate. Grushin’s depth and facility with language eclipses the clichés that lesser writers would fall into with this genre. Instead of just one plot line here, there are several subplots, with familiar tropes inverted, offering a surreal and sometimes disturbing portrait of a royal life.Jane, after 13 years of marriage and two children with her “Prince Charming,” (Roland), is fed up. As much as she loves her children, she detests Roland’s philandering ways and condescending, cruel treatment toward her. She seeks out a witch and asks for release, in the most un-fairy-tale-like way. Enter the fairy godmother, also. In fact, it isn’t just Cinderella here, but references and events of Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Jack and the Beanstalk, and so many other fairy tales that we grew up with, that make cameo and poignant appearances.As Jane begins her journey, the reader is taken back and forth through the years of their marriage. The reader has to keep up, and concentrate--unlike the usual fairytales that you can read and recite in your sleep. Grushin’s prose is as silken as a princess’ dress, so I slid with alacrity down the slippery slope of fairy tale corrections. Corrections, that is, of the falsity of “happy ever after,” which the author redresses with biting wit and wisdom.At times, the passages are linguistically surreal, metaphorical, and poetical, in ways that evoke an almost physical display of thoughts. This is a princess who is initially thoughtless, covetous, naïve, and indolent. Her journey carries her deep in the weeds of her interior self, a place she had denied and declined to reside until the palace felt more like a prison and her riches like privation. Jane eventually confronts a different kind of magic and reality.“Magic hung thick on the air, almost visible, like a sheen of green moonlight that made everything slightly distorted, shimmering and shifting—and she sensed this magic to be completely unlike any she had known before. For the ordinary brand of godmother magic was thinly spread, civilized as a powdered wig, harmless as a drop of liqueur after a four-course meal, whimsical as glass footwear, and entirely pedestrian in its dabbling, domestic purposes of comfort and matrimony. This magic felt uncanny—denser, older, much more hidden, and much less certain; though whether it was light or dark, she could not tell.”Dip your toe into the fanciful fable, the awesome allegory, and the willowy prose of Olga Grushin. From Cinderella to Little Red Riding Hood, and multitudes between, the author includes the idea of many fairy tales into one morality tale, and she does it with her fertile mind and her magic whimsy. At the end, the “happily ever after” motto has pivoted to an enlightened outcome.Thank you to Putnam and NetGalley for my advanced copy....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jan 10, 2021","Jan 13, 2021","Jan 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53095098-the-charmed-wife

After teaching at a “low-residency” writer’s workshop, he makes a decision that will alter the course of his life and career. It also prompts a moral question about his integrity, especially when a Twitter comment threatens to expose what he did.Korelitz made some style and structure choices that hooked me in immediately—the novel within a novel format, although with a carefully navigated twist. It’s not the first novel to concentrate on stealing another writer’s work, but this one focuses on hijacking the plot. The prose and story conflicts are the work of the writer and protagonist, Jake, who “borrowed” the plot from his former student, Evan Parker. Familiar tropes are used, although Korelitz made this her own story. However, for me, it had mixed results.Jake’s successful novel, CRIB, centers around a mother and daughter that dislike each other so entirely that their interactions are merely transactional. Jake is a competent writer with a talent for producing a suspenseful narrative, but lacked the imagination to create a brilliant plot. When Parker reveals his own story line, Jake is jealous and aware that Parker could produce a winner, and later finds an opportunity to make it his own. Korelitz adds intensity by not revealing Parker’s prized plot to the reader until close to the end, but I figured it out pretty quickly, anyway.In the meantime, Jake has been consumed with his success, his new girlfriend, and a movie version of his book, directed by Spielberg. He struggles with doubt elicited by the anonymous tweeter, and attempts to convince himself that he was scrupulous. What is the outcome, and what are the implications, when a writer covertly lifts a plot from another writer? What are the boundaries and ethics of a writer, especially when he cherry-picks the meaning of T.S. Eliot’s, “Good writers borrow, great writers steal.”I’ve read several Korelitz novels, and noted her talent for insights and characters. Perhaps it is my familiarity with her arcs, but I was able to figure out 90% of the late revelation before I finished the first third of the novel. Parker’s winning plot did not win me over, as I surmised the bombshell “steal.” If that was the only idea that Jake “stole,” it lacked the gravitas he made of it, or that Korelitz presented. Even though it was part of Korelitz’s aim for us to question whether Jake’s actions were libelous, dubious, a transgression of his craft, it felt a bit feeble as the breathless disclosure. The actual “plot” idea is available from the vapor, the place where writers’ ideas collect and swirl; it’s not the kind of plot that calls out ownership. There was also an expository info dump at the finale, which was unnecessary, since most of the facts had formerly and slowly been signaled or revealed. And Korelitz regularly overexplained how Jake’s thoughts turned, such as writing that “He didn’t really believe that” or “He didn’t really think that,” not giving enough credit to the reader for tacitly understanding it without requiring her parentheticals.THE PLOT, despite its flaws, is still a dark, engaging book. It will appeal to escapist readers who want something deeper than Dan Brown and more literary than Liane Moriarty. If they make a series, I hope they do a better job than they did with YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, which was made into the HBO prestige domestic thriller, THE UNDOING, which was a complete mess.

The Bell in the Lake is searing, haunting, yet seductive and exuberant. The end was so moving that I vibrated from the shimmering beauty that was harnessed and expressed so incandescently. Mytting’s poetic prose captured my spirit, and my heart broke in scattered bitty pieces before it bled back together. The author did a phenomenal job of portraying a rural Norwegian village, circa 1880, that embraces the commingling of old Norse myth with modern Christianity, and a centuries-old stave church that exalted both. Meanwhile, bronze and silver Sister Bells (made in the sixteenth century to honor talented, conjoined twin girls—ancestors of the female protagonist) rang with the resonance of Time. It’s the first of a planned trilogy; I expect that the next book will take place decades later. I don’t want to pigeonhole a genre to this story-—a little bit of this and that, it adds up to a rugged, pasture and mountain-filled fable that feels intimately real—a metaphorical allegory involving ancient myths that survive in perpetuity. Dark, light, shadowed, and cinematic. Astrid, the strong-willed young lady protagonist of the story, may easily be a favorite of mine for her character and fidelity to what she holds dear, as well as her charisma and nerve.This is the story of a church, its unique Sister Bells, an artist/architect, a love triangle, and the myth that arches over all. The pastor, Kai Schweigaard, is a flawed and sometimes conflicted man who wants to do the right thing for his parish here in Butangen. The interloper, from Dresden, is Gerhard Schönauer, an ambitious artist drawn to architecture. He’s tasked to come to Butangen and help take down and move the church to Germany, along with its original portal door or Door Serpent, declared missing, and the Sister Bells. Meanwhile, Kai wants to build a functional church that isn’t so cold and dark, especially after the fatality of one of its parishioners inside the church--she froze to death. However, Astrid has her own agenda based on family history and what she feels is right and just. The three main characters and the church and bells will lure you in and hook you early in the narrative. The lyrical passages and assured voice bring it all together.“The Sister Bells had neither a sad nor fearful ring. At the core of each chime was a vibrancy, a promise of a better spring, a resonance coloured by beautiful, sustained vibrations. Their sound penetrated deeply, creating mirages in the mind and touching the most hardened of men.”...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 27, 2020","Dec 30, 2020","Jan 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50157931-the-bell-in-the-lake

Hooks you in steadily, veers off-balance, it’s edgy, but the rewards are many and you’ll experience an influx of emotions. I liked not knowing “where this is going,” but arrived at the finale feeling gratified. Veselka digs deep into the psyche of the human condition. Along the way, you will learn the shipwright’s way of life and receive a humbling, visceral education on the workings and working on a skiff, vessel, boat, while Livy labors toward her dream of fishing in Alaska—to pursue her desired occupation.Half-sisters Livy and Cheyenne, born on the same day, run separately and headlong into transformational crises. Essex, their younger brother, was brought home by Cheyenne like a stray pup as an adolescent and raised by their mother, Kirsten. The characters in this book are so full that they pop on every page. Moreover, the story is complex with an occasional exotic choice of settings, and prose that is often rugged and poetic, mixed with some myths and the ghosts of the dead, such as Sir Walter Raleigh. “Standing at the beachhead—not all that far from the Roanoke River, or even from Hatteras Island, a place of ghosts—looking east, the ghost of Sir Walter Raleigh is caught in a loop of time. Every night, he flees his lost colony and sails for El Dorado.”The author is a brawny language artist and pulls off genuine sentiment, too. The siblings care deeply for one another and for Kirsten, and for each of their flaws or blind spots is a flair for the heroic, too— even when in survival mode. All are striving for intimacy and personal agency, and the struggles to achieve that shape a brilliant and seductive story. “Maybe the hardest thing to see straight is love. It’s not the view through the window but the frame around it, and the glass is gone.”Unlike the more opaque sisters, Essex is open, generous, transparent, and sporadically heartsick. His journey leads to an unlikely bridge for his spirit and a channel for his courage. He takes a shot at a 180 and the narrative heightens. Move over Mr. Darcy—you’ve got nothing on Essex. Compared to him, you’re just dour and clinically depressed. In the pending of action, Veselka’s narrative pauses periodically to observe on the ground; seaward, or she augments spectral images with the history of those that wandered the Earth.“…in 1890, a Paiute man with messianic visions manifested a dance. …the dance united the spirits of the indigenous dead with those of the living. It infused the People with the powerful magic necessary to halt colonial expansion. …The Ghost Dance. It spread across the country. In a rage of eerie faith, it scorched the battlefield at Wounded Knee with ghostly fire.”Literature lovers, this is a powerful story of love, family, intimacy, trauma, assault, siblings, children, and making your own family.

I didn’t mean my life story, but rather that Boyd has the capacity for short-term drama, and for characters. But, unfortunately, in TRIO, his characters’ stories lacked liftoff. Characters did things, things happened to these characters, and on some level, there was change. Is that sufficient?The author didn’t entirely let me down, although the narrative had too much static electricity. The short saga read as if characters were running in place until he or she had a place to go. But all of them, in their own way, were endearing. That goes double for the novelist, Elfrida, with writer’s block and a drinking problem (formerly compared to Virginia Woolf). Generally, I avoid novels that star an active alcoholic, but Boyd contoured Elfrida well and factored her flaws in to make her more human and indefinite. Alcohol is like Vonnegut’s ice-nine, and there is a bit of a karass going on with some of these loosely knit cast members, all linked to the same movie project in some way: Emily Bracegirdle’s Ladder to the Moon.The year is 1968. WW II is a shadow, Vietnam is a cloud, and everyone wants to feel brighter. Anny Viklund, an American actress, is in Brighton, England as the star of this Ladder movie. She hears that her convicted terrorist ex-husband has escaped prison and may be trying to find her. Her current boyfriend is an older man, Jacques, a Parisian philosopher involved with the cultural revolution in the French city manifested by mass protests and street battles. In the interim, Anny has gotten romantically involved with the less complicated and more gentle Troy, her romantic interest in Ladder.One of the producers, Talbot Kydd, is a British man in his 50s who served in WW II, and is married and closeted, surrounded by temptation. Elfrida is a smart, attractive, and aloof woman, married to the director, (who has pretentiously changed his first name). Anny is a beautiful, diminutive, young star who got famous before she got wise.Begin with understanding that Ladder to the Moon is metaphor to describe each of the characters defining purpose—to climb a ladder to the moon. Moon is also interpretive. And ladder. But Boyd more than hinted that it was personal poetry for each of his troubled protagonists. The chapters alternate on this “trio,” although in a few chapters, they alternate in paragraphs rather than chapters.Finding yourself; revealing yourself; vulnerability; and realizing your part in life’s movie—or individual reality—prevails on the trio. The reader gains an intimate view of each, often more than they do of themselves—their denials, falsehoods, flaws. All the parts are placed consistently and consciously-—maybe too consciously, and I felt unsatisfied at the end. So this is it—the breadth of the story and its allegory? I gripped my hands at intervals, disappointed that Boyd didn’t do more with the material. But I don’t want to speak for most readers. You may feel rewarded; Boyd keenly creates complex characters that eclipse some of the story’s failures. I kept waiting for a radiant event but instead it was more like a tatty, faded finale.(This is the UK edition, which I am sure is the same as the American one.)...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 17, 2020","Dec 21, 2020","Dec 23, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51889053-trio

You can read it as poetry, if you’re in a meditative mood, or for the landscape, the weather, the water, the sky and the day turning to night. I read it for the story and the sights and sense-inducing seasons. It centers on two families in Maine, in the Penobscot region, away from the bustling cities. The time pre-dates cell phones and home computers, which makes a tableau less busy with static. So much room for the trees to grow. And then lose their leaves.“Snow fell early that year, collecting overnight in great, suffocating banks that squeezed our houses. Windows rattled. Roofs shifted and groaned. Front doors met wet and sticky resistance when pushed outward in the mornings...Snow in the branches, snow in the creeks, snow in the marshes, snow in the distance, snow in the cracks of the world.” “When the snow stopped and people dug free, the fog began rolling in from the sea. It blanketed the hills and coiled about houses, erased children tottering down the streets with their parents, choked brick storefronts and swallowed cars trying to pass through its belly.”It works best if you accept nature as a character. Within the natural world, the human will is to align and compete—build boats for the rushing river, fly a plane and disturb the birds, or erect Babel and then burn it down. If none of what I write makes sense, it’s that I choose to think of it visually or thematically rather than reproduce the plot. But I will tell you that it is intense, with a gravity that grips your with its teeth. Two families who love, hate, understand and misunderstand each other. The narrative enters the liminal spaces, thwarts the threshold of kindness, and create tragic consequences. Characters are flawed in ways that can damage and destroy, but all seek redemption through acts both naïve and unwavering.Brown’s debut is beautiful, elegiac, and often Shakespearean in dilemma and structure. No nobility or generals, but the humanity which swerves and upends itself invites similar reactions for the reader. At the end, I felt mercy. There are poisonous endeavors and benevolence that can shake you open.

That parochial town with the roiling sea, the beach at night, footprints in wet sand, the labyrinth of caves, the low and uneven fencing, and The Survivors themselves—an iron monument standing in the waters, changing its look as the tide rolls in and out. It commemorates a century old shipwreck, yet it is also a reminder of a more recent tragedy. Harper steals the story with her sense of place and haunting atmospherics, more compelling than the story itself. A group of friends, some who moved on elsewhere, are brought together again twelve years after a terrible storm that took and shook lives, including the disappearance of an adolescent girl. The unresolved questions of the deaths and disappearance have altered the little town forever. And now there’s a new murder to solve.Kieran Elliot has returned from Sydney with his girlfriend and baby daughter to help his parents move out of their beach house, due to his father’s dementia. Kieran’s brother, Finn, was one whose life was lost in the storm. Kieran carries persistent guilt, believing himself responsible for Finn’s death. It affects every aspect of his life, including his relationship with his parents and girlfriend. The story, absent the setting, is fairly formulaic, and the characters felt more time-honored than inventive, a bit out of central casting. Their frictions, frissons, and guarded friendliness with each other felt familiar; if it wasn’t for Evelyn Bay—it’s history, tragedies, nature, and looming singularity as a character itself, I would not have been that impressed.My complaint is that the structure or unfolding of the story provided too many signals of typical stagecraft. Sure, I didn’t figure it out until Harper wanted us to, but that doesn’t equal great storytelling, especially as she made it to fit more than the organic fit itself. For example, certain character traits aren’t revealed until close to the finale, validating conclusions. Moreover, just as Harper designed everyone to be a suspect along the way, her misdirections were easily sussed out. Maybe it was my spidey sense that did it, but each time the author threw out a red herring, it was obvious to me. At those points I was distracted by the author behind the curtain.I was expecting an original story, like THE TROUBLED MAN, her previous novel, which was a riveting story set in Queensland’s outback. Like THE SURVIVORS, the setting was arresting. But TTM was also unique and penetrating. The characters didn’t come across as standard types, like this one does. I was not a fan of THE DRY, either, which was predictable and contrived, with too much info dump near the climax. SURVIVORS is saved by its backdrop and framing, which eclipsed some of my criticism and absorbed me into its ambience.

She notably portrays a provincial Irish village, rendering her characters with painfully honest and detailed definition, complete with the local patois and ethos. The tension between Catholics and Protestants is fully on display, as the story takes place not long after the Troubles ended. Gallen is obviously talented and insightful, but I regretfully had to force myself to finish it. The author was purposely redundant to make a thematic point of a woman stuck in a static town with backward customs. Unfortunately for me, it backfired and became a series of Groundhog Days, page after implacable page, chapter after intractable chapter, with a plodding, punishing plot.Majella, the pudgy 27 year-old protagonist, possesses dormant intelligence and questionable personal hygiene habits, but prefers a spotless environment. Her compulsive tics point to the autism spectrum, although it sin’t specifically stated. She’s worked at the local fish ‘n chip shop for nine years, and occasionally has sex in the storeroom with her married co-worker. Her dad disappeared when she was a child, never to be found, and presumed dead by many. This trauma disturbs Majella’s life, soils her outlook, and sustains her stagnation.Majella supports her insufferable, somatic and alcoholic mother, who stays home to drink, smoke, and complain. Their house is decaying and their bond is declining. In her free time, Majella makes lists of what she likes—eating, cleaning, Dallas (the TV show), among other things, and what she doesn’t like, such as noise, fashion, gossip, and sweating. There are subgroups of each, but it all boils down to not liking “Other People.” Every night, Majella returns home with fried food from work, microwaves it, and tucks herself in bed to watch old episodes of Dallas, or lies there in confounding displeasure, eating. Periodically, she intervenes in her mother’s attention-seeking and self-destructive behaviors. Occasionally, Majella takes the hours long journey to visit her beloved granny, her only departure from the recycled days. We know from the opening pages that her granny was recently murdered, and the perp is still unknown. As the narrative alternates time periods, we learn just enough to stay restless.“Majella didn’t understand all this pseudo-secrecy, the stories people told. She liked things straight. But things weren’t like that in Aghybogey. It was a town in which there was nowhere to hide, so people hid stuff in plain sight.”Despite the narrative confidence and unique voice of Majella, the daily repetition of circumstance and interactions fell flat for me. Although I acknowledge that the author designed the story to illustrate the quotidian life and unchanging mores of this fictional village in Northern Ireland (near the border of the Irish Republic), it failed to keep me engaged beyond the first few chapters. I powered through, hoping for an intriguing payoff. However, the finale was quickly dispatched and foreseeable. Despite my lack of enthusiasm, I’ll keep an eye out for Gallan’s next novel. I appreciate what she achieved, but I’m the wrong audience for this book. She controlled her narrative and gave it the structure she intended, but it left me sluggish and listless. Gallan’s talent is indisputable, however, and I’m optimistic about her future work.That you to Book Browse for supplying an ARC for me from the publisher...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 07, 2020","Oct 09, 2020","Oct 16, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49150937-big-girl-small-town

Now that I have read this latest novel of hers, I’ve ordered three more of her books! That is how impressed I am with her latest psychological suspense thriller. If you’re hankering for a mystery studded in rural Texas grit with an urban savvy and snaky plot, you’ve come to the right book. There’s desert and desert mythology, the wide and starry sky, Texas wildflowers, small town suspicions, and the unsolved ten year disappearance of a nineteen-year-old girl, Trumanell Branson, and her father. Her brother, Wyatt, is a Boo Radleyesque character who has always been the primary (but unproven) suspect. There’s a lot more in here to compel the reader; I was hooked from page one.Haeberlin captured my interest with her palpable humanity and atmospheric writing. This may be a police procedural, but it is also a character-driven portrait of a community still in pain. Odette, a police officer, is the protagonist with a personal stake in finding Trumanell, as she was her friend, and Wyatt was her first and longterm boyfriend and lover. They grew up together. Odette’s father was the town’s top cop at the time, but he’s dead now for five years. At the moment of Trumanell’s disappearance, Odette was trapped under her car after an accident, losing a leg in the process. Much is focused on the symbolism of her prosthesis and her missing leg becomes a kind of motif of loss, pain, and strength. Odette is married now to a successful Chicago attorney, but made a mistake by returning to Texas with him and falling backward into Wyatt again in a weak moment. Can you love two men? Finn, her husband, and a dead ringer for “Emily Blunt’s husband,” isn’t going to tolerate that.There are several mysteries in this small town. Wyatt finds a young, mute girl with a missing eye outside on the baked ground in the hot sun, barefoot. He names her Angel. A runaway? Abandoned? Odette has a covert group with her cousin, Maggie, daughter of the town preacher. They help these unmoored children by arranging escape from whatever danger they are in. And she relates to Angel’s loss—Odette’s leg, Angel’s eye. It is reminiscent of some of John Irving’s themes (Haeberlin even includes a nod to Irving within the story)--abandoned children, missing body parts, and a touch of a dreamlike quality at times within the narrative.Told in first person from various characters’ perspectives, the story advances with a thrum and well-paced rhythm, misted with levity and pop culture references. I was turning the pages with anticipation and suspense, but at intervals I enjoyed slowing down to enjoy interior moments, the characters’ imaginations and poetic observations. These emotionally tortured characters are relatable and sympathetic, often with a warm and mordant wit. Carefully mapped and executed, it would take a really sullen and cynical reader to not embrace this southern, tragic, and hopeful story.

Neapolitan author Elena Ferrante’s latest has a fulsome, assertive, witty, emotional, and resonant voice that sears through the narrative and rattled deliciously in my bones. Protagonist Giovanna (Gianni) is a 12 year-old pretty girl, daughter of educated parents. Her parents hobnob with wealthy and influential professors, scholars, and outspoken political dissidents, and have expected that Gianni follow in their footsteps. Giovanni worships her father, but she’s also a critical observer. Things at home begin to break down when she hears her refined father compare her to her Aunt Vittoria, the black sheep of her father, Andrea’s, family, a free spirit and someone Andrea calls “ugly.” When Gianni overhears that, she’s stunned, and immediately concludes that she must be ugly like Vittoria, and demands to meet her. THE LYING LIFE is a gem of a coming-of-age tale.Vittoria seems like a classic Borderline Personality Disorder with hints of an untreated breezy bipolar disorder on the side. Her potty mouth could set a sailor’s teeth on edge or make your grandmother faint. Yet, she evoked empathy in me, with her contrasting and unrealistic eternal love (more like lust) for a boyfriend who died twenty years ago, and who looked coarse and minimally educated. He was a cop and petty grifter with a wife and children, all who Vittoria has grown as close to as family. Vittoria is blatant, blunt, and confident of her perceptions.Gianni, after a shocking discovery regarding her parents, begins hanging out with her aunt, in the seedier part of Naples, and her aunt’s self-made and religious family. Gianni was raised by atheist parents, as were all their friends, who are largely academics. Gianni also meets the blue collar kin that her father rejected. Over the course of the following years, Gianni learns some harsh lessons and hears even harsher secrets about her father and mother. She decides her life is her own to do as she pleases, and becomes the rebellious daughter who shirks her tony friends and gets an education in sex, love, and its full-throated realities. Throughout it all, Giovanni’s voice is riveting, exuberant, and commanding.Themes of identity, betrayal, and all that a bildungsroman contains, shines bright in a tight ball of fire.

O’Connor’s artistic flair for conveying installation art was mesmerizing. The protagonist, Jess, creates structures that in turn creates enigmatic rooms and spaces. Her pieces play with light, shadow, and zones that produce a sense of movement—specifically, a movement from one realm to another. Our temporal life moves into another space or place—one that is beyond that which we can typically see. Jess is an artist that became frustrated with canvas and paints. Her installations were inspired by an unresolved grief of a fellow artist/ex-boyfriend. Little did she know that her followers were also attracted to her installations by their deep sense of loss and grief. Several of Jess’s installations are believably and beautifully described. Moreover, the intensity of one piece, at a New Mexico former bomb site, became the central focus and pain of this story.I won’t go into the plot except to say that it takes place largely in the late 1970s, when Jess is in her 30s and her brother, Zack, is two years older. They lost their parents to a car accident when they were children and went to live with their bohemian aunt, who encouraged their creativity and imaginations. The prologue is past and takes us to the moment that Jess first felt a desire to recreate an ethereal moment where she moved from one place to another, outside time and space. Later, as a successful artist, Jess became known for the intense emotions her pieces evoked in others, including people that aren’t too emotionally stable. It leads to a tragedy that shuts Jess down and depresses her into inertia. “...she had only managed to create more anger and grief, infecting others with what she made.”O’Connor’s characters are fully three-dimensional and their vivid depictions were credible and fertile. I related to Jess’s anguish as well as the desperation and despair of her antagonist, Izzy. Izzy is only 16 when she causes harm to Jess at an art gallery; she is angry that Jess closed down her installation in the New Mexico desert after an incident in which the teenager was involved. (Readers will get to this on their own, without me spelling it out.) There is one character, Tanner, who is particularized with vivid detail; however, I had a hard time believing him as a magnetic cult leader who is able to manipulate almost all men and women he comes into contact with, once he finds his confidence. That was the snag I was stuck on at times. He is the book’s Elephant Man, so to speak, but not a good person. As hard as O’Connor attempted to paint him as a charismatic cult leader, I felt nothing but revulsion for him. And I don’t think most people could lower their filters so easily and generously as the author attests. I was not convinced by the qualities he placed on Tanner.Another problem I had was how the characters interacted to move the story along. Instead of organic development, it felt as if O’Connor executed a certain chemistry or understanding between characters when he needed the story to mobilize in a certain direction. For example, and without spoilers, Jess meets people later on that she facilely apprehends, and I struggled to accept their easy nature together, how they swiftly fell into place to accept each other. There were other characters who did this, and it seemed a ploy to progress the storyline. The relationships developed too quickly and artificially, a freshman writer’s pitfalls (and he isn’t a freshman writer). Jess is a closed off individual with serious issues, and the mechanics that the author employed to open her up felt contrived. Her characters weren’t cookie-cutter, but the plot advancement from their interactions were too easily dispensed. If I sounded negative, it is because I am a bit torn on my response to this narrative. The writing is lucid and elegant. Where it fails for me is how the unique plot cannily progresses—a contradiction between the story and its execution. So it is O’Connor’s logistics that aren’t credulous. The development of story into one coherent whole is where it breaks down for me. However, I remained absorbed, too, much of the time. The metaphysical aspect to Jess’s art, and O’Connor’s prose, yielded a layered texture and simmering tone to the story. And the arid desert in the novel was enigmatic and vibrant despite its symbol of death. I closed the book feeling a sense of wonder and benevolence, beyond the story's twee denouement. Even if the sublime was occasionally thwarted by the author’s engineering of events, I came away with its resonant themes of loss, loneliness, and the ultimate search for connection.3.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 02, 2020","Oct 05, 2020","Oct 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55101779-zero-zone

The Gilead books are now a quartet, but obviously not sequential. Robinson must have decided she had a lot more to say about Jack and Della, set in the Jim Crow era, when even Black veterans coming home from WW II were met with segregation and violence. Della is the daughter of an educated and successful Methodist minister from Memphis, who meets Jack. Gilead readers know Jack as the prodigal son of a Presbyterian minister. Della is kind and gentle in a soft, murmuring way, and is in love with poetry and literature. Like Jack, she often considers the world metaphysically. Jack is a bum, basically, living on the streets or wherever he can find to sleep, thieving and drinking, often with run-ins with police,but is a gentle soul, nevertheless. Jack, too, loves poetry and often thinks in metaphysical terms. His goal is “harmlessness.”Together, they have some things in common, even if they are not practical things. This is the story of their journey together, how it begins.Robinson’s language is a joy to read, to parse; it is inside the complexity of language that the story evolves. Pick any page and you will find a gem of joy in her linguistics. Although her metaphysics embody a paradox of exuberance and restraint, the character progression is static, because their decisions and intentions are within their shared trapped philosophy—a kind of “what if” stagnation. Moreover, they address the very dangerous and scary laws against miscegenation too casually and deftly, as if their predominant problem is the judgment of her family, who would disapprove of them together.Their thoughts and philosophies are intricate and passionate within its theological framework. Their actual dialogue can be stilted, however, when it’s pragmatic and not waxing poetically. How they go from point A to point B in their relationship strained some credibility. I found myself enjoying the book in its philosophical intelligence, but the actual plot is fairly formulaic. And their attraction, although understood within the language, lacked actual chemistry to me. The interior lives are rich in thought, but the progression of the story is more monotonous and derivative. Jack is fully developed, also, while Della seems one-dimensional. She’s presented as flighty, but yet resolute. Jack lives in a crude “lowlife” manner, but with Della we can observe that he is capable of poise and allure.I did find a way for me to accept, believe, and embrace Robinson’s story as a whole, even if some of the sum is questionably realistic. Both Jack and Della do possess a reprieve that is separate from the world, but very much a response to it, too. Jack is misunderstood by those around him, by the uncouth characters that exploit him and even hurt him physically. His depth of thought and ability to find a transcendence through poetry, and to be delighted by Della’s natural equanimity, is a joy to read. A lesser author would be pithy, but Robinson’s writing is sublime. She is grace Itself, and if the devil is in the details, she finesses those, too, with elegance and mercy, breaking my heart in the process. “He was inclined to believe that there were (a) energy, and (b) displacement. Any gesture was, whatever else, like freeing something from your hand, some living thing that would touch or settle wherever it happened to be carried on the surge of displacement. ... he was ill suited to the brittle, frangible world of things. It was as though planet Energy and planet Order had collided and merged, leaving displacement as the settling of the ruins....the small gesture of, say, recommending a book of poetry to someone became displacement that struck where it would...converting itself in midair into malice or stupidity.

But this isn’t the premise of the book. The primary protagonist is Katherine’s daughter, Norah, and the universal theme regards their relationship in all its complexities, and Norah’ search to find out who her father is, and who the mother is and the actress is not. “...I think there was a moment between acting the [part] and acting the actress that my mother was herself. There was a slice of time between those two points when she was lost—when she did not exist, almost—and then she found herself, or was handed back to herself by the crowd.” If you’re a daughter or a mother of a daughter, there may be more than a flicker of familiarity in this novel. And even if the events in this book fall outside your experience, the relevance of their relationship has ubiquitous themes—on the labors of love, emotional dams, and psychological depths. The author probes the seesaw of their bond, through the eyes of Norah and the lens of the actress, and the lighter Enright’s touch with the narrative, the more dense are the layers. The childhood past of Katherine seems as distant in focus as in its atmospheric, vaudevillian mood. However, the present and past, gathered in accretion, are reformed in the conclusion, as if a prism is spun in a newly perceived light. As temporal events disperse and sharpen, time thrusts like thoughts, ever rearranging itself.The plot is shaped around Norah and Katherine--the exhaustion of living; the comfort and lurking of death; and the moments of unblinking tenderness. Love is stark, deep in the skin-- to the bones—love is a scar that you rub to feel its span. Actually, the story’s design or scheme isn’t evident at the start; you read to ravel and loosen the threads as they tighten. The sheer physicality of Enright’s prose is like the creation of color, light, shadows--it dilated my pupils and saturated the scene. Enright’s rhythm, agility and bare muscularity of language conjures the proportion of importance and insistence like no other author I know. It’s done so effortlessly, so simply, that it doesn’t call attention, it just evokes with flawless intensity. Enright never gets in the way of her story—it’s as if she wasn’t there, and you’re in the belly of it. There’s a scene of sexual assault, an event that occurred with such banality that it made it all the more appalling. It is like no other rape scene I’ve ever read, and truer in its malice, more violent in its emptiness.Some of the action is interior but animal, and the latticework of story and events swirl most vigorously when Norah annexes past with present with future, the understated undercurrent made manifest with the bombshell realizations of the reader and the character simultaneously. My  isn’t much about the story itself; that is for the reader to fill in. I can only tell you that I’m rarely so filled and so stilled as I was while turning the pages of this novel.

Be patient as you enter, step into it, let your senses go and find your heart and mind possessed by the story.

I gave it five stars for being the best of its type. This isn’t literature, although there is surely literary pepperings, and there are oft-used tropes and a requirement to periodically suspend incredulity. The plot’s the thing, but the characterizations of these women are well wrought, which is why I was enchanted and thrilled in equal measure. Wittenborn, who has written for HBO, is a master of plot performance, and kept me turning the pages eagerly while I ignored my immediate environment, except for the story. Dinner could have burned and only fierce hunger would have alerted me, as I was acutely engulfed in this tale. Best popcorn book of the year!References to #MeToo, I think, would have to be superficial. The movement calls for outing these heinous men, shaming them in public and on social media, and also filing lawsuits. Equal justice through legal means. In STONE GIRL, we are talking more about justice into your own hands. In this case, Evie, a top tier art restorer of sculptures living in Paris, has survived a mendacious assault by one of a group called the Lost Boys, who are a group of dashing, charismatic, highly attractive men who have graduated from Ivy League colleges and are willing to live both inside and outside the law. Evie has a daughter with cancer, and her mother, up in the Adirondacks, hasn’t seen her in years. The man who assaulted Evie hasn’t gotten his comeuppance, and seventeen years later, Evie still suffers from these scars.The wisps of lively literary spritzes include Evie’s work as a restorer; much is said over the flaws, blemishes, and cracks in a once intact sculpture, and Evie’s precision in returning it into a whole and spotless form again. This parallels Evie’s youth, as she was born with a port wine stain on her otherwise exquisite face. She sustained repeated taunting, teasing, and even threats to her safety from the boys and teens in her town, a corruptible group of bullies that thrive on this behavior. Evie’s mother, Flo, homeschooled her instead of throwing her to the wolves day after day, and tight her the importance of literature and critical thinking. Her father, Buddy, edified her on fishing, skinning and survival skills in the wilds of their domain. Her solid childhood and quick witted mind, as well as her curious nature, lent itself to Evie’s love of repairing what is flawed.From the opening pages, I knew this would be a wild and thrilling ride. I was led, yes, but not condescended to, and the voices of the main characters kept them visually dimensional. Yes, there are archetypal “villains,” the Lost Boy scoundrels, but there’s even bad to worse to worst on the palette of malefactors. However, despite some convenient plot points or predictable outcomes, there were still a few surprises. And, oh yes, and a catamount! It wasn’t so much the destination—the journey is at top speed and compelling. I can already imagine the HBO series that I’m sure will be created.

He is a reader’s and writer’s writer, where plot arises from his prowling prose and evocative atmosphere. Sinister and menacing at every turn, his narratives metaphorically create the invisible monsters of our youth as the setting for our stories. In Glass Kingdom, West meet East again, where his protagonists fall through the darkness and shadows in alien cultures. Our lead female here is Sarah, a lonely young woman who defrauds a female writer in NYC that she once revered, then escapes to Bangkok (where Osborne has lived for years) to decide her next steps. The eponymous title belongs to the residential complex where she selects to stay, which was once “a zircon in the city’s rickety diadem,” until the financial crash of 1997. Consisting of four buildings of twenty-one towers each, it is now a decaying place, shaken by the crash but equal parts mysterious and transparent. Sarah’s naïveté is soon evident when she befriends three other women and tries to deal with the working class on the periphery—and sometimes the inside—of where she lives. “...she didn’t understand the context of the place in which she was living.”The main character can well be the Glass Kingdom itself, where much of the story takes place. There is a scene where Sarah is taken on a walk by her new and enigmatic “Thai, or Eurasian” friend Mali, during one of the protests the city is known for—pro-government demonstrations around the royal palace. On their journey, Sarah and Mali visit several temples containing an ancient spirituality, which sparked Sarah’s epiphany that her life has been utterly worthless up to this point. “She had a venomous thought: that the Goddess [Guanyin] had come to life and reached inside her with a supernatural hand. She had revealed Sarah as an empty clown, a shadow actor in a drama…”Many f the other characters, including Sarah’s new foreign friends, are ciphers either trapped in the Kingdom or exploiting from its open and concealed spaces. As the pages turn and the story progresses, the malice curls heavily around the expanse and evokes a claustrophobic presence, dense with the scent of the decaying garden below. Within its walls, abuse, grift, profiteering, and murder take place undercover. If it is cat and mouse, who is the cat and who is the mouse? This book is not for everyone, especially is you want your thrillers straightforward and sharply drawn. But if you are an Osborne fan, it is a must-read. The wandering viewpoint adds to the vertiginous mystery. If I highlighted every exhilarating sentence or passage, the whole book would look as yellow as “the yellow flowers in the lobby denoting the owner’s loyalty to the authorities, even as civil unrest leads to frequent power cuts and the rainy season gathers oppressive force.”...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Aug 21, 2020","Aug 24, 2020","Aug 26, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53734187-the-glass-kingdom

Whitbred Award winner, Tony Tulathimutte, describes Moloney’s writing as “stainless-steely prose,” which is apt and flawless. Moloney, rather than distancing himself and delivering customary criticisms of the men behind bars and the officers in charge, instead dissolves those boundaries that exist in this enclosed and ruthless zone. The difference between the inmates and the COs is often repudiated in the lives of those that carry the keys. Incarceration is absolute for the prisoners but often a euphemism for their keepers. The author doesn’t aim to vilify; instead, the darkness and emptiness on both sides is explored and openly visible to the reader. However, it is largely from the officers’ point of view, and at times I wondered what it would be like to be at their mercy. The transactional system fails to mend lives, and the pecking order between staff is raw and rancorous; their souls are lonely and stained.At times, it feels like a diary or chronicle, and at intervals reads like theater, like a play.

Mishani, has crafted an alluring and understated story of three women in transition, thus the title. Divided into three sections to depict each woman, it is linked by one man, a cipher named Gil, an attorney who works on passports for immigrants. The stories take place in Tel Aviv. The first woman, Orna, is a recent divorcee filled with anxiety regarding her eleven-year-old son, Eran. He is sensitive and introverted, and has been all but abandoned by his once-devoted father, Ronen. Remarried to a German woman, Ronen presently has a built-in family of small children. Now he wants to re-enter Eran’s life, and Orna suffers from jealousy and fear of losing her son to this new, larger family. In the meantime, she has started dating Gil, who she met on a dating site online.The second story highlights Latvian immigrant Emilia, a childless and unmarried forty-six-year-old and caregiver who lost a client to death. She was attached to him and still sees him as a spectral presence. Gil is the son of her former client, and she seeks him out for work permit assistance. Working part time in a nursing home, Emilia has difficulty transitioning to staying in this cramped room and taking care of a woman with a caustic daughter. Finally, Ella is the woman in section three, a student, mother, and wife in her thirties returning to university, and working on her thesis on the Lodz Ghetto during the Holocaust. She meets Gil at a cafe, where she offers him a cigarette and insights into her married life. She feels out of place at university, as she’s older than the students and most of her professors.All three women are vulnerable, particularly due to their current circumstances. Orna, Emilia, and Ella are very different, vitally expressed by Mishani’s talent for characterization. It is also evident that they all see Gil as bland, soft-bodied and cryptic. He regards them in his passive and often dull manner, which struck me at first as odd that these complex and interesting women would reach out to him. However, it isn’t his nature that attracts them; it’s about these women, who tentatively embrace what he offers, and sometimes even use him as a crutch of standby support. Orna is a private person, Emilia knows few people, and Ella is secretive due to her marriage. But, Gil is in transition, too, and is shifty and secretive about his circumstances. What Mishani demonstrates in his measured, quiet, and disquieting narrative is the conning of society, the distracted acceptance of cruelty, savagery, distortion, and the need for women to rise up and take care of each other. There is nothing pedantic or message-y in this tale; in fact, it allows the reader to interpret through a prism of the ordinary, which makes it extraordinary.

But the author isn’t flashing the Bard in this narrative; in fact, Shakespeare is never referred to by name. This is not about Will, who remains, in many ways, a distant character, seen primarily through the eyes of his wife—who takes center stage.Shakespeare, in the novel, is variously known as “the Latin tutor,” “father,” or “husband. His wife, who the author calls Agnes, is mythologized, also, as a quirky herbalist that legend claims comes from the edge of the forest. There is so little history about their son Hamnet and the intimacies of this household in Stratford that, except for the bare and minimally known facts, arises straight from O’Farrell’s exquisite imagination. HAMNET deserves the Booker (WHY was it not even nominated??!!).Agnes is truly the locus of this novel; her grief over Hamnet’s death is overwhelming. However, in O’Farrell’s beautifully restrained and measured narrative, the reader perceives her pain with intimacy and intensity. The tale is non-linear, with background story and cultivation of characters organic and superbly synthesized into the story. Thus, Hamnet’s death affects the reader, too; the tender love between him and his twin makes his death even more cruel and painful.Here, in this storied account, the author creates a folklore around Agnes—she is already a legend, a wood-spirit, sporting a kestrel on her wrist, foraging for healing herbs that she utilizes the heal the townsfolk’s ailments. She is both sought after for her talents and imposing, a bit intimidating to those that seek her out.O’Farrell’s mythical tale is also a realist and quotidian family drama. Agnes is a local celebrity, and her free-spirited nature is evident in vivid descriptions. “There were creatures in there who resembled humans – wood-dwellers, they were called – who walked and talked, but had never set foot outside the forest, had lived all their lives in its leafish light, its encircling branches, its wet and tangled interior.” When the Latin tutor first meets her, she appears androgynous and enigmatic, with her inscrutable gaze and her magnetism. The author impeccably ties in several of the Bard’s themes and ideas into the novel. In fact, the play Hamlet is taken directly from the Bard’s son and his tragedy. The effect of its title and staging on Agnes magnifies and deepens the themes, as well as her nature. Everything O’Farrell does is precise and essential. Not one superfluous word or sentence.

ThisDangarembga’s inspiration for the title is from a 2015 Teju Cole essay, “Unmournable Bodies.” (You can read this brief but weighty essay online). This was my first foray into Dangarembga, and now I know that she has a previous book, Nervous Condition, from the 1980s, which includes the same protagonist, Tambudzai Sigauke. The backdrop of TMB proceeds from the war for Independence, from colonialism to the liberation of Rhodesia to modern day Zimbwabe, and the freedom-fighters and current strife-filled citizens. Tambu’s PTSD from the war has taken on a life of its own. And Dangarembga didn’t drag us into her personal politics. Her way of writing is so uncommon/suis generis that I’d confidently argue that no writer can take on second person POV as exceptionally and naturally as she does. How is it both artful and artless simultaneously? It is the subtle combination that the author utilizes.. Tambudzai is from the village and is the one who got away to get a formal education from university and lived in Harare. She became a biology teacher, which ended in a rupture, provoking her worst period of life. Now in her mid-thirties, Tambu is an ambitious woman with unresolved issues from the war; many who were babies then are suffering, untreated, maladjusted. Guilt, anxiety, sorrow are burdens she carries--and periodically, disassociation. She survived continuous, unrelenting trauma.Tambu yearns for upward mobility, and her comparison to other people nags her day after day. She attended a private, elite high school, but was overshadowed by white students less talented. Similar encounters occurred at university and beyond. Demons from Tambu’s past have not been confronted and subdued. They are traumas—in the literal sense of the word, too, and their ghosts live within her and around her in many different forms, which is exhibited in in the author’s bracing figures of speech. Tsitsi uses animals to full metaphorical power, as well as body parts, including the womb:“...the snakes that hold your womb inside you open their jaws at the mention of war. The contents of your abdomen slide toward the ground, as though the snakes let everything loose when their mouths opened. Your womb dissolves to water.”For every new internal border crossing and reach to break the glass ceiling, there is the stuff of kid’s nightmares gone adult, and it follows Tambu everywhere, haunting her with all-consuming fear, withdrawal, isolation. Floors, ceilings, walls—their borders are often extended or dissolved. Ambition is tested, her sense of self wavering. Coping is a challenge; she manifests pain by existing apart from her body. Tambu peers in from a crack in the ether, decompensates by disassociating.Tambudzai carries her soul’s burdens in metaphorical images that can tear the reader apart. The first line of the first page is “There is a fish in the mirror,” reflecting herself. Animal metaphors penetrate the pages as encroachers—hyenas, snakes, ants, and more-- and viscerally so. “You arrived on the back of a hyena. The treacherous creature dropped you from far above onto a desert floor. There is nothing here except, at the floor’s limits, infinite walls.” “You are an ill-made person. You are being unmade. The hyena laugh-howls at your destruction. It screams like a demented spirit and the floor dissolves beneath you.”“Mealie meal” given to Tambu by her mother, indirectly, precipitates Tambu’s inner brawl to stow or shed it. Her gestures and mordant wit adds a dimension to how she perceives her relationship with her maman and the rest of her family, as well as her colleagues, country and social hierarchy. How to balance the desire to succeed with kindness? It’s ripping her into pieces.Her sister lost a leg in the war and “Yes, I went and I am here but I never came back. Most of the time I’m still out there wandering through the grass and sand, looking for my leg.” Tsitsi’s use of the grotesque, the severed body parts, augment the borders of our bodies—how they become borderless in war. Life begets death begets life.These external symbols and figures crack something else open for the reader. Not only does Tsitsi think outside the box, her box is lightyears and constellations from convention. Tambu’s body and out-of-body intervals are both staggering and emotionally compelling. She is mournfully conflicted--is she accountable for her pain, or did her circumstances create this torment?Advocate for herself. Break the glass ceiling. But what if those shards fall and hit the ones you love in the flesh? Does ambition allow blindness instead of kindness? Tambu’s story is not easy to read, because there’s so much crushing pain, deep discouragement, and despair. Alienation, fear, shameless FOMO, shameful failed successes. But it is written in a picaresque style, also, that moderates the multiple tragedies. Redemption and reparation are just as noteworthy. The fraught heroine is unforgettable.

It’s Dublin, and the first world war is still raging, and it eerily takes place during the Spanish flu pandemic that we hear about often during the current Covid-19 crisis. It’s even worse than ours because death was at a much higher percentage then, with less modern medicine (they didn’t even know it was a virus vs a bacteria). I was keenly affected by the sights, sounds, textures, and tastes that swirled in this novel. And Donoghue’s sense of place, time, and environment is spot-on.The story takes place over jut a few days in a “Fever/Maternity” ward. Julia, a nurse about to turn 30, single, and living with her now-mute brother, Tim, just home from WWI due to PTSD (although they didn’t call it that then), is the protagonist. Julia and Tim have already had the Spanish flu and fortunately survived it—we know that it rendered immunity once you’d had it (and I hope that it’s true with Covid, as I’ve had it!). Julia, as a nurse mid-wife, works in a ward with pregnant patients also suffering from the flu. On this opening day for the reader, Julia walks in, and no supervisor is there to assist. Lots of sick colleagues at any particular time, and the ones that are there are spread pretty thin. It’s a charity hospital, also, run by the nuns. Julia realizes that she is running the ward today, and they find her a newbie named Bridie, fresh from the poorer district with no hospital or health experience. In fact, she didn’t know that a baby was “alive” until after it left the womb. But she’s a quick learner, and witty, too, game for this adventure and compatible with Julia’s sensibilities. By the end of the first day, Julia is practically besotted with Bridie’s helpfulness and willing, winning personality. Donoghue also chose to include an historical figure, a doctor involved in some Ireland rebellion, and sought by the authorities. Donoghue talks a bit about her in the afterward.For me, the main character is the historical setting, which carried me through the novel. I know that many readers were swept away by this novel, and I think that the “graphic” medical interventions and bodily fluids was gasp-inducing for the lay reader. I am an RN, and nothing is too graphic to me when it comes to medicine, neither past or present. I thought it was intriguing to read about the medical aspects, although it wasn’t something that, by itself, amplified my reading pleasure (or took away from it, depending on your tolerance for graphic medicine). The parallel to our own pandemic was gripping in its coincidence, but again, that didn’t elevate the story for me just for being alarmingly fluky.My quarrels with the story rest in that I’m used to Donoghue being more meaty than entertaining, but this novel seemed more of a check-the-boxes diversion. Pandemic, poverty, PTSD, pestilence, check. (And another checked box I won’t give away in my ). I know that it was written prior to coronavirus, but I’m convinced that there were some edits made later to bring the parallels even closer (but that’s reasonable). However, I thought that the way the story moved through these events was a bit melodramatic (but, again, I don’t want to reveal what the reader should have the right to discover). And rehearsed, in a sense. The characters fit the author’s scheme rather than them being underived and natural. To me, Julia could be any human superhero (without actual superhero powers), she was almost too faultless. The nuns were cartoonish, a sort of comic relief. Bridie was provocative, but she also sloped in the vicinity of a straw character for Julia. And the ending was far too pithy and plumb.Despite my complaints, I read straight through, easily turning the pages, swept up in her writing. That’s why my 3.5 can swing up to 4 stars. It’s Donoghue going mainstream, to be sure—this could be a Hulu series or movie, a period piece with nothing too surprising in the plot for mature readers, but a story with stirring events that are vivid and instructive, a morality tale that perhaps attempted to be a cautionary one. But if this is Donoghue’s weakest novel, it still has many strengths to keep me engaged. Her powerful, imminent prose—events happened, and happened now. Even a handwashing was full of haunting terrors.“At the sink, I scoured my hands so hard, the nailbrush left red lines on my skin and the carbolic burnt. I sensed the bone man just outside the door. He’d claimed one small life already before any of us had realised, and now he was hovering close by, doing his rattling dance, swinging his smirking skull like a turnip in his bony fingers.” Whew! And this is the tempo and muscle of the prose throughout!

It takes eight people—and it has always been men—to physically work together to do this. The story takes us inside the old Ireland Butchers and their modern rivals, with a kaleidoscope of varied perceptions that cause fiery friction. “In this country,…cattle are politics.”The Butchers number approximately 500 across the country, and are itinerant eleven months of the year. Some are married and leave wives and children behind to fend for themselves while they are off performing their rituals. During the Mad Cow disease pandemic in Northern England, some petty smugglers try to take advantage of the British beef ban—as the Celts are now having a boom. The story surrounds two families. We get to know the individual men, their wives, and their children via alternating chapters. The nonlinear story takes place largely from 1996 to 2018. The topics of cults, folklore, rituals, feminism, family, bullying, borders, loss, art, change, country, allegiance, loyalty, and pride are well delineated and bolster the eerie story. There are those in Ireland who scornfully think the Butchers are primitive and lost in the past. Over the years, rumors and gossip and wild stories about Butchers are spread from fear and prejudice. And that is sufficient information for the reader before heading into the unknown. And, before you Wiki it--it doesn’t exist in our world, only in the writer’s piquant imagination. And this tale is original, offbeat, and consuming. At the outset, the author’s aim to get the reader familiar with the background of the story came off inelegant and too on the nose. This led to an uneven tempo and I sensed that the atmosphere was told rather than felt. However, the meat and bones of the story emerged as a startling surprise, and the last page or two was smashing and resounding. The characters were inevitably finely drawn, the finale unforgettable.“…without folklore and traditions, surely Ireland didn’t really exist? Surely it might as well just be England or France or anywhere else…? So just as there were those who saved up all the country’s native stories, there were those…who devoted their lives to maintaining the country’s old beliefs.”4.5 rolled up to 5 stars.Thank you to the publisher’s f Tin House for sending me a copy in return for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 29, 2020","Jul 31, 2020","Aug 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51188676-the-butchers-blessing

Identical twin sisters live in the (fictional) town of Mallard, Louisiana, a rural place that graces no map. Everyone is light in their Blackness—so light that a dark Black person will receive the full hostile treatment. Desiree and Stella are inseparable, but have distinctly different natures. Desiree is adventurous and bold; Stella is shy and intellectual. The twins are traumatized when they witness their father dragged from their porch and lynched by a group of white men. Their perspective of the world is shattered, and the last of their naivete is scrubbed away. In 1968, the civil rights movement barely touches the periphery of Mallard, and Stella and Desiree, only sixteen, decide to run away to New Orleans. It was Desiree’s adventurous idea, but shy Stella is game, and they live there on a wing and a prayer.Some months later, Stella passes for white to get a decent job. Shockingly, however, she stealthily leaves Desiree for the wider world as a White woman, a secret life that paradoxically frees Stella while keeping her imprisoned in her lie. Secrets can both build and destroy. Bennett carries us back and forth from the 1940s to the latter 1990s, centering on the sisters but branching out to the next generation, and the one before. The novel also examines feminism; a misgendered young man born a woman; the class system; and dissembling. Stella pretends until her fake identity becomes real. This could have been a heavy-handed story by a less imaginative author. But Bennett’s narrative is authentic and juicy, and not overplayed. Tragic as a premise, like the movie, Imitation of Life (yes, there were progressive filmmakers in 1934 and 1959), grief and loss are channeled with stinging delicacy. Stella lives a lie, even to her husband and daughter. Cruel irony asserts when the normally subdued Stella is outspoken at a neighborhood meeting, stating that they shouldn’t let “Negroes” move in. Fear of exposure makes her shameless.Desiree returns to Mallard with her dark Black daughter, Jude, escaping an abusive marriage. Jude contends with spiteful colorism at school and around town and swiftly goes her own way and pursues a future. Desiree has a steady boyfriend there, another dark Black man who travels a lot for his work. The author’s character-driven plot kept me fully engaged in the story and voice—a limited omniscience that tethers the reader to each character. The author extends the metaphor and paradox fluidly; Stella’s daughter doesn’t feel authentic unless she is acting on stage. A lazy author may depend on epiphanies to tell the tale, but Bennett doesn’t rely on derivative Hollywood scenes. OK, there’s ONE meetup that reeked of Oprah moments, but it isn’t the cardinal climax, anyway. In fact, there are several resolutions that aren’t resolute; instead, there are ongoing disclosures that refuse to wrap things up in just a scene or two. It is contoured, and time touches the characters with tolerance and regard. The psychological effects of each sister’s life are genuine and stirring.A few incidental scenes read as if an editor suggested expediency, a bridge or transition, and the author (or editor) exerted canned dialogue, but it was brief and insignificant, surpassed by the moving, poignant story.

All three hear him utter one word, softly, but each sibling hears it differently. From this act of offstage violence, Livesey, with undemanding delicacy, tells a complex domestic drama. It’s not morose, sensational, or melodramatic; it’s expressed with levity and deceptive simplicity.The violence to Karel precipitates a rupture in the usual family dynamics. Karel’s suffering affects each of them in searing ways that take the reader on a journey of secrets, resilience, love, betrayal, and identity.The narrative is pared down to the essentials, each chapter from alternate siblings.

Livesey starts with a suspense, a mystery, and morphs it into something more central and universal, but intimate and singular. Do not expect a police procedural as plot. Rather, she keenly probes the siblings’ psyches and their actions. As they transition to adults, the rooted effects of that traumatic day continues to bear upon their choices.

This is an author who has bended genres and brought me to my knees. However, Utopia Avenue’s coverage of the counterculture 60s feels borrowed and Wiki’d. By far, it’s the worst slog by a notable, former first-rate author that I’ve ever read, a migraine-inducing mash of mixed metaphors and insensate, ham-handed prose, bad poetry, and corny lyrics. It is riddled with clichéd, gaseous sentences that telegraph and italicize every thought and action. Here’s a passage:“Jellyfish of colored light breed and smear the dancers and Jasper’s mind is set adrift.”  “Abracadabra, it’s a boy, why not name him Jasper?”  “Why this name and not another?” “A friend? The stone? A long-lost lover?”“Plenty more where we came from. A million per droplet of the stuff of life.”Yeah, heavy, brother. Groovy. I should have been warned when Mitchell decided that Utopia’s first album would be “Paradise is the Road to Paradise.” Is this supposed to be clever? Mocking? He takes this novel seriously, and the levity is at best, puerile. How about these lyrics to their first hit, Darkroom:“We hid under trees from the rain and the dice; but under the trees the rain rains twice.”These aren’t lyrics from counterculture music; it is the trivial stuff of a bubblegum chorus. (Exceptions are Richard Harris and Donna Summer, who can eloquently leave the cake out in the rain). It opens in 1967, and the premise is the rise and fall of a British rock band. The novel is structured in six sections by the three Utopia LPs (A and B sides), and each song centers on a different band member: Romeo-ish, cheating Dean, the bassist; Lennon-ish Jasper, the watchful and schizoaffectve-ish guitarist; Elf, singer and keyboard player with man problems; and Griff, the brash and nervy drummer from Yorkshire. The characters, like the story, are trite and swirl in the self-referential Mitchellverse. Levon, the manager, is a meta-reference to Bone Clocks. Jasper de Zoet’s reference to Jacob is purposeful but insubstantial, like all of the meta- bombs. Perhaps Mitchell is reminding the reader that he once wrote novels with staying power.The author hammers home that it is the 60s by all the name-dropping and cameo appearances: Jagger, Bowie, Sandy Denny, Zappa, Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Jerry Garcia, Nina Simone, Pink Floyd, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, like the novel, their function is flimsy and clumsy, like Marc Bolan’s, “If you want to understand me, read The Lord of the Rings. It’s that simple.” 590+ pages of buzzwords, bromides, and banalities, swirling in Mitchell’s past novels. A solid narrative stands on its own, without weak wink-wink plugs to an author’s oeuvre.

Coles is also a playwright, and her theater background is evident in her use of dialogue—lots of it, and the manner in which the cast seems to sharply emerge from the shadows or disappear into the dark. There’s a linear plot nestled inside the characters’ non-linear background stories. The suspense builds steadily through the snow squall, enclosing us fully till the show-stopping end. It’s a character-driven tale of icy adventure in a turbulent and emotional landscape.Iris, a young woman of mixed racial heritage, and eternally insecure about her value, is in the crisis throes of her two-year affair with John. He dithers between his selfish needs: die to have her or kill her to get away. The push-pull on Iris’s heart is reaching a climax, and the reader is pulled taut in latent and active events. “This is small game hunting at the local coward gun club...And what is worse, as every stroke of recognition is finally fully delivered hard against Iris’s hurt timepiece, is that all was lost the moment she opened the door and let him step across the threshold. He wanted her less from there.” It’s a lust and obsession story with teeth, not a trivial love triangle. Moreover, there are various other characters grappling with profound personal issues: addiction, loneliness, violence, homophobia, depression. It’s droll, intense, and ripe with inevitable confrontations.The most enigmatic character is Olive, a rural native who now lives in St. John’s. She doesn’t work at the Hazel, but periodically visits Iris or hangs at the edges of the place. Her presence early on is the most mysterious of all, but I felt the pulse of it immediately, and knew somewhere in my heart that she would break it. Her story, I sensed, may be pivotal to the action. Then there are the diners during this blizzard, including a table of cruel, elitist prigs, and a twin brother and sister who eat here weekly. The circle widens to include friends, family, and frenemies that connect to the Hazel in close or distant ways. A crew of criminals add a stain of menace that permeates the pages; the peril is palpable but at first indefinable. Later, vivid and blistering events crushed me to my core.Megan Gail Coles wrote in her epigraph to the novel: “This might hurt a little. Be brave.” Stoke your courage, readers.

He’s attempting to segue into a new career--of photographer-artist--and trying to launch a sustaining livelihood in his host country. A woman in a red dress, the digital photo in black and white, emphasizes his concept of contrasts in visual form. She is standing amidst an historical protest in Istanbul, unprotected by any gear, in a lovely red dress. The thrust of Peter’s art concerns an old political theory from the Cold War, of contrasts producing tension. “A society in crisis, one that is gripped by tension, can be more easily manipulated and controlled than one that’s stable…” He intends to fold this theory into his work, his artistic innovations. I brought up Peter first, as his theme of tension is writ large on the novel itself—not the Cold War theory, but the brittle tensions that this cast of characters endure and create on a daily basis. Often, it’s unconsciously triggered, but there’s collateral damage. And selfish aims, or mere survival, and there is plenty of that to go around, all the way till the final tell: a bit of a jolt and the key to Ackerman’s storyline. Getting there is a feline thrill from the deftly structured narrative, the exquisite architecture of his character-driven plot, and clarified down to its essence. The covetous traits are disclosed during the denouement. But Ackerman doesn’t give the reader everything on a platter. There’s room to judge and speculate.Peter’s lover, Catherine, is married to Murat, a well-known real estate developer. They have a young son, William, who steals a few choice scenes, especially when he picks up Peter’s camera and aims at birds in flight. Yasar, the family name, is more like a destination than a person. His name is on countless buildings scattered throughout the city, and the citizens don’t know he’s a paupered prince—in debt up to his neck following civil unrest in 2013, when the Gezi Park protests dominated the news. Protesters fought against the urban development of Gezi Park, which Murat represents and resents. Now it is stalled and his finances are fraught. Then there is another Turk, Deniz, a major museum curator at the Istanbul Modern (and Catherine serves on the board). He’s picky and aloof. Lastly, there’s Kristin, another American and a State Department employee in Cultural Affairs. She’s working to advance cross-cultural dialogue in Turkey, and trying to help Peter get a gig at the gallery. What helps him helps her. First they have to convince Deniz that Peter’s photographs are worthy. Ackerman’s talent in knitting all the characters together is nothing short of superb.In the meantime, Catherine abruptly enlists Peter’s help in a precarious plan. After a decade living here, she wants to leave Murat and take William to America. The novel opens up on that crisis, but reveals just enough to keep the reader tense, like the cast. Thematically, there’s a meta- quality of conflict and tension that mirrors Peter’s theme, and the readers and characters walk a tightrope together throughout the book. The nonlinear events advance and unpack the plot, and demands close attention from the reader.The characters are well-developed, flawed, periodically cruel. If you want likable characters, search elsewhere, but they do have their virtues. Their humanity is evident, as well as their failings, and the cracks in their nature are sometimes tough to take. Istanbul emerges as a character, too, perhaps the most vivid of them all. The author’s depiction of the city was almost corporeal. Within the city and beyond, the story spoke to me in hushed tones. The knife clinks on the wineglass, the guests circulate among the portraits, the voices echo throughout the maze of alleys. Ackerman’s details fuel the tale.

Give it a wider berth and the symbolism will rear its head Anyone who has seen the Matrix remembers the meaning of the “red pill” (v. the blue pill). Give it a wider berth and the symbolism will rear its head in Kunzru’s bleak and electrifying thriller-like domestic drama-esque, Kafka-esque new novel. The protagonist and narrator of Pill is a struggling, blocked writer determined to pen a book about the self, in all its high-brow, philosophical, historical, allusion-filled and allegorical connotations. He, the Brooklyn writer, aware of his mid-life funk, appears to have a loving relationship with his wife and daughter, but he is no longer certain if that is true—what is the criteria?---or about his sense of reality or utility. The narrator accepts a writing fellowship near Berlin for a three-month stint, where most of the action takes place. But it also furnishes solid, revealing dialogue with his wife, Rei, in back story and current phone calls home. Unfortunately, is also where plans for the Final Solution took place during the Holocaust. Herr Deuter, the industrialist who started this “Deuter Center for Social and Cultural Research,” in the late 1970s, expressed his belief that “the royal road to the future lay in confronting the darkness of the past.” What follows is a strange, mind-bending tale about the self and reality that takes our increasingly damaged narrator on a stark journey of revelation and paranoia.Instead of an independent residency, the protagonist learns (condescendingly) from the current director that his activities are closely monitored, and there are petty policies like where he can work: only at the public Workspace, intensifying his discomfort with these illogical rules (that’s the Kafka-esque point of entry). He stops writing, and begins taking long walks around the perimeter of the center, and watching a mainstream, uninspiring cop show on TV. Uninspiring but chilling, too.Nothing can be assessed at face value at the Deuter Center. On his walks, the narrator frequently passes the grave of the writer Heinrich von Kleist, a hysteric and writer of chaotic, fragmented stories. Kleist died in a suicide pact with an acquaintance, a woman immaterial in his life. As the walks become regular, the grave’s presence begins to steadily disturb and alarm Kunzru’s protagonist. The largely conventional police show the narrator obsesses over is Blue Lives, which showcases cops who have lost their moral compass and become criminals themselves; they torture their victims. However, on this typically low-brow and brutish show, our narrator discovers that one of the cops quotes a well-known but vile and dogmatic figure of the past, Joseph de Maistre. Maistre was a late eighteenth century philosopher who was anti-Enlightenment, a supporter of authoritarian rule by Kings and Popes that he believed were divined by God. He was like a dark figure straight out of the Middle Ages, a theocrat and furious autocrat. Subsequently, Kunzru’s narrator meets the creator of the show, an alt-right racist named Anton. The Brooklyn writer’s piercing curiosity with Blue Lives turns to Anton, as Anton represents everything that is sinister and dark, and hurls our narrator toward a psychic battle with the wicked. He wants Anton to explain his appalling ethos.Kunzru’s prose is limber and immersive, and kept me close to the story even when I thought I lost the plot and misplaced the premise. The more dire our narrator’s mood, the more mired in the murky past and his fear of the future, the more amorphous the storyline was to me. However, if you think the tale is a tangle of ambiguous, inexact implications, don’t worry. Kunzru’s novel has a rewarding payoff where the loose threads tighten up and clarify where and what and why. In fact, the moment of clarity is akin to an organic epiphany, and a warning. If the past is prologue, when is the future epilogue?The author’s key construct is almost too orderly. He quite leans over into a formula of his own artful making (almost occult), but the way he gets away with it is impressive! His position on humanity is benevolent and kind to the earth and the people who populate it. It seems certain that Kunzru felt a moral imperative and expressed it through art. I am the perfect recipient and I believe that history—100 or 1000 years from now—will agree with me, with us, the victors.Thank you to Penguin Random House for an ARE via Net Galley...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jun 15, 2020","Jun 17, 2020","Jul 15, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49188384-red-pill

Focusing on married couple Annie and Graham (second marriage for both), the chapters Sue Miller’s MONOGAMY is a slow burn rather than a bright flame. Focusing on married couple Annie and Graham (second marriage for both), the chapters alternate between characters and time periods. The plot is more like a through-line in the story than a sequence of events, but before the end of the novel, you’ll see that the grief process is the main “action.” Grief associated with death, yes, but also other kinds of grief. Miller’s strength in conveying the pain of loss was authentic, moving, and realistic. Graham is the lodestar of the story, the pivot point, but the other characters have their own inner lives, also. Annie and her daughter, Sarah, have a tendency to look at their emotional wounds from multiple angles, obsessively, and allow the anguish to eat at them.This is a nuanced character study, chiefly interior—reflective, thoughtful, complex, with a keen emotive quality that is both quiet and disquieting. Don’t look for passion, carnage, active adventure. The author instead deftly constructed a cerebral but also visceral narrative. I know that I provided a lot of descriptors, which may or may not be helpful for a potential reader curious about the premise and the dynamics of this book. This is the most stately, restrained, and measured of all of Sue Miller’s novels. The voice and tone of MONOGAMY reveal the private hells of people who share blood or bond but carry despair privately, often silently. Secrets intensify their loneliness, and the burdens they shoulder create deep, yawning wounds that hemorrhage when disturbed.Blended family issues raise tensions between them, and revelations bleed through with Miller’s artless subtlety. Graham, a partnered owner of a Boston bookstore, is the most gregarious and generous of the family, a big man with a big voice and big appetites. An oversized Teddy Bear, warm and devoted. Overwhelming at intervals, and periodically oblivious to the guilt and distress he places on others. Annie is pretty and reserved, not confrontational, reticent to share her most conflicted concerns. First wife Frieda remains in the picture and is Graham’s closest confidante; she still has residual and unresolved pain. They have a son together, Lucas, now a successful man. Annie and Graham have a daughter, Sarah, who as an awkward teen turned to Frieda for maternal support. Moreover, Frieda and Annie gradually form a bond, progressing to best friends, which pleases Graham. But this isn’t a soapy story; Miller keeps it seasoned and sophisticated.Graham’s garrulous nature seduces others to concede to his way of shaping life, his narrative. But you can still pick through the individual memories that sway to perception. It’s the kind of story that, despite the title, is not a beach read or skin teaser. It’s adult, mature, and requires the inward patience you reserve for a sober, contemplative tale. Some readers may conclude that there is too much unnecessary detail, which I initially thought when Miller expanded on what may seem extraneous detail. However, these small, even trivial matters verify our own quotidian lives. I closed the book satisfied and also relieved to return to my own concerns.

Much has to do with the kind of attachments we choose as adults; the decision on whether to have children; and acceptance of the limits placed on our lives. Sons, daughters, fathers, and mothers--especially motherhood and its significance to the various characters—are intimately portrayed with depth and realism. The story is ripe with a vivid cast and tightly paced plot lines. I didn’t notice any “quotable” passages, but the propulsive narrative and bustling prose laid out a harsh indictment against the desire for nature to be fair. The focus on mothers, and women excluded from motherhood, underscore not just the external demand to conform, but how it is a women’s burden to weigh. And then there are the women who can’t have what they want.My only complaint is that I don’t think Hooper did sufficient research on registered nurses’ education, particularly Labor & Delivery nurses. I’m a psychiatric nurse, and I can tell you that all nurses are familiar with most of the basic lab tests. For an L&D nurse (or ANY nurse) not to know what an FSH test is—and then, after learning, still ignorant of how a baby is implanted—is patently unbelievable. Call it occupational hazard, but it took me right out of the story. There were a few other details that cast a nurse as oblivious to basic facts educationally, so I deducted a star. I was unable to trust the character’s authenticity, and it removed me from an otherwise gripping storyline. However, I would still highly recommend this book for its emotional wallop and life-like portrayal of (especially) women on a precipice.

A smile too dangerous to keep.” The author augments realism in order to portray it. Reading MIGRATIONS is akin to reading poetry; images are created that bend the narrative and McConaughy liberates it from gravity, periodically. Her dystopian epic is sprinkled with Arctic dust. No matter how bleak, there is the natural world that can still surprise you, and lift you beyond earthly misgivings. This story of loss, love, and terrestrial devastation parallels the contradictions of Franny Stone, the central character—and how she perceives the world. At first, I yanked back from Franny’s confessions; the visuals caused me to conjure up a shock absorber in the pit of my stomach to protect myself from the bullets and shell casings of her grief and remorse. Likewise, the dystopian setting is realistic and immanent. In spite of ourselves, can we end up sittin’ on a rainbow? A subtle, redemptive refrain pulses the story—a bittersweet note that would have been cliché under the pen of a lesser author. McConaghy hit the sweet spot with Franny’s fugitive wings and I even dreamt about the Arctic terns, their alleged last flight of the near future. If you Wiki the flight paths and mating principles of the Arctic tern, you’ll be impressed, maybe astonished. They mate for life, and are the most migratory birds in the animal kingdom. The author was brilliant to use them as the primary metaphor in this book. (Ripe reader discoveries here). The terns glide as well as fly, are circumpolar, like the author’s language. The prose persuaded me to look up, above the horizon, where mercy confronts despair.It’s partly about your rhythm syncing with the book’s, and being as vulnerable as Franny and her husband, Niall. MIGRATIONS invited me to sink and soar, burrow and bury, float within and sail above. It would have been trite if there hadn’t been such essential and elemental meaning to every event, scene, dialogue. What I might call speculative and celestial reading but logical, probable, and emotional—whether stitched together or pulled apart.

Sliger conveyed her themes and placed the plot within the context of art and also intimacy. The structure isn’t inventive but the pieces interlock well enough. There are pique flashes now and then in this chiefly predictable story.Modern day journalist, Kate Aitken, is fired from her NYC job, an ambitious career destroyed by formidable men in a #MeToo backstory that is gradually revealed. Kate goes west to a northern California boutique town to posthumously organize a well-known photographer’s personal effects. Miranda Brand died by reported suicide in the early nineties, and her son, Theo, hires Kate to archive her effects and uncover any pieces that may reap rewards. As this is Sliger’s debut, I applaud her effort and stayed sufficiently involved to finish. She is a compassionate and skilled writer—-(if you aren’t, your abilities are limited). So, if the author takes more risks in subsequent novels, she’ll take off. What this narrative lacked was tension, except on a few occasions; it stuck to a deliberate, formulaic arc. Sliger put together a somewhat derivative story but her writing kept me going. Pace was slack, with wearying repetition and chapters lacking momentum. However, Miranda’s diary breathed vigor and urgency into a dead character that surpassed the living ones. The title could mean either “destroy me” or “I can put myself back together.” As I progressed, that is the question I would ask about both Kate and Miranda. There were similarities in their tensions and inequity issues with men and mental health anxieties that undermined their desires for recognition. But, for all the narrative filling, it was periodically like a warm, moist cake with too much gooey and sweet pudding in the middle. Pared down, it could have been pacey, provocative, and half the page count. It lagged when Sliger reiterated ordeals, many of them internal, so I just wanted her to get on with it. If I seem to mostly be complaining about this book, that’s not my full intention. Sliger has much to offer, as soon as she trusts herself enough to leap out of the box. As Miranda said: “New theory: no image is complete without a clue to its continuity. A line that moves beyond the edge. The shadow of an unseen object. A pattern extending outward. Something suffering beyond the edges of the frame.” I look forward to Sliger’s continued work.Thank you to Farrar, Straus, and Giroux for sending me an ARC....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Apr 2020,"Apr 04, 2020","Apr 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45892241-take-me-apart

HPaulette Jiles impressed me with her writing style, her flair for period prose, and historical atmospherics in her lyrical novel, NEWS OF THE WORLD. Here again, she shines in her confident writing skills and cinematic sense of place and time. Jiles’ life on a ranch near San Antonio and her talent playing the Irish tin whistle no doubt brings her close to the landscape and musical components of this novel. I admit to being carried away by the rich and descriptive settings of 1865 Texas and the hardships faced in the South after the Civil War. The author highlights the continued racism and class distinctions that plague the nation in the postwar South in this Western adventure tale. Simon’s cherished Markneukirchen fiddle served as an instrument of beauty and a weapon of destruction, which created trouble and salvation in his journey across the Texas frontier.Simon, who appeared as a lesser character in NEWS OF THE WORLD, is the main character in Jiles’ newest, an itinerant and talented fiddler player who avoids conscription due to his boyish looks and agility—he’s quick and can outwit almost anyone he confronts. But, he eventually gets nailed after a brawl in a bar in Victoria, Texas; fortunately, he avoids battle by playing in a regimental band with some ragtag musicians, and when the Confederacy falls, he falls, too—falls in love with an indentured young woman, Doris, who he sees fleetingly when playing for officers of the North and South at the end of the war. She is a governess for a Union officer, a man with sinister intentions and allotted power in government. Doris feels her heart swell, also, at the sight of Simon. The rest of the novel is the search for both of them to find their way to each other, despite demands that require them to be apart.Beyond the author’s assured writing and immersive setting, I wasn’t able to install myself in the story. The characters, for the most part, felt like cutouts from the age, and most were either heroes of integrity or villains, and were portrayed with caricature-like reliance, and keepers of their own convictions. It was a bit like watching a Disney meets Hallmark film, with romance as the key to winning audience endorsement. The episodes and events that lead to the windup and the details of various trials and tribulations resulted in predictable outcomes on the way to the sentimental conclusion. At times it felt static and varnished; there was no moral ambiguity that mattered, and it possessed a PG type of sweetness. Even the fraught violence seemed mitigated by a lectern morality. There was no speculation or reflection required for the reader, as it was served up soft like a 19th century mutton stew with boiled vegetables. However, the lush descriptions, acerbic dialogue between men, and the backdrop of poverty, yellow fever, and drunken bar fights, if stereotypical, might engage some readers sufficiently to forget about nuance.In NEWS, Doris speaks with trenchant boldness on behalf of a vulnerable girl who needed help, but in SIMON, Doris was relegated to the back burner for much of the novel, where she waited to be rescued, although her incisive mind demonstrated a more independent agency. There were other characters that were impossibly endearing, such as a whistle player who quoted Poe with emotive flourishes, a naive Irish boy on bodhran, and a Tejano guitarist. Even with a colorful nature given to all, the story felt stilted in execution. In fact, Simon’s motley band, with their charming subversiveness, seemed more as sounding boards or points for Simon’s strengths more than agents for themselves. It’s Simon’s intentions and ambitions that matter most in this narrative. “His future was all there like a three-draw-spyglass shut up and compact and he would draw it up cylinder by cylinder.”As much as I savored the beauty of Jiles’ way with words, I felt distant from the story. My emotions weren’t bound up with the oversold characters, and the plot plodded on as expected. Rules in Civil War Texas are enforced with violence, and the great weight of martial law leads to constant struggle, defiance, and anarchy. Ever the chivalrous Simon emerges as a Western hero, with...”heroic thoughts. Rescuer’s thoughts. Savage thoughts.” I just wish it gave me a chance to have my own thoughts.

Ho-hum stuff compared with Meyer’s sizzling talents.Vaughn is also trying to prove to a lover—well, her son, actually, that the Serious Crimes Unit the Hawks, was not corrupted, nor was he bought. But it all felt prosaic. And the alternating narratives of Griessel and another character, Daniel, that may merge with Benny’s current case later on didn’t have sufficient spark to start the motor for me. And Mbali Kaleni, probably the most colorful of all characters in Meyer’s past books, has become the most notable of one-note creatures in THE LAST HUNT.Thanks to Meyer’s intelligence, which does filter out some of the ennui of this putdownable book, I found some ground to settle in and still engage with the clever plot. Daniel’s fate became alluring at times, and towards his climax I was surely all in, but I wish that the vitality and spontaneity of the author’s past books had been injected into Last Hunt. But I will be first in line for whatever Meyer writes next, anyway.Addendum: Most readers love this one. Perhaps my reading experience here is because nothing has more danger and kilowatts as our current global pandemic.

I finished Baron before the coronavirus rolled in, when I was These are uncertain times, and all the dystopian books I’ve read come back to haunt me. I finished Baron before the coronavirus rolled in, when I was carefree. This book does not console, but real life was fine then. Reading it now may trigger intense dwelling on things. There’s no strong redemption, and the tone is black with ignorance melted down to absurdity. Krasznahorkai portrays its nihilism with burlesque delivery, like a sinister clown dancing for wages. Any pretension is tongue-in-cheek because the narrative is also compelling—there’s a town reminiscent of Brigadoon, but inverted and bleak because it exists in denial of its own nature. The emperors are walking the streets naked and bragging of their finery, and the existential threat of doom hovers while the town vacillates between hammer and nail.An aging Lord Baron escapes gambling debts in Buenos Aires, where he has spent much of his life. He returns to this burg of a town in Hungary (far away from Budapest) where he was born, a melancholy, static village where mediocrity glitters to perfection in a place that Google forgot. Baron Wenkheim has vivid nostalgia for the one woman, Marika, who got away from him in his youth. He packs his bags and travels back by train with the intention of asking Marika to marry him. I can’t remember how old he is now—mid 60s—70?Krasznahorkai is a combination of Dostoevsky, Beckett, Kafka, and David Lynch, with some of the humor of 1984 and Brave New World circulating. It is difficult to describe, because it is an experience of tone and syntactical intensity and athleticism that creates this lost world of parody, but the cast of Baron believe their agendas have gravitas. There are a few unsung antiheroes, one or two that they could play up in a movie version. I won’t mention who they are, because that is part of reader discovery.Marika is intriguing, as is her relationship with her best friend. This tomb of a book is partly a portrayal of alliances, colleagues, partnerships, family, friends. There are grifters, whiners, thinkers, bikers, a chorus, musicians, repurposed old horses for royal pageantry, and there’s a monkish professor who wants to rid the planet of imbecility and only allows himself to think for an hour or so daily, if you can imagine that. It’s difficult for someone so cerebral.Krasznahorkai doesn’t write in straightforward talk. At the end of a two-page sentence, however, you have gotten to the core, the seeds, and the juice. Krasznahorkai creates generous growth around malignancy. Give him a blank space and he will erect the cosmos to hell, but in a wise, heavenly way.

Instead of Oceania or World State, it’s the Transparent City. Instead of soma, a crystalline product in the water creates a feeling of constant peace and wellbeing. Like the novels before, the people are controlled by government manipulation with an absurdist execution of an ideology that nevertheless is widely accepted by the citizens. Yet, in SURRENDER, it’s difficult for anyone to literally define this ideology. Rather, the dwellers soon adapt to the lifestyle or are labeled traitors.A decade of war has been going on in an unnamed country. The protagonist—also unnamed—and his unnamed wife haven’t heard from their two sons in years; they are off fighting this war in parts unknown. This man and his wife have lost their farm, the animals have disappeared and the water has almost dried up. Moreover, they have taken in and grown fond of a young mute boy they call Julio, who showed up six months ago at their farm, before the transfer to their new home. This transfer is accomplished by a rounding up effort via regional agents.Cooperative citizens are taken to the Transparent City, where everything is made of glass or some derivative or similarity. All is transparent; you can see what everyone is doing at all times. It never even gets dark—there is no night, so day is day and night is day, too. Nothing has an odor anymore—not even people. No longer the enjoyable and complex odors of your spouse. And everyone has ample food; shelter; a job; clothing; and supplies. They lack for nothing, and don’t need money. All is complacent and serene. The narrator works at a sewerage plant—but no worries, waste matter has no smell.What compelled me was the convincing voice of the narrator/protagonist. He is getting weary with all this happiness, with the enforcement of compliant behavior by a government that doesn’t state what it stands for—in fact, the new citizens become the government, by direct complicity in its function. Does nobody question what is going on and why? The purpose of the provisional government is implied--to commandeer happiness, and to keep the masses obedient. But, to what end? What is the agenda? “Nobody here is different or better than anyone else, and nobody gives orders…We ourselves are the provisional government.” As the narrator becomes increasingly fraught with existential unease, the stakes get higher on the issue of resistance or surrenderA shout out to Carolina de Robertis for her remarkable, smooth translation.

THE DESTROYERS and LIGHTNING PEOPLE were standouts of dramatic and suspenseful plots with prose to match them, and kept me fascinated until the exciting finales. Like DESTROYERS, Bollen selected an exotic backdrop; not Greece this time, but Venice, Italy, for his story of intrigue and grift in his latest boiler, A BEAUTIFUL CRIME. Venice, to me, was like a character in the book—the unique pedestrian city of canals and confinement that, at times, expanded its claustrophobic setting, especially if you’re trying to get away with a “beautiful crime.” It brought me right back to Venice—-the author animated it for me once more.Two fairly new lovers, Nick and Clay, come to Venice from NYC with an agenda to rip off a wealthy American, Richard West, who lives in a historic palazzo, a walled half once shared with a former Dutch scion of NYC, Freddy Van der Haar, who lost his wealth to his flamboyant lifestyle and drugs, and recently died of AIDS. He left it to Clay, a true platonic friend. West lives in the other half of the house.West was an enemy to Freddy, and Clay has his reasons, also. The plan is to sell to West Freddy’s ancestral family’s (now) counterfeit silver, enough to pay off debts and start a new life together, away from their sorrows in NYC. It’s an elaborate but simple plan, but develops into even more entangled grift as their rip-off scheme becomes less risk averse and more perilous. I’ll leave it to the reader to watch the plot amplify.Bollen did an adept job of bringing Clay and Nick to life—less so on some of the secondary characters. Although the brutal plot was believable, and I felt each footfall along the Venetian Lagoon, the middle section of the story lost some tempo, as it lulled me with a stretched out narrative—until a knotty jam shook Nick to the core. It added another layer of suspense, but all this treachery had less effect on Clay and Nick’s relationship than I would have imagined.

The staying power of art, music, and performance and the nuanced exploration of memories are just some of the story’s refined themes. “Survival is insufficient” is a standout line, however banal on the surface. The story explores the aftermath of a flu epidemic that killed off most of the population. In The Glass Hotel (also being made into a series), a Ponzi scheme is the juncture of catastrophe--financial death instead of death by disease. There’s a bit of meta- in this new novel, as there’s a line referring to that flu pandemic (that hasn’t yet come) and even a minor character from SE that becomes a major character here. And both books begin at an end.“Begin at the end” are the first words of The Glass Hotel. But as St. John Mandel demonstrates, time is fluid, and the author once again nimbly links her characters’ lives and fates. Some find purpose after disaster, and others distinctly deteriorate. Still others navigate a borderless future and welcome the “sense of being outside of time and space.” The most compelling character is Vincent, a young woman that became the trophy girlfriend of the Ponzi schemer, posing as his wife. There’s nothing fragile about Vincent, who is inextricably hewn to her half-brother, Paul, whom she rarely sees. Their coiled fate is subtly and powerfully drawn with a gradual and contextual force. She’s affected by the death of her mother, but Paul is ruined by the “idea” of Vincent. “I’ve only ever hated Vincent’s incredible good fortune at being Vincent instead of being me…” He envies her natural creativity and strength of survival, which he eternally strives for and fails, even when he is successful. His core is hollow.While SE is set in the near future, Hotel takes place in the past. St. John Mandel consistently pens lucid, haunting and moody prose. Both novels tackle crisis; our personal ghosts; borders; memory, and the nature of time. I’m not going to rehash the plot; I’m more interested in the similarities and differences of both books, like bookends with completely different stories. The author purposely linked the two herself, which adds to my fascination. SE is exuberant and optimistic, eclipsing collapse with creativity. GH is stark, lean, angular, shadowy but just as keen. More profiteering than propheteering. Eclipsing creativity with collapse. But there’s doomed beauty in GH, glittering like faint stars after a storm. There’s paradoxically a sense of walls between people and places, and yet a conflux of conections and lands distant to each other—NYC, British Columbia, and the Toronto faraway Hotel Caiette, inaccessible except by boat.Both books are elegant, mosaic-like, but GH’s complexity is often latent or distant. The schemer, Jonathan Alkaitis, summons a “counterlife” to survive. Vincent’s counterlife is admirable—she takes on various roles like skin, and she isn’t a thief like Paul or Jonathan. My only complaint was that, unlike the warmth of SE, The Ghost Hotel felt remote, whereas Station Eleven was spirited. The characters in Hotel were predominantly unknown to me, even when they became familiar. Perhaps St. John Mandel wanted them to be unknowable. I spent much of the book trying to reach out emotionally to the story and its people, but I kept sliding backwards into the gully of murk. Although I assigned this one 4 stars instead of the 5 I gave to SE, it didn’t disappoint. The Glass Hotel just didn’t embrace me the same way. I did enjoy choosing my favorite characters, though. Vincent, her anti-hero blend of shrugs and grace, and Walter, the loner who feels at home at the isolated hotel. None of the characters came across as archetypes, which is genius!Sorry about my lengthy , nobody likes a long . I’m enchanted with Emily St. John Mandel’s haunting style of writing, her brilliant themes, and her clarity of prose. If you are already a fan of her writing, it’s a no-brainer--get thee to a bookstore. If you’ve never read her work, read both these novels--I think of them as a whole, these bookends. But SE is 2/3 and GH is a necessary 1/3 bond to the latter, there’s a connective tissue. Her work will echo in my heart for years to come. (P.S.

They tried to convert an isolated tribe of people who spoke an obscure language, and depended on succeeding through the grace and will of God. Joan Thomas’s alacrity with the primary facts builds a captivating story of the husbands, and especially the five wives. The wives were left stranded and widowed in the deep of the Ecuadorean rainforest. Without derision or deference, Thomas created fictional dialogue and suitable temperaments on factual characters, based on what was already known, and twined it to her lucid imagination. Her style of prose and the observant, understated voice are so eloquent that it allows the reader to glean what was plausible. It is a potent and masterful novel rich in gravitas.To be frank, I expected a serious bias to float to the top of the text, depending on Thomas’s approach. Instead, she let the characters speak for themselves and did not lay a writer’s judgment on them. That’s why it is so masterful—she doesn’t tell you what to think; you think for yourself and conclude corollaries or upshots of your own. It boils down (but not reductively so) to different groups and their objectives for meddling in an ancient tribe’s habitation. The missionaries, the capitalists (oil companies and that which they bring aboard), even a Catholic priest, all have distinct and definite goals. Agendas clash and occasionally align. The priest was more pragmatic in his role there, but the Evangelists were more ardent and enthusiastic about their calling from God, which they believed they heard from Him directly.I am impressed with the author’s ability to research these missionaries and give them layered and complex natures. Wife and widow, Betty Elliot (who became a well-known Christian author and speaker), said, “But six men now have given their lives to the Aucas’ salvation. That’s a marvelous indication of God’s love and purpose.” As a secularist, I cringed, but Thomas didn’t reduce Betty to simplistic pronouncements of God’s glory. Betty also sensed, “The widow’s task is not weeping but thinking. Every widow has to grasp the new shape of her life, so that she might embark upon it wholeheartedly. Every widow has to understand how one event led to the next…this new preoccupation absorbs her every minute.”Three generations of this church come alive in the course of this novel. The moral center may be young woman Abby, third generation and contemporary figure, Betty’s grandniece and the granddaughter of another of the wives (and, as Joan Thomas tells us in her note, a wholly fictional character). Abby contemplates and synthesizes the information she has learned about the Operation—the nuanced miscalculations that turned the Operation into an ambush, the future of the Waorani people and where they stand now in contrast to 1956, and Abby’s own points of divide with the church, where her dad is a pastor. She perceives it from many sides, and in this way the reader experiences how generations evolve as their lifestyle, education, and environment changes.I don’t want to rehash the plot, as it is the narrative; characters; the poise of Thomas’s writing; the devotion and devoutness of the wives; and the struggle to raise a family in the deep unknown, far away from your home, that has the stirring impact. Creating their own hearth under these challenging circumstances acutely affected them. I differ with the missionaries’ belief that God directed these events—and that the outcome was for God’s larger purpose—but the novel isn’t about a verdict, it’s an exploration into the human condition; it’s not a debate, it’s a penetration into the experiences of all involved. When I finished the last page, I heard the silence around me, and then the sounds of nature, in different proportions, depending how near or far, how loud or faint. In this astounding novel, all the voices are present. We, the reader, are witnesses to cultural shifts and true believers and their flaws and missteps. Are there consequences for civilizing a tribe with your own mores and values? Is your faith and sincerity the X factor? What price is righteous? Are we imperialists?

I thought tAMERICAN DIRTYUp until a few days ago, I had a favorable  posted here, before I knew the truth of what went down with American Dirt. I thought that Jeanine Cummins was telling this story at the behest of her husband--that she was telling the story of undocumented immigrants from Latinx countries through him. Cummins told us she understood their story because of her husband, her undocumented immigrant husband. But, then, shockingly, the public learned that she misled us purposely—-and, in cahoots with Flatiron books, framed the lie in her reader’s note to us in her book. Flatiron and Cummins wholly mislead and deceived us as readers into thinking the writer’s husband was Latinx. That is shameless and egregious deception from both the writer and the publisher. And it also demonstrates that both the author and the publisher don’t respect readers and other writers, and were aware before publication that they needed cover for a white woman to tell the story of perilous times for Latinx immigrants. So, they hatched this hideous plan to betray their readers.Cultural appropriation, which has gone unchecked for decades and maybe centuries, is when the white majority (or any majority) deigns to tell the very story of the people they have oppressed. It isn’t about being PC. It’s about being culturally sensitive. I’m Caucasian and a Jew, and I’ll be darned if I will defend my white peers that get defensive and throw vitriol and hostility toward Latinx readers and writers who say that enough is enough. White writers should not tell the story through Latinx eyes after being a major factor in hurting and oppressing them for all those years. Don’t cry censorship when you have a responsibility. Ethics, morals, awareness, anyone? It is time to wake up. And it is time for Jeanine Cummins and Flatiron to apologize for betraying the trust of readers and writers alike.What Flatiron did was select a Caucasian writer with a Caucasian husband, and then try to falsify the author’s experience into, “I understand, my husband is an undocumented immigrant” for a 7-figure publishing deal. This bad faith deception is the most noxious, insufferable, arrogant, money-grubbing and mean-spirited behavior in writing and publishing. I am disappointed in my Caucasian friends who have closed their ears to what Latinx and Asian and other ethnic writers are angry about. If it is supposedly okay for a Caucasian writer to culturally appropriate the feelings and experiences of Latinx people that face hardship, danger, and death, then why go to such treacherous lengths to hide the truth of Cummins’ husband? Why try to foist this bogus narrative of “undocumented immigrant husband” by placing her erstwhile empathy in the context of shared experience?This isn’t about Latinx people/writers crying “victim.” They are crying foul. Fraud. Why are 7-figure publishing deals like this to tell a story about the Latinx experience awarded to a Caucasian writer and not a Latinx writer? About 99% of the characters in AD are Latinx. This isn’t the same as a book that CONTAINS ethnic minorities. This is about having the temerity and greed to tell their story FOR them under false pretenses. Shameless. It’s time for those that aren’t woke to wake up and listen. And don’t try to shame and blame Latinx voices for “playing victim.” How outrageous to do more pretzel twisting. Don’t be insensitive and crude and then try to censure ethnic minorities from voicing their concerns by branding then with disparaging labels. That’s boorish and obscene. How about just taking a step back and promising to listen? Yes, just listen to the voices that many are bent on crushing. Shame on Caucasians to lash out at Latinx people for not agreeing with Caucasians who think we, the Caucasians, have the right to tell their (Latinx) stories and shame on Caucasians that think they have the right to decide how Latinx people should respond.

Children are naturally vulnerable, and in the precious developing years, they look to their parents for the promise of love, support, and security. What happens when this pledge is shattered? That is the essence of Belgian author Adeline Dieudonné’s weighty, heart wrenching debut. A father, who is a burly, muscular man and game-hunter of beasts is a beast himself. He beats his wife in front of the children, and enforces cruel and intimidating rules and routines. Additionally, he has a room full of proprietary taxidermy as trophies to his exploitations. He orders them to stay away from that room. When the head of the family is a vicious monster, can REAL LIFE end well?The young daughter and narrator spends all of her home time playing with and trying to protect her younger brother, Sam. It is a colossal task, especially when Sam and his sister are painful witnesses to a tragedy outside the family. This is where the author’s titanic talent for anthropomorphism is on astonishing display. Those stuffed animals, described in their deadness in an earlier scene, slowly unravel and tightly coil Sam by figuratively inhabiting his body:“The emptiness in his eyes had gradually filled with something incandescent, pointed, and sharp-edged. Whatever was living inside the hyena had slowly migrated into my little brother’s head. A colony of wild beasts had set up residence there, feeding off slivers of his brain.”This is the rule, not the exception, of Dieudonné’s writing. She’s raw, passionate, and tender. Anyone with a heartbeat will be moved, decimated, and horrified by the narrator’s story. Often, even when the children were playing outdoors and visiting their free-spirited old woman friend in the woods, I felt suffocated, at times finding it difficult to breathe.

In REAL LIFE, the mother appears meek to the children, like an “amoeba.” That’s what happens when you’ve been beaten into submission.This is not a book for the faint-hearted.

But where are its edges, ceiling, and boundaries? In Saint X, these concepts are intimately explored. Claire Thomas, a young woman in her early thirties is outwardly functioning and productive but suffered early trauma that prevents her from embracing her life. That is what made this novel so uncanny and compelling. Not the “murder mystery” aspect of a girl’s death, but the human cost of the survivors. Schaitkin opens a window into this and demonstrates how several characters struggle with authenticity; most of them harbor a secret or two. Saint X may seem like a crime story from the outset, but it is a fully realized probe into the search for personal integration. If you are looking for a fast-paced thriller, look elsewhere, but there is certainly an overriding suspense in this narrative that adds high stakes. Saint X is a (fictional) Caribbean island with resorts for the wealthy. The islanders themselves are often struggling financially and some of them work at the resorts, catering to the visitors. This is the place of trauma for Claire and her family.When Claire was seven and her sister, Alison, was eighteen, their family visited for a Christmas holiday. Tragedy struck, and now decades later, Claire—now going by her middle name, Emily—is still trying to deal with the fallout. Decades later, Emily runs into Clive Richardson, a former suspect in the family tragedy that worked at the resort in Saint X, and who may know more than he admitted all those years ago. He’s a cab driver in NYC, and when Emily steps into his cab and sees his name, she makes a decision to do her own investigating. Clive doesn’t recognize her, of course, but she sets herself on a path that she hopes will be discovery and resolution. The novel alternates between characters and years, filling in backstories, laying a foundation, and giving us a compelling context for events that happened on Saint X, as well as the time before and after. Alison’s diary, recordings, and behaviors often contradict her private musings; Emily is concerned with the performative nature of individuals vs. their genuine concerns and interests, all while she is also performing for others. And Clive is largely inscrutable, but also haunted. “She haunts him, a ghost skulking at the edges of his vision. She shape-shifts, appearing in the form of other people.” We read, we wait, and clench our hands and hearts as the book progresses and searches out the private pain and suffering of the characters affected by tragedy. Moreover, it gradually reveals motivations and agendas that swirl around these individuals. “It’s not that my life was ordinary, but that I fell for it so completely, that I failed so utterly to detect within myself the darker currents that must have been there all along.” “It fell to me…I must inhabit the depths alone to uncover the truth, no matter what.”In undulating, lyrical prose, Shaitkin unpacks this story with measured and flawless control. It’s equal parts mystery and the examination of human nature. Emily/Claire and others search for truth and resolution, to put events in perspective and move forward with their lives. The theme of trauma, tragedy, dualities, grief, truth, and resolution are universal here as we are instantly installed in the heart of those affected, as the author persuades the reader into the very souls of these characters, and what drives their behaviors, affinities, and fears. It is about the ghosts that follow us, shadow us, live in our souls.“…nothing can quell her presence…She reaps pleasure from each small indignity…She has strung it together, just so. And he feels an anger at her that will never, ever be spent. Then he wonders what it says about him that he has made her into such a vindictive, punishing ghost.”Perfect for literary readers and those looking for a solid slow burn of a book.Thank you to Celadon for sending me an advanced reading copy for . #SaintX #Celadon...more",Notes are private!,1,16,1,"Oct 18, 2019","Oct 21, 2019","Nov 15, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43782399-saint-x

So I was thrilled to find a copy of her newest one ahead of the publishing date. Moore excels in narrative voice, the sincerity of the storyteller. As far as plot and characters, I remained engaged, but was occasionally disappointed in her tendency toward boilerplate formula TV. And yet, there were moments that Moore rose above her own limitations. LONG BRIGHT RIVER is a family drama where addiction triggers tragedy. And tragedy triggers addiction. Additionally, it's a murder mystery--killer of prostitutes on the loose (now where have we heard that plot before. Everywhere?). The serial killer was a bit of a lazy frame over the foundation; Mickey's relationship with her family and the community at large was more intimate and unsettling, as it was explored with more depth.The plot concerns Mickey, a police officer patrolling the seamier side of Philadelphia, her troubled, opiate-addicted sister, Kacey, and Kacey’s sudden disappearance. Sisters raised in the same family—to anyone interested in the study of environment on siblings—had dissimilar outcomes.Mickey keeps an eye on Kacey by frequently patrolling the area her sister hangs out and walks the streets as a hooker to keep up her habit. I was expecting the same enigmatic, mysterious, and unique plot as in Unseen World. This story is ripped from the headlines, but doesn’t go too much deeper, although Moore does absorb us into problematic family relations, addictive minds, and the nexus of trust. The elegiac tone set the undulating pace, and I felt comfortable just leaning into it and letting the prose and Liz Moore’s humanity seep through me.I kept expecting a valve to open up into another astonishing unseen world—that is, a fresh exploration of the human condition. It was a good story, and it simmered, but never quite boiled over for me. Elements of surprise were restricted and often familiar, and I predicted several plot points before actually getting there. So I focused more on the large swathes of inner dialogue and conflicts that compelled me, and was captivated by the familial bonds and why Mickey was periodically paranoid about the safety of her four-year-old son, Thomas. She senses danger surrounding her, and is also afraid for her missing sister and what may have happened to her.I give four stars instead of five because of what I felt was lacking, especially compared to THE UNSEEN WORLD. I don’t expect every book to change my perception of the world I live in (although some have!), but I want it to open a previously undiscovered window in my mind. Moore’s writing here is delicate and sensuous, and flowed lyrically. However, I didn’t learn anything exceptionally distinct or original. Yet, I do appreciate LONG BRIGHT RIVER and I recommend it as an addition to your reading shelf. And I look forward to what she writes next.Caveat: I am a psychiatric nurse who has worked with children, teens and adults, including chemical dependency and its effect on families.

Hence the eponymous title. Let that sink in. Gloria is the daughter of a Mexican immigrant. Imagine how quickly the authority figures in this unforgiving scrubland are quick to control the narrative, particularly the men. No hearts and flowers. Debut novelist Elizabeth Wetmore captures the casual but lethal misogyny of men toward women with a timestamp both powerful and gripping. Her measured, minimalist yet vivid narrative captures the era in all its bone dry and big sky grandeur. “The sky turns purple in the east, then blue-black, then old-bucket slate. In a few minutes it will be orange and red… the land stretched tight beneath the sky, brown stitched to blue…The sky is the best thing about West Texas, when you can remember to look at it.”The first pages begin at the end of the assault, and we watch Gloria pull herself together with her depleted stores of mental strength, because she doesn’t want to die. In daylight, the landscape opens up to reveal a litter of pump jacks, oil patches, mesquite, and always the hot sun punishing the sand and scrub while the girl, who spots a farmhouse, walks steadily toward it for safety. “There are piles of caliche rocks and stacks of old pipeline where rat snakes and copperheads and rattlers lie entwined, their breath slow and regular, waiting for spring.”This traumatic event kicks off a story of interconnected characters, centering on the women and ethnic minorities immersed in this hardscrabble West Texas life. Odessa is yet to be progressive; back then, it was downright terrifying for women who attempted to assert themselves. If you are an ethnic minority and your roots were in Mexico, you’re not even a second-class citizen (as women were); you were a third class citizen twice removed.A more nuanced, accepted violence --mental, emotional, and societal, and the overt objectification and narrow classification of females prevailed during this era. The reader is immersed in Odessa’s citizenry as well as its flora and fauna. Leave sentiment at the door, and when it does emerge, it’s earned. I could spend pages on Wetmore’s robust, strapping prose, her granular descriptions that also set mood, tone, voice, and atmosphere. The second person pov that only a master can pull off convincingly. Each sentence is rebellious and transcendent, a portrait of messy characters harboring hard secrets and long fears, salty tongues and a burst of inexorable courage. It’s primarily the voices of women-- how they coped, survived, and adapted to their lives. I can promise that not once will you find a platitude crawling from under any rock. The book just smokes.The main players are Gloria (Glory), who triggers the gradually unfolding plot; Corrine, a 60-something retired teacher—a grieving widow, an iconoclast; Debra Ann, a spunky, wiry and optimistic teenager with a weakness for horny toads, construction paper fortune-tellers, and lonely outcasts; and Mary Rose, a young mother pregnant with her next, weary and sleepless, rousingly so, as her mostly absent husband struggles in the failing cattle trade. These women and this story will sear into you with piercing clarity. Hope brackets tragedy in a drama peppered with screwball comedy wrapped in fresh tears. It’s all there, how women connected and men controlled. VALENTINE is one of the most lyrical and shattering books of the coming 2020 year—it deserves the Pulitzer. I cannot imagine a more phenomenally written book—I may have already said that.Prepare for some potent images that will nevertheless bring you to your knees. “She imagines her own limbs disconnected, fleeing into the desert to be picked clean by the coyotes she heard calling to each other all through the night. She imagines them blanched and worn smooth by the wind—a desert filled with dry bones, never to rise again--…”Read it and weep. And the sky, that West Texas star-filled sky. All my senses were piqued as the author tackles sound, sight, heat, cold, taste, as well as the politics between gender and class. VALENTINE is bracing in conflict and confrontation. You won’t read a better domestic and courtroom drama slash literary western; it may be the best novel I’ve read this year (publishing date April 2020). There’s something about a flawless portrayal of West Texas that few authors can wrest from their souls—Wetmore nails it. Even amid the majestic, endless skies there, women are suffocating and invisible. Immigrants are punished with crimes against their families. However, this narrative is the space where women also find their voices and let them be heard. Sharp and stout, seamlessly structured, Wetmore creates vibrant characters and a charged, electrifying story.Thank you to Harper Collins for sending me an ARC to ....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,Oct 2019,Oct 2019,"Nov 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52377380-valentine

The narrator/protagonist was successful in her professional life--persuasive, subtle, and empathetic. The reader could not be sure until the very end whether she was a reliable narrator, which added juice. In her latest foray, PLATFORM SEVEN, the narrator is an early 30s teacher—and she’s dead. She’s a ghost. A bit derivative or possibly gimmicky at first glance, but the author convinced me that the ghost character had a purpose, a mission. It was imperative for her to not only resolve questions about her untimely death, which happened here where she’s stuck--platform seven in Peterborough Railway Station (about 75 miles from London), but to examine her short life. For the first time, Lisa is taking charge of events that led to her demise. In death, she is growing up.As the novel opens, Lisa witnesses a suicide on platform seven. It disturbs her greatly, and she promptly begins her own detective work on who and why. It also stretches the imagination at times when she stumbles on canny coincidences and connections. Moreover, she starts to fall for a guy who of course can’t see or hear her, but he captivates her attention because he appears to be a possible next suicide. During this time, the reader is speculating how Lisa died. Over the course of the novel, she takes us into her troubling past and her complex and periodically painful bond with her parents. A large chunk of the story also concerns her domestic partnership with her lover, a doctor who is both manipulative and emotionally abusive.Doughty created a strong voice, and assured prose, which kept me reading until the end. However, I did have several problems with the story. It trotted in some conventional tropes, which she attempted to thicken with her empathy for some outcast characters, usually those who were employed at the station. At times it was too sentimental for my tastes, and it dragged in the middle. Towards the end, it dipped into sheer YA reading and some cheesiness, which never occurred in APPLE TREE YARD. In Lisa’s quest to identify and empathize with her characters, she inadvertently (to me) came close to patronizing them.The author widened her scope to be all-inclusive with these secondary character stories; some of the offshoots worked for me, but others seemed a bit strained, such as the station boss in a band that hid his purchase of a ukulele from his long-suffering wife. Doughty’s novel explored the moments of joy, pain and isolation that connect people; even loneliness is shared by everyone. Her talent for subtlety enriched the narrative, but intermittently she was too pointed. And her relationship with her boyfriend made me want to pull out my hair or throw the book across the room.

Lawrence Osborne is a master at keeWhile reading this novel, I sensed a haunting and tilted atmosphere, a gradual closing in, an existential, nausea. Lawrence Osborne is a master at keeping us off guard with a rogue seduction, while his prose finesses with knife-like precision. Set on the Greek island of Hydra, this narrative contains restless, disaffected, wealthy, privileged characters, and a lusty, alluring setting. Osborne’s characters don’t change—-don’t look for a moral reckoning here. They just become more of themselves—their darker animus that exists within their light, surface beauty. It’s a story borne of a new friendship between two young women who meet during this long, humid summer on Hydra, each staying with their parents, searching for a way out of their time-laden ennui, eager for adventure.Naomi is 24, British, sophisticated and a lawyer recently fired by the firm she worked at for reasons that will gradually be revealed. Her father, Jimmie, is a vacuous rich art dealer and her Greek stepmother is snobbish and cruel. Naomi herself is manipulative and cynical. Sam, an American of 19 or 20, is much more naïve and also beautiful, and besotted with Naomi’s urbanity. Both girls are staying with their parents, and find an enigmatic pull toward each other. “What beautiful animals we are…beautiful as panthers.” Jimmie is still trying to connect with Naomi on meaningful matters, and is bemused by her point of view on a theoretical discussion concerning migrants and puzzled by his daughter’s lack of authenticity. To him, it’s a contradiction of status for young affluent people to be empathetic to liberal social causes, although he is rather phony himself; he concludes “their consciousness had been created by the media, not by life.”Unbeknownst to Jimmie, Sam and Naomi, on a long walk to a remote part of the island, came across a half-naked Arab migrant, Faoud, literally washed up on the rocks. They decide to make him a project, and this is where it gets murky, as the reader soon realizes that their motives—mostly Naomi’s, who takes charge—are not altogether pure or reasonable, but rather reckless. “His misfortunes made him charismatic…and therefore arousing.” Yet this seeming vulnerable refugee is multilingual and cosmopolitan, and not necessarily acquiescent. In fact, he is confident and insolent; however, Naomi insists on rebranding him, or tailoring him to her will to carry out a plan to save him, help him to safely flee to mainland Europe, one with unintended consequences.The second half of the story belongs primarily to Faoud, and the cat and mouse suspense amps up the pace and the stakes. Mixed motives, misguided perceptions, and bent moralities add complexity and depth, as Osborne is not going to release the tension for the reader or connect his theme to a larger humanity. I was awed at Osborne’s ability to write this elegant satire, blending bite with the sublime. “Humans are like spiders in their old age, moving from shadow to shadow in the bright sun, inexhaustible in their way.”...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 19, 2019","Sep 21, 2019","Oct 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32829350-beautiful-animals

Margaret Atwood, Emily St. John Mandel, China Mieville, and many others have contoured this landscape with winning stories of “what ifs” taking place in the near future. Now, Helen Phillips, perhaps joining China Mieville’s niche of “weird fiction,” and that “other” genre-- fabulist fiction, has written a brief novel (almost novella-ish) centering on a paleobotanist trying to balance her home life with husband and two small children with her professional life of digging up artifacts of the past. It's even got tendrils of Kafka, but sideways and contemporary.It’s a very personal story that I think countless women can relate to. Trying to harmonize those two lives can be an enterprise of almost dissociative proportions. That’s how it seems with one mother, Molly, still breast-feeding her youngest baby. What happens when your fears reach a breaking point—that thin line you’re walking between organizing the many pieces that must come together (especially when hubby is often out of the country pursuing his professional life as a musician) between mothering, finding a babysitter, and maintaining your work responsibilities? And the exhaustion that comes with it—and the guilt that you feel when you find yourself wishing for a private space with no obligations to anyone. This maternal horror story dangles itself in the paranoia and emotional riptide that consumes Molly, at her most vulnerable—home with two small children, one of which she is still nursing around the clock. What happens when she hears an intruder?There’s a lot more to unpack and interpret here than at first peek. If you don’t engage, than you may complain that it is one long diatribe on the vicissitudes of motherhood. But, digging deeper, as Molly must do at her work at the once former Phillips 66-turned-dig site, the eerie narrative and a quixotic character nudges the reader closer to the abyss, that place where the continuum between anxiety and panic not only exists, but may consume you. I don’t want to spoil the plot, or the layers you will uncover. It is a mesmerizing tale of identity and motherhood and being caught up in “the cyclone of your children’s needs.” And the ending is provocatively ambiguous....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 18, 2019","Sep 19, 2019","Oct 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42201850-the-need

In WRITERS AND LOVERS, Lily King’s fifth novel, the story centers on Casey, a 31 year-old single woman and waitress living in Boston trying to finish her first novel, a six-year project so far. It’s 1997, and Casey is drowning in debt from school loans. Her mother has recently died, and she tries to hide her exhausting grief. Romantically, she’s a disaster of failed relationships. She lives in a damp shed-turned-efficiency attached to her landlord’s tony house. An early emotional trauma concerning her father keeps rearing up and weighing her down. Casey’s mask of irreverence is slipping and her life is unraveling.Despite Casey’s ongoing grief, King’s story has an even balance of droll wit. Scenes at the trendy restaurant, Iris, where Casey works, contain some high octane humor and energy, as the reader sees the backstage drama and antics of the restaurant staff, while the seated guests frequently remain as set pieces, although occasionally come into searing focus. King’s prose is clean, nuanced, and linguistically knowing. In 1997, we still pitted one gender against another in casual conversation (these days, we try to equalize more fluently), and King captures that era flawlessly, not just by saying it is 1997, but by evoking it. The author uses language lightly, but with poignancy.There are many passages about grief, especially, that stirred me. Here is one, demonstrating Casey’s loss with relation to the novel she has been writing for these past six years: “I’ve lost access to a world where my mother is a little girl reading in a window or twirling in fast circles on the street, her braids raised high off her back. Outside of that novel she is dead. There seems to be no end to the procession of things that make my mother feel more dead.”My primary complaint is the cinematic ending, which I don’t think was necessary or better than other choices that King could have made. For me, a little ambiguity goes a long way, vs. a Hollywood ending. Is this how King’s life moved forward? Probably not so much. Did the editors or publishers push for this? It’s a rhetorical question, of course. It could have even cheapened the novel, but fortunately for King, her head is mostly above the fray, and I still found the book an enjoyable feast of food, words, and lovers.Thank you to the publishers of Grove/Atlantic for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Oct 12, 2019","Oct 14, 2019","Oct 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45289222-writers-lovers

Redemption is also an energetic but nuanced theme with this writer. THE BEAR is a completely different style and format—it is an adult fairytale, but the allegory reaches back to his past books and covers grief, shame loss, survival, and redemption.I am quite picky about adult fairytales, as they don’t always work for me. The writer must evoke more than a cleverness to twist an old fairytale into something new. Well, Krivak has done just that. It’s a parable that fits into the heart of Krivak’s overriding themes, and although it didn’t pack the same emotion for me as THE SIGNAL FLAME, I admit to feeling tender towards this father and daughter throughout the tale, the last two people on earth. I anticipated the ending, but it didn’t change my attitude toward the story. Krivak’s little family, living in the shadow of a mountain, evoked that sphere of unconditional love. The father taught lessons to his daughter, but he also conveyed deep feelings that can’t be taught; his daughter responded to him in kind. And her respect for the natural world was a family trait that was elegantly passed down to her. Some beautiful touches add to the atmosphere, such as animals who channel human traits and the girl who can communicate with animals. It’s a story about one small family, but as I turned the pages, it became a gentle but prophetic fable about the ceaselessness of Mother Nature, the end of the era of humans, and how this timeless march toward oblivion is both haunting and hopeful.Thank you to the publisher for providing me a copy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Sep 18, 2019","Sep 18, 2019","Oct 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45869112-the-bear

Other than that, I’m not, unfortunately, a big fan of this book. This sequel also has a context. Thirty-five years ago, I don’t think Atwood even considered writing a follow-up, or finale. It didn’t need one. It wasn’t just a dystopian thriller. It was a What If from a ripe, imaginary mind, and she pulled it off spectacularly. Why undermine it with this unnecessary sell-out? Because of the TV series? I do not see the value in taking a theme and turning it into another theme. What is it with superheroes these days? We have enough of them with capes, webbed feet, and unstoppable knee strength. There were no heroes in Handmaid’s Tale (the book). If Bruce Miller et al. wanted to create one out of June, I was fine with that. The series, to me, was its own story. It continued and embellished on the original but it kept them, in satisfying ways, separate. Now they are joined at the hip. And the spoilers were likely led by the producers, and now the series' end (and likely going forth with season 4) is now forecast, which comes from writing a “series tie-in book” by a great literary author who went commercial. It comes with baggage, with the acceptance that there’s a denouement and finality to the authoritarian ruthlessness and degradation to women in Gilead. I figure we didn’t need a ham-handed message and we didn’t need it to be written as the bookend to its predecessor. Atwood is capable and has written a Booker winner--The Blind Assassin, which was one of my most beloved of her books. The Testaments is way too on the nose for consideration, imho.There are three narrators—Aunt Lydia, a girl who grew up in Gilead, and a girl who grew up in Canada. Two of the three are more persuasive, but the Canadian girl’s story just descends into mass commercialism to entice mass readers. Not up to what I think of as Atwood’s standards, but more a coopting agreement with the TV series producers. Moreover, the novel turns a juicy villain into a martyred hero for the cause, which is both hackneyed and leaves nothing to the imagination. HT didn’t give answers, it didn’t require them. This novel was too determinate, too plot-based.I kept reading because, no doubt, Atwood can write. But it is impossible to judge this book in a vacuum. If it were a series by a middling author of escapades and thrillers, my expectations would have been met. But, for a writer of Atwood’s caliber, it struck me as a whole cloth sellout. I won’t give less than three stars, simply because of her knack for prose.

Dual timelines—2015 and 2051—tell the story of the defining event called the Spill and its aftermath, which divided the two eras. Clues are prudently dropped as the story unfurls on both sides of the Spill—the crisis that dramatically separate and connect both timelines. The harrowing part? I didn’t have to suspend much disbelief. Megan Angelo's vividly imaginative story is rife with the human passions, flaws, and misguided desires that blind an Instagram-infatuated and celebrity-hooked culture. Moreover, she impeccably measures out the menace and dread of a civilization that has lost its way. When people unwittingly trade authentic lives for ten million “likes,” the price of celebrity is a bargain bin fame farm, at the cost of free choice and humanity. The benefactors and benefiters shell it out cannily to those most willing to sell their souls.I don’t want spoil—or, em…spill the page and image-turning plot, but even the most jaded reader will be awed by the author’s chilling new world setting. Designer lives and designer pills are dispensed with cunning extortion; a picture perfect vista underscores a vast veneer of dystopian engineering.

Parveen Shamsa is a recent college graduate of anthropology in Northern California, where she has lived as an Afghan émigré since age two. Now, in 2009, at age 21, she is passionately inspired by a memoir, Mother Afghanistan, written by an American ophthalmologist and activist, Gideon Crane. Parveen decides to be the first American since Crane to go to this quiet village and stay with the same host family. Initially, Crane went to Afghanistan after he was busted as a crook, in exchange for his fraud schemes against the American government, and to redeem his adulterous past. Parveen is going as an idealist and to put her medical anthropology studies to good use. Through a charitable foundation that Crane initiated after his return to America, he built a maternity clinic in this village many miles away from Kabul, where he stayed with Waheed, Fereshta, and their six children--Fereshta was pregnant with their seventh. It was his grief over her death in childbirth that inspired his shiny, technologically advanced new clinic and the memoir of his experience there in the farm village. And currently, Crane’s activism has spread to influence the American military in elevating Afghanistan’s infrastructure, such as paving roads to allow outside access. Waheed is now married to Fereshta’s younger sister, and has had three more children. Moreover, he has taken on yet another young wife to help with the daily labor. Almost everyone in the village is illiterate, sharing the backbreaking farm work. The village’s religious leader, a shrewd businessman who keeps the inhabitants in check, does nothing to dispel their ignorance about medicine and infection control, or to assist in bringing education and modernity to village life. The village birth assistant, an ancient and suspicious woman, is content to keep the families in the Dark Ages and to resist innovation.But why does the female doctor only travel once a week to the clinic, for an afternoon only, and why is the technology sitting mostly idle? Although Crane spent money to staff the clinic, it sits there empty most of the time. Why does it seem that, even after all the donated monies, the women who are pregnant are no better off than before? These and other questions emerge as Parveen integrates into village life and attends all the appointments at the clinic. She sets up daily readings of the book chapters of Mother Afghanistan to any interested villagers, to demonstrate and uplift them with how “famous” their village is to Americans, and to help open their minds.Mother Afghanistan stood as an enigmatic unknown to these backward, hardworking, and earnest inhabitants, despite its reach in America. But once they started hearing the contents of the memoir from Parveen’s daily readings, the question of its truth, exaggeration, or outright fiction begins to unfold. The book was like the ziggurat of American intervention in Afghanistan, but is it truth or fable? Is paving over the roads equal to paving over the truth? Waldman also does a superb job of highlighting the paradox of deception between the military and Afghanistan. What is noble in ideology and workable in practice may require a sleight of hand. Parveen’s virtuous ideals could be both honorable and dangerous. It is a coming of age for her, to see shades of grey-- where black and white can be reductive and untenable between truth and lies—and can make all the difference between life and death. In graceful and measured prose, Waldman, in my estimation, exceeds even her last book, THE SUBMISSION, in moving me to the edge of the abyss and persuading me to realize that, from the comfort of the U.S., with our modern homes, big-screen TVs, and comfortable lifestyles, we may still be somewhere on the continuum between arrogance and ignorance. When a developed country like ours tries to help, it can scorch the earth even in the most undeveloped places of need.“…anthropology, while purportedly allowing us to understand other cultures, was really a tool to understand our own.”Thank you to @LittleBrown for this ARC in exchange for an honest .#AmyWaldman #ADoorintheEarth #AmyWaldman2019masterpiece...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Aug 07, 2019","Aug 11, 2019","Aug 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41716928-a-door-in-the-earth

This speculative fiction will no doubt be compared with THE STAND, THE PASSAGE trilogy and others; in fact, he gives a nod to them during the course of the novel. But Wendig is not merely standing on their shoulders. He’s capturing the essence of our era in this dystopian, epochal, and epic story, with well-developed characters and a sizzling plot. Wendig integrates drama and adventure, blending science, technology, human nature, a little romance, and good old-fashioned storytelling. Gravity and levity are keenly balanced and buttressed by mystery and suspense. Even after reading 780 pages, I didn’t want it to end (and it ends with the potential promise of a sequel).In rural Pennsylvania, seventeen-year-old Shauna wakes to a missing fifteen-year-old sister, Nessie, and subsequently finds her sleepwalking down the street, mute and unresponsive to her cries. Nessie’s eyes stare ahead and are as blank as nickels. Nothing can stop her from this purposeful walk, and soon more and more join in and are named the “flock,” with Nessie maintaining the lead. Needles won’t penetrate their skin; trying to prevent them from walking will cause a heinous death. Shauna, her father, and other “shepherds” soon accompany the flock to protect them from outside forces, with RVs and other vehicles to transport the shepherds. The “sleepwalkers” don’t need to eat, drink, sleep, or relieve themselves of waste. Nobody knows what is happening, but as the flock multiplies, the CDC begins investigating the cause, while extremist groups weaponize events to create fear and amass calls for destruction of the flock and their shepherds.Multiple main characters advance the story. Dr. Benjamin (Benji) Ray, an African American scientist, worked for the CDC and was disgraced by a noble lie he told some time ago. However, he is drawn back in to find out the cause of the sleepwalkers’ “illness.” Sadie, also black, is the one who contacted Benji, and is a leader in the private sector behind the advent of Black Swan, a machine intelligence that assists them to research the flock and their symptoms, and get to the bottom of what is happening.There’s a pastor, a villain (of course), a quasi-washed-up rock star, the spiky Shauna, and her new love interest, Arav, a young member of the CDC team. Moreover, there’s the media, the White House (not our current president—it’s fiction, and part cautionary tale), various government agencies, and a secondary cast of characters that are fully alive inside the pages.Additionally, a killer disease is proliferating--one with strange symptoms and consequences. That’s all I want to reveal; it is best for the reader to be surprised by new discoveries, characters, and plot points. I’ve read some s debating/complaining that the story is too political and bashes Christians. That is excessively reductive, and doesn’t capture the narrative nuances. The story isn’t targeting Christians or the GOP; it is cracking open what drives extremists of any kind. Benji is both a scientist and a Christian, and one of the good guys. Sure, the story warns of the dangers of climate change, but it does so within the context of story, not with platitudes or preaching. THE WANDERERS is a carefully measured and multilayered novel that, for me, was a page-turner. Wendig took a few liberties, but none that distracted from the thrust of the story or its characterizations. Additionally, there’s a rape scene that many readers complain was gratuitous or over the top--it certainly deserves discussion. The entire book deserves spirited dialogue. It hit close to home in many ways. Our planet is in trouble, and climate change is just one of them. This novel is chilling and timely. I hope to see a sequel, as Wendig is immensely talented. QC Entertainment, the producers behind the movie GET OUT, has closed a deal on THE WANDERERS for a TV series.

It looks like a mystery—and Crossing genres delicately, without pretension or distraction, is a big plus of my enjoyment with Lippman’s latest novel. It looks like a mystery—and it surely has that--but you can’t pin it down to a narrow scope. It’s 1965 and 1966—which the author portrays with confidence and ease. Maddie Schwartz, Baltimore wife and mother of a high-school son, leaves her almost 20-year marriage to a prosperous, successful lawyer to blaze her own trail.Maddie moves away from the elite Jewish neighborhood that primly cocooned her and moves to a blue-collar area that her mother proclaims as unsafe, (code for not Caucasian). Events lead her to employment at a newspaper, where she is determined to become a reporter. Moreover, she finds a new lover that, in these times, is risky, risqué, and liberating to a woman who had always been the “good girl,” and who met everyone’s expectations but her own.There's a choir of voices that come together separately to tell the story, each chapter a different or alternating voice. Maddie is the main character, but the Lady in the Lake is the ghost of the dead woman, Cleo Sherwood, who also has her story to tell. Lippman is skilled and finessed at speaking right into the reader's ear; while I was turning the pages, I heard all the various voices, their points of view. Only Maddie's voice is told in the third person. Each character--men, women, young, old, black, white, child--they came together like this wild, untamed garden of incongruous beauty that was both a whole and the sum of its parts.This story portrays women outside the herd mentality, as individuals, not in supportive roles to men, but Lippman’s nuanced narrative is not a feminist manifesto or authorial soapbox.

She can do a stylistic, tragicomic period piece, like FROG MUSIC, or a boldly dramatic story, such as ROOM. You can’t fit her into a niche. And whatever she writes, her characters are fully formed and could leap magnificently off the pages. AKIN is no different in that way, a witty but poignant contemporary story with an old man and young boy at the center, thrown together by life’s tragic circumstances. Donoghue plays with the different definitions of the eponymous title, but with levity and nuance. Yes, this is a tender, warm, affectionate—and sometimes brutal—narrative about the bonds of kin (and some chemical bonds, too), as well as how history inches ever close to the present, and time rolls forward as it reaches back. “The future was more urgent than the past, …even if the two were entangled.”Noah Selvaggio, an (almost) eighty-year-old retired chemistry professor and childless widow, is about to embark on a weeklong trip to Nice, France, his birthplace. He left when he was four, delivered from his mother to his father in NYC; he’s never been back, and has made this city his home. His memories of early childhood on the French Riviera are foggy. This was the time when Germany had already invaded France. He has nine old photos from that era, saved by his now dead sister. His grandfather, Père Sonne, was a celebrated French photographer, and Margot, Noah’s mother, was the famous photographer’s primary assistant. But these photos were slipshod, unframed, and didn’t bear Sonne’s stamp. How to put them into context? In the meantime, Noah is entrusted with the care of his eleven-year-old great-nephew, Michael, who he’d never met before. Michael’s father (Noah’s nephew) had died of a drug overdose, and his mother, Amber, was serving a few years in prison. Child Services had found Noah, and asked him to care for Michael for a few weeks until another relative came through to take Michael in. If Noah didn’t agree to care for Michael, he would be sent to foster care. Michael would have to accompany Noah to Nice, in lieu of canceling the trip. He was a wily, obstreperous boy, frequently disrespectful but observant, who had lived his life with few advantages. The two of them were like a fraught chemical reaction, or oil and water, but Noah understood that Michael had suffered trauma, and agreed to his short-term care. After all, what’s a few weeks with a snarly, surly, screen-addicted, impulsive kid? He could at least try to teach him some manners. “Weren’t all of us bridges for another, one way or another?”A lesser author would have made me groan. I figured out much of the general arc fairly quickly, but it was the relationship between Noah and Michael that lifted this novel to a resonant pitch. What does an old, highly educated, and mournful man and a damaged, underprivileged young boy have in common? The more Noah tries to bond, the deeper Michael’s disinterest. With a handful of antique photos and their wobbly, separate grief—“the final death of hope?”—can the blood between them find a pathway to mutual regard? “He and this boy were quite alien to each other… Yet, in an odd way, akin.” Donoghue took what could have been a derivative, ham-handed story and turned it into a charismatic, organic, and robust tale of memories, time, and the chemistry of alien relations. It is a genuine winner, surpassing my initial cynicism (and Michael’s)! I walked those steps in Nice with them, watched the Carnival and the circus, and explored he meaning of those photos. Moreover, I pondered Michael’s plight, his parents’ past, and what’s to come in the future. 4.5 rounded upThank you to LittleBrown for this ARC in exchange for an honest .#EmmaDonoghue#Akin...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 17, 2019","Jul 21, 2019","Jul 19, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43209291-akin

I admit that, due to bad timing, I never finished OLIVE KITTRIDGE (although I loved the HBO series). There’s something about the quotidian that Elizabeth Strout gets just right. OLIVE, AGAIN swept me up in its small town Maine-ness. Every word, character, event, and action was organic and seamless, seemingly effortless. It’s more story than plot, but each chapter of this novel-in-stories is a link to the people of Crosby, Maine (or Shirley Falls) and once I started, there was no putting the breaks on. There isn’t one boring minute of this quietly powerful novel. I was at turns delighted, uneasy, distressed, and always infatuated. Strout doesn’t aim to dazzle and shock you; instead, there’s a constant pulse to the narrative that quickens and speeds up or slows down to match the rhythm of life here (or death). This is a place where people say Mrs., not Ms.; Crosby is earnestly provincial. Olive is the especial character that quietly stampedes my heart. As said in the first book, “she had a darkness that seemed to stand beside her like an acquaintance that would not go away.” Olive is harsh, intractable, precise, sincere.To me, Olive is as familiar and surprising as a neighborhood pond or swim hole--a blend of refreshing and murky, with slippery or jagged places underfoot and brimming with warm and cold spots, and depth from an unexpected drop-off. The townspeople are appalled by her, or find her bracing and genuine. Her innate gallows humor and blunt remarks can capsize a moment or persist in your thoughts. Olive makes you laugh at drama. She was sharp or stubbornly obtuse. Olive fails at social cues (she is probably on the spectrum). I wish I had Olive in my life! She is late to her own wisdom, which would make her a hypocrite if she wasn’t so sure of her herself, even when she isn’t.“’You know, I just want to say, Mrs. Kittridge told us, years ago in that math class—I will never forget it—one day she just stopped a math problem she was doing on the board and she turned around and she said to the class, “You all know who you are.

FSB was what I would call literary mainstream. But WE, THE SURVIVORS is more intimate, literary, and not so mainstream. It’s for readers who can submerge into an enclosed, at times crushing portrait of a Malaysian man’s life, ruled by poverty as a child, who tried to rise above and maintain a decent level of equitable improvement. Ah Hock wanted a middle-class life and ended up in prison for killing a man. And this is his story to an educated, worldly reporter after his stint in prison, the story of his life.This isn’t a mystery or thriller; the story of homicide is less poignant than the story of Ah Hock’s survival, ambition, and his struggling rise from poverty in a village 50 miles from Kuala Lumpur. He grew up in the 1980s, in a village that was isolated before industrialization led to bridges, roads, and passages closer to the city. Ah Hock’s obscure beginnings relied on fishing and later the fish factories. His father left for Singapore when he was young and never returned, leaving his mother to fend for them. Her own evolution was rough, but she did teach Ah Hock the will to survive above all. After he met a friend of sorts, Keong, a much older boy that was a hustler and wannabe gangster, Ah Hock began to develop his own kind of values and attitude related to the word at large. His ambition in youth was to be a tycoon, but as he matured, he longed to work in a comfortable job with a nice salary, and find a good wife. Although he tried to shake off his association with Keong, the hustler would reappear in his life, a magnet for trouble. Keong still wanted his big dreams of becoming a tycoon.This is not a fast paced or action-packed book. It is a measured, unhurried, and nonlinear portrayal of a young man’s life, and the choices he made. The author explores themes of heritage, hope, and fate, as well as attitudes toward immigrants and the implications of the class system. But it never patronizes or preaches. Tash Aw is a keen writer who gives a finely wrought depiction of one man’s life of hope and dreams. “The more we longed for something, the more impossible it became. You only dream about things you can never obtain.”There are also subtle things about the rhythms of village life, the effects of modernization on outlook, and the desire for obscurity by Ah Hock’s ancestors who lived through war and preferred invisibility to transparency, and how fate shapes our character. Besides Ah Hock, we are intimately drawn in to the lives of the people he’d known—family, friends, wife, workers, acquaintances. Many of the passages were penetrating, painful, flanged with regret—but often with the bittersweet tides of hope.“What she’d hated back then, she now loved: the sense of continuity, of surrendering…the pulling in of her horizons, the comfort to be found in the death of ambition.”Thank you to the publishers of Farrar, Straus and Giroux for sending me a copy....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jul 09, 2019","Jul 13, 2019","Jul 09, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52192404-we-the-survivors

A very different story, of course, and quite noir-ish. In this, he tackles several themes—my favorite being how memories identify us, color us in, or leave us more blank than we want to be. Memories and missing. But Norman also grapples with grief, fertility, marriage, loss, and the whole poetry of life (and there is poetry!).During the opening pages, we learn that Simon, an underrated writer who died a few years ago, still inhabits the farmhouse in East Calais, Vermont (where Howard Norman lives), where he lived with his wife, Lorca, an artist who creates Emily Dickinson-inspired paintings. Still mourning Simon’s loss and some unresolved feelings, she sells to a couple, Muriel and Zachary. But Simon, the “stenographer” of death, still inhabits the house, mainly the library, and often inadvertently sets off the security alarm, signaling ""Motion in Library.""The title refers to an alleged clause in Vermont concerning the sale of homes. If the house is haunted, you must disclose that to potential buyers. There’s a missing child, and one of the buyers is Zachary, a detective newly hired at the very small but prestigious Green Mountain Detective Agency. He becomes obsessed with the case and finding Corrine, the little girl, a moth-loving eleven-year-old with autism. His wife, Muriel, translates Japanese poetry, particularly of a (fictional) poet that uses parenthesis to declare his most intimate and romantic sentiments. Muriel embraces and mimics these parenthetical poems to flirt with Zachary, but also because it is the subject of her book. But, they, too, have some unresolved issues. The missing and missing pieces flourish in meaning.In fact, most of the novel has a kind of flirty voice to it--even when Simon is trying to be mordant, there is a light but poignant touch to his portrait as the pining dead. Memories and the missing. In totality, the primary thrust of the novel is Simon’s ghostly narration of memories and how his marriage to Lorca reflects and refracts Muriel and Zach’s marriage, and those unresolved pieces so relatable to readers and writers alike. I’m just sharing a brief overview of the theme that touched me the most. Simon says:“…I was envious of people with repressed memories. Well, now, as memories arrive one after the next, I feel I am becoming almost entirely composed of them…I’, standing in a field out back and my own private drive-in movie screen is there and I have no choice as to which moments in the past are projected onto it.” And, oh, what fuss this can cause to someone stuck between two worlds!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,"Jul 05, 2019not set","Jul 09, 2019not set","Jul 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40796181-the-ghost-clause

She doesn’t land it as a deafening whack, more like a sober blow. You know that you are walking on a minefield when you are reading her novels; it’s with subtle baby steps that lead to the inevitable. You don’t wholly see it coming because it could have gone another way, the one you were expecting. Then hisssss, the snakes! With their Mona Lisa smiles.This book follows one family, particularly, a .1% billionaire and his family. They are all a hot mess. The father may seem like a stereotype to innocent ones, but you’ve met--well, I’ve met--men like Griff, consummately unsympathetic. You can’t design your parents. You can only leave them when you grow up. “’When you’re gone…and you look back, this will feel like a dream.’”Griff’s wife, Liv, is criminal in other ways, and his son, Alex is an addict trying to follow the NA path. Our focus is with Griff’s daughter, Bea, and her husband, Dan. Bea, according to Griff, was no prize in the “looks” department, and a little bit “frumpy.” She’s also exceptionally kind, and a psychotherapist in London. Dan has the education and heart of an artist, but he’s stuck being an estate agent. His mother is black and fiercely protective. His father is white and absent his whole childhood. He’s what the young call Hot AF. He fell in love with Bea’s kindness and quiet dignity. Bea wants zero to do with Griff’s money. She sees her parents once every few years.Needless to say, they are all stuck in outback France in a hotel-to-be that Alex is restoring—it is terminally under construction and not fit for guests yet. He’s got an ADD and eccentric personality and is always running in different directions simultaneously. There’s a dark cloud over this family, this house, and getting there is painful, for the reader, also. “You’d swear you could see it, in the cracks in the pavements and the bricks in the walls; violence and grief.”...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,Jul 2019,"Jul 03, 2019","Jul 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40554139-the-snakes

It’s all here in one delicious detective novel. If this had been written by a typically genre author in dramatic fashion, it would have come off rather melodramatic and derivative. But British novelist Kate Atkinson, who has written some of my favorite stand-alone novels, dips deliciously into her Jackson Brodie fare with relish, making it piquant, droll, and equal parts character and plot.Jackson Brodie, living in Yorkshire, by the sea, is the laconic main character, trying to raise his son as a co-parent separately with Nathan’s mother, Julia. Nathan is a typical thirteen-year-old glommed onto his iPhone and bored with anything his father finds interesting. In the meantime, we are introduced to Crystal, a new character—mother, stepmother, and wife, who you root for, secrets and all. A few other characters, some burlesque, and some grotesque, keep you fastened to the pages.Former child character from Brodie’s past, Reggie, is all grown up and a police officer now. Brodie will eventually cross paths with everyone in an intriguing way, with his old pal and dog, Dido. Dido is so old that walks on the seaside are difficult. Tide in, tide out—it’s a metaphor for a lot, turns out.If you like the Jackson Brodie novels—this is a treat. If you love Atkinson, you’ll recognize her trademark humor. She creates a nice circle in the end. And, just an aside, but I think Jackson Brodie would be way more fun as a love interest than Darcy.

From the first sentence, at “The Agency” in D.C. in the 1950s, with the clack of the typewriter keys, the typing pool women engage us. The Agency goals are to spin subversive words into gold to spread democratic ideals. That is where the role of Dr. Zhivago comes in, a book banned in the Eastern Bloc for its critiques of the State. Intellectuals, scholars, artists and writers and were used as propaganda tools to disseminate the ideology of the West to places behind the Iron Curtain in the East. Prescott demonstrates the role of women to advance this objective, giving us an absorbing, scintillating, and exceptionally well-paced page-turner that will have you canceling dates and burning dinner to keep reading.During the ten or so years that Pasternak was writing his masterpiece, word had come to the attention of the cultural heads of State that the content may contradict their dogma. Boris’ lover, Olga, was Pasternak’s muse for the character of Lara, Dr. Zhivago’s love interest. She had already gone to the gulag once, so that the State could tap her for information on Pasternak’s “heretical” novel-in-progress.The narrative alternates between East and West--Olga and Boris in the East, and the typing pool women in the West. Among the women in D.C., the focus is on Irina and Sally, two very different women who become more than just typists. You can use Swallow or Carrier to describe them—women who are talented at getting info from loose-lipped men that possess important information (Swallow), or who are trained and clever at dropping envelopes of top secret information to their appointed recipients. Whether you are familiar (or uninformed) with Dr. Zhivago, the Cold War, or the 1950s, it won’t matter. Prescott shines in installing the reader instantly and sustaining our interest. The words flow with the urgent but descriptive narrative, and the momentum is both fierce and sinuous. The women often work as “doubles” to obtain information. “A double is a bit of a misnomer; one person doesn’t become two. Rather, one loses a part of herself in order to exist in two worlds, never fully existing in either.”Well, I can tell you, the only world I existed in for the time I was reading this novel was Prescott’s narrative creation. There isn’t one false word or boring passage. I was gripped from the opening page to the hypnotic end.

But I ask myself—would I have liked it as much if it wasn’t an historical, fictional portrait about the daughter of the celebrated and enigmatic Peggy Guggenheim? Did that add just the right mystique, knowing that this wasn’t just ANY fourteen-year-old? It’s hard for me to say, as that fact pervaded the narrative. However, I was transported by the voice of the narrator, Lara, the daughter of the art philanthropist, Leonora. The relationship is fraught, as the mother is a self-centered and self-serving woman incapable of love.Written like a diary by Lara, she also includes letters to her brother and the botanical lexicon of numerous plants and flowers of the exotic locale, Costalegre, on the Pacific and western side of Jalisco, in Mexico. It is 1937, and Hitler’s power is gaining momentum. There have been several movies and books (fiction and non-fiction) about the “heroes” who hid some of the great art from the Nazis, so that Hitler wouldn’t destroy it (if it didn’t conform to his politics). Here is another—but the thrust of the novel is not about the adventure of hiding the art; it is about an intelligent, artistic, and neglected adolescent girl seeking love and connection.Leonora has taken Lara, her current husband, and several surrealist artists with her to Costalegre, where she feels secure from Hitler’s advances. She awaits a boat that is supposed to be coming, stored with the art that Leonora wants to sequester away for safe keeping. She doesn’t care that she has taken her daughter out of school and far away from her brother. Her concern is her art/artists, good food, sex, attention, and having control over everyone in her life.There’s a lot of white space in this book, which allowed room for me to silently convey my thoughts and feelings in response to Lara’s words. Her sensitivity and maturity is eloquently manifested, despite her mother’s indifference. She seeks kinship during her sojourns on the island, and I was captivated by her awkward but tender appeal to attain a deep connection and understanding.“That he will tell me something and it will be true. That he will continue to live in his small house…and listening to people…I don’t think I have ever been contemplated.” Like all of us, Lara yearns to be contemplated, observed, considered. She craves affection and reciprocity. Her growth pains and emotional hunger pains are lightly stated but deeply felt....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 24, 2019","Jun 24, 2019","Jun 25, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41827075-costalegre

He’s expansive, hyper-verbal, exuberant, urbane, and frequently absurdist. But he's generous, if flamboyant. A solid Salman novel, like this one, is also tender and sublime; he locates the reader sweet spot and delivers a potent, exquisite and heartfelt denouement. QUICHOTTE is speculative fiction designed as a picaresque and earnest tromp for true love. All the masks are off at the end and you are face to face with what we do to be our authentic selves, warts and all, and what it is to love through our fears. Quichotte is like Quixote, but contemporary, and meta- meta- and apocalyptic. Although it took around 80 pages to fully engage—there’s a lot of learned and obscure references that were initially off-putting, but gradually forms a coherent and wonderful beast of an epic journey. An older and single, childless man, originally from Bombay, is in love from afar with Ms. Salma R, a huge celebrity and media darling, a beautiful woman of Indian heritage living in NYC. Ismail Smile is a pharmaceutical salesman. He has reinvented himself as Quichotte. There’s also the story within the story of Sam DuChamp, the writer of spy fiction who invented Quichotte (also known as Brother), and Quichotte has an estranged Sister, an accomplished attorney also living in NYC, also known as HT, or Human Trampoline (don't’ ask, just read the book!). Quichotte understands that he must resolve the unfinished business with Sister in order to deserve Ms. Salma R.’s love. They had an emotional fallout many decades ago, and they haven’t spoken since. Quichotte also creates a phantom (teenage) son by chasing down many meteor showers and snapping seven wishbones at precisely the right time. Now he has his real, imaginary Sancho to accompany him on his quest. “…I estimate that you’re telling the reader that the surreal, and even the absurd, now potentially offer the most accurate descriptors of real life.”Quichotte’s and Sancho’s adventurous quest has many branches, loops, sidetracks, and trespasses along the way. (DuChamp has an estranged relationship with his son, and is trying to work out his own personal demons through his story, not to mention a little conflict with secret forces in the government). If all this sounds like too much of too much, don’t worry—Rushdie is the soulful, talented brainiac that will put it all together. Salman’s characters grow and grow, and grow on you, and through all the droll, absurdist, metaphysical, technological and media-savvy embellishments, he will eventually shatter your heart and bring you to your knees. In the meantime, every page has little and large profundities that add to the mystique of the novel.“…Love itself, the purity of the grand essential phenomenon…the heart of the heart of the heart, the eye of the storm, the driving force of all human and much animal nature, and therefore of life itself…Love as Being…For love is without reason…it comes without a rational explanation and lives on when there is no reason for it to survive.”Rushdie covers so many concepts and subjects that at times I thought my head would explode (in a good way). Family, love, life, death, technology, ethnicity, religion, the opioid crisis—even mastodons. Yes, mastodons! The tale is a colossal, victorious glob of transcendent goo. He is the ultimate writer of our times—thoughtful, provocative, magical, and self-actual.

I was transfixed by the story of a high school girl accused of brutally murdering her classmates. In her latest crime story, a psychology professor, Stig Ahlin--aka “Professor Death”--in prison thirteen years for a murder conviction, is given hope. Respected attorney Sophia Weber is persuaded to  the celebrity case and appeal to the Supreme Court for a new trial. Prepare for a page turning and exciting story. It’s got mainstream appeal but doesn’t pander or lead the reader. Call it literary sorbet, a perfect book between denser ones, but still smart, nervy, and potent.Retrials are rarely permitted in Sweden, so Sophia has her work cut out for her. Moreover, there’s a lingering stink from a dropped charge against Ahlin for molesting his daughter when she was a toddler. It’s obvious that the tabloid-hungry media took control of this man’s guilt or innocence about both crimes, even before the first trial was underway. Sophia’s burden is to pierce and parse the truth-lies frontier and independently examine the facts. The author also peppers the story with other events and characters swirling in Sophia’s life, her anxieties that are separate from the case or linked at arm’s length.If you like legal thrillers wrapped up like a holiday gift, you may want to skip this one or adjust your expectations. It won’t follow circumscribed outcomes or behave like genre fiction. It also keenly stretches the big reveal until the bitter end. The narrative mirrors real world chaos and disturbance. It’s often light on its feet; the gravitas is organic, not labored. The passages lift off and the nimble tempo keeps it snappy but with a noir overlay. There’s enough levity to unlace tension periodically, and the plot glides forward, even when it goes back in time.

There are still some corners of America that remain in the Dark Ages, despite the new laws allowing gay people to marry. But in Uruguay, during the fascist dictatorship of the 70s, coming out of the closet meant getting arrested, tortured, sexually violated, and often “disappeared.” And women couldn’t gather more than four together—five in a group could also mean disappearing. Gay people had to live their life as a lie or risk merciless punishment. This latest novel by proudly gay author (with Uruguayan origins) Carolina de Robertis is about a group of gay women friends in Montevideo who find a way to prevail and lead authentic lives.It starts during a 7-day beach vacation at a remote oceanside location, unknown by tourists and the military. A group of five gay women converge--a criminal number. Paz is the youngest at 16, but accepted as one of the “cantoras,” with their special definition: not just a woman who sings, but also a lesbian embraced by each other. Long and leggy and beautiful Anita is unhappily married and in love with Flaca, who used to be with Romina, who was once arrested for three very long days. Malena is the quiet one. They are all singular yet relatable; they have vastly different relationships with their individual families, not without its flaws.It sounds like a soap opera, and de Robertis always has a torrent of romance, but with a subtle restraint and knowingness. She’s a rare author that can get away with exclamatory and declarative sentences and hot love filling the pages. She’s audacious but cadenced, replete with memorable characters. Each woman has a backstory and current pressures, and no two are alike. De Robertis shapes her individuals, distinct and three-dimensional. Flaca Paz, Malena, Romina, and Anita (her sobriquet now La Venus) meet here at the beach whenever their schedules will permit, and that’s all you need to know; the rest you discover in the pages and you root for these five brave but vulnerable women, not without flaws. Danger shadows them. Reading CANTORAS is to absorb an adventure tale of women who insist on being sincere, open, and candid, in a safe place to thrive, and to support others who also have to hide. It’s both an epic saga and an intimate story of survival and friendship.

I’m not talking about your personal life angst, although that’s material in Choi’s new story, especially the teenage years. But I mean expectation. If the author takes off in a direction not foreshadowed, will you discount her methods? Do you not trust her when that happens, or can you flirt with the idea that your mistrust is misplaced? What kind of contract is forged between reader and writer—that’s a big part of Choi’s narrative. If you demand a more conventional format and construct, skip this story, you won’t like it.What is the relationship between truth and fiction, and who gets to tell the story? A writer takes full authority when constructing a narrative with several characters. Is it egregious to appropriate someone else’s life for your story? If your subjective eye places most people outside your horizon, are you betraying narrative truth when you eliminate others or give them bit parts? The story takes place in the early 80s at a performing arts high school in Houston (the city not stated but Choi later acknowledges it). My high school drama teacher in Houston ran her drama classes like she was Uta Hagen, reminding me a bit of the pied piper-ish Mr. Kingsley, the teacher every student wants to impress. The students clamored to be recognized and selected for on-stage performances.“[Y]oung people… experience pain more intensely than those of us just a bit older. I speak of emotional pain. Your pain is greater, in duration and strength. It is harder to bear.” That was a time “when we were taught that a moment of intimacy had no value unless it was part of a show.”Choi’s characters perform a lot of challenging trust exercises in their drama class. Mr. Kingsley is charismatic and openly gay, progressive, previously cultured in NYC. The students here want to be validated by the talented Mr. Kingsley. He’s “impossibly witty, and sometimes impossibly cutting.” His practice lessons in “Ego Deconstruction” and “Reconstruction” could make them feel relevant or ignored. David and Sarah, the school's glittering teen romantic couple that everyone is jealous or envious of, feature most prominently in Kingsley’s daily Trust Exercises. Shells detonating.The middle section takes place twelve years later. The author’s shift in perspective in part II might send you looking back to the more straightforward part I--but, no, you didn’t miss anything. The contradictions are merely slashes in the narrative that cause you to realize a few things about your subjective vs. objective self, and the wide chasms between individuals and their perspectives, and who gets to tell their story. If you seek a layered or fresh perspective on voice and point of view--well, here it is!All three sections of the book are titled Trust Exercises. The last twenty or so pages causes a minor but inevitable whiplash. It’s only part II that you didn’t see coming, and possibly aspects of part III. In the first hundred pages, the high beam is on the school’s dazzling couple, Sarah and David. There’s lots of sweat and sex and tears between Sarah and David, mixed in with that close, sticky Houston humidity.Under the aegis of Mr. Kingsley, David and Sarah’s relationship becomes fodder for the drama class, as their “theatre”(never “theater”) teacher contrives daily trust exercises for them, creating a spotlight for the couple to live under.This may be the most circumspect  I’ve ever written, but I don’t want to spoil any discoveries for the reader. Everyone deserves to be excited or inflamed, inspired or disappointed. Whatever you come away with, I suspect that this novel will, even days later, line your thoughts. There are several themes in TRUST EXERCISES you could spend a semester discussing in a class. There’s the issue of consent: I think, is that art? or hijacking other people’s lives to suit our own narrative. Are we nearing the fictional truth when we write or even when we read. Choi’s divergence, or misdirection, stirred me. A writer can reshape and blast the singular narrative, and tell two, maybe three or more stories simultaneously. That’s what Choi did, poised in this balancing act, the meta- and the fiction. Her voice of clinical detachment didn’t diminish for one minute the powerful force of her words. In fact, it gave them more voltage. Choi is electrifying, and TRUST EXERCISES uses a brilliant setting to realize this fascinating story.Thank you to Grazia Rutherford-Swan at Henry Holt for sending me a copy in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jun 06, 2019","Jun 08, 2019","Jun 14, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40046059-trust-exercise

When I read BEATLEBONE, I became like Alice eating that cookie, and every moment was enhanced and spectacular. Barry is the true definition of sui generis; he’s like Beckett meets David Lynch, but neatly himself. NIGHT BOAT TO TANGIER has a Godot-like framework; two guys waiting…and waiting…and much of what happens is in the language, the slang turned poetic but brutally raw on the page, and it sets a mood of menace that invites you to bear witness. Guiding us is the author’s wordsmith acrobatics. It expands into cerebral and visceral places to amplify the story. The page is the stage and the actors are playing out his imaginative spree. Two longtime frenemies and drug smugglers, Maurice Hearne and Charlie Redmond, are waiting in the Algeciras ferry terminal on the southern coast of Spain for Maurice’s daughter, Dilly, to either appear after stepping off a boat from Tangier, or to embark on a night boat going there. It could be an interminable wait, and the tense and chaotic feelings between the old friends usher the trek through time, and their separate relationships with Dilly. They recount memories, loiter through cacophony and haunt the silence.In the course of the night they will reminisce on a bench, sing to a dog, take a man hostage, move to the café bar, gaze upward and inward and ponder the big D, Death. “There’s grief and the longer we go on, the more of it we’ve the burden of.”A sharp intake of sentiment and intense nostalgia veers toward tragic and maudlin memories. Dry as a bone left in a stern wind, but with an absurdist crunch, the reader is taken on a journey that almost defies a destination. I didn’t care where it ended up; only that it remained tantalizing. You won’t be disappointed if you enjoy a good story spun from the rogue and orgiastic voice of Barry’s mind, how he executes temporal shifts. “The past shifted and rearranged itself. He could not step out from its reach.”Open any page of this book. Lots of white space, like a play or a script. You also notice, amid the drugs, dirty money, violence, husky love and regret, “The air had a medieval tang.” Just ride along with the madness and magic, the surreal visuals that permeate the tale. “That’s when our old friend avarice comes a knock-knock-knockin’ along.”It’s a mood piece that unfurls with the “lizard night.” I could read it just for the author’s metaphors and lexicon and his magnet to all our senses. And look for all the Beatle ripples within, like “a ticket to ride,” just one example. Why? I think Barry is showing us his playful and sentimental side when he flanks the grim passages with Beatles bait.

PRAIRIE FEVER is one of the most fierce, fearless, open-hearted, and radiant novels written this centuWhy had I never heard of Michael Parker before? PRAIRIE FEVER is one of the most fierce, fearless, open-hearted, and radiant novels written this century, about the earlier part of the last one. It takes place primarily in the rural prairie stretch of Lone Wolf, Oklahoma, the 1920s, where the “coyote wind” is icy and menacing, and the hardscrabble land is punishing, unforgiving. The wordsmith author writes about love, land, language, loyalty, and two sisters bound together, even when apart. It was a slow start—but don’t give up, because soon enough it will rip through you like the prairie wind.Elise Stewart, 15, and her 17-year-old sister, Lorena, are devoted to each other, despite their different natures. Elise is fanciful, flighty, a free spirit with “notions” that she follows. Lorena has restraint, is down-to-earth, logical, practical. Both are stubborn as mules. Every winter morning, their mother pins them under a blanket on their horse, Sandy, who knows the way to the school. They recite memorized tidbits from the Kiowa County News to each other to pass the time (many of the newspaper quotes were actually lifted from West Texas and Oklahoma between 1900-1920). There’s an early tragedy in the book-- original, visceral and visually stunning. It’s catastrophic, and yet fueled with dry wit, even comedy, and it brought me to my knees. Like the other adversities rendered in this novel, Parker portrays it with a keen hand and generous heart. An example of his gorgeous writing: “Sandy. Everywhere you go, you leave that place all the wiser…With each wave it sends millions of shells to entice you…The shells tinkle like frozen words falling from the unpinned blankets of yore. You bore us gallantly and selflessly through winds icy and coyote. You kept intact, always and overhead, the blanket of sky. Not everyone---certainly not I—can say they always know the way.” What a skilled chef does with essential food ingredients, Parker does with words-—serves us up a noble treat that you want to gobble up and savor simultaneously.At the heart of the story is a crushing conflict between the sisters that drives a wedge that I felt in my marrow. “…our lives changed the moment she held fast to her facts.” The author’s locus is that everyone must find his or her own “true cry”—“She put her head down on the top of the piano and attempted to find, in a trill of high flats and sharps, the music of her true cry.” This motif threads through the story and most major characters. For example, Elise and Lorena’s mother is permanently addled since the death of her little boys from “prairie fever” (typhoid). But despite the sorrow we carry, our true cry is what saves us from the facts of our lives, and carries our hearts home.This will surely make my top five this year. I plan to read all Parker’s books.

I read it in one sitting, but the takeaway still haunts me. Ciment’s wry observations of a three-week media-frenzied murder trial and sequestered jury recalls the circus appeal of the O.J. Simpson and Casey Anthony trials, but that’s only one branch of this finely measured narrative. At stake is the case of a teenage defendant accused of arson and murder of her baby brother. The author seamlessly merges a sensational plot with a literary narrative, exploring themes of mortality, morality, loyalty, compassion, and the concept of justice, as it plays out inside and outside the courtroom. The story’s main character is 52-year-old female juror C-2, a successful photographer. C-2 bonds with juror F-17, an anatomy professor who dissects cadavers, as C-2 has always wanted to photograph a dissection of a human body. At home before sequestration, she studies the painting of Rembrandt’s, “The Anatomy of Dr. Tulp,” and his genius idea to compose the med students and cadaver as a single shape: “individualism melded into the collective,” a harbinger of her imminent duty as a juror.The drab Econo-Lodge, where the jurors are sequestered, faces the highway, offering traffic noise, blackout curtains, and a dreary motel pool. C-2’s husband labels their brief Saturday visits in her room their “conjugal visits.” In truth, the jurors are like captives, in a different kind of prison than the defendant. They’ve lost their right to smartphones, newspapers, TV, and basic independence. They can’t leave the area without a guard; the food at assigned restaurants is bland and starchy; and the locks have been removed from their doors. All eyes are on them; even their fellow jurors eavesdrop on each other. The court-financed meals, motel, and diversions provide droll insights within a layered and serious drama.Parallel stories of the courtroom/jury and C-2’s personal life pivot through the trial, the jury deliberations, and the post-trial events, when C-2 returns to her private life with her devoted, elderly husband. Also waiting for her is the pitiless court of public opinion that heard and saw inflammatory evidence on TV that was excluded from the jury’s eyes and ears. Actions have far-reaching consequences in this riveting and suspenseful tale. And the behavior of one can have collective ramifications.If, like me, you prefer no spoilers, don’t read the synopsis on the back of the book (I’m glad I waited until I was finished). The spare prose fits the confined milieu, and Ciment deftly executes a pressing blend of bodies in question. Steel yourself for a potent journey and inexorable outcome.

It’s a book about the chances you take, the choices you make, and the secrets that eat at your heart and the atonement you thirst for in your soul. As you turn the pages, the pressure mounts toward the final disclosures between Lincoln, Mickey, and Teddy—the three Musketeers—one for all and all for one. Russo keeps his characters around long after you close the book. In the sixties, three scholarship students meet at a liberal arts college on Martha’s Vineyard. They become lifelong friends with long stretches in-between. After almost a decade of distance, they decide to spend Labor Day weekend 2015 at Lincoln’s summerhouse on the Vineyard, provoking misty memories and murky wounds. It’s 44 years after graduation, and they are 66 years-old. They recall their friendship with each other and with their fourth Musketeer, Jacy, the well-heeled sorority woman they were all a little (or a lot) in love with, even Lincoln, despite embarking on a new relationship with his future wife. They remember the night in December of ’69 when they watched the draft lottery on TV, waiting to see what their numbers were (I remember that myself, in the fevered tension of my living room, with two brothers to worry about). The stricken mood as one of them got #9, Vietnam deferred till finishing college. And then came Memorial Day weekend after graduation, their last together with Jacy, who disappeared mysteriously and forever—from them, her family, and her fiancé, never to be heard from again. It still casts a shadow over their lives, and is hovering over this 2015 weekend. Jacy is the avid ghost, a permanent presence and absence that wreaks havoc on their reunion weekend.Despite the superb characterizations, Russo flailed with his plot. The last third of the novel was overcrowded with excessive storylines and info dumps, meandering and rambling and tacking on material that didn’t connect well to the earlier narrative flow. This was a quick read; I finished in less than two days, but the superfluous drama was unnecessary and disappointing, and unfurled like declarative broadcasts.

How can this topic be grappled with without platitudes and clichés so that the story is bracing, believable (and imaginative) as it shakes us up and drops us in? Jo Baker convinced me that I was living in the house with our unnamed narrator, a London writer who was assaulted while pregnant by a large man in a blue anorak, and three years later is still traumatized and wants to leave the city. That’s the point of entry, and the story proves subsequently more layered, subtle, and prismatic. She even pulls off the absence of humor, which is a feat few authors can do with alacrity. Unfortunately, this stellar and nuanced narrative devolved into a pedestrian and clunky denouement, but the antecedent journey made it worth the ride.Our writer accepts a lectureship in the Lake District, teaching Creative Writing to MA students working on their novels. Mark, her husband, is too preoccupied with his own teaching career to consider moving with her and their son, Sammy, so he arranges to drive up and visit them on weekends and school breaks. Our female protagonist is unnamed throughout the novel, potentially symbolizing the inequities of sexual politics at home and in the workplace, and the demoralizing, devaluing effects of violence against women, especially when trying to move forward without adequate support. Is the female protagonist unnamed because her circumstances debased her, or as an invitation for readers to identify with her? You decide, or it could be both. As soon as she starts her new job, her boss dumps excess work on her and gives himself permission to touch her with his slimy fingers whenever he pleases. He pretends to be innocent and avuncular. She is too new and too meek to voice her concerns. But the real fallout begins in the classroom.Baker’s narrative is written in third person, with multiple points of view emerging through the students’ work. “Unnamed” has a handful of students, all writing in various genres. Baker’s ability to examine personal agency through these diverse student stories is sharp and deep. And this is when the snarl of darkness begins to descend. One enigmatic and troubled student, Nicholas, attempts to usurp the protagonist’s authority in the classroom with his harsh criticism of other students’ work as “not telling the truth” through their fiction, and his air of righteousness toward the teacher. He even blames her for not providing a “trigger warning” for stories that may be violent or upsetting to others. The trigger warning issue provides the one nugget of approaching humor in the novel, as the unnamed protagonist tries to accommodate Nicholas’ request and stumbles down a rabbit hole of red tape. As the weeks and months pass, the accumulation of daily degradations pile up, and the imbalance of power at work and in the protagonist’s life reflects the theme of personal agency, specifically for women. Nicholas’ story is increasingly disturbing to our protagonist. He seems to be writing about her--or, rather, his idea of her-- and her only meaning is what she means to him. The teacher comprehends that Nicholas’ idea of the truth is one where she would be powerless-- “the prospect of being caught up in someone else’s story, of being written by someone else; the fear of having no say in who I was at all.”Baker nailed the theme with her artistry and intelligence, threading her thesis through multiple voices and stories within stories. But she thwarted her measured delicacy with a clumsy and derivative denouement. Early on, our protagonist tells her students ‘”you could decide not to think in arcs and lines…think it as a pool in which narrative pebbles are dropped and we watch the ripples roll outwards. Or a spiral, where a key event is returned to, and seen slightly different each time.”’ Her character taught creative writing, and then hoisted it on her own petard. Baker’s theme was vividly realized, but the finale foiled her plot and partially dimmed her vision....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 19, 2019","May 21, 2019","May 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41827019-the-body-lies

A domestic and historical drama, it’s also a concept novel about artists and their mediums (music, painting, photography) and art’s intersection with life, including heritage, memory, time, and the spatial world. The title also points to the novel’s blended German and American families, and links latent and unresolved secrets and lies that divide them. The family’s odious skeletons symbolically mirror Germany’s shame from the events of WW II. However, the “secret” or misapprehensions that broke a marriage apart never gripped me the way the author intended.The story alternates between the 1970s and 2008, from Düsseldorf, Germany to Eugene, Oregon, with a finale in Berlin. Louise is the mother of 35 year-old Elke, her daughter with her first husband, Dieter, a musician, who she met while in art school in 1970s Düsseldorf. They were so young when they met and had a baby, and the marriage essentially ended when Louise returned to the states to care for her ailing mother, and never returned to Germany. Both Louise and Dieter were carrying a heavy emotional burden that they couldn’t reconcile.Back in Eugene, Louise met Richard, a photographer and urban planner, who she has now been married to for thirty years. Their avant-garde musician daughter, Margot, is now the age that Louise was when she lived in Germany. As the novel begins, Elke asks Louise to accompany her to Düsseldorf to attend her grandmother’s funeral. This sets up an awkward reunion with Louise and Dieter, who she hasn’t seen since Elke’s high school graduation in Eugene.Meanwhile, Louise expects Richard to stay home and snap the recurring timed photo of a visual project she has been working on for decades on their property. He's concerned that their marriage is threatened by the unfolding of a distant history that he didn’t share, and a fraught memory that they did. Meanwhile, Margot is on a European music tour with her techno music band, another event for Louise and Elke to visit together.The author develops her characters well, but there are too many events and issues that she attempts to integrate. Instead of a seamless story of life and the difficulties reconciling the past and present (and Germany’s past and present), I felt that the narrative meandered. Her exploration of conceptual music and art was fascinating, and I saw how the elements applied to the themes, but she spread herself too thin.In her story, Diehl embraces the concept of “desire lines” or desire paths. These are the visible lines or paths that have resulted from people who make shortcuts or freewheeling tracks through the designed or natural landscape. Our lines give feedback to the land and to the community, and also reveal where people refuse to tread. These ideas fit squarely with Diehl’s themes in LIFELINES. The civil disobedience of desire lines mirrors the intractable messiness of living, despite our desire to control our own narratives, or lifelines.“Spatial nudges: a notch in the hedge, a line in the grass…Years and years together. They’d given each other that.” These concepts are intrepid, but got buried for me as a reader, because I was also balancing all the elements of avant-garde music and ongoing, multiple threads. Heidi Diehl is a lovely and thoughtful writer (and is nothing like the witty, sardonic Meg Wolitzer, which she is wrongfully compared to). She may have made some missteps here, but I will keep an eye out for her next novel.

It’s both dystopian Regardless of the country and time you’re from, you are sure to experience time-space cultural whiplash in McEwan’s latest novel. It’s both dystopian and alt-history. I know that dystopian is supposed to take place in the future, but, instead, McEwan’s convoluted setting this time is in the 1980s London. A very advanced 80s where Alan Turing survived, Tony Benn died (in the Brighton bombing!), JFK survived Dallas and Jimmy Carter beat Regan and was still president. The latter two factoids don’t impact the story but just give a little more alt-history for the context of the author’s setting. And, yes, robots that look like humans and have a bit of dramatic whimsy are the antagonists created by the protagonists. Or are the humans the antagonists to the robots?Charlie is a well-educated but aimless 30-something who earns his money in day trading—usually losing on schemes—has a bit of a shaky past with his law degree but is honestly open and vulnerable to love. He decides he loves his roomie, a PhD candidate and history major, Miranda, the most enigmatic woman he’d ever met. He was likely attracted to her air of secrets. Charlie takes an inheritance and spends 89 thousand pounds on Adam, a robot who looks good enough to be human, and meant to be programmed by the owner to have whatever characteristics you decide to give him. Thus opens the whole theme of morality and technology and the intersection of the two. And what happens if you let your new love interest is asked to program half of Adam by herself?Don’t wait for me to tell you—go read the book! As always, McEwan never disappoints on prose, dry wit, a trough of sentimentality when it comes to romantic love, and the bittersweet shakedowns. It also addresses the limits of consciousness in AI. OK, and that topic has been explored by many other authors in thousands of books, so this wasn’t the reason I read it. I knew that McEwan’s story would be as much philosophy as conflict, and perhaps I’ve heard similar debates and ideas about robots before, but I wanted to observe how McEwan executed his characters and themes as well as story. He’s never a lazy writer, and his ambitions are typically within his sphere of confidence. It wasn’t my favorite McEwan—that spot goes to ATONEMENT. And at times I felt that the author was too restrained, and the liftoff was denied to us as readers.Charlie’s voice sounded a bit dour mixed with a hopeful and careless optimism, especially when faced with Adam. Those two definitely had friction. I think McEwan wanted us to explore how Charlie and Miranda could be a successful couple when they both programmed Adam (but didn’t share what characteristics that they programmed into Adam). As the reader, we didn’t know any more than those two—even less, because Miranda’s choices aren’t transparent. Is Adam actually a combination of the traits they entered, or did he have his own consciousness arising from the two? And, if he didn’t have his own consciousness, what is the difference between having your own consciousness and simulating it? I like how McEwan provokes the reader to speculate, but then again I was a little disappointed, too, in the endgame. However, as always with his novels, there’s a bit of a jolt to the denouement—something that pushes you in a lane you weren’t ready for—at least, in one aspect. But there are other parts of the climax that are standard for this kind of novel about robots.This isn’t a spoiler, but I was especially impressed by Adam’s considered thoughts on vision and death. He compared it to our peripheral vision and awareness. “The odd thing is, there’s no boundary, no edge…There isn’t something, then nothing. What we have is the field of vision, and then beyond it less than nothing.” “So this is what death is like. The edge of vision is a good representation of the edge of consciousness. Life, then death.” There are other nuggets like this that I enjoyed.My biggest complaint is that Adam didn’t really get under my skin, not as a robot or not as programmed—that, of course, should have been conveyed through the actions, reactions, and interactions between Miranda and Charlie. I thought that McEwan succeeded in somewhat closing the loop and leaving an opening to ponder, but as much as the characters were organically comprised, occasionally it felt stilted. The momentum was halting, and the alt history of the British politics didn’t tie in enough specifically—only in a general way of social sciences. But, I’m glad I read it and I was certainly engaged until the end. What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be programmed by humans? 3.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,May 2019,"May 05, 2019","May 07, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42086795-machines-like-me

Yes, it is a tome, but once you are installed in the story, it pulls you naturally along. I cared and cringed and chuckled and cried with each of the four sisters and their parents (and then there’s the third gen of kids). Each character was individualized and any one of them could have leaped off the pages. How they lived and loved became all-important to me as I folded myself into their days and years. They crept into my heart; it was like being a member of their family.Marilyn Connelly and David Sorensen met in the mid-70s during their undergrad days in Chicago and knew instinctively that they were meant to be husband and wife. David became a family physician, and Marilyn left university when she got pregnant. The novel covers 40 years of their lives, as their family grew large with four daughters--Wendy, Violet, Liza, and the baby, Grace--fifteen years younger than Wendy. Violet and Wendy are a year apart--Irish twins, the sisters who were the closest and developed a love-hate relationship. Liza was considered the middle child, and Grace was born (on purpose, but everyone thought she was their Catholic accident) in 1993. The current year is 2016, but the novel moves back and forth in time, mounting little mysteries and hints and integrating interlocking narratives. Everyone has a storyline, independently and collectively. And that includes the loose cannon, Jonah, given up for adoption by Violet as an infant and, at age 15, has resurfaced, to Violet’s dismay.Wendy, the guarded, troubled, and most irreverent, sustains the lion’s share of tragedies. She keeps the wine close at hand and others at arm’s length, and is most combative with Violet. Violet has control issues, and has difficulty taking risks; she resists interference in her perfectly chiseled life with her husband and two young sons. Liza, now pregnant and a successful professor, has a severely depressed boyfriend who alternately sobs and sleeps. Gracie, after graduating from Reed, in Portland, subsists in a boring job and tells an ever-ripening fiction to her family. She’s confined her options and widened her lies.“Nobody was who they appeared to be; everyone was struggling; money didn’t make a difference…” And, as Gracie believes, “No one…would ever regard her with the same enthusiastic awe as her mother; the same feverish pride as her father.” As the story evolves, it is clear that the author created a prism for everyone’s fractured perceptions, revolving memories, missed opportunities, and mixed blessings. The shifting impressions and vacillating notions circle around and veer in sloping lines, caterwauling, twisting, tipping and turning. Colleagues, outsiders, and even their children assume that David and Marilyn’s love together is effortless perfection. Nobody would truly comprehend their nuanced history and complexity, the intimacy of joining together before they could ever be alone. But they agree--it's the most fun they ever had. And each child has a shared and personal history that we glimpse through a window or gaze through a curtain. Resounding, the spirit of the narrative stirs with fractious dialogue and unfiltered warmth.

The description of “hillbilly noir” attracted me; I was thinking about Cormac McCarthy, for one. But there was nothing noir about this book, just lots of hillbillies, rednecks, and meth heads. Noir, to me, means stark, lean, and not a lot of translating and expounding on someone’s inner thoughts or decisions. There was too much clarifying, and not enough allowing the reader to figure it out. Moreover, the prose was plain Jane Main Street instead of terse, taut, and pointed. I also figured out almost everything that would happen.After 80 pages, I wanted to quit. But I kept trying, anyway—in order to give a reasonable . There are 300 pages and I made it to 180, and then read the last 40 pages and concluded that my predictions were correct. This was actually more of a short story, for all the little that actually happened. But the author trimmed no fat in telling the tale, and packed it with a lot of excess but pointless (to me) passages.If the plot wasn’t going to keep me engaged, I wanted the characters to absorb me. But not even Clayton, the Sheriff and supposed hero, lured me in. He was a boring self-pitying drunk that would drink a pint of whiskey by 8 am, and then evade his job, his wife, and his baby boy, all because he was forced to kill his vile, sociopathic brother (oh, yeah, his brother with half a heart?) to save an innocent woman—in the last book. But his guilt was ruining his life. And, he was too pathetic for me to feel much for him, even though I knew he’d likely clean up his act and save the day, or at least himself, in the end.A good villain with intriguing and complex traits will keep me actively absorbed. Again, Cormac McCarthy is a great example, as well as Jo Nesbo. But the villains in this book were one-dimensional and hackneyed. In fact, Panowich spent over 100 pages of LIKE LIONS intermittently returning to the plot, characters, and outcome of his previous book, BULL MOUNTAIN—way more than necessary. I never read BULL MOUNTAIN, but sure wouldn’t need to, as the author did too much retread of the finer or duller points, shutting down my senses for the present novel. And using violence to compensate for a tedious narrative won’t turn it into a fabulous tale, either. It was a puerile and corny novel, in my opinion. But Panowich has plenty of fans, and doesn’t need me lining up for his oeuvre.I just want to add that, if made into a cable movie, the right, intrepid director, writer, and cinematographer could turn this cornball, network movie mush into a true Netflix hillbilly noir....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 08, 2019","Apr 09, 2019","Apr 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27272420-like-lions

Let me explain. TwoIf TRUE DETECTIVE (without the detective part) and Ann Patchett’s novel, COMMONWEALTH, got married, this might be their offspring. Let me explain. Two young rookie officers in 1973, in the boroughs of New York City, are newly assigned partners. Their cases don’t really factor into this novel (that’s the no detective aspect), only their professions and career status. But their private lives do overlap, and several generations of each family are portrayed. That’s the Patchett part. But Mary Beth Keane does not borrow or steal from others--she has her own absorbing tale to tell that kept me gripped from start to finish. Moreover, I couldn’t speculate what would happen next at any particular time, although the story was organically told. Keane kept me on my toes as well as leaving me fully satisfied at the end. The narrative was flawlessly paced, with a pitch-perfect voice and a polished, mature, and confident prose style. For an example of its smooth, metaphorical language, and speaking about memory: “They…learned that a memory is a fact that’s been dyed and trimmed and rinsed so many times that it comes out looking almost unrecognizable to anyone else…”Francis Gleeson is originally from Ireland, with an American girlfriend, Lena. Brian Stanhope is engaged to Irish-born Anne. They start talking during their time on the beat, and experience their first murder/dead body together, too. Eventually, they are assigned to different units but they both move to the ‘burbs, in the made up city of Gillam, living next door to each other. So that is the framing device, and the story continues as a literary domestic drama, with nuanced character development and some intense moments that alternately astonished and moved me in thoroughly credible ways.This isn’t a broad drama with lots of fast and furious action; instead, it is chiefly reserved and more intimate, with penetrating, complex characters. It is theme-based with a consequential plot that spans about forty years and three generations. There’s no reason for me to spoil the plot with details, but its overarching message is about love and forgiveness. “Love is not enough” is a common refrain concerning marriage; attentive, ready honesty and communication prevents clashes and resentment from building. There is a lot here about primary trauma; tragedy; clemency; and compassion, as well as trust and understanding. How do families talk, and how do they find amnesty? Furthermore, addiction, mental health issues, and the courage to reclaim your best self tunnels into the overarching theme of redemption. The voice is more objective than the reader; therefore, we aren’t pandered to or manipulated. There’s plenty of space for the reader to interpret instead of being fed platitudes or clichéd isms. I know a novel is eminently installed in me when, even when the author is done with the characters, the characters aren’t done with me.

Tom hurts, deeply, but isn’t a complainer, and puts on a friendly face for the community. Always helpful, he is the kind person that you see on his face. He meets Hannah, and is taken in with her unusual high spirit and seemingly candid nature.Hannah is a Jewish, middle-aged Hungarian woman with a history at Auschwitz and trauma, loss. She comes to Hometown to open a bookstore in a building that has a history of failed businesses. And, nobody in this rural outback even reads, it is alleged. Tom and Hannah, both grieving, have no common background, but for the emptiness of loss. They find a slice of sunshine between them, anyway. Can they last?Tom knew nothing about Jews, except “they’d been knocked from pillar to post in the war.” Hannah knew nothing about Australia or farmers, but books had always tethered her; she even got Tom to read, at first warily, and then with delight. Hannah is more guarded, however, and when she goes to a dark place in her head, she shuts down. The thrust of this narrative is finding love in another, despite the trauma and loss of the past.

It’s in large part a morality tale--and how do we know? Because “My husband asked me to lie.” The first pages serve as prologue—an explosion in a barn where a hyperbaric chamber business exploded like a grenade. Two are dead, many are maimed, and now, a year later, in 2009, the trial begins, here in the eponymous Miracle Creek, Virginia. If you are a reader, get ready for an edge-of-your-seat literary courtroom thriller (and beyond the courtroom) that keeps the twists and turns coming, at a thrumming pace. Read it on a weekend or be prepared to call in sick!The hyperbaric (HBOT) “Miracle Submarine” business owner is Pak Yoo, who emigrated from South Korea a year before the explosion. His wife, Young, and his 16-year-old daughter, Mary, came to the U.S. four years before he did in order to settle in while he saved back home. Young works long hours at a grocery store while Pak runs Miracle Submarine, all for the quest to give Mary a better life and an American education.Angie Kim has consummate control over her tightly plotted story, never intruding on the narrative with an agenda. When it became clear that most of the clients using the hyperbaric chambers are kids on the autism spectrum, I was wary that this was going to be a “message” about the various controversies of autism treatment. But, my suspicions were assuaged as the content came through organically, without platitudes or bumper sticker maxims. Perhaps I figured a few things out along the way—but not the whole picture, and there were many complex fibers to this fabricated but credible story. The denouement is inspired, architecturally brilliant, all for the reader to chew on.The various characters involved (dead and alive) and their individual and collective voices are commanding, the outcome searing and seamless. The dead are brought to life via their background stories, as is done with each individual, plus a Greek chorus of protestors that aren’t, in this case, the moral backbone. Each titled chapter is a different character that continuously alternates—the chapters are relatively short and the writing is concise and nuanced, yet it periodically hit me like a sniper’s bullet aimed for my heart. The third person limited POV really works well here, too. Many contemporary novels do away with third person, considering it quaint and arcane, but you’ll settle in eagerly to Kim’s approach as the pages turn quickly and daringly.There’s so much for the reader to savor and discover that I am compelled to keep the bits to a minimum. I’m very eager and excited for all you lovers of the merge of mainstream and literary fiction (or even if you are partial to one or the other) to get your hands on a copy, and then get one for all your book-loving friends!

One summer break, they decide to rough it in the Northern Canadian wilderness and take a month-long river canoe trip. They are experienced in all things wilderness, and are well-prepped for the journey (except for not taking a sat phone for safety—the only incredulous decision-making in the novel).

Heller, who is also a Dartmouth grad and has kayaked all over the world, must have a trace of Jack and Wynn within him. And, like his previous novel, THE PAINTER, he seamlessly intersects nature and art, so that the landscape, in his frequently anthropomorphic, metaphorical descriptions, is a character in itself.“The implacability and violence of nature always awed him. That it could be entirely heedless and yet so beautiful…But also its intricate intelligence. Its balancings. Its quiet compensations. It was like some unnamed justice permeated everything.”The story kicks off quickly and the challenges they face will test their better angels vs. their demons. Nature and man commingle and combust in equal measure, and the pages turn heatedly as you journey to the end of the river with the two young men.

There’s a Who and Why regarding a hit-and-run that resulted in death, which is the ballast of the plot, at least in a pressing sense. The other characters are immediate family or characters connected to the family or incident in some way. “What a fragile thing a heart was. So easy to fool. To break. To stop on impact in a darkened intersection.”Moroccan-born Driss Guerraoui, a husband, father, and grandfather, is a diner owner in a small Mojave desert community. He’s also the victim of the hit-and-run, while walking to his car from work one evening. His two adult daughters and wife, Maryam, grieve in separate ways, often rupturing old wounds and inciting new ones. An undocumented worker, Efraín, witnessed the incident but is afraid to come forward. The primary protagonist, however, is Nora, Driss’ youngest (and favorite) daughter and the non-conformist of the two. She’s a jazz pianist and performer with more rejection notices than work; her mother pointedly and wearily saying “She has her head in the clouds,” a tired refrain to her daughter. Nora refuses to settle for a pragmatic, secure job, like her sister, the dentist. It was only her father that understood this, which makes his death even harder to bear.Returning to the Mojave for the funeral, feeling unmoored and paralyzed by her father’s death, Nora stays longer and begins a romance with a past schoolmate, Jeremy, an Iraqi war veteran-turned-cop, also a central character. They are very different people with allied needs, but Nora has difficulty trusting due to past struggles. The story highlights several ugly stereotypes without condescending to the reader. Driss, for example, is highly educated and an atheist, but is often referred to by others as “the Muslim.” Nora has been stymied and bullied by others since childhood, and finds solace in her music.Told in first-person POV, the various characters alternate with their own or overlapping stories. The theme is home, identity, and loss, and the title suggests the outliers, the outsiders, the “other” Americans.

Lindsay Bach is 33, single, a fact-checker for a men’s magazine, ace at her job, but her personal life is pretty stagnant, with no gelled romantic prospects. When an old friend, Sarah, moves back to NYC, they meet up, prompting Lindsay and Sarah to discuss a night, a decade ago, when their mutual friend, Edie, died of apparent suicide under strange circumstances. Their memories of that night don’t quite match up, caught as they are in the seams of trauma, inchoate and murky.The premise here is Lindsay trying to fit the missing pieces of the puzzle together to determine what really happened that night, the lost night of Lindsey’s hazy, murky memory. “I’d…read that in emotionally distressing moments, your brain can rewrite an ending, stitch together a memory that feels real.” And, like other genres that approach this type of mystery, Bartz’s novel centers on Lindsay attempting to cobble her memory back together, too. Her current recall has to shatter in pieces before it can become whole again. And before she can become whole again, too.The bulk of the story is narrated by Lindsay, with a few choice chapters devoted to some of their 2009 gang of friends. Edie was the charismatic alpha of the group, the irresistible ephemeral one, her friends clinging to her for assurance and attention. They were a dysfunctional group of NYC hipsters (and the irony isn’t lost on them) that lived in this massive building called the Calhoun, which reminded me of a big ship with many passageways, stairways and small rooms, with an area outside fit for musicians and their hangers-on. It was the “in” place for bands, just as Edie was the It girl of the time. I won’t give a plot progression or any spoilers; thrillers are for readers to work out the revelations. Since I’ve read a lot of thrillers, I was pretty sure I figured out the big Who very early on, which seemed initially disappointing as I carried on. But I wanted to know the Why and the How and other things that required more discovery. And, yes, there were a few groan or eye-roll straight-out-of-a-TV and over-the-top moments, but at least the author worked around that and kept going for a better moment to reveal all.There was also some nuanced threads that may slip by you, especially if you fasten negatively on the cliché parts and throw out the baby with the bathwater. It seems to be wrapped up in the end. Or is it? My mind continued to play a few tricks on me, not on the main memory event, but on some peripheral characters as well. At least it gave me some good bits to feed on. Moreover, I don’t think Bartz was shallow with her themes, either, concerning memory and mental issues. There were enough reflective moments done in Bartz brio style.

Fletcher’s irresistible story is a page-turning bildungsroman filled with adventure. The main character is reminiscent of Cervantes’ Quixote, with a bit of Virgil, Homer, and Dante thrown in. I even thought a bit of the “Fool” on the Tarot Card. This is the first lone adventure for our hero, Griz, who has knowledge about our era only from books. When there’s almost nobody left, it’s the only way to learn. “We’re out here on the wrong side of a dying world trying to piece together the story of what’s happened from torn fragments that we can only snatch at as they flutter past us in the wind.”The author’s love of literature is on gleaming display in a world with not much else that has survived. Fletcher portrays a vivid, primitive future that came after the “soft apocalypse.”“Maybe if this were a proper story it would start calm and lead up to a cataclysm…But this isn’t that kind of story…This is me writing down the real, telling what I know…And everything that I know, even my being born, happened long, long after that apocalypse had already softly wheezed its way out.”This now dystopian earth is grim and stark--old rusted cars are piled up on top of one another, shrubs and trees grow savagely in the cracks of concrete, and old fallen houses are prolific. It’s a tilted, hushed topography now. This is a planet beyond the “Gelding” and the “Baby Bust”-- a world that has no more technology, no more schools. Women aren’t able to breed anymore, and dogs (especially female) are a scarcity. Griz’s family lives on a Scottish island, and their contact with other people is rare. There’s less than 20,000 people left on the planet.Griz’s intimate, personal voice narrating this story is a captivating blend of strength, purpose, and warmth. Circumstances compel our hero to chase a visiting trader to the mainland on the family boat, a man who has absconded with one of Griz’ beloved dogs. And that is how this exciting journey takes off. It won’t belong before you feel you are walking in Griz’s shoes. This could have been categorized under YA books, but I am glad it wasn’t, because I would have passed it by. It’s a coming-of-age novel meant for the ageless population of readers. The narrative is ripe with twists and turns you won’t see coming, and the story of redemption and humanity’s best friend will resonate long after you come to the end of the story--or to the end of the world.“Dogs were with us from the very beginning.

I’m not a fan of genre spy novels like Bourne Identity, but prefer when the spy content is linked to something deeper and more thematic, such as in Mailer’s HARLOT’S GHOST, DeLillo’s LIBRA, and, more recently, Lea Carpenter’s RED WHITE BLUE. Not that all good spy novels have to have intellectual heft, but in order to engage me, I want to feel something personal in the pages. And this is a genuinely personal novel—written as a letter of love from a mother to her sons.Wilkinson’s debut novel contains nuggets to chew on--a black American woman, Marie Mitchell, working as a spy for the Feds during the Cold War, who is also a single mother trying to protect her young twin sons. Moreover, her international espionage in Africa is teamed with a tale of romance and universal themes of family. In fact, this is mostly a story of family and trying to protect the ones you love, but it adds a few adrenaline touches of adventure. And don’t read the cover blurb—it gives way too much away!As the novel opens in 1992, Marie encounters a violent incident in her home, forcing her to take her boys and escape to Martinique to live with her mother. Afterwards, she decides it is important to recount her life history and the years leading up to this moment, so that her boys understand not only the racial and gender divide in this country, but also her choice of profession—why she got involved in working for the FBI and her decisions afterwards. More importantly, she wants her sons, William and Tommy, to possess esteemed ideals and live courageous lives, and to help make America a place that they are proud to live in. She often explains to them why she made certain decisions, and presses upon them, through her writing, the mistakes, regrets, and no-regrets of her life.If you’ve never heard of Thomas Sankara, the charismatic president of Burkina Faso from 1983-1987, you will come away from this book feeling like you’ve met him and reached into his heart. Marie was persuaded to keep tabs on him in Africa, which led to some of the most poignant events and adventures of her life. I think she wanted to teach her boys not to gauge an ideology superficially, but to evaluate people as individuals. She also desired that Tommy and William understand her, and her family, and their flaws. “Throughout my life, the most consistent way I’ve revealed who I really am is through the men I’ve chosen to love.”The narrative has many page turning events, and it is peppered with literary and poetic allusions along the way. At times, it did stall with redundancies that felt extraneous, but Wilkinson was in charge of her narrative and didn’t flounder much. I felt rewarded at the end, despite a few over-the-top action scenes and somewhat predictable ones. Yet, for a debut novelist taking on what she did, she impressed me with her radiant and organically flawed characters. Most readers will be on edge wanting to know the truth of what happened to Marie’s sister, Helene, as well as Marie’s tense relationship with her mother, Agathe. And we want to know the outcome of Marie’s story.“In spy stories, the question of what becomes of a spy’s cover after it’s no longer needed is rarely discussed. But we were still there. We still existed.” Readers will be inspired and satisfied with Wilkinson’s portrayal of her characters and the thrust of her narrative. Perhaps a few of the characters are out of central casting, but her portrait of the Mitchell family—the tragedies, revelations, and ultimate endurance, were vivid and memorable. My gut instinct tells me this will eventually be made into a cable TV prestige series. But whatever happens, I look forward to Wilkinson’s next book....more",Notes are private!,2,20,1,"Feb 18, 2019","Feb 21, 2019","Feb 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40274582-american-spy

I did see The Big Sleep years ago, and am familiar with some of Marlowe’s famous one-liners and cases through literary allusions and literature culture in general. But, being a fan of Lawrence Osborne, I decided to read this, knowing I wouldn’t have too many pre-conceived notions (if any) on how Marlowe’s character and actions should be executed. I wouldn’t be distracted by comparisons. So, if you’re looking for a er that compares the two novelists, you’ve come to the wrong . But I thought this book was solid and entertaining, and covered well the theme of decency, honor, aging and alienation.The setting here is 1988, and Marlowe is 72, retired, and living alone in a house on a Mexican beach on the Baja California Peninsula, sipping margaritas at a hotel he frequents. In come two insurance gentlemen dressed like undertakers, urging Marlowe out of retirement for one last case that will take him to the badlands and border between Mexico and California. The gist if the case is that a debt-ridden man Marlowe’s own age, Donald Zinn, has washed up on the beach dead, and his insurance policy obligated a two-million dollar payout to the lovely wife, half his age. Moreover, Zinn’s body was immediately cremated, no minutes to spare. The insurance agents want Philip to investigate whether there was something fishy in this death and the policy.Does Marlowe want to do this? His days of fistfights and gun-slinging are over. He relies on a silver-tipped cane—which hides a deadly Japanese blade—to limp around. He’s truly vulnerable physically, but also mentally nostalgic. “You have your books and your movies, your daydreams and your moments in the sun, but none of these can save you any more than irony can.” So, he’s talked out of retirement for one last case.And the plot is mostly credible, in what is likely a Chandler-esque way. Sure, some bodies pile up and—okay, it is periodically larger than life. Could an elderly alcoholic really rough it this way and sustain this kind of stress? Probably not, but the cerebral and intellectual sovereignty of Marlowe sucked me in pretty quick, despite its slow start, and had me believing in his character and his gumshoe tactics. And, of course, there is a dame, isn’t there always a dame in a detective noir of the Marlowe variety? But, it isn’t like you may think. As Clint Eastwood once said, a man’s gotta know his limitations, and Marlowe knows his constraints.The book isn’t a quick page-turner by any means, and it takes a while to get off the ground, but Osborne knows his settings, and two of the reasons I chose this book is his impeccable us of setting and atmosphere. And his tone is laconic but sympathetic. “You can be called to a last effort, a final heroic statement, because I doubt you call yourself to leave comforts and certainties for an open road. But the call is inside your own head. It’s a sad summons from the depths of your own wasted past. You could call it the imperative to go out with full-tilt trumpets and gunshots instead of the quietly desperate sound of a hospital ventilator.”The plot itself didn’t win me over as much as Osborne’s writing. If you crave a fast-paced plot, this isn’t that novel—it does have twists and turns, and as Osborne wrote in his author’s note at the end, the narrative incarnates qualities of fairy tale and nightmare. He reckons with aging more than once, and in his poignant and wistful voice, reflects on his old age. “Count me as one of those who know that life is unbearable not because it’s tragedy but because it’s romance. Old age only makes it worse, because now the race against time has reached the hour of high noon.”...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 19, 2019","Jan 21, 2019","Feb 23, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37885418-only-to-sleep

However, Readers counting on a fast-paced, plot-driven linear mystery that sprints to a neatly tied and blood-soaked bow will be sorely disappointed. However, if you like your crime dramas literary and lush, with contoured characters, atmospheric prose, and penetrating themes, then you’ve come to the right book. Ten years ago, in a small Minnesota town, nineteen-year-old Holly Burke was found dead in the cold current of the Black Root River. The now retired sheriff, Tom Sutter, failed to close the case due to insufficient evidence on his main suspect, Danny Young, which angered Holly’s father, Gordon, and left him resentful on top of his depression. Now, in the dead of winter, Sutter’s daughter, Audrey, and her friend, Caroline, are driving from a southern college to Audrey’s house, when the car they are in is forcibly propelled into the same icy river, this time across the border in Iowa. Audrey survives, but not without survivor’s guilt, PTSD, and a broken arm, among other injuries. While her terminally ill father stands by (but gets involved), his former deputy, Moran, is now the Iowan sheriff investigating this case, legally requiring Tom to take a back seat and relinquish control of solving the crime. But of course he just can’t easily do thatThis new case that eerily parallels the previous one inflames icy memories in a community weighted with unresolved grief, never quite thawed. It affects three different families and reconnects them in powerful and unexpected ways. Both Gordon and now Tom are shot through with guilt due to their failure to protect their daughters from danger, albeit ten years apart. Danny Young was compelled to leave town a decade ago and abandon his twin brother, Marky, who has special needs. Their mother, Rachel, had a personal and professional bond with Gordon that was permanently severed when Holly died. Danny’s inconclusive guilt and indeterminate innocence preys on all involved. As Audrey gets her strength back, she refuses to stand passively by, and her grit and guts to participate in finding the perpetrator(s) generate stunning, personal intersections that cross red lines and drive the plot. Themes of grief, guilt, secrets, and lies pervade the text and threaten to undo a community, or hopefully heal those in need. Between the ennui of stalled conflicts, the provocation of awakened animosities, and a courageous collaboration of the seemingly mismatched, a current is forged as strong as the Black Root River itself and rallies a new resolve. But don’t ask for all your questions to be answered succinctly.As Johnston demonstrated in DESCENT, he is a master of the elegiac and the atmospheric, the haunting and the harrowing, spectacles and subtleties. As a reader, you’ll sink your teeth into his prose. He leaves a lot to chew on in his melancholy and emboldened narrative. There’s just the right bits of levity, too, in the sharp wit and dialogue. This is a book to savor, to be patient with in its languid current.“On and on under the ice, in the strange light, your fingertips slipping along the underside of the ice and the girls coming and going like the curious creatures they are, the moon following, and it’s two minutes or it’s two hours or it’s ten years…ten years and ten thousand years all the same thing to the world and only one creature in all its history ever keeping track, ever thinking of such a thing as time—ever desiring it or fearing it or losing it, and that was why you’d come home in the first place, because you were running out of time…”...more",Notes are private!,0,18,2,"Jan 22, 2019not set","Jan 25, 2019not set","Feb 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38746163-the-current

We are about to meet all the London characters, and the dead man, Zachary, going back and forth in time to include a quartet of married friends and their three adult children (two are younger adults) and then the shock and grief when he leaves them behind. The death, unlike the music, is certain.Zachary’s death was sudden and unexpected, his wife, Lydia, broken in pieces. These are friendships that go back thirty-plus years. Hadley has a particular style—delicate and filled with the gentle piquancy of art in the midst of all that is despairing, which anchors the story and also gives it an ethereal quality. You don’t read Hadley for the plot or action—you read it for the characters and story, layers of complex human psychology, the vibrations of life, life itself in somber tones.“In her mind she understood how sex and death were both part of the mystery of entrances and exits, both opening onto this same strange place where they all belonged now, in the sudden shadow of Zachary’s death.” And that is the locus, or the abyss, of these four lives (and their children, to a degree). The novel is primarily an internal, meditative narrative for the reader, but also how our actions have long-term consequences.There’s a chapter chunk in Venice, Italy, which is rendered exquisitely by Hadley. It brought me back to my time there, and she captured the light and colors so beautifully that it felt physical, palpable. On the cover, within the title, is likely pieces of the Tiepolo ceiling in the Scuola dei Carmini. In this poignant backdrop, a mirror is held up to the past, both literally and figuratively, which brings the past, present, and future into stark relief for two art lovers and close friends. It’s the scene in the book I have read multiple times, and, like a bouillon cube, it concentrates the narrative to represent the essence of the grand theme. I won’t give anything away, as it is imperative for the readers to alight on their own discoveries.This is a novel for Hadley fans and literature lovers, so be forewarned that the movement is often inward, but the stakes are high, the cost steep, and the outcome inescapable....more",Notes are private!,2,21,1,"Jan 15, 2019","Jan 16, 2019","Jan 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39893596-late-in-the-day

It takes place primarily in the small Québecois village of Three Pines, but also branches out to Montreal. A few hints are included in KINGDOM to update readers that (and why) our hero, Armand Gamache, Chief Superintendent of the Sûreté du Québec police force, is under suspension. His son-in-law, Jean-Guy, has his hands full from his bosses to comply with their demands. It’s a hot mess politically. Meanwhile, there are two major plotlines that Penny handles with seamless ease, and she keeps the reader eagerly turning the pages.The novel opens with Armand meeting a notary at an abandoned, crumbling farmhouse. His neighbor, Myrna (a former psychologist) and a young man they don’t know named Benedict have also been called to come. They learn that they are to be liquidators (executors) of a dead woman’s will, someone they have never met or even know of. This mystery unravels gradually and intriguingly as Armand uses his keen investigative skills and enlists Jean-Guy after a murder takes place subsequent to the reading of the will.In the meantime, and obviously related to the last novel, a batch of Carfentanil is about to hit the streets, a drug at least 100 times more potent than Fentanyl. Armand is desperate to stop it from happening, and is responsible for it getting through the border in the first place (one would have to read the last novel, GLASS HOUSES, to understand why that is). His decision making in GLASS HOUSES is what got him suspended, but Armand is more concerned with stopping the drug than with his position as Chief Superintendent. I’m not going to ruin discovery by giving any spoilers; it’s sufficient to know that Penny keeps us riveted to the pages and at least one step ahead of her readers.

You can always research the history online, which does help to comprehend the importance of this time. Dubček's “socialism with a human face,” as this time was called, gave rise to many outspoken intellectuals and students, as well as the civilian population tired of living in a communist bloc behind the Iron Curtain. Mawer attempts to give it a human face, also, by centering on three British Nationals and one Czechoslovak woman, with mixed results, in my opinion.Two storylines inevitably converge. As it opens, two Oxford students, James and Ellie, who barely know each other (she from a rich family, he from humble beginnings), decide to go hitchhiking around Europe together during summer break. While they are navigating their way through Europe, camping most of the time, they are also navigating the terms of their relationship. From the outset, that is the most intriguing part of their story. It’s personal, individual, set against 1968 and all that entails socially and politically. With little money for this venture, they start off with a sense of spirited enterprise, flipping a coin at intersections to choose directions to follow, which countries to go to next. It’s all very spontaneous and governed by instinct, contingency, and adventure.The second storyline concerns Sam Wareham, a British First Secretary to the Ambassador, stationed in Prague because of his fluent Russian and passable Czech. His quasi-girlfriend is leaving for Germany, and the future status of their relationship is unknown. Not long after she leaves, Sam takes up with Lenka, a naturally striking young woman from Prague with a tragic and secretive past. Sam is smitten with her, and takes her with him wherever he goes, including diplomatic gatherings and errands out of town.The narrative is pleasant enough. Mawer is a skilled and sophisticated writer who doesn’t mince words and has complete control of his narrative. However, for me, there’s not much liftoff. I was always hoping for something to happen other than the ineluctable Soviet invasion that I know will come on August 21st. I assumed, like the blurb written for this book, that it would be masterly and chilling. But it came across as lukewarm to me. Just as I felt that we may be getting close to the characters, the text sort of pans out, or leaves me with tepid thoughts about all these relationships. A subplot of Russian musicians seeking asylum just distracts from getting inside the main characters’ stories.I’ve read other books by Mawer, and was spellbound by THE GLASS ROOM. Even TIGHTROPE kept me in suspense for much of the novel. But I felt no real tension with this one. The history added color--the Moody Blues coming to play, the ongoing protests, the encroaching Red Army crawling closer like insects, the ineluctable chaos when they come. When the fate of one character is left hanging in the balance, I was puzzled and didn’t think it was necessary—either that, or the author’s reason for doing so didn’t work for me. I’m aware that this may just be me not engaging with PRAGUE SPRING sufficiently, and I don’t want to dissuade other readers from giving this a try. I loved the scenes of Prague and the surrounding countryside, which brought me back to that magical city of 100 spires.

As the novel openEsi Edugyan’s victorious achievement centers on Washington Black, an eleven-year-old slave in the caning fields of Barbados in 1830. As the novel opens, the cruel master of the plantation has just died, and is being taken over by his even crueler nephew, Erasmus Wilde. “He owned me, as he owned all those I lived among, not only our lives but also our deaths, and that pleased him too much.” At the time, Washington’s only negotiation between himself and incomprehensible fear was Big Kit, an older slave with superstitions, a “monstrous charge of dark energy, huge, inexorable as a breaker…” who welcomed death as a way to return to her homeland—“If you dead, you wake up again in your homeland. You wake up free.” Wash loved and feared her equally.Wilde’s brother, Christopher, (known as Titch), is a scientist, with a distracted air about him, preoccupied with his grand experiments (like a precursor to an airplane or glider), and noticeably appalled by the ownership and treatment of black people as slaves. He agrees not to interfere with Erasmus’ running of the slaves and plantation, and requests only an assistant to help him with his scientific explorations. After noting an intelligence and curiosity in Wash, he appoints him to be his assistant and companion, and, inevitably, his first teacher. And, from here, the relationship between Titch and Wash become the heart of the story.Saying too much would give spoilers, even minor ones, so it’s sufficient to reveal that Titch and Wash grow a strong bond over the years, and have many adventures, some that are life-or-death. The story is narrated by Wash, some years later at the age of eighteen, as he navigates through the years, and simultaneously conveys not just how he feels now, but how he felt in the past, and his interpretation of events as the years roll on. He meets most of Titch’s living family members, and other acquaintances and associates, including abolitionists. Along the way, Wash has mixed feelings about the white man’s help, their guilt, their burdens. With the help of a romantic interest and his own passionate quest for knowledge, Wash becomes an autodidact and student of science and life. Washington swirls with the need to reconcile his past with his present adulthood, and the many disturbing discoveries along the way regarding friendship, family, and ideals. One of the most profound contemplations about white saviors was the idea that white abolitionists “…were more concerned that slavery should be a moral stain upon white men than by the actual damage it wreaks on black men.” What price is freedom for Wash, and how is he tethered to the one who freed him?Edugyan’s prose is vibrant and muscular and her characters are fleshed out and evolving.

Actually, my When I take a long time to finish a book because I am reading it between better books, it doesn’t bode too well for my final assessment. Actually, my favorite scene in the book is at the beginning, the first time our hero, James, meets Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It’s the early years of the 90s, when she is a Doubleday editor with a small office, who uses a conference room to meet with a client because it has more space. I think Rowley captured her essence there, at least the grace and polish she exuded, along with her mild, gentle blend of shy and assertive. The scene was light, delicate, and showed promise. But I never felt true liftoff the rest of the way through the novel.I want to stress that this is purely subjective, and I don’t wish to discourage readers who are eager to read this book. Perhaps your experience will be different. For me, it plodded along with pedestrian fervor. It came off as if Rowley had borrowed a plot from central casting and then placed his characters in it, never actually delivering something new, passionate, and intriguing. The actual arguments that drove a wedge between characters were uninspired and derivative, with a few precious moments of levity, also limp.There was a tendency to over-explain and over-explicate. For example, two characters have a surprise run-in, and one of them needs to justify what he was just doing. This leads to nervous, strained dialogue, unfolding to a parallel conversation. It is evident in the words that they spoke, obvious to the reader, yet the author clumsily inserts, “We’re almost having parallel conversations.” Unnecessary explanation, and it was either condescending to the reader, or the author didn’t trust the reader to get it.The gist of the story is an anguished writer finally is getting his novel published, and his editor is none less than Jackie O. He has to deal with his estranged mother in order to write an organic ending to the story, “The Quarantine” (that title is explained in the first few pages). His relationship with his boyfriend of five years starts to get rocky, and of course his whole life is existentially in the balance. Oh, the thunder and crash of success.There’s many more indelicate pitfalls that tripped up this writer from making THE EDITOR a success, in my view. Setting up a scene to follow with a profound statement that is nothing more than a cliché, such as “If I want to really be a writer, I have to tell the whole story. I have to follow the narrative wherever it may go.” Was this supposed to be a gem of discovery? How can one not write a novel without already knowing this? And how did Jackie O, a distinguished editor, see The Quarantine as a winner? There's an answer, but it didn't sway me. The author's inattention to important details bothered me. I wish I could pluck out more fine attributes, but it fell flat to me, and what was supposed to be dynamic was simply more static.

Those are the white dogs with the torn-looking black patches. It reads like an autobiography of a women in the midst of the worst of it--mourning while simultaneously attempting to absorb the recent suicide of Apollo’s owner, the unnamed narrator’s writing mentor. He left behind two ex-wives and a third one that I think he’s still married to (but not attached to). Nobody has names—-well, nobody important, anyway. I’d boil it down to understanding grief and, even more powerfully, Apollo’s grief.As humans, we cannot fully communicate with animals about the big stuff, the question Apollo (we think) would be asking: “Where’s my owner?” and the fallout from this huge absence that cannot be explained to this poor gentle beast. The main story is, of course, the narrator’s loss. But she can use communication skills to get through this time (even though sometimes it complicates it even more). However, the reader naturally has heartbreak toward Apollo, who we cannot tell, ”Your master is never coming home.” This is the overarching challenge or theme. The divide between humans and their beloved animals, a natural barrier to intimacy that we wish we didn’t have, and the ones we construct between ourselves to prevent talking to each other too intimately.If you’ve ever read H is for Hawk, which was non-fiction, well, this is way different. But they both concern grief and animals—and that’s about it for similarity. Perhaps mourning a loss can be expanded outward toward those that aren’t people.The narrator cut through the air of heaviness with warm gentle nuggets of observation. She said that Wife One had a theory that there are two kinds of womanizers--those that love women and those that don’t. Another woman shares Christopher Isherwood’s approach to fictional characters--to annul the common denominator details. Instead, create a character that has those special traits that initially make you want to write about them and then exaggerate those traits.It goes on like this but the most tender and most exquisitely human and heartbreaking (and even joyful) moments are between the narrator and Apollo.

Character-driven, plot based, well-paced, and mordantly comic at intervals, this novel will surely hit my best of 2019 reads. I don’t find the violence and gory graphics gratuitous, but that’s for the individual reader to decide. He knows just the perfect time to be tender, too, without ever making it schmaltzy.After the failed Swedish war against the Russians and the assassination of King Gustav III, the city and state are teetering on disaster, as disheveled and crippled as many of the returning soldiers. One of them, Mickel Cardell, suffers from PTSD (not known then), and works as a watchman. He lost an arm in the war, and licks his mental/emotional wounds by daily drunken bouts. Cardell is called to the foul-smelling, polluted Larder, where he retrieves a mutilated corpse from the water. The body’s limbs are missing, the eyes are plucked out, the lips and teeth are gone, and the tongue is removed. The body’s enduring feature is a thick mane of long blonde hair.Mickel intersects with 30-ish Cecil Winge, a consumptive lawyer who is winding down his successful assistance to the honest but sadly, outgoing head of police. Cecil is asked one more time to help the police, to solve this heinous crime. Cecil is a bit of a watch man himself, taking apart and putting together his watch and telling time by the church bells. His self-destructive flaw isn’t drinking like Mickel. It’s his fierce belief that everything can be solved by strength of mind, to the point of too much pride in his broken marriage. He teams up with Mickel and together they make the oddest couple of buddy crime fighters you’ll ever see.To add just a pinch of hyperbole, the artistic design of this novel brought me to my knees. Niklas Natt och Dag writes like visual directors who shoot each scene like a dynamic painting. He’s a genius at placing the reader in his story, a (re)constructed world of Sweden 1793, because the novel is so visually complete in historical detail and proportioned in its internal action and surroundings. Not Hollywood cinema, but rather like an indie artistic one, united to his rich imagination. Imagery is complex, layered, and nuanced. If you’ve ever seen The Man in the High Castle or Joe Versus the Volcano (two movies which are nothing alike or similar to this book), then you may have noticed that you could watch these on mute, ignore the plot or dialogue, and just watch how every last scene is balanced and worthy of a painting. A silent and breathtaking story through images (on film) or, in the case of Natt och Dag—through words, sentences, and paragraphs. That’s how this author writes. Attention to detail, and plenty to chew on as you chew on this scenery-- but never too much, because he knows how to place an object, person, place, and moment.THE WOLF AND THE WATCHMAN is a portrait with each moment guided with the beauty of Natt och Dag’s observant eye. He sees in all directions so the perspective is expansive and yet grounded in reality. And a harsh reality it is. Gentle humanity is evident, and pops in those moments that they occur—viscerally and sensually. Blink and you’ll miss it. The theme is in the title, “Are we wolves to one another, always on the lookout for the least sign of weakness before we choose our moment of attack?” But there's more to the theme, too--friendship, love, the class system, and human suffering.

And Peter Rock certainly shows us the depths of Lake Michigan and his love of night swimming in open water, as he looks back, age 50, to the summer of 1994, when he was 26 and a recent college grad. I share Rock’s love of swimming, so I just about twinned with him as he described, through beautiful imagery, the mystical power of open water swimming, specifically at night. “On the horizon I could see the lights of distant boats…We found our rhythm again, the slight chill of the water receding with the effort. The blackness below, the darkness above, the way they blended together and time stretched. I could not keep count of my strokes.”The timelessness of swimming underscores the author’s (and autobiographical novel’s) attempt to reconcile his memories, (both from the past, the present, and perceiving the past from the present), to his sense of self and his choice to be a writer. Using art, poetry, fairytales, photos, and scraps of old letters and emails, Rock revisits his values, passions, and commitment-phobia earlier self and seeks to discover a personal wholeness in the world he inhabits. The narrative seemed to be reaching to make peace with the past, his 1994 attraction to an older widow, and the unsaid words and misunderstandings toward past girlfriends.I am an excellent swimmer who shares Rock’s love of night swimming. However, other than the delicate, sensual swim and water imagery, this novel felt more like trying to find the depths in shallow water. He constructed it mostly as different meditative thought pieces, with a scant story within to hold the narrative together. But there was always a sense of the author, not as narrator only, but as the man behind the curtain trying to be the wizard. He included interesting tidbits of information (which occasionally felt like a Wikipedia stroll), but this wholeness he desired to achieve in life didn’t work for me as a novel. In fact, it fell flat, and seemed more like swimming in circles.The thin story was dragged out—a widow he met and had as a swimming buddy that 1994 summer didn’t strike me as all that enigmatic. Rock’s attempt to milk that mystery not only got old, but the longer it went on, the more it appeared contrived, as if he were searching for a reason to keep on plumbing the shallow depths. He also shared several black & white photos of his children at various times, but it came across as self-conscious, like social media posts, spuriously included. They weren’t essential nor did they add to the story of his self-searching, so it struck me as gratuitous.Aspects of the book were engaging, due to his stirring, tactile prose and passages. I sensed that he was trying to project an unreliable narrator keen to be reliable, but the story was thwarted by choppy seams and scant momentum for his raison d’être. I haven’t read any of Rock’s work before for comparison, but there’s evidently talent here. There were some glittering pearls in these narrative waters, but the sum of its parts didn’t feel whole to me....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 23, 2018","Dec 27, 2018","Dec 28, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41578266-the-night-swimmers

British author Jon McGregor is unconventional, to say the least, and not what you may expectI think I just discovered a new (for me) favorite author. British author Jon McGregor is unconventional, to say the least, and not what you may expect. Sure, the beginning is as a page ripped from the headlines—a 13 year-old girl goes missing from a northern English village. “When last seen she’d been wearing a white hooded top with a navy-blue body warmer, black jeans and canvas shoes. She was five feet tall, with straight, dark blond, shoulder-length hair.” Subsequently, the novel leaves the genre crime thriller behind. It becomes one of the most transcendent novels I have ever read, gently illuminating a portrait of a town and its people in a style closer to Virginia Woolf with a Michael Ondaatje sensuality. RESERVOIR 13 marks the life cycle, the microcosmic ecosystem of people and nature juxtaposed and turning year after year, the quotidian hum observed as from an omniscient eagle flying over the landscape or skimming over the terrain. The author has impeccable control over his narrative, glancing freely from one inhabitant to another, pairing with nature. The bats hibernated, the foxes gave birth, pheasants lift their plumage, people die, the clocks move forward or back.There is no one protagonist and no specific plot. Instead, there are themes of repetition, of community life and its social interplay, the way we inhabit our space, even the way McGregor inhabits space on the page, repeating certain sentences throughout the novel, marking time as infinite. We note the undercurrent of male violence. We observe the way people and nature affirm the cycle of perpetuity, regardless of individual struggles and in the face of our intimacies, secrets, personal tragedies, betrayals, and eventual obscurity. The community endures. Rebecca Shaw is the missing girl, and the author keeps her in the consciousness of the reader and the villagers with ceaseless rhythms and repetition, echoing her name as the narrative advances. “The missing girl’s name was Rebecca, or Becky, or Bex.” There are 13 reservoirs, thirteen chapters, thirteen years. Every chapter save the first and last begins with, “At midnight when the year turned there were fireworks…”The crystalline prose is truly exquisite, and its beauty made me gasp. All events are equal, and often in the same paragraph, the natural world and the domestic one coexist equally. This may be the only book I’ve read where I felt that almost entirely using the passive voice worked so magnificently to create the right mood, atmosphere, and superb restraint.“In August the young bats moved away from their mothers’ milk and the nursery colonies broke up. Their networks of flight were complex and unseen. They flung themselves through the grazing meadows taking dung beetles and moths while the adults began finding mates. On the baking stone path beside Reservoir no. 5 a slowworm was basking, and was taken by a buzzard to feed her chicks. Richard and Cathy were seen having lunch again at the new organic pub in Harefield. Questions were asked as to why they felt it necessary to go that far. Inferences were drawn. The cricket was canceled for weather, and the Cardwell team didn’t come over for drinks as they had done in previous years. Su and Austin Cooper had their twentieth anniversary.”There isn’t a moral point to this story. The emphasis and our attentions aren’t focused on one episode or another. The missing girl doesn’t age as years go by, she was sealed at thirteen, as she alternately surfaces like the seasons or is buried in their minds behind the everyday continuation of village life, and the world keeps on turning....more",Notes are private!,1,21,1,"Nov 04, 2018","Nov 06, 2018","Nov 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34146665-reservoir-13

Reading him was like entering another dimension, with the juxtaposition of hypnagogic images, surreal and hallucinatory dreamscapes. Murakami never disappointed me before, with his allegorical symbols such as an empty well or an underground city, and bewildering plots but with accessible characters caught in individual or collective traumas. Many of his novels were postmodern, but even in his realistic fiction, such as NORWEGIAN WOOD, you got a sense of the “other,” due to his dark, searching, and waiting atmosphere and tone. And humor—there was always a piping of humor with the dramatic. Reading him felt like watching a cat with fugitive wings. So why did this one take such a hard nosedive?Did Murakami usually have an editor to keep him in check, to clean it up? It almost seems as if, since the author has arrived, over and over again, that he wanted other hands off his text, or perhaps he was experimenting. But who would experiment with and cumbersome prose and bland details? The voice sounded juvenile at times and the plot was buckling under its own lack of subtlety. And, instead of trusting the reader to read between the lines and pick up on suggestion, he habitually jabs us with over-explication and declarations. By the time I was 25% through the novel, I wanted to heave it across the room. It was sagging under its own weight.As an example, the narrator, a portrait painter, talks about why he was attracted to his wife, a secret he never revealed to her. He goes on to ay that she wasn’t outstandingly attractive, but rather resembled his dead sister, especially her eyes. There was something hackneyed, unoriginal about it. “…the fact that her eyes reminded me so much of my sister who’d died at twelve…Without those eyes, I probably never would have tried to win her over…That was the sole secret I kept from her…”There are other details that, for me, landed with a thud. Part of it was presentation—a rather flavorless buffet of many “secrets” and anecdotal information I felt I’d heard before. The style was tedious and monotonous. I would have been engaged more if the fictional world and characters blended together more seamlessly, if the sentence structure had some flair. How narrative and description are invented is integral to reader absorption. I suppose my expectations were high, as Murakami had been known for his unique and imaginative language to build his stories. For me, KILLING COMMENATORE—and what a great title, that refers to a hidden painting—it lacked the author’s talent for atmosphere and tone, and I found it too cloying and overexposed, for lack of a better word. The painting idea had muscle, but the telling is where it atrophied for me.If I missed something, or readers heartily disagree with me, I understand. I don’t relish posting a two-star , but Murakami is no debut writer. Someone of his stature can handle criticism –it’s the fans I am concerned with. I am a dedicated fan, also, and appreciate that not every book is a winner.

Technology has advanced to skin implants and and special eye lenses to access the Internet. Printers print out 3-D “food,”—paper loaded with nutrients and fed to mostly animals. “Poly-roaches” are viruses that can entirely shut down digital networks. Climate change effects are now extreme; there are terrible floods and also raging dust storms that cause serious respiratory illnesses, like debilitating asthma. Into this world steps Frankie Burke, a recent MacArthur grant winner. She’s decided to move from Manhattan to Missouri and study the bonobos at the Foundation to carry on her work in evolutionary theories. Bonobos are gentle primates who won’t hurt humans and have exuberant sex before mealtimes to mitigate aggression and competition. The leader is an alpha-female. These creatures, with the intelligence of four-year-olds, are the closest animals to early humans.Frankie is healing from surgery, and is hoping for a full recovery. Most of her life was spent in pain and suffering from a disease which is revealed at its own narrative pace. That is how Schulman tenders her story—measured disclosures and progression. Frankie is at the bonobo enclosure daily, studying their interactions, eating habits, sexual behaviors, and mating rituals. She selected an assistant there almost at random; because of her reputation, she could have had her pick. But she chose a quiet ex-military researcher with a buzz cut and startling blue eyes, named David Stotts, or just Stotts. Frankie and Stotts possess separate dispositions, but he was strong and concise and he assisted her to walk, to fall safely to the ground, and instinctively she knew they would be honest toward each other. “I don’t like praise…Don’t give me any,” Frankie says to him early on. “Stotts would stand out in a crowd, like a fox in a group of Pekingnese. Alert, coiled and capable.”The locus of the book is Frankie--her healing, her life entire, which informs what and how she studies. While Frankie’s background is laid bare, Stotts is mostly an enigma, who we primarily see through Frankie’s eyes. As the narrative progresses, her professional relationship with Stotts evolves, shot with occasional and subtle playfulness. Her post-surgical status allows her to eat foods that were previously forbidden, and Stotts is amused at her taste for mayonnaise, chocolate, and meat—all rolled together and popped in her mouth!The bonobos bind Frankie and Stotts in shared devotion of a species, these chimp-like primates, with names like Sweetie, Tooch, Mama, Goliath. The interactions swing from casual to fraught, depending on various factors, such as Frankie’s demands and Stotts’ attentiveness, consistently impressive. His daughter suffers from serious asthma, and has left with his wife for London for treatment. In the meantime, Frankie is trying to win over the bonobos, so that she can spend more time in their enclosure interacting and proving her theory. One thing intriguing she discovered—for all their exhibitionist sex, there are times when they also have “secret sex.”The latter part of the book is when the dystopian elements appear to take over, reminding me of other novels in its class, such as GOLD FAME CITRUS, by Claire Vaye Watkins, and GODS WITHOUT MEN, by Hari Kunzru. The tone and atmosphere, especially, were reminiscent of STATION ELEVEN, by Emily St John Mandel. The events that coalesce into a force of nature may have been conventional, but Schulman doesn’t get lazy and rely on the easy literary heritage of others to deploy her plot and themes. The irony of Frankie’s disease and surgery plays a poignant role, and her relationship with her past, with the bonobos, and with Stotts is nuanced and credible.Schulman’s quixotic tale of the sex lives of bonobos and the theory of ovulating women is commanding, confident, and heartbreaking. The enduring power of love is evoked within the immediacy of harrowing crises. In fact, the presence of the bonobos, who are more than mere players in this novel, illuminate most brilliantly and tenderly one clear question: what it is to be human.

It suggested that Cunningham’s novel would center on the human condition, and it does, superbly. The structure, characters, prose, and plot of this Irish writer’s tale are all first rate and first class, and it hit me like a gut punch when the denouement arrived. You don’t have to be an expert in the Irish Troubles (I had a smattering of knowledge through other novels and films); you only need a curiosity and empathy for what it is to have divided loyalties and inner conflicts. What does it mean when your allegiances to family, relationships, career, politics, childhood memories, and secret affinities put you in doubt and danger? How do you control the outcome when you aren’t truly in control?The prologue of the novel starts in the present, in Ontario, and focuses less on exposition and more on a character, but vaguely introduced. The circumscribed approach to the story is the rule rather than the exception throughout the book. It caused me to pat close attention while simultaneously letting go, as the reader is led back and forth through different years and decades from the 50s until present time—in Ireland and other parts of Europe. Initially I was frustrated at not having a handle on where I was or where I was going, but permitting myself to essentially trust the author and accept that the enigmatic framework had a purpose, and the further I progressed, the deeper I was lodged. The mood is permeated with existential dread, a monumental engine of the story.I don’t even want to get into the set-up or content of the story, as this is one of consummate discovery for the reader, which embraces the sort of restricted access to the reader of plenary information. Part of the progression is piecing it together as the author intends. However, we are indulged and installed into certain events in Marty Ransom, the protagonist’s, life, especially his gilded childhood memories of Waterloo farm in Waterford, a rural farm in south-east Ireland. The narrative returns to it repeatedly, and each time a piece of the puzzle is placed. Marty’s childhood, affections, and root loyalties are illustrated. As an adult, he works in the Department of External Affairs, a post that requires a cool impartiality between the politics of the British forces in the Northern UK, and the competing forces of the IRA.There’s drama, romance, love, adventure, politics, sex, fidelities, bonds, betrayals, ambitions, collisions, duty, and violence that will break your heart and keep you in icy suspense. Soul searching, devotions, memories, treachery, contempt (and self-contempt), and perceived safety are key ingredients and keep the reader off-balance and exhilarated.“…The person I really hated was myself, for, just as all the characters in our dreams are different manifestations of ourselves, so the object of our deepest abhorrence are trapped in the parts of us that have fallen into the lost abyss of our souls.”A definite must for literary readers and thrill riders....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 24, 2018","Oct 26, 2018","Oct 30, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35694088-acts-of-allegiance

It revolves around a family in Louisiana—it goes back and forth in time, but at its center are Eden and Mae, two sisters ages 12 and 14, unsettled by divorced parents. They are sent to live with their writer and former activist father, Dennis, in NYC after their poet mother, Marianne, attempts suicide and is sent to a psychiatric hospital. The story of the family, told in concise chapters narrated by different characters (mostly the sisters), is like a chorus of indistinguishable voices, except in the content and perceptions of what they say, and ultimately tells the harrowing details in a gradual reveal.

Andrew Michael Hurley is aIt’s difficult to convey what I am compelled to say about this novel, as THE LONEY was just about my favorite book of 2016. Andrew Michael Hurley is a writer of commanding talent, and I will still be first in line for his next novel, when it comes out, as his elegiac tone, haunting atmosphere, and undulating and metaphorically muscular prose is still on full display in DEVIL’S DAY, despite it being a disappointing book for this reader. This is how I can best describe it with analogy. It’s like I was at the airport waiting to board a plane for a heady trip. But then the flight gets delayed by many hours. There’re still a lot of exclusive places to shop and eat at the Austin airport, and I can stay amused and fed until my flight finally arrives. But after finally boarding and watching the pregnant clouds, the grey and moody sky, and the astonishing play of light for half a day and night, the plane detours to another city because it ran out of fuel. The story in THE LONEY was electrifying, dangerous, ominous, and menacing, yet also supple, delicate, with a plot and characters fully rounded, from mournful to macabre. I was on the edge of my seat, although the narrative wasn’t swiftly paced, but rather gradual with colossal strength. But I have to wonder if Hurley, in writing DEVIL’S DAY, felt the need or desire to combine some autobiographical material into a fictional story. There was a lot of time spent on the quotidian dynamics of a family who lost an icon, The Gaffer—father to some, grandfather or uncle or cousin to others, and the first year of the annual Gathering and Devil’s Day sans Gaffer. This is when the tiny, rural and provincial burgh celebrates with a feast and rituals simulated to seduce and trick the devil after bringing the sheep down from the moors. Those that live here in “The Endlands” year round deal with punishing climate and embrace superstitious beliefs. I looked it up to see where in England it was, and discovered that The Endlands was a sci-fi horror book by Vincent Hobbes, a place of darkness, despair, and where things hiding in the recesses of your imagination foment and haunt you every night. OK, I was intrigued, anticipating another story where the mind is the most conjuring and frightful foe, reinforced by the moody, grim setting.This year, the Gaffer’s grandson, John Pentecost, returns to help gather the sheep for the Gathering. He’s the one that left for a teaching degree, lives in Suffolk with his comely, pregnant wife, Kat, and is the narrator of this story. He brings Kat for her first visit--for the Gaffer’s funeral, the Gathering, and the feast for Devil’s Day. The set up is alluring, and Hurley foreshadows with his poetic, confident prose. Every sentence is gem-like and rarefied, building tension and foreshadowing evil. Describing the Devil, “He was the maggot in the eye of the good dog, the cancer that rotted the ram’s gonads, the blood in the baby’s milk.” “But when he saw the animals decaying before his eyes and the blood dribbling from the wet-nurse’s teat, his nerve faltered and the Devil brought a blizzard to the valley that lasted for days.”Omens augur throughout the story, and now and then I was creeped out by the behavior of a disturbing child or a dark, murky memory. There were a few moments where I held my breath, but then it flattened out and blended into the background. That is how I felt the presence of the book—a finger that points to something intoxicating and ominous, but then it fades or deflates. The mounting tension between John and Kat becomes the focal point, but it is unsustaining when it weakens. The reader gets a sense of a guarded event that John is hiding, but then another event from the past becomes the locus of evil. Or is it?Wounds and buried secrets provoke and then sigh. The background and setting seem to rise from the primordial steam, like THE LONEY, but don’t coalesce into a riveting tale. Rather, it is a coming of age for the back woods, an evoked Stand By Me vibe that is more a portrait of an isolated, eccentric, and sad little valley that did surprise me at the end, past the disappointing denouement, but only because it didn’t seem credulous.If you haven’t read THE LONEY, read it! It’s a masterpiece. I think Hurley needed to get this one out of his system, and I’m still glad I read it, as the glistening prose kept me forging ahead. But it was more grimacing than grim, and malingering rather than moving.

She’s spot-on at mixing the clean and the messy, visually appealing characters with their urbane and often insouciant lifestyles, but never misses the humanity and poignancy that gives the story its heart. In her new novel, NORMAL PEOPLE, Rooney is like the anti-zeitgeist zeitgeist writer, or the anti-hip hip writer. I say that because the novel has a classical sensibility—third person pov, a love story of the wealthy, self-contained girl with the awkward, underprivileged boy, and the recall of manners novels of another era. But the author also textures it with a contemporary setting and modern angst. The years of post-crash Ireland, a wry tone, tacit gender equality that quivers with intimate power shifts.The lovers, Marianne and Connell, start their love story in high school, and are at cross-purposes, which is the main suspense and action that provides tension. Connell’s mother, a warm and loving woman, cleans houses for Marianne’s family (both are single mothers). Marianne’s brother is abusive and her mother dismisses her entirely. Although Marianne is from the elite family, this is a small town in Sligo Co. where her offbeat style is off-putting to her peers. Connell is a winning athlete and popular, and they begin their on-again, off-again romance in secretive fashion. Time passes with titles of Five Months Later, Three Months Later, or even a few days later, moving forward from 2011 to 2015, from high school on to college at Trinity Dublin. As the narration alternates between the pair, the background story fleshes out. The reader is in suspense as each time period begins, not knowing the status changes of their relationship until you are teased into it. The novel itself is largely interior, and the raw emotional and psychological energy is the story’s propulsive force. Yet, Rooney’s precise language and stripped down descriptions of place are yet amplified by the physicality of her prose.“At times he has the sensation that he and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronization that it surprises them both.”And the exposed, rough and yet tender description of the electricity between them is ongoing: “She was attuned to the presence of his body in a microscopic way, as if the ordinary motion of his breathing was powerful enough to make her ill.” Their relationship is often quiet, even when turbulent, a gale force between the two of them and a mystique to others. They confide in almost no one but themselves, even when they are off-again. A wall separates them, but when they penetrate it, there’s a shattering, like glass. But don’t expect a tidy ending—if you read CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS, you know it isn’t Rooney’s way. She’s more of a yin yang writer, with an ending that is somewhere in the middle of time and things and life.“From a young age her life has been abnormal, she knows that. But so much is covered over in time now, the way leaves fall and cover a piece of earth, and eventually mingle with the soil. Things that happened to her then are buried in the earth of her body.”...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Oct 02, 2018","Oct 05, 2018","Oct 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37539457-normal-people

Brodie Moncur is a 24-year-old handsome, educated gentleman, a first-rate piano tuner in Edinburgh,with perfect pitch and attention to detail. He has poor vision, though, and depends on his Franklin bifocals; otherwise the world appears “utterly aqueous.” When Brody’s boss at Channing & Co, a family-run piano shop, offers him a showroom managerial position in their Paris store in 1894, Brodie accepts. He offers an innovative idea to employ a pianist, John Kilbarron, known as the “Irish Liszt,” to play a Channon piano in concerts and hence boost sales. This leads Brodie to the love of his life--a tall, beautiful Russian opera singer--and thus to the main action of the story.Boyd’s novels tend to be genre-benders, and this is no exception. It is part romance, international adventure, classic drama, a bit of melodrama, and even shades of a play—or a Chekhov play. The epigraph is written by Chekhov’s widow, Olga Knipper. She describes a play that her husband intended to write in the last year of his life, in which the hero loves a woman “who either does not love him or is unfaithful to him.” This isn’t a spoiler for Boyd’s novel, only perhaps an inspiration for certain narrative flecks. But there are other Chekhov parallels—from “The Lady with the Dog” and Chekhov’s gun principle to a consumptive protagonist and a small but significant appearance of a Russian doctor, among many examples. I see most of the Chekhov allusions, however, as an aspect of the author’s playful wit, his levity that occasionally borders on farce. But Boyd’s use of the absurd is counterbalanced by an underlying poignancy, so intimate does the reader become with Brodie and his fate.Brodie is immediately smitten with Lika, Kilbarron’s sometimes-mistress, and feels “as if his innards were molten—as if he might melt in a puddle of sizzling magma on the floor.” Curiously, and I think this was the author’s intention, Lika remains inscrutable, inexplicable—not really three-dimensional EXCEPT from Brodie’s point-of-view. We see her through his eyes, not ours. In fact, she “stood at the very limits of both of the lenses of his Franklin spectacles—move and squint as he might, he still couldn’t bring her into focus.” The antagonist is John Kilbarron’s brother, Malachi, a truly old school villain who follows the couple “like a hell hound,” and is present at a duel that marks a turning point of the story.What kept me fastened to the novel was Boyd’s meticulous plotting and the deepening of Brodie’s troubles related to his constant love for Lika, despite the odds which would have driven most men away. He is committed to her despite threats to his life and his need to flee at intervals, and the stress it has on his tubercular health problems. The reader is sent on quite a journey—from France, to Scotland, to Russia—and then full circle where the novel opens with a prologue in the Andaman Islands in 1906.Many sections of the novel are like little short stories that could have theoretically expanded into their own separate narratives. One of my favorites is when the reader is installed at the Moncur family home in the Scottish Borders, with Brodie’s eight brothers and sisters and his fire-and-brimstone preacher father, Malcolm Moncur, a widower, perhaps an analogue of Malachi—a grim and sinister figure. The preacher acts despicably toward his children, especially Brodie, who Malcolm refers to as “you black bastard” and other racist images of Brodie’s coloring, which doesn’t match the rest of the family’s ginger complexion. Malcolm’s blackness comes from the heart-- “a dark singularity.” Brodie rejects religion as he rejects his father. Instead of blind faith to God, Brodie chooses the providence of blind devotion to Lika. The author expresses his narrative within the secular Chekhovian divination of love, art, time, and death. As Brodie is gazing into the guts of a piano, he reflects, “Mysteries—music, time, movement—reduced to complex, elaborate mechanisms.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 27, 2018",Oct 2018,"Oct 22, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38470168-love-is-blind

I am suspicious and picky when it comes to genre crime and police procedural books, as many tend to be gratuitous and boilerplate. My reason for choosing her this time had more to do with my recent trip to the Scotland Highlands and my wish to indulge in the setting again. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the author’s writing and story, as well as her well-articulated characters.In fact, Karen Pirie struck a nerve—a woman on top of her game in the police business, but personally grieving for a monumental loss--her boyfriend’s death. And, although this is my first McDermid book, I can confidently report that an inaugural Mcdermid reader can delight in this well-paced, thoughtful novel. You won’t feel that you forfeited anything that interferes with the thorough thrill of the story.The excitement essentially starts with a body in a peat bog, discovered when a couple was searching for a couple of Indian motorcycles that was buried by the woman’s grandfather during WWII. It’s fascinating that peat can preserve a body for decades—perhaps centuries, right down to the eyelashes. The found body (I won’t tell you how old the body was, although you learn early on) is one thread of many, as the story stitches together with plot and rotating time periods. The author admirably constructs a coherent story by stitching all these time periods together. And McDermid artfully includes a few subplots, which are seamlessly employed to add suspense, complexity, and deepen character.Equally impressive was McDermid’s handling of setting; I felt like I was back in Scotland again. The way she described the urban and remote, rural areas of the Highlands was virtually poetic. I didn’t expect this in a police procedural, but she installed me visually in Edinburgh, allowing me to recall the streets, hills, waterways, and architecture. And in other parts of the Highlands, she placed us in some sparsely inhabited and rolling hills, forested land, estuaries, lochs, and Firths. It gave me chills to read what I had once seen.The narrative pace is energetic yet unhurried, but I finished it in a few days as the story heated up. Not everything is tied up in a bow, either. A few strands may be followed up in the next book, perhaps twisted into a new vigorous plot. McDermid is obviously confident in her writing, and it shows in her ability to keep you guessing. Moreover, Karen Pirie's character has room to evolve. I felt her sense of mourning and loss, but also her strength and resolve to move forward and break from her interpersonal shell of grief. The story never gets stale or derivative. I look forward to her next book—it’s never too late to be a fan!...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Sep 15, 2018","Sep 18, 2018","Sep 26, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/39086134-broken-ground

On Shrove Tuesday, 1491, the novel’s There’s a tiny, isolated village in Somerset, England, separated from outsiders by a twisty river and no bridge. On Shrove Tuesday, 1491, the novel’s narrator and parish priest of Oakham, John Reve, is awakened by news that the body of the wealthiest villager, Thomas Newman, was sighted in the river’s fast moving current, before being swept away again. The only evidence of Newman is a green scrap of his clothing found in the bulrushes. Was this an accident, a murder, or a suicide? Samantha Harvey wouldn’t simply write a straightforward historical novel or mystery. She’s an unconventional (but accessible in her narrative immediacy) writer who reveals many layers of character while advancing her plot, as I learned in DEAR THIEF, a novel that centers on a woman writing to a childhood friend who stole her husband. Furthermore, THE WESTERN WIND is told backwards in time, from Shrove day 4 to Saturday, February 14th, day 1. This, to me, seals the contract of reader and writer, because the reader must actively attune and allow for the challenges that come with reverse telling. Like Reve, we want to know what happened. I experienced more than a few double takes. In the end, you will be mightily rewarded!In 1491, the Renaissance has not reached everywhere; this is the late Middle Ages in Oakham, replete with religion and superstition embracing a monumental part of everyone’s lives. Minor transgressions are confessed to John Reve, and he informs us that he has the only confession box in England, placed there to allow people slightly more privacy, but crudely built and offers minimal concealment. The priest is concerned about losing his flock, as many have been confessing privately to traveling friars. John is a complicated man, a priest with his own self-doubts and periodic crises of faith. To make matters worse, his superior, the unnamed dean, with “a nose for the nasty,” has traveled to the village to demand that the answer to Newman’s fate be concluded swiftly, offering to let whoever confesses to Reve (the dean thinks Newman was murdered) will be pardoned. The confessions that unfold are a large part of the novel.John thoughtfully examines the tragedy of Newman, who had new ideas and a plan to build a bridge that would liberate the villagers from confinement and poverty. Some other residents were indebted to Newman, or had indeterminate ties to him. Additionally, Reve is praying for a western wind to blow away the evil spirits. He worries that the prevailing eastern winds would give Oakham more to tremble about and suffer. Although told in first person, Reve is privy to most secrets, providing us with a window into everyone’s lives, an omniscience of sorts. However, there’s nobody but John to tell us about John. As character development goes, John Reve is the most rich and compelling. Although he is the most known to us, he is paradoxically the most ambiguous. Contemplative, witty, flawed, and compassionate, he knows all the secrets and how best to help others. But whom can he confess to? Is he a reliable narrator? Time reversed will reveal the facts and the author’s brilliance of swiveling time to get to the truth. And don’t worry that the prose will be medieval and stilted. Harvey evokes time and place in more atmospheric and indelible, visual ways, such as sights, smells, and sounds. Ball is played with a pig’s bladder and a drum out of goat hide. While the language is easily accessible, there is no question that you are in ancient times, with its textured period detail.“My heart beat, and beat again, and I thought: one day it will beat and not beat again. Then what’s in store for me? And the light undid itself, separating out the grain of the stone into a dull, disparate yellowish-grey, the texture of cloth before fulling. I’d forgotten to eat and was hungry.”...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Sep 04, 2018","Sep 08, 2018","Sep 20, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35277865-the-western-wind

Intelligent, layered, and If you enjoy an unconventional novel of family dysfunction and dynamics, this slim but substantial novel may be your cuppa. Intelligent, layered, and understated, THE SHADES is a psychological exploration of a family that is mourning the sudden death of a daughter/sister. Catherine and Michael, married for two decades, had two children, both inching toward adulthood. After Rachel, their eldest, died in a car accident thirteen months ago, Michael began spending more time in London, away from Catherine, with the handy excuse of his real estate work. Catherine, a successful art gallerist, retreated to their Hamdean home in the countryside. Their teenage son, Rowan, convinced his parents to send him to a liberal-arts boarding school. The family is not only isolated from each other geographically, but also emotionally. How do you heal after devastating loss, and unite as a family and look toward the future? Where do you find your sanctuary?The opening of the book is focused on another death—a young woman named Keira who has tumbled to her death from the roof of the Hamdean house. Previously, this waif had shown up unannounced, informing Catherine she lived there as a child. Catherine befriended Keira, mostly ignorant of her character, but drawn to her in some inexplicable way. While the police are asking questions, their query was “creating a circular conversation that would have been absurd had not the content and the morning’s events been so especially awful.” And who was Keira? Was she a stand-in for Rachel? Did Catherine invest too much emotional energy in her? What happened to lead to this young woman’s death? Whereas Catherine was drawn to Keira emotionally, Michael wanted to meet her to discuss the old blueprints of the house, the design of which changed since Keira lived there.Though not a straight-up mystery, either, there are complex features of this family that pique the reader, more so as the narrative progresses and the author drops clues--about Keira, about Catherine and Michael’s marriage, and about the events surrounding Rachel’s accident. Moreover, their son makes a stunning announcement, adding to the weight of his parent’s grief. Like the police with their questions, the mapping of the story itself is circular, and also reveals the hidden cracks like an ancient work of art with several underpaintings. As the story advances, so, too, does the peeling of layers, getting to the heart of guilt and blame, of fractious grief. At one point, during an agonizing dialogue between Catherine and Michael, a seed of understanding breaks through: “Don’t you think it’s a delusion to think that we have any control over what happens to our children? To treat them like a project with a prize for the ones with the best design? This is our hubris.” And it is hubris that interferes with their healing, creates ragged scars visible on the surface and digs at other old wounds that penetrate below.The prose is rich, textured, with every word well placed, sans excess. The ending isn’t neat and drawn within the lines. Families are messy; endings aren’t always tidy. In fact, it is certain to create endless debate between readers. The book is like a canvas with an overlay of fractured portraits, each providing a key to the family’s layers, none conclusive in themselves. If you like your endings unambiguous, don’t go near this book. It isn’t black and white here, but rather a contrast of shades. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 25, 2018","Aug 27, 2018","Sep 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36236098-the-shades

In lesser writGimme ShelterKingsolver established the Bellwether Prize for socially engaged fiction, which is a distinction she has mastered herself. In lesser writers, novels that envelop politics and social justice turn out to be static mouthpieces for the author, an authorial intrusion like a fist slammed into the story. But Kingsolver is a nuanced writer of realist fiction, and, like all her novels, UNSHELTERED fuses the struggles of society with a compelling story. The title here evokes the theme—not just physical shelter, but emotional and psychological shelter, too. Or lack of it. In a community called Vineland, in New Jersey, two parallel storylines take place in alternating chapters and centuries, both during cultural upheavals. Kingsolver mixes drama with levity, even in times of crisis, which she handles with evenhanded grace.The contemporary narrative takes place during the presidential primaries of 2016, and the second storyline during the late nineteenth century, which is partly inspired by actual historical characters. The present day tale covers the Knox family, a four-generation family living under one crumbling and collapsing roof, struggling financially and emotionally. While strident voices of corporate rich America promise walls and barriers, the Knox family is being torn down by unpaid bills, diminishing health care coverage, and a poorly constructed house.And, in the late 1800s, a teacher, Thatcher Greenwood, tries to educate his students on Darwin’s evolution, but is obstructed by the major landowner and the principal of the school, who fear the influence of this thinking on their credo of scripture and the preservation of the ruling class. Science is fine as long as one does not observe too closely. “These men think we need only declare ourselves Adam and Eve to recover all the fruits of Eden. Whereas an actual study of fruit pests does not interest them.” Meanwhile, at home, the Greenwood’s house is showing cracks, and the poorly built house is falling apart. And his social climbing wife and vapid mother-in-law are as much support as the house’s shredding beams.Willa Knox, a journalist, married her handsome Greek-American hunk, Iano, an academic, twenty-five years ago. They lived like nomads as Iano chased the fading dream of tenure. He found it, and then the school closed, and Willa had a nice job, until the magazine folded. Moreover, they take care of Iano’s ailing and rancorous father-in-law, and their son’s infant baby, as well as Willa and Iano’s forward-thinking and free-spirited millennial daughter, Tig. The idea of losing shelter for the family is unthinkable. Willa then looks to the past archives of Vineland to research their house, hoping it is found to be an historical landmark. Meanwhile, back in the 1800s, Thatcher, although a Kingsolver creation, finds an unlikely ally, the neighbor and biologist, Mary Treat, who is a true historical figure. Through their forays in the forest for all things scientific, Thatcher becomes braver and bolder and less fearful of his job or his shallow wife. He finds another unexpected friend in a newspaper editor that challenges the aristocracy and narrow-minded leaders of Vineland. As Mary says, “Truth is not ours to find within, but to search out. We study the known world in order to recognize the remarkable.”And it is both families, struggling to find peace, assurance, and shelter--several generations of needs and noise and loving and listening, what they share and how they differ, what they learn from each other and what they provide outside the house and recover--who grow to see the world through a different lens, and to look beyond their practiced way of thinking. Without a roof, there may not be shelter from the storm. But, “Without shelter, we stand in daylight.”...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Aug 17, 2018","Aug 24, 2018","Aug 18, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/37959904-unsheltered

It tThe City of Lights also has a dark history, and some of the effects of the past are illustrated within a fictional story in Faulks’ latest novel. It takes place largely during the contemporary years (circa 2006) and during the Occupation of France, specifically Paris and the Vichy government, during WW II. At that time, when Germany was in power, the French government cooperated with the Nazis, killing German enemies and rounding up Jews for deportation. The French Resistance was a brave and subversive organization, especially as the native French were in danger of being slaughtered by their own people if caught working against the Axis powers.There is also a murky past of Colonial Algeria, starting in the 19th century, which segued into the migrant movement of some Algerians to France. In this instance, instead of France being an auxiliary to another country (Germany), Algeria was an auxiliary to France under a variety of governmental systems, and bands of French-sanctioned Algerian groups, or Harkis, would kill their own people in submission to the French government. Eventually, there were uprisings of Muslim populations, fueled by the lack of autonomy, against the French people.I only include these (very simplistic) pieces of history because much of it is not only background and setting to PARIS ECHO, but, especially in the case of the Occupation in Paris, comes alive in vivid portrayals through the two protagonists. Hannah, a thirty-one-year-old American postdoc historian, returns to Paris for a second time, having left ten years ago after a failed love affair with a Russian playwright. She’s learned to subdue, even quell ideas of romance, in favor of immersing herself in history, a place she feels safely in control. But, when listening to 1998 recordings of Parisian women who lived in and witnessed the Occupation, she learns some horrifying information that threatens to undermine her emotional quiescence.Tariq, a nineteen-year-old Moroccan college student from Tangier, fluent in French but deficient in history, decides to run off to Paris to experience adventure. He had a romantic idea of Paris from movies and pictures he’d seen, but discovered that, for a poor black man in Paris, living the dream could be a nightmare. He was hoping to dig up some information on his half-French mother, who was raised in Paris. She died when Tariq was ten, before he could learn much about her past. Tariq has a talent for talking to anyone, and making friends easily, which eventually led him to Hannah. He soon became a lodger in Hannah’s apartment, and helps her with some tricky French translations in her research. While Hannah lives a circumscribed life in Paris, Tariq falls in love with the Metro, and becomes an adventurer, after all, riding almost all the lines and getting off on the most untouristy stops. He gets a job working at a fast-chicken eatery, and the Muslim immigrants he works with and an old man he meets on the metro become his best teachers of Algerian history.The narrative is slower paced than the satirical A WEEK IN DECEMBER, and the plot is generally thin. It’s told with an intellectual vibrancy, and the Paris streets and metro lines become almost a character in itself. Even the chapter headings are the names of metro lines. The energy in the novel turns primarily to theme—of identity; the tragic complicity of human life; forbearance; the search for love; and that history requires us to both remember and imagine. The ghosts of the past cross into the present and become Tariq’s personal Rubicon, when a photograph of an enigmatic and beautiful woman from the Resistance becomes transcendent and alive for him now. Faulks plays with history on several levels, achieving the idea that the past belongs to everyone, and we must come to terms with our own past, in order to move forward into the future.“I was bored…Who cares about history…? What’s the point of ‘remembering’ stuff that happened before you were born? We weren’t ‘remembering’ it, anyway. We hadn’t been there—neither had our teachers, nor anyone else in the world—so we couldn’t ‘remember’ it. What we were doing was ‘imagining’ it…And what was the point of that?” Tariq eventually confronts this in a most sublime way.As for Hannah, she must confront the sublimation of her past and stop living in the past if she wanted to engage actively with her life. In many ways, Hannah and Tariq assist each other to evolve.

Instead, like this one, her novels are character-based, and her style is often meditative. When something dramatic happens, it isn’t like a bomb going off, but rather like the bottom fell out. She does not pander to boilerplate blockbusters, or pad her story with popular platitudes. Thompson’s narrative is subtle, intelligent, with themes that compel you to examine our culture. Is your agency governed by choice or by decree? Does history determine your future? As women, are we bound to roles passed down by our mothers? How can we fix our lives when mired in a damaged, dysfunctional family? In this story of three generations of women, spanning over 80 years, the questions of legacy and expectations—both your own and your parents’—are addressed.Three generations of Wise women, in a small midwestern town, with their various ambitions and stifled longings, are keenly portrayed in this story. Evelyn, well educated, taught college during WW II, taking advantage of the vacancies when men went off to war. She was an unconventional thinker and assertive achiever who married late and had children even later. She capitulated to choices against her nature, and paid for it with growing resentment and ill-disposed mothering. Evelyn lived in the shadow of her husband—the conduct of the good wife, while she was devoured by custom and housework. Evelyn’s daughter, Laura, was unlike her mother; she was obliging and pliable and sought love and marriage. Eventually, she settled for an unruly and moody alcoholic, and took a backseat to his will. Her minor career offered meager satisfaction, and she tried to be the glue in her family. Laura coddled her self-destructive son and took her daughter, Grace, for granted; she expected Grace to be accommodating to the men in the family. Now in her twenties, Grace wants more for herself, but she’s stuck in a matrilineal legacy. She carries her burden with dread, and is caught in a battle of wills. The pace moves gently as the characters deepen and troubles increase, but there’s an urgency growling subtly beneath the narrative. It’s a pull and push, a tug of war, a war of the women in the quagmire of history.“And yet history shifted underneath your feet…The present was a dizzy perch that every so often began to spin and slide…You held onto your life with both hands, you told yourself to pay attention to this moment, the here and now. But one minute passed into the next, and at some point you looked back and everything was over and people called it history.”4.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jul 27, 2018",Aug 2018,"Jul 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38532222-a-cloud-in-the-shape-of-a-girl

In 1969, an The central motif of BITTER ORANGE popped out through its pungent prose, represented by a crumbling old manor on the English countryside. In 1969, an American businessman, Mr. Lieberman, bought the 1806 manse, Lyntons, (wrapped around the original 1754 brick one) and hired Londoner Frances Jellico to assess the the garden architecture, and another English expert, Peter, to report on the condition of the house and its fittings. It is evident that Lyntons was once grand and impressive. But things aren’t always what they seem. “…beautiful on the surface, but look a little closer and everything is decaying, rotting, falling apart.” As the novel opens in 1989, Frances is ill, bedridden, and talking about death and funeral plans with a visiting vicar. Frances has lost some of her short-term memory, but does recall that special summer in 1969, when she lived in the attic of Lyntons while appraising the gardens. Down one floor are Peter and Cara, the beautiful and enigmatic couple that entice Frances out of her grief from her mother's recent death and her social anxiety. Frances had been lonely and isolated, tending to her sick mother for a decade, with no real excitement in her life.That’s all about to change when Cara lures Frances with her gourmet cooking and beguiling banter, filling her up with stories of her and Peter’s travel and romance. The three of them drink through the hazy days of summer, courtesy of the well-stocked wine cellar. Frances, overweight and plain, routinely wears her dead mother’s girdle and bra to painfully rein in her loose flesh. But her attentive and flattering new friends galvanize Frances to feel confident and deserving, removing obstacles in her path, to joy and self-esteem.Eventually, the triad explores the minutiae of the property and discover every nook and cranny of Lyntons. Fuller’s descriptions are as intricate and serpentine as the estate and the trio alliance. Frances is swathed in the illusive—she has discovered a hidden telescope embedded in her bathroom floor that peers into Cara and Peter’s bathroom. The lens, however, provides a distorted view. The reader is enveloped in an unreliable narrator, and as the story advances, the plot thickens and gets incrementally more disturbing. My only complaint, if it is one, is that I figured out most of the secrets before the end of the first chapter. But most of my friends, close readers all of them, didn’t see it coming (which means I’m a genius! Haha)—so apparently it isn’t as obvious as I thought. It diluted the suspense, but not my engagement.

He is also a poet, which is evident in his peerless prose, his talent to give passages breadth beyond its edges, and collapse time, fusing the past and present to a distilled point, or an infinite one. WARLIGHT is his finest, most mature and polished work. “We find ourselves in a ‘collage’ in which nothing has moved into the past and no wounds have healed with time, in which everything is present, open and bitter, in which everything coexists contiguously…” This, to me, underscores the author’s storytelling style and fully realized achievement. Ontaadje delivers a profound story of storytelling.It is post-war London, 1945, and twelve-year-old Nathanial (Stitch) and his fourteen-year-old sister, Rachel (Wren) are left by their parents in the care of “The Moth”, Walter. “Ours was a family with a habit for nicknames, which also means it was a family of disguises.” Their parents are ostensibly going to Singapore as part of their father’s promotion, and the children soon lose the pattern of family decorum, as is noted in the first line of the novel, …”and left us in the care of two men who may have been criminals.” Nathaniel and Rachel feel abandoned by their parents, and navigate through adolescence without ballast.The Moth is a secretive presence in the house who periodically disappears for a few days at a time—“He was a man of many doors”—and soon others drift over, also, men and women of various eccentricities and serendipities. Nathaniel crosses the Rubicon into early adulthood by one especial guest, a former welterweight called “The Pimlico Darter,” who takes Nathaniel on adventures tinged with danger and transgression, involving greyhounds, mussel boats, and inscrutable deliveries. Moreover, The Moth sets Nathaniel up with entry level jobs at a hotel, where he meets a waitress who steals his heart.The reader will delightfully discover these adventures on his or her own, the mystery and uncertainty of adolescence. WARLIGHT appears to be the beginnings of a picaresque novel. But, with Ondaatje, you know you will soon enter territory both melancholy and profound. Nathaniel’s exciting adventures are rife with contrasts--the pervasive loss that the siblings feel in their separate ways, and the stark landscape of postwar ruin: “There were parts of the city where you saw no one, only a few children, walking solitary, listless as small ghosts. It was a time of war ghosts and grey, unlit buildings, even at night…”But with everything already said in my , I believe that the true scaffolding of this novel is something the author often plays with—the interplay of fact/memoir and fiction. In Cat’s Table, he even named the protagonist Michael, and wrote a disclaimer at the end that the book was fiction. WARLIGHT, though, is not a story of the author’s life, but rather the narrator, Nathaniel’s (he narrates most of the novel)—fiction through memoir through fiction through memoir, weaving throughout the novel. The fusion of memoir and fiction begins in part one, but is most evident in part two, when Nathaniel is twenty-nine, (and working in his mother's old trade, but from more of a distance). I wouldn’t call him unreliable, either, as he regularly signaled to the reader when he was recalling and when he was conjuring.“When you write a memoir…you need to be in an orphan state. So what is missing in you, and the things you have grown cautious and hesitant about, will come almost casually to you. ‘A Memoir is the lost inheritance,’ you realize, so that during this time you must learn how and where to look. In the resulting self-portraiture everything will rhyme, because everything has been reflected.”Ontaadje exquisitely shapes the turf between adolescence and adulthood, where the theme of duplicity and recollection, both true and false, dovetail his contiguous line between memoir and fiction, or autofiction. It was less of Nathaniel attempting to recall his youth as was his urgent need to know himself, and his ghosts, and especially his mother. “If a gesture was flung away in the past, you now see it in the possession of another. So I believed something in my mother must rhyme in me. She in her small hall of mirrors and I in mine.”Nathaniel’s desire to mine the past is manifested through Ontaadje’s various motifs of identity/self, and the vestigial symbiosis of the boy/man to his enigmatic mother, fostered by neglect, duplicity, and secrets. His prose often rejects the linear in favor of the (im)perceptible. “I think it was becoming clear that it was not just my mother’s past that had become buried and anonymous. I felt I too had disappeared. I had lost my youth.”Nathaniel was searching for who he was supposed to become, and attempting to qualify the person he is now, by braiding his memoir with his acute imagination, in order to arrive at an emotional truth, if not an historical one. The distance between past and present has collapsed in the vault of memories and meaning. “There are times these years later, as I write all this down, when I feel as if I do so by candlelight. As if I cannot see what is taking place in the dark beyond the movement of this pencil. These feel like moments without context.”My  is already too long; please excuse my impassioned need to examine and share. There’s just so much in this spare, stark narrative that captivated my reader’s heart. Ontaadje is not just a reader’s writer, but also a writer’s writer. There are no false moments or words in WARLIGHT, and no excess, either. The boy, adrift from a rightful intimacy, becomes a careful observer, and finally the adult “autofiction” writer. It will undoubtedly be my #1 novel of the year, and hopefully the Booker committee’s, also....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jul 20, 2018","Jul 23, 2018","Jul 20, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35657511-warlight

I’m not concerned with keeping the purity of Homer’s text, since Homer’s text, written subsequent to preceding oral traditions, demonstrates variants in characters and events—some minor, some potent. And, in the Western Canon, The Iliad has sparked many subsequent interpretations and re-imaginings. Some of the plot/themes of love, betrayal, friendship, pride, and the treatment of our enemies during wartime has inspired countless other novels that derive its essence from THE ILIAD. Barker evoked Briseis as privately independent of mind, almost like a modern heroine. Briseis, in Barker’s version, is as close to inwardly liberated as possible to contrast her inescapably enslaved conditions. I do believe that, in better hands, with more shaded prose, it could have worked. But her prose style was too heavy-handed and exposition-heavy, and had a shrilly tinge of adolescence. It felt more contrived, or over-the-top, constantly reminding us of Briseis’ power held in check. Her character, grieving for her murdered family, and passed around like a trophy, would understandably have carried rage and fear. But, in Barker’s version, Briseis conveyed the conflict--of her hidden persona with her necessarily outward servility--as a one-note repetition. I’m giving Barker props for writing a plot-generous page-turner, despite its flaws. She keeps the action going and the plot central. Briseis’ POV naturally limits the reader to what her character sees and hears (although, when it is convenient, Barker does use third person POV). For example, we don’t see the return of Hector by Priam to Troy, and most of the interventions of the gods are absent from the story, which doesn’t detract. Yet I do expect that the narrative of a classical text, one that is derived from a rich history of oral and performance traditions, (and one with many subsequent reinterpretations) to be literary.Perhaps I expected more, as Barker is a Booker Prize recipient. So I was surprised when this book read as more of a telegraphed and nearly Young Adult version (except for the graphic violence). I expected more subtle, allusive, poetic prose, although I do contend that there were select scenes with Achilles and his goddess mother that had a poetic lilt to them, and some of the descriptions of land and sea, and the border between them, showed me a glimpse of Barker’s more refined talents. But these were the exception rather than the rule. For me, there was minimal nuance or breathing space between the lines.The prose may not be a deal-breaker for some readers, so I urge others to make up their own minds. It has a definable arc, a forward flow, and a decent rhythm. Did it capture the essence of Homer or his story? For me, it felt derivative—and not in the inevitable way that stories with plot and themes inspired by THE ILIAD would necessarily be. Instead, it was corny; rather than expand on its predecessor (especially by rebooting with a female slave’s point of view), it diminished it (for me) by relying on familiar novels of desperate women in similar situations....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 18, 2018","Jul 19, 2018","Jul 19, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37969723-the-silence-of-the-girls

Our protagonist, Juliet Armstrong, vulnerable after her beloved mother’s death, was recruited into the MI5 in 1940, when she was just eighteen. Before she was mature enough to forge her own coherent convictions, she was trained in the art of duplicity, impenetrability; her individual identity was subsumed in her patriotic one. Now, in 1950, working as a producer for the BBC, and having left the Secret Service behind her, can she distinguish between her idealism of ten years ago and the person she is now? Through Juliet, Atkinson explores the weight of idealism and the psyche of selfhood, as well as the ghosts that confront your present with the choices of your past. As the protagonist muses, “And there was Juliet Armstrong, of course, who some days seemed like the most fictitious of them all, despite being the ‘real’ Juliet. But then what constituted real? Wasn’t everything, even this life itself, just a game of deception?”The title of the novel refers to Juliet’s main occupation in counter-espionage, to covertly transcribe the conversations of a motley group of Fascist sympathizers who think they are meeting weekly with an agent of the German government. However, these “fifth column” traitors are kept from spreading their “evil deeds” by one of MI5’s agents, an enigmatic man himself, who convinces these men and women that their cause is moving forward. Next door, Juliet is challenged by the ambient noise, a yapping dog owned by one of the members, and the limits of the listening devices that connect her to their voices. Sometimes, transcribing the conversations forces her to read between the lines.I recently finished Red, White, Blue by Lea Carpenter, an American novel that pairs the psyche and duplicity of spies with the grief that the protagonist suffers after the death of her father, who worked for the CIA. Both novels’ protagonists suffer loss of a parent, and the grief abuts their connection to the work of deception and patriotism. Although Carpenter’s character is not an agent herself, that novel bolstered my understanding in TRANSCRIPTION, to how idealism and identity are both hand-in-hand and adversaries.“That eager-to-please…girl, transmuted by bereavement, had gone. And, as far as Juliet could tell, she had never come back.” And, in her interview for the MI5--“It had been a lie, of course. Her mother hadn’t been well, not at all, in fact she had been dying,… but Juliet had preferred the subterfuge of her mother’s health.”Atkinson’s trademark levity, her droll wit and finesse, is consistently on display in TRANSCRIPTION. Although Juliet is often humorous and self-deprecating, her serious moments have teeth, and I could feel them biting at my back, both her fear and her determination. The ghosts from her past possessed a comic presence and a haunting undertone. The author seamlessly yokes the buoyant Juliet with poignancy and grit. Terror and danger is balanced with jaunt and nonchalance. The story also contains striking italicized phrases that pop out of Juliet’s thoughts--some of them like a refrain that periodically arise while gathering heat, others known by the reader to have meaning, and still others offhand at first, then carrying more sinister weight. Many phrases are cryptic, but you know they must be loaded, despite their insouciance. That is Atkinson’s exquisite nuance at work. They become like iron fillings collecting on the table—you know there is a magnet underneath. Atkinson kept me going from point to precipice.“It was the war…it has made refugees of us all.”...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jul 07, 2018","Jul 09, 2018","Jul 19, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36991825-transcription

What if a machine could tell you simple instructions to achieve it? “Eat tangerines,” “Arrange fresh flowers,” “Write poetry.” What if the pursuit of happiness became a guarantee? This theme is explored in Katie Williams’ debut novel, which takes place in 2035. The response from the public, surprisingly, is not unanimous. Sure, there are many individuals clamoring to buy happiness (if they can afford it), but there are people who are skeptical, others who prefer UNhappiness, and those that would prefer to cultivate it themselves without technological interference. How this plays out, and the effect it has on society, is the substance of this story.The protagonist, Pearl, makes her living as an “Apricity” technician, swiping people’s DNA, inserting it in the machine and reading the resulting recipe for happiness. Her wealthy ex-husband uses it for performance art, and their anorexic son refuses it, on the grounds that he is perfectly content to be unhappy, but uses it to help a friend in trouble. Other, secondary characters play a part in Apricity’s attributes, which raises intriguing questions as the narrative unfolds.It’s hard to pigeonhole this book into a genre, but speculative fiction covers the heart of it, and it quietly, and with a sense of disquiet, tells a tale through interlinked and overlapping stories, or chapters. Williams is a scintillating wordsmith; she creates lucid images and also entices us with her word etymology:“The word for ‘spell,’ as in casting a spell, comes from the same root as the word for ‘narration.’ This is evidence that ancient people believed language to be a sort of magic, the simple act of naming something akin to creating it, controlling it.”These little brilliant gems are peppered through the narrative, as well as passages that genuinely made my skin tingle. It was worth the read just for the succulent language. If you are looking for a book that hurtles inexorably toward a conclusion, to unify all the various threads into closure this is not that book. Ambiguity jettisons completion. I do take minor issue, though, that the end has more features in common with the ending of a chapter rather than a book. Then I read that the author is turning this into a series, which may explain a sort of lackadaisical finish, like a disappearance, as if the characters just walked off stage precipitously. Could the author have been deliberating the series while simultaneously writing the novel? I look forward to viewing the televised version, which may give more decisive action to the characters. However, I feel a certain artifice at work here—i.e. that possibly the outcome had less to do with ambiguity as an intentional novelistic device and more to do with jettisoning it to a different medium—television. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 27, 2018","Jun 29, 2018","Jul 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36435424-tell-the-machine-goodnight

Cultivation—that’s what humans do.”Geni’s latest and exciting literary thriller once again examines the liminal space between humans and wildlife, while depicting how compassion can mutate to corruption and danger. In this novel, Geni’s characters are not research biologists and strangers to each other, like in THE LIGHTKEEPERS. In THE WILDLANDS, her characters are four Oklahoma siblings orphaned by a Category 5 tornado, which destroyed their house, massacred their beloved horses and cows, and slayed their father. The trauma to the children have both shared and clashing impacts on their grasp of the future. The slaughter of life—both human and animal--has compromised their trust in benevolence, stripping them of faith in ordinary safety. The oldest, nineteen-year-old Darlene, a realist, wants to keep the youngest three together with her, and gives up college plans in order to put food on the table. Tucker, the only brother and second oldest, is more of the dreamer, and finds solace in the wild lands beyond their new and shabby trailer home. The youngest, Cora, age six, worships Tucker, who pays close attention to her and includes her in his forays to the fields and wildlife beyond. When he leaves the family and disappears after an angry dispute with Darlene, Cora is stricken. As in THE LIGHTKEEPERS, we begin to comprehend that our true self is often mirrored or altered by the behavior of the humans and animals that we love, protect, confine, exploit, or liberate. Three years later, Tucker returns with a vengeance and vocation against the injustices to animals by the public. He is on a quest to save the animal kingdom, who he believes are casualties of the human war against them. The bonds of family are tested to terrifying depths, while the pace-perfect, page-turning narrative, in Cora’s now mature voice, also explores the thin but overlapping border between man and beast.“This is the story of the summer I disappeared,” begins Cora, the first line after the prologue. And, as the pages turn, it becomes apparent that her disappearance is both physical and psychological, under a Svengali-esque influence, as her psyche is subsumed by events that tear the family apart and completely turn her identity inside out. I am hesitant to say more, since I don’t want to ruin even the small discoveries meant for the reader’s eyes.Part eco-thriller, part suspense thriller, and part domestic thriller, THE WILDLANDS cuts across genres and keeps you emotionally riveted to the characters and plot. The prose is lyrical and poetic, compelling me to re-read passages and paragraphs just for their force and hypnotic beauty. The description of the tornado alone is harrowing and filled with magnificent terror.

The primary theme was about family—the ones you are born with and the ones you create, as well as the redemptive power of the human spirit. Boyne’s prose is warm, accessible, thoroughly engaging, and page-turning. He manages to fuse the métier of writing literature with the pacing and excitement of mainstream storytelling, without forfeiting originality or artistic expression. A LADDER TO THE SKY, a suspenseful novel about the art of writing, will captivate old fans and engender new ones. You’re in for a treat by a sinister villain, Maurice Swift, who possesses a virile magnetism and a narcissist’s nature.The book covers 1988 to the present, from Berlin to London to NYC, and honorable mention of other European cities. Each section includes Maurice, who is aspiring to become a towering, celebrity author and distinguished literary prizewinner. It doesn’t take long to conclude that this ambitious writer is a textbook narcissist. He is also a physically beautiful creature, which works in his favor to manipulate the men and women he encounters and becomes involved with throughout the story.I think of the narrative anatomy as resembling a fully open circle of a folding fan. In the rivet pin is Maurice Swift, with the cast of characters assembled around him like the connecting leaves. The story pivots around Maurice. The titled chapters and sections cover the core people in Swift’s life chronologically, and whatever happened earlier or offstage is nimbly incorporated into the story.One of my favorite scenes starts in the first hundred pages. It’s almost a meta- interlude of writers on writing, with some casual celebrity name-dropping that Boyne must have winked while he wrote! Maurice’s character is still in the infant stages of success. He’s invited with an author-benefactor to the Amalfi Coast to visit Gore Vidal, who, as written by Boyne, does a scintillating cameo. It is soon apparent to Gore that he may have met the younger version of himself. The barbed dialogue between Gore and Swift drolly exhibits their competition, but Gore has wisdom and experience on his side. At one point, after besting Maurice, Gore relished the response on the young man’s face, but was unable to interpret it precisely. “Why, he thought, he could write a thousand words on that expression alone.”This juicy and dazzling novel gripped me right at hello, but candidly speaking, the middle section began to trouble me at times. After such a nuanced opening, it became too predictable and on the nose. Maurice’s cunning became familiar, permitting me to anticipate his stealthy moves, especially with the aid of some heavy-handed foreshadowing. It seemed below Boyne’s refinement as a writer. But I’m not complaining anymore, and I can’t tell you why. But, if you feel that happening to you while reading, just go with it--you won’t be disappointed. Boyne is ultimately wise and wily.A LADDER TO THE SKY is a tightly focused, well plotted, page-turning story and cautionary morality tale that demonstrates that Boyne is not limited as a writer. Invisible Furies had a consummately winning Irish setting and expanding number of characters (despite some key departures to Europe and the US), but it kept its parochial color, even as the backdrop became more sophisticated. Ladder, however, is almost entirely urbane, cinematic, tailored for American film. No complaints, however. I’m already casting the characters and selecting the director of my choice.

The boundary between doctor and patient that is taught in academics is difficult to uphold when surrounded by harrowing injuries, sickness, and death, day after day after day, for months and even years. The psychological damage to all concerned corresponds remarkably to the physical environment of things such as wounds, amputees, lice, typhus, and pneumonia.Lucius Krzelewski is from a wealthy Polish family and was born and raised in Vienna, but seeks a way out of his sheltered and pampered life, and decides to study medicine. In 1915, during the Great War and after six semesters of medical school, Lucius enlists, expecting to be sent to a garrison hospital with four or five doctors and a full staff of nurses. Instead, during the winter, he is deployed to a sub-zero temperature field hospital, where they “patch and send” the patients, in the Carpathian Mountains. Here in this outpost, Lucius is confronted with a church-turned-hospital that has been without a doctor for months, and maintains only one nurse, a Polish nun, Sister Margarete, an excellent nurse who has been functioning as surgeon, nurse, and triage specialist. She becomes Lucius’ teacher, as he has never even held a scalpel before. They soon are learning from each other, and together with their patchwork of orderlies and a cook, make an admirable team, considering the scarcities of fundamental tools and medicines of the trade.Lucius is forced to practice limb removals much like a butcher or, at best, a veterinarian, due to the very limited supplies and modalities at his disposal. The “hospital,” when not redolent of disease and death, is punctuated by the smell of creosote, lime, and carbolic acid, the main weapons they have against germs, lice and typhus. In this subpar facility, with punishing winters and scant modern supplies, they must make snap decisions and use their imagination and skills to save lives. The central character—the one the novel is named for—is a man brought in by wheelbarrow from the field. He doesn’t talk, and he is in a quasi-fetal position. There are no visible wounds and—alas!—no need for amputation. This new patient and how to treat him consume Lucius, who determines that he has “nerve shock.” These were the years before PTSD and shell shock diagnoses; however, these kinds of patients had been observed during wartime, with a unique and specific set of symptoms. And it is the nexus of doctor, nurse, and especially this patient that propel a large part of the story.Daniel Mason, an author and psychiatrist that has studied the influence of culture, literature and history on the practice of medicine, captures the intersection of war and field medicine in all its horror and humanity. He possesses a formidable talent for describing the acute moments of human tragedy in wartime, and the melancholic ravages that it subsequently inflicts upon those who experienced it firsthand. Writes Lucius in a letter, “Now, with each day that passes, I feel more and more like some of my soldiers, who seem forever stuck in their eternal winters.”War heightens emotions, as survival is uncertain and dread is the norm. This is illuminated in Lucius’ story, which is underscored with the search for love among the ruins, as well as redemption, atonement, and forgiveness. This novel is a slow burn, just as a previous book by Mason, “The Piano Tuner,” was (fans of this book must read it!), and patience for the reader is worth the journey. Moreover, even in this dramatic setting and story, the author provides gallows and subversive humor, and a pitch perfect and unpredictable ending that is worth the wait. Mason’s character portraits are granular and original—no cutouts here, not even in minor characters. His prose is eloquent, with an intimacy that installs you in every crisis, in every conflict. He spares no images of war, but it is never gratuitous. It's as razor-sharp, incisive, and penetrating as a surgeon's scalpel.This will surely be in my top five reads of the year....more",Notes are private!,1,29,1,"Jun 21, 2018","Jun 24, 2018","Jul 05, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37946436-the-winter-soldier

She is a luminous and compelling figure, whose father, Noel, a former CIA operative, died on the eve of her wedding, literally (and then the wedding was delayed). She seeks answers and a truth to the lacunae of her life. But like the design of the CIA operative, these truths are often buried in a nesting-doll assembly, with many layers and classifications that are formidable to access.Carpenter’s new book feels very intimate, despite its existential, non-linear style of time, action, memories, and reflections. The answers for the reader are often in the narrative juxtapositions, and in the book’s considerable white spaces between passages. The text fluctuates, and in lesser hands would be inchoate, but Anna is so central to all the facets of story that I always felt grounded in her character. It can jump to a father’s lesson on koans to a section on China Ops and yet there is a tensile thread that keeps it all from being desultory. There isn’t one excess word or event in this book.After her father dies, Anna receives a USB in the mail from her father’s close friend, a colleague in the CIA. Anna feels a kinship with this man, who also loved Noel (like a father). On the USB are videos that don’t coalesce at first, but contain an overarching motif that parallel Anna’s questions and answers. There’s a section on the “parlor trick” of polygraphs; the matter of China; a woman important to Noel (Anna’s father) and the unnamed sender, and a running story of their work, or its climax. And, a running leitmotif is a video called “Rooms,” that reveals rooms, or compartments, on the question of Heaven and God, but also understanding and forgiveness. These are pieces of the whole picture that Anna ponders, and the narrative returns to these rooms and also compiles other seemingly arbitrary ideas that are actually germane to Anna’s quest. Memories of cooking with her beloved father, or discussing philosophical ideas with him, and life lessons he imparted to her.This absorbing novel reads equally like an unfinished memoir and an unfinished spy/CIA story, yet complete in the transaction between author and reader. I closed the book satisfied, and realized that part of the narrative’s purpose was for Anna to just keep digging for meaning in the disparate strands of her life, the loose jigsaw pieces that yet contain connective tissue. And how, through those connections, she can finally feel whole and also part of that larger life outside herself.The epigraph of Red, White, Blue is from an essay written by Norman Mailer, an obvious precursor to his masterpiece of the psychology and sociology of the CIA (and it is evident that Carpenter read the book). She quotes from Mailer: “We do not know which of our facts are bricks and which are papier-mâché painted to look like bricks.” “We will not get the goods so quickly as we will learn how to construct a model which will tell us why we cannot get the goods.” I don’t often quote from the epigraph of a novel, but in Carpenter’s theme, it seems pertinent to understand that the characters here are grappling with the limits of knowledge and how the art and aesthetics of deception can be proximate to truth, (and, it isn’t too much of a leap to consider how it may annex the truth).“If you are not comfortable with hypocrisy you can leave right now” is one determining factor of job fitness as a CIA agent. “The truth will set you free…” “…if the truth approves of your exit plan.” Welcome to the CIA, and to life—full of paradoxes. If you enjoy a good paradox, or several, as part of the mining process to understanding, then you’ll laud the poignancy of this masterful, astonishing novel. Exploring and examining grief, loss, and love side by side with the CIA is ambitious, and fully realized here. And, for me, Anna will remain unforgettable....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 20, 2018","Jun 21, 2018","Jul 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37007774-red-white-blue

Andrea Kleine’s new novel focuses squarely on the adults that they become, and their family members, and how others perceive them. Does childhood trauma underscore your life as an adult, does it ruin you, does it DEFINE you? These themes are explored with purpose, and within an intense and absorbing storyline, never reducing or simplifying the ramifications of the trauma itself (which we know as PTSD). A stranger abducted Hope and her half-sister Eden when they were teens. The experience they shared is gradually unraveled poignantly over course of the book. For decades, 35-year-old Hope, a mostly failed playwright, has not seen or heard from her sister. Over the years, Eden and her family, including Eden’s hippie-commune mother, has lost contact with Eden. But, after becoming dislocated and jobless, and provoked by a call from the DA that the perpetrator could be released soon unless he can be tied to another crime, Hope embarks on a vision quest to find her half-sister. The road trip begins in Hope’s father’s old and temperamental camper, and leads her on a journey to people from her past, and to unwitting strangers, all who play a part to help crack open both repressed and obscured insights buried within her. Tying her experiences and the disparate and sometimes desultory clues together is as complicated as Hope is complex. Her ex-girlfriend thinks that Hope fetishizes this event as a way to prevent moving forward, and her father suggests that Hope is wasting her time, and should just finally grow up. But he is paralyzed with guilt and blame. Often, Hope perceives that everyone has moved on except herself, but also notices how trivial or guarded they are. There are few people she can trust, like her suicidal, drug addicted, and successful and celebrated artist friend, Zara. She told her, “...you decided your life was about writing plays and trying to get at the truth of something…And now that’s who you are. You’re sort of like a junkie. You use what’s in front of you to pay for you fix.” When Hope asks her what she’s addicted to, Zara responds, “To continuing.”Hope continues the journey, her labile thoughts contained but directing her. If you are looking for easy answers or a bow to tie this up, you’ll be disappointed. On the other hand, Kleine’s window into making sense of your past, written in frank but forgiving prose, explores how art intersects with life and conveys sharp insights about trauma, attachment, and memory....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 17, 2018","Jun 19, 2018","Jun 26, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35721129-eden

That is all that Helen Franklin, an English scholar living in Prague during contemporary time, knows about this ancient essence that plagued an old dead man, Joseph Hoffman. Her friend Karel, an academic at the university, asks Helen to read a document left by Hoffman. The dipped-ink document contains narratives, letters, and journals that all mention Melmoth, a beleaguered creature that frightens and follows others. The legend of Melmoth unravels gradually as the plight of different characters, some as far back as 500 years ago, is inevitably revealed.Like the sea serpent in THE ESSEX SERPENT, Perry writes again in gothic, mystical tones about a creature that appears to both mesmerize and control the fears of others. ESSEX SERPENT took place in the late 1800s, but with glimpses of modern times to come, and is often lively and warm. MELMOTH is a novel taking place in the 21st century, but is written in a tone and atmosphere that evokes an austere, ancient era.Don’t expect the romantic and charming characters of the latter book; Melmoth is a grim novel about gloomy characters in a bleak setting. While reading, I felt the frost settling densely in my limbs. Don’t look for much to uplift, other than a gallows humor that is both frightening but scintillating. Perry’s way with words to construct images and surreal transmutation is never more ambitious and effective than in this tale, by turns harrowing and haunting, and inescapably gripping.Melmoth is part of old legend, according to a library book found by Helen. It describes an itinerant and doomed woman in dark rags, appearing out of nowhere, arising from the dust, with large liquid eyes that can cut like knives, and a tortured face. Those that she follows feel her presence like a spectral shadow, a heavy weight, or a light, eerie touch at the back of their necks. And why were they chosen?These unforgettable characters that populate the book range from the repressed to the grotesque to the damned. Helen chooses to live a half-starved life, ascetic in her habits, emotionally distant. “’I sometimes think that one great emotion is never very far from all the other ones. Best to avoid them entirely, if possible.’”Helen's only friends are Karel and his wife, Thea. Thea, a former social, highbrow raconteur, has withdrawn to her wheelchair in her house, isolated after a debilitating stroke. Karel is now self-pitying and depressed, his only interest the Hoffman document. Helen’s hag-like roommate, Albína Horáková, a shrewish centenarian, is intrusive and slovenly, wearing heavy fabrics stained with the accumulation of her sour meals, and always nosing around in Helen’s privacy.And what of the enigma of Helen, so aloof and obscure?

She liked it, because she made good money and could buy drugs, get high, and the money helped support her son, Jackson (who is now seven). Romy won’t see him anymore, though, because she is serving two life sentences plus six years. This is mostly a narrative about Romy’s life in prison, and her thoughts, and the claustrophobic existence she lives and breathes now, and her granular memories of life before. She got a raw deal, although she did live a life of crimes and misdemeanors. “I was assigned a public defender, We were all hopeful things would go differently. They did not go differently. They went this way.”The novel flows with gallows humor—I would almost call it gulag humor. This is no Orange is the New Black. The women don’t have white teeth and shining hair. They don’t have hope beyond the walls, either. But they do form a family, of sorts, with each other.Romy is an intelligent woman, never had a break. But didn’t much look for one, either. She threw the opportunities away and aimed low, but you’ll empathize with her. She’s so human, and doesn’t deserve to be treated like an animal, just because she lived an animal existence before, and didn’t really spend meaningful time doing meaningful activities. She did have a boyfriend and a hideous stalker. She unpacks her life in bits and pieces, but it all fills in within the cracks and scars.Romy muses on San Francisco, the city that outsiders think is lovely and exciting and fun. For Romy, it is not. She grew up here with her mother, and is not sentimental. “The city to us was clammy fingers of fog working their way into our clothes, always those clammy fingers… The city was wet feet and soggy cigarettes at a rainy kegger in the Grove.” Her mother took care of Jackson when Romy went to jail, her mother the chain-smoking German that named Romy after a German actress who told a bank robber on television that she liked him. A lot. Well, you get the picture. Romy expands that picture in her contracted world.This isn’t a face-paced novel, but the pages turn with a grainy 8 mm-like visual and a steady, sinuous rhythm. The plot is just enough to have a bit of an arc, but mostly it is a portrait of different kinds of grim restriction—imposed by the self or the system. There’s a number of very colorful and sinister people, and then there’s the femaile prisoners who are lifers caught up and damned by the prison system.Then there’s Gordon, a paid English teacher that works in the prison and who forms a constricted connection with Romy. They share a love of literature and loneliness. He gave up a more trapped academic life with attachments to live in a remote, isolated cabin, where he reads Thoreau and observes the natural world.Gordon gave up a girlfriend who he was glad to sever from his life, because women with need incited his escape instincts. “You had to mask your own ambivalence and pretend to be in love one hundred percent of the time, and he’d rather swim in a lake of hellfire.” But the remote life doesn’t necessarily expand his mind and calm his soul. Instead, things just become more skewed and he becomes more confined in his thoughts.Kushner has written three very different novels. She’s that rare author that also has more than one writing style, but many of her characters are fighting oppressed or reduced circumstances. She also finds these intriguing niches of humanity—a cabaret dancer, an anarchist, a French agitator, a woman biker, avant garde artists, poseurs, and others who dazzle the pages. And her main protagonists, like Kushner herself, are acute observers. In THE MARS ROOM, I felt as if I were seeing with Romy’s sharp and weary eyes.

Its haunting prescience conviSUPER SAD TRUE LOVE STORY, Shteyngart’s 2010 dystopian masterpiece, will remain one of my 50 favorite books of all time. Its haunting prescience convinced me that technology and social media had already dominated and intruded on our lives to chilling, sinister effect. Some of it is already dawning—the way we can destroy lives with Facebook or Twitter is just one example of the way we live now. LAKE SUCCESS isn’t quite as epic, and although there is a nod to the dystopian—just a sprinkle--this is largely a story of the divisive present.A wealthy, educated, but severely dysfunctional couple splits up. Barry Cohen is a successful investor, a secular Jew who made it rich through his adamancy and timing, but right now his wealth is being challenged by an SEC investigation. His wife, Seema, a beautiful first generation American, was a law school grad who gave it all up. Their three-year-old son, Shiva, has recently been diagnosed with autism and is on the extreme end of the spectrum—-non-verbal; poor eye contact; displays no affection; unable to play with others; and barely plays at all.Shiva (which means destroyer) essentially cleaved their perfect family fantasy. Three children, three high-end separate sinks—that was Barry’s dream. And Seema insists that nobody know about Shiva’s diagnosis—not even her parents or their closest friends. They sequester Shiva away from everyone and keep the truth locked up with the childcare assistant they hired and all the professionals that the government will provide.Barry decides, in an impulsive moment of desperation, to abandon his credit cards, iPhone, business, and family to take a Greyhound across the country and find his college ex-girlfriend. He decides to live like a pauper and make it on his resources of contrived charm and canny goodwill. The author’s absurdist portrait of Barry’s fundamental blind spots (of which there are many) had me laughing, squirming, and wanting to slap him upside the head. But, on the other hand, Barry’s recessed humanity eked out in some of the most surprising moments, like helping a socially awkward but genius young boy come out of his shell. Barry may be too self-deluded, egotistic, and self-indulgent to be authentic with himself and others at this point, but there are disarming moments when his fury and pathos collided and touched me truly, madly, deeply. Like when he tried to help others he thought less fortunate, even if his moves were calculated and self-centered. Shteyngart’s finesse of human comedy and tragedy slips sideways with absurdity, and shimmies in a calypso odyssey, while Barry lurches toward his darker nature and the bus chugs and rattles across the dustier parts of America.In the meantime, Seema embarks on an affair that Shteyngart brilliantly portrayed to squeamish an awkward effect. Her downstairs neighbor, a published poet and novelist, steps in to capture Seema’s heart, even while his wife makes a surprising and heartfelt transformation to Seema’s life. As Barry and his estranged wife continue on separately, we wait tensely for the penny to drop. Along the way, a vivid cast of drop-in and secondary characters kept me hooked to the narrative. I wasn’t installed and engulfed like I was during Super Sad. I wanted to feel like a passenger on the bus or contained in Seema’s apartment and New York streets, but I was nevertheless on board for the ride of the Cohen’s lives. Moreover, the author has done his research on autism; Shiva was flawlessly credible. In lesser hands, this “Trump World” backdrop would shriek its cautionary tale counter-message. But, Shteyngart is a master of turning tirades into sensibility, and existential dread into wisdom. The characters, not the author, own their political rants and righteous indignation. The themes don’t pontificate on politics. It’s all about Barry and Seema, and how “the best fiction is the fiction of self-delusion. It contrasts the banality of our self-made fiction against the hopelessness of the world as it really is.” But still, there may be hope.

It welcomed me in like aI just fell in to this heartbreaking, bittersweet, memorable debut right from the first melancholy, artlessly graceful pages. It welcomed me in like an open claim to my spirit. That’s what it felt like to read Higdon’s novel—as if this story was whispering in my ear, lovingly and generously sharing its deep wounds and yawning grief, its tightly wound trauma and loosely held desires. Love, shame, loss, lust, pain, exile, solace, and secrets all resonate through beautifully wrecked characters and a vividly woodsy but distressed landscape in British Columbia, 1967, and stretching through forty more years. Lulu Parsons is ten years old when her mother disappears at the same time as their neighbor, Mrs. McFee. Lulu finds a note her mother, Bette, left and buries it, hiding it from her four older brothers and her father, a note that states that her mother doesn’t want to live in a “tarpaper shack for the rest of my life.” As the years pass, hope gets thin or lost for some, but bidden for a few, such as Lulu’s older and lower functioning brother, Geordie, Lulu’s closest confidante other than Nadine, her best friend. Life goes on but memories can still shatter and shade their childhood and hover near their futures. Bette’s sister, Aunt Kat, comes to live with them, but is welcomed warily. Mr. McFee, the husband of the missing Mrs. McFee, looms large as a major force in Lulu's life.Nadine and Lulu collect bottles for a penny and share their longings. As for Geordie, Lulu and her favorite brother listen attentively to each other and play with abandon in the woods, fields, and rural roads. Lulu has a strained relationship with her brother, Trevor, who keeps a few secrets of his own, and takes off to lead a self-destructive life of hardship and addiction. But we know that early on, as time in this novel has a way of rocking gently back and forth, enfolding and unfolding with powerful ease and confessing, unearthing, and exposing its secrets gradually, and sometimes forcefully, like nature and its seasons on this landscape of sharp winds, bright diffuse wildflowers, tall, concealing trees, and rocky scattered streams that blend with the narrative voices. The novel is bound with its topography and industry, and the author allows for many adventurous scenes that interact with the natural and industrial world, alternately merciless and penitent.“The wide Fraser River rolled beneath the bridge. Tugboats pulling booms of logs and fishing boats hung with heavy nets churned up the brown water, leaving white swaths behind them. Speeding motorboats stitched the big boats’ trails together with their own thin wakes. Sometimes, if you were in the narrow right-hand lane heading into New West, you could hear a train clacking along below on the railway bridge that ran underneath the Pattullo.” And within this enigmatic, harsh and humming backdrop, human voices echoed its time stamp, or its timelessness.Lulu’s chapters are told in first person, and alternate with third person POV chapters that focus on Doris Tenpenny, the mute, literature-loving egg seller who everyone tells their secrets to—well, most everyone. She and Lulu share a secret of survivorship, both damaged by a sick abuser, but the damage that was done makes it hard for them to cross invisible barriers to help each other. Doris and Lulu survive their ordeals differently, but the force of experience ties them together, separately.Even through the painful personal stories of all involved in the Parsons and Tenpennys private or shared grief, I never felt suffocated, as Higdon’s prose was delicate, undulating, lyrical, and finessed. How does she do it? Her passages and paragraphs are nuanced, and her characters’ emotions are expressed lightly but leave an indelible print. “From the bridge, you could see forever. …To the right, Woodlands and the B.C. Penitentiary loomed on the hill over the river. I’m not sure I knew which was which back then.

Doris stays near home, in a place where Lulu can come to, also. But that’s another chapter for the reader to discover.I found a quiet, unhurried, (and sometimes unsettling) retreat between these pages. It is rare for a debut author to create such a balanced and evocative novel—both disquieting and satisfying--that unfold with such composure, without seeming composed. The words gave meaning to the silence and spaces between them, and the silences gave thunder to the themes.This will undoubtedly be on my top ten of the year. Although a part of me would like for the author to continue this story in a follow-up (sequel?) book, on second thought, I think it may spoil the unspoiled territory of this unforgettable tale.

North Korea was such an abstract concept to me, until Adam Johnson’s masterpiece novel and Pulitzer winner, The Orphan Master's Son, in 2012. It shook me to my knees, and gave the elusive, corrupt leader, Kim Jong-il, and his subjects—the people of the country--real substance. Like Johnson, author D.B. John has visited North Korea and spoken at length with defectors, and used his imagination to create a visceral portrait of truth through fiction. It was like stepping right into the shoes of its characters, especially the native ones. This nail-biting thriller doesn’t let up for a minute, even during its quietest moments.There are three storylines that comprise the novel. Jenna Williams, a thirty-year-old American scholar of history who joins the CIA when recruited, in hopes of finding her twin sister, who was abducted 12 years ago from a South Korean beach when attending classes for a summer program. Jenna and her sister are children of a Korean mother and African American father. In the novel, she is sometimes more noble and heroic and just “more” than any one human contained, but it served a purpose to not only propel the story, but also to show the odds that were at stake.The more granular and compelling characters are two North Koreans that fulfill the other two storylines. Lieutenant Colonel Cho of Pyongyang, doting father to child nicknamed Books and loving husband to his wife, was adopted years ago when he was too young to remember his biological parents. However, a background check is coming in order to allow his promotion and coming diplomatic mission to the US. If his natural parents were considered enemies of the state, it will pass on to him, with dire consequences. His story is utterly nail-biting as we follow him through truly dark waters.The third thread of the story concerns an aging woman named Moon, who lives with her husband in what appears to be a more restricted area of North Korea, filled with poverty and hungry souls. They are at the mercy of guards and police who use intimidation and merciless punishment to keep them compliant. Over the course of an event, Moon is lured into a more or less black market place where trading is done for extra money or food, and she soon becomes a resourceful leader in this fringe community. Danger and fear keep them occupied, and a few of the traders are up to some behaviors that could bring everyone near death’s door—or at least to harsh work camps in caught.As the different plot threads alternate, the propulsive action of the book keeps the reader—and the characters—on their toes. The corruption, menace, and peril in North Korea is almost like a character in itself. If the people don’t fully capitulate to the great Dear Leader, or show any kind of transgression on their faces, life will turn to a hellish nightmare. Even if you were never interested or knowledgeable about anything North Korean beyond the few sightings in media, at the end of the novel you will feel exuberant and breathless. The themes are universal—survival and a chance for a better future—as well as loyalty, betrayal, and family. The pages will fly from beginning to end.4.5 stars rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,13,2,"Mar 20, 2018not set","Mar 23, 2018not set","Apr 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36723261-star-of-the-north

Miller book to read—the one that preceded this one, NORWEGIAN BY NIGHT, featuring forty year-old section chief Sigrid Ødegård of the Oslo police department. Both novels take place in 2008, but of crimes that are entirely different. Miller’s last novel, THE GIRL IN GREEN, was one of my favorites of 2017, as he transports us to the Middle East during wartime 1991 and then 22 years later, focusing more on the perception, influence, and insanity (and sometimes inanity) of the media. Miller has a knack for juxtaposing the horrific with the absurdist, which in turn makes the story even more poignant. AMERICA BY DAY focuses on a police investigation, and again, like a dart, he targets perception vs. the truth. In this case, saliency with high profile cases that involve race in America, and then contrasts it with the Norwegian approach of catching a criminal. But, there’s also a universal link to police instincts in crises that turns a bit of the contrasting theories on their heads. Sigrid is compelled by her father to go to the US, specifically, upstate NY, to locate her possibly missing older brother, Marcus, an adjunct professor that has been teaching there for the past 20 or so years. Sigrid is plagued by events that have distanced her and Marcus from each other. She also just went through a stressful event on the job, and longs for some time away from work.Sigrid’s arrival in the US is so spot-on—her absorption of American manners, culture, and procedures is so observant, witty, and thoughtful that I was reminded that I am in the hands of a writer that sees the world with subtly acute and intelligent eyes. She is thrown together with the philosophical sheriff Irv Wylie, with a background and master’s degree in Divinity. Rather than narrowing his focus on religion, his studies has given him a savvy skill set for understanding human behavior, and the ability to pierce the pernicious side of institutional conduct and racism that he is forced to withstand. Together, these two provide the reader with the wittiest clash-of- cultures banter you can hope for. On approaching crime-solving, Sigrid points out that Americans tend to quickly create a hypothesis and then work their way back to prove it, whereas her approach is slower, more exploratory, without presumption, and based on evidentiary facts. It is only when these are collated that you can connect the dots. In her estimation, doing things right is what speeds things up. As Irv notes, …”it’s most true when people care about the results. Usually they don’t, though. They care about perception, and it’s easier to perceive something in motion, and fast is more exciting than slow… They want conclusions that make them look good.”Miller commands this page-turning narrative with both open generosity and restraint. He allows his characters to win us over with their resilience, flaws, vulnerability, and humor, but the author doesn’t impose any political or social views of his own. In fact, he steers clear of giving us pat answers and instead we feel the burden of doubt and incertitude to any system, community, or institutional philosophy. Irv understands that the American culture of individualism embraces performance, to a fault, and the quest for achievement can be blind to justice for all. And Sigrid learns that uncertainty has its place, and stepping blind into the fray has a nervy legitimacy, too. What the reader comes away with is an exuberance and optimism for the human spirit....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Mar 21, 2018","Mar 23, 2018","Mar 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35721120-american-by-day

This is her second novel focusing on a Hemmingway wife. In THE PARIS WIFE, the story revolved on Hadley, Hemmingway’s first wife and their life mostly in Paris. In her last book (and my personal favorite), she took a break from Hemmingway and featured Beryl Markham, the first aviator to fly solo and non-stop across the Atlantic, east to west. This latest novel centers on Martha Gellhorn, third wife of Hemmingway, and one of the most intrepid war correspondents of the 20th century and a solid novelist and short story writer. Their relationship and fallout—their private love and war—is told amidst the international wars of their time.This is a hefty book at close to 400 pages, much of it amidst war. During the Spanish Civil War in the 30s, Martha and Ernest started their love affair, (although they first met in Key West and became friends), even though he was still married to his second wife, Pauline. It took several years for Hemmingway to finally get divorced from Pauline, but after he married Martha, more problems ensued when he beseeched his new wife to stop traveling as a journalist and instead stay home with him in Havana. But, Martha, as strong-willed and independent as her husband, was compelled to travel to war zones and write about what she saw. “How could a single day—or a single mind—hold two such vastly different realities? It didn’t seem possible, but here was Belgium, cold and benign as a surgeon’s table rising from the mist.”Their relationship was ill fated from the start, with all the passion and fire of love and lust but doomed by different demons and demands. Hemmingway, an alcoholic, was often imperious and cold if Martha didn’t comply with his pleas. Eventually, they became competitive, and Ernest didn’t shy away from undermining his wife to get what he wanted, once trying to prevent her from traveling to a battlefront by hijacking her assignment from the magazine she worked for, Colliers. Gellhorn refused to settle for being a footnote in Hemmingway’s life.McClain writes impassioned prose, peppered with strong, beautiful metaphors that convey the carnage of war and the ruin of a painful marriage. She showcases equally the private war of her marriage and the public wars on the world stage. “And yet here we were, anyway, hurtling through the dark toward each other under a hundred million stars, and set to collide disastrously. Logic wouldn’t save us and neither would the dwindling pile of days. We had all the time in the world to make a terrible mistake.”The emotional facets kept me involved; however, as poignant as the wars were to Martha’s work, I experienced frequent weariness while reading. It felt redundant, the recurrent chronicling of blood and shells and bombs and tears. The push and pull, back and forth of Gellhorn and Hemmingway interrupted by travels to the front fatigued me, a static struggle that ran amok throughout the book. The story began to seesaw, a kind of infinite purgatory that was conveyed in the narrative. War at home, war abroad, moments of tenderness, and more adversity at home and overseas. Even the imminent events felt remote over time, a reiteration of clash and combat. Yet, McClain managed to keep me afloat with her passionate and confident prose, which occasionally flanked cliché, but surged with the vigor of the valiant.“No matter what else happened going forward, Ernest and Madrid and this awful, marvelous war were tangled up together inside me, like the story of my own life. “I wouldn’t keep them; I couldn’t. But they were mine.”...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Mar 04, 2018","Mar 08, 2018","Mar 14, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36614133-love-and-ruin

If it weren’t for my fiancé (now husband), I may have spiraled into a dark, depressing space for a long time. Makkai’s book brought it all back to me—the despair, the secrets, and the shame that was forced upon my friend from the virus and the politics of the time. Even though the locale (Chicago/Paris) in Makkai’s novel is different than my own, and the plot of course sprang from the depth of her imagination, she captured the emotions and momentum of the time so well that I often twinned with the author’s story. Character-driven, theme-driven, and generous of spirit, The Great Believers is a fully realized work of art.The novel threads two timelines—the 80s/90s AIDS epidemic era and 2015. We follow Fiona in both timelines, first a heartsick nineteen-year-old sister in the 80s and subsequently a mother estranged from her adult daughter in 2015. She never stopped grieving for her brother, Nico, for his untimely death from AIDS in 1985. The effect it had on her, while she stood by all who came after-- Nico’s boyfriend and friends and friends of friends who succumbed, left her so consumed and damaged that she never felt whole again. She couldn’t sustain a marriage, and motherhood was fraught with mistakes. In the 1980s, Yale, a development director of an art gallery, is about to pull off the collection of his dreams, just as he finds out his boyfriend has cheated on him and is carrying the virus, which now means possible doom for Yale, too. He decides to focus on his work to escape his pain. Nora, the elderly woman donating the 1920s pieces, seems a far cry from Yale and his personal problems, yet her romantic nature and story of loss—all her friends that died or disappeared in Europe during the Great War—resonates to the monumental losses of people dying from the virus. The urgency and sorrow are wrapped up in the wreckage. Many during the war were ravaged, sick from the flu epidemic, dead, or grieving alone. And in the era of AIDS, as Nora says, “I don’t know how you can compare it to anything else…I don’t know how it’s like anything other than war!” And Nora still hasn’t gotten over her great love, Ranko, an obscure artist who painted some of the pieces that she is about to offer. He died over sixty years ago, but he’s alive in her heart. She trusts Yale to preserve and display her collection.Fiona, on a tip, flies from Chicago to Paris to hopefully find her daughter, Claire, who she suspects now has a daughter of her own. So many years of embittered anguish--the misunderstandings, mischaracterized actions, conflicts, have damaged them both. Fiona’s inability to recover from Nico’s death left her heart torn, like Nora’s when Ranko died. As one character says, when asked if love vanishes, “I think that’s the saddest thing in the world, the failure of love. Not hatred, but the failure of love.”The Great Believers delivers a sprawling cast of characters. The majority of them—even secondary and tertiary characters, have singular features that give them dimension. The past informs the present and quietly, through love, memories, and friendship, they open a window to redemption. And art. Makkai has a knack for penning each book so differently, and yet her theme of redemption through art is a bright beam that radiates like an eternal flame of hope and healing.

I took a chance on this debut writer, attracted by the noir-ish cover, and was decidedly swept along by the narrative flow and the mental and emotional energy that pulled the story along. It wasn’t exactly noir, but it had its dark moments and moral ambiguities. And one or two threads continue to unravel in my head, even though I’ve reached the end. There’s one low-key question left unanswered, but it is just enough to add a little fizz to my afterthoughts.Six friends from Oxford University spend a week in the summer at a French farmhouse, where they meet the eponymous French girl, a family acquaintance of one of the friends. After their departure, they found out that the French girl, Severine, had gone missing. Now, a decade later, she has turned up dead on the property, in the well that was subsequently filled in. This causes disruption in the five remaining friends (Theo died in the war)—Kate, Caro, Tom, Seb, and Lara. Not all of them have remained close, although Kate and Lara are best friends, and Seb and Tom are close cousins. Caro has been relegated to fair weather friend.Enter the French detective, Alain Modan, whose approach to solving the crime is detailed and observant. His presence and his questions rattle Kate, who has already started seeing hallucinations of Severine as she remembers her from ten years ago—sultry, sexy, laconic. She joins Kate everywhere—her apartment, her office, and around the city, silent and vivid. The novel is told from Kate’s perspective, and the reader is immediately installed in her memories, her pressing stressors with her new business, and the awkwardness of confronting an old flame. Not to mention her new dead friend!The couplings and uncouplings that took place between the six friends during that intense week at the farmhouse heighten the mystery at hand, and the search for what happened ten years ago straddles the question of what is happening now and what may happen in the near future. Lexie Elliot unpacks the buried memories that churn up along with the buried body. She employed a formula but made it her own, focusing largely on the human angle—friendship, success, betrayal, deception, trust, and the search for acceptance.

But, now that I can read for pleasure alone, my approach to even dense books has morphed. I relax and let the story wash over me instead of urgently trying to find that prevailing thesis. Not that Elmet is difficult to read; the words are easily known and spoken, although there is a Faulkner-esque slash Homer style to some of the prose. Elmet refers to the last independent Celtic kingdom in England. The story begins with a hint of ancient myths and evolves into current and harsh realities. Elmet, in a grave and allegorical approach, channels stark themes about family, love, loyalty, pride, and alienation. Daniel and his older sister, Cathy, grow up in a sylvan otherworld in a house built with their father’s hands, out in the woods of Elmet. He wanted his children to live their own lives, to make what they use, and be close to the natural world. They fashion archery bows with yew and oak, and play childhood games long into their teens. Early on, Daniel remembers “Tales of green men peering from thickets with foliate faces and legs of gnarled timber.” Later, with chapters italicized to indicate the present situation, “I think of my sister with her slick of black hair. I think on my Daddy and the words he did and did not speak. I think on the others, all eyeballs and teeth.”Daniel, Cathy, and “Daddy” are fiercely loyal and loving to one another. Another page and Daniel is sitting with his father, sister and an “old squaddy,” who is smoking a cigarette rolled by Cathy. You sense the unrest when the old stranger makes lewd gestures toward Cathy, seen only by her and Daniel. The menace is incipient, and the reader is privy.The narrative voice is more passive than a lot of contemporary family suspense dramas, giving it the voice of bygone years. The author, by setting her novel beyond even where Thoreau would dare to tread, created a timeless tale, not incidentally. It takes place in contemporary times, but the isolated woods, bleak atmosphere and rural lives could have been written for any time, and the imminent sense of violence is eternal and easily felt from the start, cold and searing. I felt icy while I sat reading. The plot advances with acutely subtle and granular progression, and the reading isn’t “fun.” It is not entertaining, as such, but it is powerful, disquieting, and enduring. The opening pages compelled me with its lyricism:“I cast no shadow. Smoke rests behind me and daylight is stifled. I count railroad ties and the numbers rush. I count rivets and bolts. I walk north. My first two steps are slow, languid…I have passed through the turnstile and the gate is locked.”So, at the beginning, we are pinned like the boy to this scene, with the dark air of danger in our midst. We then segue to a grim and bald reality. Father--builder and occasional day laborer, who also makes money fighting other men, one on one. He’s part of the poorer classes but above it, too, due to his unassailable gift of a colossal physical frame (that, too, almost myth-like), and his reputation as a conqueror of men. He’s also above the fray in that he is a talented builder of their well-made home, the best in all the land there, one that will outlast every other. But the land—that is another problem revealed by deliberate degrees.This is a novel that demands your attention, as the rhythm of the narrative builds to its harrowing denouement. Even out in the wild, a gnawing suffocation is engendered and unleashes the worst of our fears. Like folklore or a parable, there is both a cautionary tale and a sustaining moral message to this sinister but heartfelt tale of gentle love and formidable pride. The quote from Ted Hughes about Elmet serves as warning: “…But even into the seventeenth century this narrow cleft and its side-ginnels, under the glaciated moors, were still a ‘badlands,’ a sanctuary for refugees from the law.” An astonishing piece of literature, and even more astonishing that this is Fiona Mozley’s debut novel!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 22, 2017","Dec 25, 2017","Dec 28, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35711376-elmet

THE ACCIDENT ON THE A 35, like THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ADELE BUDEAU, takes place in the small French town of Saint-Louis, close to the Swiss border.As with Adele Budeau, we learn in the Forward (and more in the Afterword) that this detective story was actually one of two outstanding manuscripts by the “acclaimed” (fictional) author, Raymond Brunet, delivered to the publisher on the day of his mother’s death. Brunet had died years earlier in a suicide, which leaves the reader wondering why these manuscripts weren’t sent until this very day. Burnet is such a tease with his crafty meta-fiction!The lugubrious Detective Gorski is back, with an accident on his hands. The 60-ish year-old driver, Bertrand Barthelme, a successful solicitor, appears to have fallen asleep at the wheel, rolled down a slope, hit a tree, and instantly died. No mystery there, until Gorski is asked by the attractive young widow, Lucette, to look further into the accident, due to an unexplained route Bertrand took on the night in question. Gorski’s vulnerability to Lucette, like every other detail in this story, has a hand in changing the course of events. When it is apparent that a murder occurred in a neighboring town on the night of Bertrand’s death, Gorski starts making connections.The deceased’s seventeen-year-old son, Raymond (the same name as the “author’s”), appears relieved by his father’s death. “…a certain lightness; a feeling similar to that which he experienced when the school year ended for summer, or when spring arrived and it became possible to leave the house without a winter coat.”Raymond is a loner, but has two close friends—male and female. He’s an eccentric boy that appears to lack empathy. He prefers to read, currently preoccupied by Sartre. There does seem to be a sly NO EXIT sprinkling in the story, as this novel often explores the concept of subjectivity—looking at oneself as an object and seeing oneself as the self appears to others. “How should I react?"" thinks Raymond, when told by Gorski that his father has died. “He glanced on the floor to buy time. Then he sat on the bed. That was good. That was what people did in such circumstances…” This was a boy who wasn’t guilty of a crime--except perhaps the crime of unkind thoughts.Several of the characters periodically digress into deductive reasoning concerning present actions, and there is a consciousness—or, more accurately, self-consciousness, as they ponder the reaction of others and themselves. In this way, even small gestures or inconsequential and innocent actions take on significance. A stray look from a stranger never ceases to alarm Raymond, especially as he follows-up on an address he found in his father’s desk. This leads him to another town where he subsequently begins to act out in reckless and risky behaviors.As the narrative moves forward, the reader witnesses a solid sense of isolation between characters, and even between characters and their immediate environment. It accentuates an existential angst that is pervasive here. Regarding Raymond’s stiff-necked father, “Even in his absence…when Raymond and his mother shared a light-hearted moment, they would restrain themselves, as if their deeds might be reported to the authorities.”Background details of the family are revealed gradually through the tale, poignant moments and random encounters that tunnel its way toward the visceral denouement. Ongoing marital problems between Gorski and his wife, as well as unanswered questions regarding his own childhood, add a layer of motif in the vessels of the main story. The plot is lightly told while the psychological tension ratchets up.As the reader is led back and forth through the past and present, the narrative gains ground and stimulates our curiosity subtly but surely. The book’s framework consists of small stones that gather bits of moss as they roll on, page after page. “Something HAD happened. And it happened without any exertion of will on his part. One thing had simply followed from another.”Hauntingly atmospheric, mordantly witty, and brilliantly written, Burnet’s book will leave you with many questions of your own about the characters and events. Motivations are sublime and secondary characters are written just as skillfully as the primary ones, with a tinge of undertone that makes you pause, and with the force and nuance suggestive of a Dostoevsky novel. The dissection of small-town life is reminiscent of Karin Fossum's THE INDIAN BRIDE. This is one to read again and again. I can’t wait for the ""other"" manuscript to surface.

On our first trip, I used the Rick Steves guide book, as it is compreMy husband and I will be visiting London for the second time, in spring of 2018. On our first trip, I used the Rick Steves guide book, as it is comprehensive and his others have never let me down while traveling. Since I already have that one (the 2015 edition), I decided to use this as a companion piece. I would be able to form an opinion on the value of this book for beginner travelers. And I was surprised how much valuable information was packed away in this small, tidy book. You won’t get tips on obscure places to visit or how to vacation like a local (RS books have a compendium of advice on lesser known jewels of the city) and, unlike the RS books, you won’t often get witty descriptions and rare finds, but, when comparing to other brief city guides, this is surely a winner.The book is color-coded and divided into sections, such as the recommended Top 25, More to See, City Tours, eateries, places to stay, places to shop, etc. There is no alphabetical index at the end, but rather several throughout related to its chapter. Each site gives “The Basics,“ i.e. address, the tube or public transport exit, cost, hours, and handicap access. I appreciate that the cost is marked as “free” or “moderate” or “expensive” rather than the exact price. That is one of my few criticisms of RS price quotes--—often it is outdated. But Fodor’s gives you a range, and stresses how expensive London can be for the tourist consumer. But, it also recommends many places that are free to visit (many of the museums). I looked at some of the London places we already visited, such as Tower of London and St Paul’s Cathedral. In this aspect, although the info is specific and sufficient, it was the RS guides that convinced me that I MUST visit the Tower of London and the Beefeater’s Tour, whereas Fodor’s gives zilch on the Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters) and the fascinating and engaging tour. It was one of the highlights of our trip.If you just want to check off boxes, this would suffice as a 5 star book. It points you to 25 of the most popular and also notably can’t-miss places. And the color photos and sturdy pages are first class. I am also a street-map appreciator, and the laminated—yes, laminated street map of Central London folded neatly in a snap-shut plastic envelope at the inside back page is star-worthy by itself. Plus several maps are interwoven with the chapters. Central London, or “The City,” as I learned, is about a mile in perimeter. But, many who visit, especially for the first time, stay largely inside its boundaries. There certainly is enough history to behold and breath-taking sites just within that square mile—even Roman ruins! The enfolded map plus the front flap of the book has the Tube system. By the way, not only is the Tube the oldest underground metro system in the world, but you must experience while in London! It puts NYC subways to shame. You won’t get stuck in a Tube tunnel or suffer from its crumbling infrastructure. It is almost poetry the way the train lines are braided, and the countdown clocks at every station and cleanliness demonstrate how well Londoners care about their public transportation. I wish this book spoke with such passion about the Tube, but it doesn’t authoritatively dedicate praise of the Underground. Use it to your advantage! And the buses, too. Taxis and even Uber are expensive.OK, back to the guide book at large (or small and compact). Little tidbits stand out, such as The British library, which it states is home to over 150 million items, including Shakespeare’s first folio and some Beatles’ manuscripts. You can take a “Tate to Tate” boat ride; there’s a good atmosphere in the evenings at the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the Houses of Parliament tours are expensive and only during summer recess and on Saturdays (although open to the public daily at specific hours in the public gallery). Additionally, there is a “Getting Around” section that shares everything from getting in and out of London by plane, train, and automobile (or boat!); the general weather each month, tips and websites; money and credit card info; modes of communication, etc. If you had the RS guidebooks, you’d also be given info that is pertinent to the LGBT community. This book is surely lacking in social and political edification, which you may not think is important until you get there. The Fodor’s guide will tell you where things are at, but not the nuances and underpinnings of English culture. However, there are little entries on history, which gives some context to various sites, and may pique interest or add to your quest to explore. In summation, I think this makes a portable adjunct to the RS guide books, but not a replacement. But it does an excellent job of going beyond the 25 Best that it adverts....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Nov 2017,Dec 2017,"Dec 06, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35242839-fodor-s-london-25-best

No, this isn’t literature. The language is plain spoken, but unpretentiously unself-conscious, and the author risked a powerful, topical plotline which could have been ripped from today’s headlines—sexual allegations in the workplace and beyond, a subject that could easily be trivialized by platitudes, grandstanding, or a hackneyed narrative. But she kept it real and relevant. This had to be written before the current scandals, almost as if Burke were prophetic. Like me, you may get a few hot tingles down your spine before you get to the end.Angela, the wife of the accused, Jason Powell, narrates a large part of the story. Angela has a troubled history that leaks out over the course of the book, and it made me wonder more than once if she was a reliable narrator. I do love my unreliable narrators—but this could even be more juicy—not knowing if the wife was being straight with us or not. Let the reader decide! Jason is a writer and economics professor at NYU, plus a lead consultant in a cutting-edge firm that crossbreeds international finance with human rights causes. He’s a successful, handsome, and apparently doting husband. After earnings from his book allow him some cushion, he and Angela move to the Village (which is near NYU). Angela’s son, Spencer, is not yet a teen but is quite bright and adored by both. Jason has been a little off-track about finishing up the adoption papers, but treats him like a beloved son.The first line sets up tension straightaway: “In an instant, I became the woman they assumed I’d been all along: the wife who lied to protect her husband.” It starts in media res, with a police officer coming to the door, and it is obvious that Angela has encountered this woman before. I like how it throws me off, makes me pay attention as the narrative shifts back and forth to past and present, filling in the blanks with onerous allegations about Angela’s husband and combining it with pieces of Angela’s past coming up to haunt her, and also Jason. It’s obvious that the couple know more than us, and Burke is ace at switching points of view and apportioning perception of events. There are also facts that we are privy to but are murky to other characters. The police officer, Olivia, is trying to put all the pieces together.It’s a fast-paced and psychologically cunning domestic thriller plus police procedural, but the author doesn’t sacrifice characters for plot. There’s delight in the parsing of the Powells, and how they respond to events. Although some of the supporting characters are stock, Burke flawlessly finesses Jason, and especially Angela, that you won’t feel shortchanged. It’s a meaty story, not hollow or boilerplate. I picked up clues here and there, and perhaps guessed some truths along the way, but it is far from a hollow plot; there’s always more to unpack, right until the glittering finish.I was both satisfied and piqued at the end, which is ripe for discussion and debate. If you’re looking for a nice, tight wrap garnished with a bow, look elsewhere. Burke wins the reader by not vanquishing all options. If you like it authentic, with a touch of ambiguity to unwrap, you won’t be disappointed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,2,"Nov 08, 2017not set","Nov 09, 2017not set","Nov 30, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35008738-the-wife

Fortunately, I discovered early that this was going to be the opposite of my fears, with a thoughtfully provocative plot and contoured characters. But little did I anticipate how derailed I would be as the book shifts from the story I thought I was reading to a more sinister and menacing twist. Darkly comic at times, and one step ahead of the reader, Herron proves he’s a master at creating danger and dissembling.Look--it's one story. No, it's another!It would be poor form to ruin the reader experience by revealing too much of the plot, so I will describe the protagonist and the set-up. Maggie Barnes is a plain Jane who recently moved to London to escape from her abusive boyfriend and to increase her prospects of success. She has no college degree, unlike her estranged sister, Meredith, with her “shiny flat…shiny car, and a shiny man.” Instead, Maggie struggled to make ends meet, currently in the postal department of a large corporate office. “A quiet cup of coffee in a noisy park café made up the kindest minutes of her day.”London was a place that was defined by the river Thames, it had been said. But when Maggie walked by the Thames, she was pressed in the crowd by a river of strangers, and “the only embrace it offered was equally cold. London’s heart was carefully guarded. If it had a soul…it could be found in the street names that had survived fire and the blitz…” Living in London had made Maggie feel the wrong kind of anonymity—unloved, unacknowledged, and excluded. Maggie, at 26, was already burned out on the future, trying to get by in the present and unable to forget the past. She didn’t just feel ordinary—she felt invisible. So, one day, when approached by a British M15 agent to work as an asset, she was intrigued. He needed someone low-key and inconspicuous to infiltrate the offices of where she worked and interface with their security systems via a flash drive. It was a simple-seeming task, with just the right amount of danger to pique her interest. She could be a hero, just by installing a surveillance system into the company’s network. Cyber infiltration to stave off cyber-terrorism, and save Britain from destruction.When we meet Maggie on the first page, we are in media res—in the middle of a scene. She’s hiding in the corporate office bathroom until midnight, when it was safest to climb to the top floor of executives and install the flash-drive. Her heart is beating wildly and she is trembling with fear. What keeps Maggie going is the importance of the task and her role in it—and her growing reliance on the agent, Harvey, to keep her safe. “If you could be part of something huge—something life-savingly important—what risk would you be willing to run?” The stakes are about to escalate as Maggie risks everything to save others and herself. Just expect the unexpected.Nick Herron reminds me more of the crime authors Herman Koch and Sascha Arango—the clean, spare prose, nuanced characters, dark wit, and the face of evil. In a few well-chosen sentences, and with a cunning suspense, he breathes an atmosphere of melancholy and bleak irony, with a menace that resides in the boundary between false truths and credible lies. I read it in two intense sittings. The very end was my only complaint, and the total ignorance of one character, but I will stop there. ...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Nov 04, 2017","Nov 05, 2017","Nov 07, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34837211-this-is-what-happened

The people in Silber’s cast are either related to each other by family; their circumstances; by a generation; or by several degrees of separation. In some instances, they are intimately associated with each other, or acquainted, but at times, it is only a casual or chance agency that is relevant. What IS relevant is that they are ordinary people, relatable, with baggage and common problems—money, relationships, insecurities—that make them so familiar and sympathetic.Reyna and Boyd are a couple; she has a four-year-old, Oliver, from an ex no longer in their lives. Boyd is just out of Rikers for a minor criminal offense, and Reyna is concerned that Boyd wants to go into another life of petty crime with his cousin, Maxwell, and best friend, Claude. She’s not even sure that her and Boyd are meant to be forever. “I was perfectly aware that some part of my life with Boyd was not entirely real, that if you pushed it too hard a whole other feeling would show itself.”Claude’s sister, Lynette, is an adversary of Reyna’s--they have a strained relationship due to Reyna’s suspicion that Lynette wants to hook up with him. Lynette is an aesthetician, talented in brow work, and wants to own her own salon one day. She is confident that she is capable of making it happen. “The point was to ask for strength. Improvement wasn’t coming any other way.”One of her steady clients, Monika, a Berlin transplant to NYC, is an art historian for the Met, and married to a Jewish artist whose career is declining, which is putting a strain on their marriage. Julian has a tense relationship with Monika’s mother, who is ailing and living on the dole in Berlin. He still has assumptions that Germany is crawling with anti-Semitism, especially from Monika’s mother. So he resists the potential to start a career in Berlin, where the art community may be more receptive to his installations.Long ago, unknown to Monika, her mother was a short-term dealer in antiquities, and had briefly met Kiki, Reyna’s aunt, in Istanbul. Aunt Kiki and her braided rugs are like the glue of the story. In some ways, Kiki is closer in degrees of separation to almost everyone, whose choices have a magnifying but subtle effect on the other characters’ personal histories.Silber keeps the narrative focused on the quotidian, the day to day concerns and activities of her characters, and at times they are braided, like Kiki’s rugs, into a larger narrative or whole piece. Kiki was married in 1970 to a Turkish man and lived in Istanbul and in the countryside, at first helping her husband Osman, in rug trading, and then went with him when he went into farming. She returned, divorced, after eight years, and remains an enigmatic but supportive presence in Reyna’s life. Kiki has never remarried, and lives independently in the East Village.There are others who populate the novel, some related by death, denial, tragedy or secret affairs. The connections—lost, found, fragile, refuted, or discarded, go back and forth in time and characters. What they held, and what held them. The mind—able to be two places at once—the truth and the lie, the past and the present. “A person could keep the best of certain private things to herself, so they didn’t fade, and she could lie flat-out…out of loyalty to once was. Nothing could get her to take back the lie; she was glad for what she held on to.”There’s deliverance through the fog and cloud of precarious decisions, even a grand or noble gesture that change perspectives and lives, and allows us to look through the lens of ordinary people at the small but poignant gestures and bits of improvement that grant redemption....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Nov 05, 2017","Nov 07, 2017","Nov 07, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34013952-improvement

I am a big fan of his small screen series, such as Foyle’s WarAfter reading Horowitz’s MAGPIE MURDERS, I was compelled to read this one straightaway. I am a big fan of his small screen series, such as Foyle’s War, a nuanced, intelligent series about a British detective during WW II and beyond to the Cold War, the short series Injustice, a tense drama about a tormented attorney, and the eccentric but suspenseful Midsomer Murders about a quaint English village and its people, coupled with murder. Magpie Murders had a combination of a vintage English murder, mixed with a contemporary meta-fiction that renders it more complex and twisty. In this, another murder case, Horowitz is even more brazen by casting himself as himself, layering fictional characters and a storyline with the authentic Horowitz, in a sometimes gleefully tingling meta- scene. For example, the writer is in an actual meeting with Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, and…well, I won’t reveal what happens, but it really blurs the lines between fact and fiction, that scene being the most arch of all the meta-scenes due to the billion-watt celebrities going eerily from foreground to background with a few strokes of a keyboard.The story: It starts with a short narrative: a 60s-aged woman, Diana Cowper, walks into a funeral parlor to arrange her own funeral, and is murdered six hours later. This was more of a prologue, demonstrating the author’s draft of a story, and then the next chapter we get to the meat of the set-up, and how that funeral parlor scene came to be.In London, Anthony Horowitz, busy with different writing projects and a screenplay, is contacted by a peculiar ex police force detective named Daniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne was once hired by Horowitz’s production team to be used as a consultant in his five-part miniseries, INJUSTICE, to help keep the script’s police procedures credible and methodical. He was brilliant with his advice, and apparently a crack investigator, but was fired by the Metropolitan police force prior to working with Horowitz on the series. Anthony never liked him—he found him morose, socially miscued, prickly, annoying, and intrusive, but he put up with him for his use on the series. Horowitz is inwardly outraged and outwardly dismissive when Hawthorne calls him to offer him a 50-50 book deal to write about himself. Why would anyone want to read about Hawthorne? And how brazen for him to call Horowitz to write this? And 50-50??? Yet, when he finally does meet up with him and Hawthorne tells him about the Cowper case, Anthony is legitimately intrigued. The fact that she has a famous son, a stage and screen actor he’s familiar with, amps up the buzz. Horowitz agrees to do it, i.e. to follow Hawthorne around (who has been curiously hired by the Met to consult, and seems to have primary privileges). The problem— to Anthony’s chagrin, Hawthorne is a cipher and refuses to answer any questions about himself. Anthony expresses to him that if he is going to write about him,  “I’d have to know where you live, whether you’re married or not, what you have for breakfast, what you do on your day off. That’s why people read murder stories.” Hawthorne’s response?  “I don’t agree. The word is murder. That’s what matters.”As the case and story unfold, and the suspects pile up, it becomes just as thrilling to witness the testy relationship of Hawthorne and Horowitz as it is to watch how the investigation progresses. Moreover, the writer shares the writing process. Although the case is fiction (but treated as fact), you totally believe in it! Horowitz is a genius at including himself BUT getting out of his own way. Only an accomplished, meticulous writer is able to pull that off.

And I’ve started getting into Midsomer Murders, also taking place in the English countryside, with each show a murder among an eccentric cast of often middle aged or elderly people. Horowitz creates sophisticated scripts with three-dimensional characters. So, when I saw that he also wrote adult novels, I decided to give it a go. And I wasn’t disappointed.Horowitz has proven that he can combine a storyline combining wit, drama, folly, and levity all in one period piece of meta-fiction. Most of it surrounds a writer of a successful detective series, with blockbuster fame, named Alan Conway. His editor, Susan Ryeland, has sat down to read his latest manuscript with Detective Atticus Pund, a German who came to England some time around WW II. It is the 1950s in the Cotswold’s, and I felt a familiarity of characters—a vicar, a doctor, a taciturn handyman, a wealthy community leader, and others that dot the countryside and provide color and character. And, of course, there are secrets, some venial, and others more venal. A death has occurred and concluded an accident…but was it?During the reading of the novel, Susan inserts bits of information about Alan Conway—she doesn’t like him, and that the book has changed her life. She tells us that she is no longer working for Cloverleaf publishers, where she spent a majority of her professional life. A mystery to add to the mystery of the book. She also shares excerpts of her private life and her beau, a wealthy Greek who travels a lot. She reads on, until we get to a startling reveal, which I do not want to spoil. At that point, it becomes a story within a story, and I was impressed at the seamless dexterity in which Horowitz pulls this off.Without revealing anything juicy, I just want to add that the story is rich with its impeccable architecture and structure, and the labyrinth path and rabbit holes, as well as the leisurely but commanding pacing of this novel. The author leaves no stone unturned and no reader turned off. The net is wide for the cast of suspects and potential who, what, and why of reality and fantasy. It’s a bold and ambitious undertaking that is fully realized and deliciously satisfying. It will keep you relentlessly guessing as you turn the pages, suspicious of everyone, trusting of no one.

It begins now, with a young woman, Judith, reluctantly visiting her mother, Stephanie, in prison. It’s evident that this is an ongoing yet uncomfortable face-to-face, where the conversation stays safe with topics of movies and books. At home, Judith isolates and chooses unhealthy habits in order to escape from the memories of childhood—specifically what landed her mother in prison. Throughout the tale of this mother/daughter relationship, the narrative goes back and forth to the past and the present. The future of their recovery is at stake, and we feel it with a brittle intensity.Stephanie raised Judith as a single mother, protective but tired from work, trying to be mother and father simultaneously but feeling a failure at that. Stephanie’s friction with her own mother is cutting enough, but Judith, a fun-loving fan of popular culture, accuses her mother of not listening to her—ever. When Stephanie falls for an intense, inscrutable man named Nathaniel and brings him home to meet Judith, the conflicts escalate. Nathaniel convinces Stephanie to leave mainstream society and join the “Ark,” a religious cult high on the moors and devoted to God. A number of adults and children live there and Nathaniel is the charismatic leader. A distressed Judith unwillingly joins her mother at the Ark as Stephanie is so besotted by Nathaniel, “the prophet,” she is willing to remove herself from society and follow the Old Testament mores, even though she herself is more agnostic. And then—nothing—not Nathaniel, the creed, or the lifestyle is what it seemed from the outset. The precarious equilibrium with no more substance than a house of cards, but while you’re in it, you believe.Wait does a superb job of creating the atmosphere of the Ark, archaic and implacable, with a haunting reminder of isolation from the moors. All the members must change their names to biblical ones, and the laws of the dogma require unconditional subservience. Technology is limited, and the women spend their days cooking and cleaning, while some of the men leave to work in “Gehenna,”—their name for the outside world that Judith and Stephanie have left. Judith finds solace in Moses, a boy around her age who was born with what is evident as a port wine stain on his face, but which the prophet has denoted a mark of the devil due to the story of his birth. He helps Judith to adjust to the Ark, and she edifies him about so-called Gehenna, a place he’s never been because he was born at the Ark. They form a close bond and have a secret meeting place where they talk and learn a sense of real play and unrestricted dialogue.The pacing and sense of foreshadowing is palpable and purposeful, as of course we know from the start that Stephanie is in prison. The foreboding sense of tragedy is in every shadow and in every corner of the Ark, and I was on edge while Wait brilliantly built the architecture of the story toward its cataclysmic climax. As Stephanie’s hopefulness turns to despair, she realizes too late that she made wrong decisions in trying to remake herself in the image that Nathaniel demanded.“Your thoughts are wicked from the day you were born,” says the prophet, Nathaniel.

Although these confessions are decidedly not on a psychiatrist’s couch, the subtext of Freud’s tripartite of id, ego, and superego form a subtext in each of these characters and their concerns. Taken as a whole, these stories are about people wrestling with guilt and the bounds of morality.In the first story, on the first floor, a retired officer, Arnon, a father with two young daughters and a stern wife, periodically leaves his youngest, Ofri, with a pensioner couple to babysit. The old man may have early dementia, and an incident occurs that leads Arnon to believe that his daughter may have even been violated in some way. He recounts this to a former fellow soldier-turned-journalist, and we learn of the dreadful actions that Arnon took, potentially destroying his marriage in the process. This bottom floor represents the id, the more primitive, instinctual, aggressive, and sexual drives, which colors this narrative.Floor two lives Hani, nicknamed “the widow” by others due to the fact that she is alone a lot while her husband travels for his job much of the time, and she is left alone with her two children. If she admits to the other mothers at the playground, that “sometimes I have a really strong urge to get up and leave everything,” she gets iced out. In this, the ego—the personality component that mediates between the primitive drives and the external real world—Hani makes a decision to invite her dangerous brother to stay (dangerous because of his involvements), which adds some excitement to her increasingly isolated life. But also brings her to the fringe of morality.The third floor and novella, the most fleshed out and complex, represents the superego, which incorporates the values and morals of society. No accident that the protagonist is a widowed judge, Devora--judge = superego. She talks to her dead husband on tape, using their answering machine, mostly about their estranged son, Adar. It is a painful and tragic story, and the one that elicited the starkest of emotions. However, the potential for redemption lends it hope. In this, Devora gets involved with a former Mossad agent—or was he? The slow-burning excitement of being around him opens Devora up to adventure and facing her own demons.Eshkel Nevo installed me in these three “floors” immediately, with his bracing immediacy and language, as well as his sympathetic and flawed characters. If you enjoy reading about the vicissitudes of the human heart and the threshold of boundaries and morality, this interlocking drama will hold you fast to the pages. “After seeing all of that, you realize that morality is completely relative. And you become a little more forgiving, of others and of yourself.”...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Oct 09, 2017","Oct 10, 2017","Oct 25, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35185844-three-floors-up

The author’s jumping off point in this coming-of age story is his own experience as one of few white boys in his school, and his imagination takes us to realist fiction in some funny, ironic, and painful ways. It is 1992, and Dave Greenwood is extra white with his curly blonde hair and blue eyes. Like all the other kids, he is trying to fit in, even while being bullied on the bus and in school. He meets Mar, a nerdy black kid from the projects with an aim to getting into Boston Latin next year in 7th grade, and they form a friendship over their love of the Celtics and their temperaments—non-violent outsiders. Their friendship forms the center of this story.The language and dialogue feel immediate and sharp, the two boys finding solace in their shared studying for exams and watching Celtics videos, and Mar becomes like another big brother to Dave’s younger and purposely mute kid brother, Benno, an eccentric and odd child who has adopted a removed stance from all but his family. The sense of identity confusion is highlighted as Dave tries to find his place in religion. His father is a secular Jew and his mother an atheist non-Jew, so Dave is…nothing? he surmises. (Judaism is decided by the maternal line). Mar is a devoted Christian, and suddenly Dave wants to belong to this new tribe, one where it may also help him to stop his teenage onanism. He also lies to Mar and hides his Jewish roots.The book is packed with adventures between the two friends, such as being a part of a city theater group that Dave introduces to Mar, and the curse of being noticed—or not—by the girl of your desire. Throughout the story, Dave refers (to the reader only) a private shame about the “force”—something he was ignorant to in elementary school when the motto was “Together in Friendship”—a white kid and black kid holding hands, or when his choir sang for Nelson Mandela when he was freed.But then, with the Rodney King horror came the Reginald Denny violence, which made Dave sick with the force—it reared its ugly head even more when he would walk to school and hear, “ Fuck  you lookin’ at, white boy?” The same force that permeated white and black with its systemic racism, and which clouded Dave with shame, guilt, and anger. His parents were peacemakers, organizers for good works, and his Jewish grandfather was a survivor from the Holocaust. Middle school was difficult enough for Dave, but with conflicting forces at work inside of him, he felt even more isolated, until Mar became his best friend.Even so, home life was different for Dave than for Mar. Mar lived in the projects with his mentally unstable mother, tended to by his grandmother, and Dave had the luxury of two stable parents—one a Harvard grad, the other a Harvard drop-out. Even Benno was well-protected and had support for a better future. Throughout the book, we are brought back to youth—the fear of ostracism, the struggle for identity, and the fumbling toward the future. The gritty immediacy and looming dread is contoured with a rising hope. I was gripped by the tension and storyline, keen to know how it would turn out. My only complaint is that there are too many anachronisms of speech and style, phrases and words that didn’t come into vogue until the 21st century, some not until a few years ago, but peppered throughout in Dave’s speech (and his peers). It even distracted me, enough to periodically jettison me from 1992 and right into 2017. That shouldn’t happen in a period piece, but otherwise, I would highly recommend this for its timeliness and timelessness.

The place is the song and I’m going to be part of the song.”These words are uttered by a ghost, and certain members of a fractured family see the dead that are unburied, because they are not finished shadowing this family. Today JoJo turns thirteen, and his grandfather, Pop, is initiating lessons in adulthood. Jojo assists Pop in slaughtering and preparing a goat for the table. In Ward’s earthy and yet ethereal language, the slaughter becomes poetry, and the act is riveting. This is a family who has known death early, and is on the brink of awaiting another—Pop’s wife, Mam, once a robust midwife and shaman of herbs, who is dying of cancer…”the chemo done dried her up and hollowed her out the way the sun and the air do water oaks.”The story opens with intensity and remains like a sad ballad throughout, with moments of light and redemption mixed with the thick slap of the Mississippi mud on the Gulf. It takes us to Parchman, the state penitentiary, on a road trip that compelled me with its mournful narrative. Jojo’s mother is Leonie, an unreliable drug addict who is away often, an unsteady but burning force in his life and that of his toddler sister, Kayla. Pop is the steady force, and Jojo is Kayla’s protective brother. Leonie is going to pull Jojo from school for a few days to go to the prison and pick up her husband, Jojo and Kayla’s father, Michael. He’s been in Parchman several years, a lean and many tattooed Caucasian man whose brother hatefully killed Leonie’s brother, Given. Jojo’s memories of his father are largely physical fights with his mother, leaving bruises on both his parents. Pop won’t go near Parchman prison due to his own bad memories of being there for “harboring a fugitive” when he was a young man. He carries a psychic, emotional torture for the death of a cellmate, a twelve-year-old prisoner he feels he failed to fully protect.Ward’s searing story is told through its corporeal and mystical language—elements of earth, fire, water, and sky; and animal, vegetable, and mineral allusions that I felt like iced heat in my bones and a violent river in my blood. At times, it is also so sensual that I wanted to cry and sing simultaneously. Ward sings a profound and painful love song to the bonds of a family crushed by grief, but with a glimmer of hope for the youngest generation. It is a must read for lovers of Jesmyn Ward and classic American literature. I thought of Beloved for its musicality and Grapes of Wrath for its archetypal and biblical characters. But Jesmyn Ward also sings her own aria of life, death, and the purgatorial unburied. Shattering and memorable. “Sing for your son, he said.

In media res, it’s called, as Dr. Anna Fox, a psychologist, is peering through her camera at the neighbors in 212, stuck in her agoraphobic world in her $3,000,000 house. We know that she talks to her almost-ex-husband, Ed, and young daughter, Olivia, on the phone pretty frequently, and she shares her voyeuristic adventures. She also plays chess online and is part of a forum to help other agoraphobics. She goes by the name thedoctorisin. Anna is in her 40s, starting to look pretty ragged, and drinks way too much—not good with the meds she is on. Once a week, a psychiatrist, Dr. Fielding, visits and assesses her, and her physical therapist and friend visits at regular intervals. She drinks her red wine and watches old black and white thrillers from her collection. All her stimulation is from within the walls of her home.This contemporary and Hitchcockian suspense thriller has all the moxie of old black and white film noirs while still retaining the modern world of social media and technology, but Finn does a superb job of shaping the language, tone, and rhythm as if it were a classy classic. Woven through the story are bits from the old movies that serve as threads to thought, action, and atmosphere. And it has plenty of moody atmosphere, yet is plucky, too.I wouldn’t think to add any plot points; just go in cold like I did. If you love suspense, full-bodied character, psychological mystery, and old movies, (even if you are not a film buff, you’ll engage, as Finn brings it all home), then be careful, you may have as much fun as I did on this roller coaster, nail-biting ride. I wouldn’t call it literature, more like lighterature, but it is articulate and intelligent escapism. I have no complaints, although, like the old movies it plays homage to, perhaps the journey is even better than the destination.

A secular sense of the divine is approached in the first sentence, and throughout the book, through science, mythology, and the struggles of family, the author deftly sprinkles the sense that blessings and curses are mixed up together rather than categorized separately. It is that theme that glows the brightest to we lesser gods, and reminded me that faith in humanity has a power that transcends any one doctrine or devotion.Elena Alvarez is 21, a newly minted 1978 UCLA college graduate in physics with no future prospects. She is pregnant by an abusive young man she hooked up with, apparently another in a long line of self-sabotages. Elena’s self-immolation leads back to a horrific tragedy in childhood that overwhelms her with guilt, one that is revealed to readers organically. When her grandmother (Tuah) writes to her from Leadville, Colorado, asking her to quasi-live-in babysit for a recently widowed father with two small children, she accepts it, because she loves her Gran and she doesn’t know what else to do, despite the fact that Elena has no experience with small children.What follows is Elena’s challenges to maturity, which include learning family secrets that both shock and surprise her. She is an only child of a mother who abandoned the family and a father who was often away working, so Elena was primarily raised by Tuah, who still keeps a rustic cabin in Hat Creek as well as a more convenient place in Leadville. The house in Hat Creek, Elena suspects, is a place where her Tuah goes to be alone.When Elena asks Tuah why she keeps this ancient cabin in Hat Creek in the middle of a ghost town that is falling apart, the place where her grandmother grew up, she gets an unexpected answer: “I don’t go to the cabin to be by myself. I’m not going to get  away from people. I’m going  because of people…a house holds memories, keeps them safe for anyone who wants to come back.”As Tuah recounts stories of her mysterious sister, Elena’s aunt, she also entrusts Elena with the truth, another stepping stone to her maturity. Revelations lead to more challenges, and Elena starts to understand her father’s remoteness and her grandmother’s burdens. As the children she cares for becomes more attached to Elena, she develops a more nuanced understanding of family losses. “It seems a person is never finished learning about sorrow…”Despite the periodic twee contrivances of plot and story—Elena becomes Super Sitter in no time at all, and quickly becomes the best decision maker and healer of a grieving family; in the midst of crisis, Elena becomes a hero; this small town accepts her at face value, with no small-town pettiness to shoulder; and a young, educated, and handsome man is immediately attracted to her, accepting her pregnancy without nary a blink—despite these eye-rolling moments, I was fond of the story from start to finish. Catt’s language and her protagonist’s reflective internal conflicts, (despite the ease of Elena’s external environment and acceptance) were thoughtful, and her metaphysical inclusions give the reader a lot to chew on.Much of the story is a feel-good formula, but the author provides numerous visceral and spiritual moments to reflect on grief, loss, family, love, and acceptance.

Once I started reading them, I realized that Shreve defies formula, even when you think the narrative is headed that way. She curves around outside the norm. Often, her protagonists are women who have been challenged by either the times they live in or the precarious choices they have made. At times, poverty, disasters, and loss must be faced squarely with nerve and wit. In this latest novel, 24 year-old Grace Holland and her babies must bear the aftermath of the Maine coastal fires of 1947, a true event that left some dead and thousands homeless. The casualties Grace and her family suffered were catastrophic, and the present is a broken past that Grace strives to accept, in order to redefine herself and shape a future for her family. Is this a tragic ending, or a hope to begin once again?Shreve creates a mood, tone, and atmosphere that captures the time and place and immersed me in the narrative. Her elegant prose steps aside to let the story tell itself, and Grace is well fleshed out. Some of the characters are thinner and exist to provide a buttress for Grace to resist or persuade, but her inner dialogue and tightly coiled determination are the stanchions of the story. There is a plot point that, if done more in tune with Grace’s situation and nature, would have ended the story quickly. In order to keep it going, Shreve contrived a different choice for Grace, one that delayed certain actions. I admit to straining to suspend disbelief on this one artifice, and it almost cost me a star.

This time, Bollen changes the setting, but many of the themes reappear. THE DESTROYERS takes place on the Greek island of Patmos, an ancient Christian pilgrimage site where the Book of Revelations was supposedly written in the Cave of the Apocalypse. Interestingly, religion in this novel is more of a punch line than a lifeline. The plot is cagey and the denouement may have mixed appreciation by readers.It’s a leisurely moving adventure thriller (don’t expect fast-paced), lush with rich characterizations and first class metaphors.Describing the island of Patmos: “…a wheeze of color: bleach-blond dust, scrub brush of wiry green, the wet-metal shine of water, and low rock walls blooming sinus pinks.” The monastery rising from the cliffs “like a cruise ship moored on a mountaintop.” And the Cave of the Apocalypse: “It just feels heavy, sunken, an empty bomb shelter left over from someone else’s war.” And “the whole island spreads out horizontal, a dazzle of land undulating and dripping with spidery dew.”Two 29-year-old best friends renew their bond after not seeing each other for five years, and that’s when the main story begins. Incidentally, you’re in for a surprise prologue, too, one of the most electrifying and unpredictable I’ve read in years.After his estranged father, a baby-food executive, dies and leaves him nothing, Ian Bledsoe takes $9000 from the family purse and heads to Patmos to see his friend, Charlie Konstantinou, scion to an obscenely wealthy family. Ian is also trying to escape the rumors of his involvement with dangerous activists in Panama, where he had worked for his father for a while, in a spot where the locals knew that the baby food corp. was exploiting employees as slave labor in subpar working conditions. Ian tried to help the locals, to a bad end. As a last ditch effort to pull himself together, Ian has an idea for a business he wants to pitch to Charlie. Charlie is currently running his own yacht-rental business to tourists on Patmos, and in a serious relationship with Sonny, a beautiful ex-actress from California. When Ian sees Charlie after half a decade, he is reminded of his inferiority—Charlie was best at just about everything: looks, confidence, chess, charisma, success. The one thing Ian was best at was a game they invented and played as kids called Destroyers, the eponymous title of the book. A variable number of men in black balaclavas bursts into the room, and start shooting. What do you do? The game was often played over the phone, using only their wits and imaginations, set in familiar places. It was the one game Ian always won.The story starts building steam with the prologue, and churns up when Ian arrives in Patmos. A sinister menace is palpable on the island, but one step ahead of us. Between the refugees from Syria that wash up on the shores of an already bankrupt Greece, a hippie End Times group of evangelicals living clothes-optional in their cove, ominous monks, shady business associates, eccentrics, and an ex brought here as a surprise, I was deeply engrossed in the natives, the ex-pats, the sun, the sea, and the timelessness that drifts through the narrative.I don’t want to risk any spoilers, so I will say that, although I was satisfied at the end, some readers may feel that the plot wore thin, or that it took too long, and the climax wasn’t persuasive. Some demand that all the threads tie tidily at the end, and others, like me, are content with a few more provocative knots.“It should end with Jude, not John! Do yourself a favor!

I am still glad I read it, as it certainly did raise my Scotland IQ from zero to novice-at-arm’s-reach. The story itself, however, never did have lift off for me. The fictional Bard of Fascaray and the fictional Isle of Fascaray demonstrated the author’s glittering imagination and intelligence for creating this microcosm of setting and character, but I didn’t emotionally connect to the story.The intertextual story alternates between past and present. Mhairi McPhail, academic writer from Brooklyn (by way of Canada), whose marriage to Marco is on the rocks, receives a grant to research her beloved (fictional) Scottish poet, the bard of Fascaray, Grigor McWatt. Mhairi and Marco both had torrid affairs that I can’t imagine happening around their nine-year-old daughter, Agnes. For a chance to escape and recoup some stability away from Marco, Mhairi takes Agnes to Fascaray to write a full bio on the hard-drinking, curmudgeonly, English-hating poet that moved to the island after serving in WW II. The narrative is divided between Mhairi and Agnes; her research writing titled “The Reimagining of Grigor McWatt;” extracts from the Bard’s editorial column in a newspaper called “The Fascary Compendium;” and poems by many, such as Keats, Robert Louis Stevenson, Percy Shelley, and others, translated into McWatt’s Scots language. Moreover, there are pages devoted to lists of Scots words, such as words describing clouds: berk, goog, thwankin and many more, or words describing wind: attery, bensill, blaud, nizzer (and many more), words describing snow: feefle, fyole, pewlin, sneesl, etc etc, as well as words describing flowers, fog, rain, and on and on. Also tucked inside are recipes, a glossary, and a fictional bibliography relating to McWatt's writings.The drama of the tale focuses on Mhairi attempting to get a factual account of McWatt’s personal life, collected from often unreliable narrators (alive and dead), letters from a lover, extracts from other research, and the collectibles left behind (he died an old man not long before). There are missing pieces that are salient to uncover if Mhairi is to write a thorough and comprehensive story about this enigmatic man’s life. Some of it is comic, like a song McWatt composed off the top of his head in 20 minutes time, but turned out to be the most famous of his work, recorded over and over again by the likes of Bob Dylan and other famous musicians. But McWatt bristled at that song, and how it eclipsed all his “better” work.My problem with the story is that McWatt, although a colorful individual, didn’t lure me in. Even after 577 pages! He never became more than a two-dimensional character to me. Mhairi’s life was somewhat derivative, a common tale told with a different setting. The climax was anti-climactic and the ending was too pat. However, I don’t want to steer readers away, as this is only my opinion, and could be chalked up to reader error, or my failure to get involved. McAffee is a brainy writer, but this esoteric novel left me wanting. Unfortunately, I never felt at HAME with this book (Scots word for home).

The question is WHY he did it, and if he was “morally sane” (insanity without delirium) at the time.This riveting bag of treats and tricks give the reader an ostensible advantage: with all the advances of contemporary criminology, anthropology, and psychology, we of the 21st century should feel superior to what passed as expertise back then, when criminals were primarily classed based on their heredity, mentality, or physiology (such as size of head, brow, or “low” physical attributes). But Burnet has some surprises in store for us, as we are led to the end, perhaps to one conclusion, only to fall into a trapdoor that the author so cleverly placed at our feet. He can get away with it because it is we, the readers, who make the deliberate choices based on each discovery and reveal. The cast of unreliable narrators and the author’s talent to manipulate perspective upend us with its many contradictions. The reader is given clues to Roddy’s nature, but never a consistent picture. This requires a surgical insight into another person’s mind, which we do not posses, and can only strive to connect the dots. “One man can no more see into the mind of another than he can see inside a stone...”.We know early on that Roddy killed his neighbor, Lachlan Mackenzie (known as Lachlan Broad), a malicious, mendacious man who abused his power as village constable to personally persecute the Macrae family. When I started this book, I had zero understanding of 19th century crofting (tenant farming) in the Highlands, but came away with a vivid picture of the patriarchal, hierarchical structure, and the effects of this essentially feudal system--harsh physical labor and deprivation on the poverty-stricken citizens of Culduie (near the Isle of Skye, as I understood it). It was a sociological 360 view of a community in metaphorical chains.I could read this book repeatedly and continue to ponder the veracity of witnesses and experts alike. For example, Roddy was described as a moron; particularly intelligent; a shy child; an idiot who talks to himself; a sexual deviant; an animal lover, an animal abuser. We are asked, as the witnesses are in court, to speculate and conclude what was going on inside Roddy Macrae’s head, and whether he was morally sane when he committed the three murders—“his bloody project.” He admits his guilt to all who ask, and writes a personal account of his crimes at the behest of his consul, Mr. Sinclair, which itself takes up half the book. The rest of the case files includes police reports; medical reports; testimony of some of the nine families that live in this tiny, impoverished community; his father; his schoolteacher; the minister of the parish; so-called expert testimony from a Perth prison surgeon; documents of the trial itself; the whims of the publishing industry; editorial columns in the newspapers; and a short epilogue. The reader is taken on a harrowing journey until the bitter end. And, yet, it is often mordantly comic in tone, despite the heinous accounts of the murders. There’s a chilling Kafkaesque scene where all the crofters are gathered to collect seaweed from the loch to spread on their lots to help nourish the soil, a ceaselessly tiring job that takes all day and is a regular event in the village. After it is completed, Lachlan Mackenzie (Lachlan Broad) directs Roddy’s father to return his seaweed, arbitrarily declaring that, since it was done without permission, he must put his seaweed back into the sea. Another time, Roddy is forced to accompany his father, John, to see the factor, the constable’s overseer. The picture of diminishment is complete here, when John asks to see the rules and regulations, and is thus accused by the factor of trying to subvert the rules and regulations by attempting to familiarize with them. The absurdity of this arbitrary abuse of power by the factor engulfs the Macraes, and leaves them nowhere to turn for justice.HIS BLOODY PROJECT gives so much meat to chew on—the justice system, father-son relationships, the class system, how urban perceives rural in the mid 1800s Scotland, sexual power, propaganda, and much more.

I don’t want to spoil it for readers working it out for themselves, but the author’s sly tricks might keep you scratching your head regarding the approach of ending this book, and beginning the second one. I’ll leave it at that, and just talk about my enthusiasm for his work.Adèle is a young, sullen waitress at the Restaurant de la Cloche, a restaurant/bar in Saint-Louis, a small nothing of a town not far from the border of Switzerland. There’s a regular crowd that frequents the place and plays poker, where quirky loner and creature of habit, Manfred Baumann, joins in the game once a week. The rest of the week after work as a pallid bank manager, he sits at the bar, eyes Adèle in the bar mirror, and ruminates about his empty life.When Adèle goes missing, Inspector Georges Gorski from the local police department starts investigating. He’s a taciturn sort with a visible melancholy, some of which relates to an unsolved murder 20 years ago, when he was a fresh rookie. His appearance in this investigation makes the introverted Manfred uncomfortable, and the story, a slow burn, is primarily focused on his growing paranoia. He doesn’t like to partake much of the human race, except for his rather flaccid social life at the bar, and a regular visit to Strasbourg. He presents with a heavy dose of social anxiety and inability to chat up women without a lot of bumbling. Gorski is not the main subject here, but his presence looms large, especially as the narrative progresses. To Manfred, Gorski is his nemesis; each time Baumann is questioned by the detective, his cage is increasingly rattled. Gorski is a man who dislikes hunches, and prefers to proceed with logic and concrete evidence, not on intuition, so his manner of investigation is incremental and built on logic.The reader, who is privy to Manfred’s present thoughts, is in for a few surprises. The author excels at his craft, with his dark wit and nuanced, sophisticated style. The writing flowed as if it was effortless, but, after the conclusion, reflecting on the architecture of the story, I was even doubly impressed. The author created a scintillating psychological thriller, unpacking his characters and plot with a taut restraint.

I don’t watch Game of Thrones nor do I typically watch battle sagas of the early centuries, but I had a gut feeling about this well-researched novel, and I’m glad I followed my instincts. This historical legend, filled with myth, sorcery, and the harshest landscape imaginable, was rowdy and bloody, rugged and visceral. And a woman stole the show! Hartsuyker created strong, flawed characters that would be considered heinous in modern times, of course. She didn’t sugarcoat them by trying to couch them prettily for 21st century readers, just to pander to modern morals. She stuck to the time, place, and perceptions of the ancient Scandinavian way of life.Ragnvild Eyestein is the primary protagonist, a young man who wants to be counted, and fight back for his land that his grandfather, a powerful king, had secured, but his carousing father had lost, due to the love of drink. Set to marry his childhood sweetheart, Hilda, he is now also old enough to find a mate for his wily sister, Svanhild, rather than leave it in the hands of his betraying stepfather, Olaf. But Svanhild is free-spirited and willful, and wants to speak for herself. The relationship between Svanhild and Ragnvild, dimensional and heartrending, was the locus of the story. Honor and sacrifice are the key ingredients to this tale, filled with savage landscapes and often even more savage men.“Every free man should know how to forge a sword, carve a shield, build a boat, set a trap, and defend himself with a sword, dagger, and ax…” And this novel has it all. I didn’t think I’d enjoy the battle scenes, but they were fascinating, more like chess, with a lot more blood! And I grew attached to the characters, especially Ragnvild and Svanhild.

It also contains important themes of motherhood, friendship, the significance of art, the burden of secrets, and the behaviors of community. The story examines the regimented lifestyle of suburbia vs. the freethinking individual. The eponymous title has both literal and figurative connotation.At the start of the story, we know that a house, belonging to the Richardson family, leaders in their community, is ablaze, with “little fires everywhere” bringing the home to ruin. Moreover, as the story progresses, it mines the undercurrents and conflicts unfolding in the neighborhood, and the inexorable events that ensue when an itinerant mother-daughter move in and casually defy every rule in the well-ordered, tony Shaker Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.In this cookie-cutter suburb, the doyenne set the moral tone of regimental planning and deference to convention. Elena Richardson was an ambitious journalist, but subverted her talent and success (now writing trivial articles for the community paper) after marriage to her attorney husband. Her loving but over-controlling nature is now enforced on her four teenage children. The youngest, Izzie is a strong-willed girl and considered the black sheep of the family. Elena can’t seem to keep Izzie’s independent spirit in check.Elena doubles down on her insistence to community expectations and suppresses the nature and sensitivities that she acquiesced in youth. She inherited property from her parents in the modest part of town and now rents it out to less fortunate individuals with, what she believes, is strong character and willing submission to Shaker Heights principles.In moves the nomadic artist Mia and her intriguing teenage daughter, Pearl, to one of Elena’s rental duplexes. That’s when the seams in the seamless-seeming community start splitting. The Richardson children are drawn to Pearl and Mia, and soon Pearl becomes a regular fixture in the Richardson home. The more that Mia casually ignores shallow convention, the more Elena digs in her heels. Elena’s ability to control events becomes precarious, bringing out her invidious qualities as she attempts to gain control of the mysterious Mia. Exploiting her professional contacts in self-interest, Elena subsequently confronts her own demons, blithely unaware of the consequences.Mia repurposes objects into unique formats and themes, photographs them, and uses techniques that reflect her perceptions of the world around her, which invites the reader into startling and intimate motifs. Elena was captivated by one of Mia’s photographs, of a woman in blurred motion, a tangle of limbs that made her resemble a giant spider. She knew that “artists didn’t think like normal people,” particularly compared to her own stringent lifestyle, and she wanted to keep an eye on Mia, “as you might keep your eye on a dangerous beast.”As the story tightened its coil, I was nearly trembling in anticipation. Ng has impeccable restraint over her narrative, gradually leading to a surprising conclusion, despite the first pages’ foreshadowing. She furnishes a sly portrait of suburbia, where the cracks and fissures that aren’t present in the manicured houses and streets are nevertheless rupturing the very misguided families that the rules aim to defend. The plot simmers and scorches, and the three-dimensional characters are poised to walk off the pages. The dangerous beast within is primed to lose control.

Poised, elegant, and numinous, iNicole Krauss has always delivered 5 star books, but FOREST DARK is easily her best and most mesmerizing one to date. Poised, elegant, and numinous, it also moved me close to tears and left me exhilarated. She explores that liminal space between darkness and light, the internal and external, emptiness and fullness, and between life and death. Two unrelated but connected characters and their stories are linked thematically in their quests for spiritual, immaterial completion. Jules Epstein, a wealthy lawyer, is left hollowed out after the death of his parents and divorce after 30+ years of marriage. After audaciously retiring, giving away all his material wealth, he now seeks fulfillment by pursuing an equitable donation to charity in his parents’ name. The pull of otherness preoccupies his thoughts. ”He had rarely lifted his head above the powerful currents of his life, being too busy plunging through them. But there were moments now when he saw the whole view, all the way to the horizon. And it filled him equally with joy and with yearning.”A charismatic rabbi, insisting that Epstein was a descendant of King David, is pursuing him to attend a reunion of Davidic descendants in Jerusalem. He is convinced that Jules is one of them. The rabbi also intends to inspire Epstein with wisdom and knowledge and to seek elevation toward the transmigration of the soul. “…a broken heart is more full than one that is content: because a broken heart has a vacancy, and the vacancy has the potential to be filled with the infinite.” Nicole (interestingly), a writer of Jewish literature, feels lost and blocked. Her marriage is stagnating, and the only love in their home is the love that she and her husband have for their children. Both Nicole and Jules are compelled to make another trip, a place familiar to both of them. This may be the vision quest journey of each of their lives.An aspect of Nicole’s existential crisis and writer’s block, other than her stilted, loveless marriage, had to do with her philosophical outlook of the mystical, and how it impinged on the narrative form. She understood that, in order to create a story, one must take the chaos of the world—the disorder and incoherence—and obscure it to design a form. But it seemed now misguided to her. The things she wrote, she felt, had a greater degree of artifice than truth, “That the cost of administering a form to what was…formless was akin to the cost of breaking the spirit of an animal that is too dangerous to live with.” It didn’t feel impossible, but it felt elusive, and she hoped that the Hilton in Tel Aviv(where she was conceived) held the promise of its aspiration.In Tel Aviv, Nicole meets an older man, Eliezer Friedman, a retired literature professor and possibly an ex-Mossad agent. He tells the writer that Kafka never died in Prague, but was in fact smuggled to Palestine and tended his gardens for the rest of his days. Friedman wants her to go to this alleged house and also to write, for a screenplay, the conclusion of THE TRIAL, which was incomplete at the end of Kafka’s life—or as Friedman would have it—when he faked his own death. As ambivalent as Nicole is, she was driven to embark on this liminal otherness and achieve self-realization.The writer remembers a book about ancient Greece that went into the ancient Greek word for time, for which there were two: “chronos, which referred to chronological time, and kairos, used to signify an indeterminate period in which something of great significance happens, a time that is not quantitative but rather has a permanent nature, and contains what might be called ‘the supreme moment.’”Both Epstein and the melancholy writer are on similar paths to find the presence in the absence, the Tikkun olam, the transformation of the world, which can only proceed from our own internal transformation. The rarefied denouements to their different narratives are written with utter grace and beauty, as is the whole novel. This is a book I can read repeatedly and continue to be astonished at new discoveries. This is certain to be on my top two books of the year, and receive a special place on my shelf. Nicole Krauss is at the pinnacle of her talent.

I was disappointed to be a protester in a crowd of praise. It took me a while to decide to post a , but, after reading Nicole Krauss’s elegantly poised and unique new novel, FOREST DARK, that contained some parallel themes, I felt unsatisfied and turned off by David Grossman’s story.The framework was clever and easily captured my attention. A stand-up comic, Dov Greenstein, now in his 50s, is at the end of a career that I believe was illustrious in a dive-joint sort of way. The narrative covers one long night, in which Dov has invited a retired judge, Avishai Lazar, that he knew briefly but intensely in his childhood, a man who was a standby witness to a tragic event, and who Dov, for reasons that are gradually revealed over the course of the story, wants as a witness to his unraveling.The set-up is Dov doing his act for one last time, with another surprise guest that may or may not have been invited (it’s anyone’s guess), an old woman who was a neighbor where Dov grew up bullied and ostracized. Dov’s only outlet and safeguard was to walk on his hands, where others left him alone and he could see the world from an upside down perspective. What the reader reads is Dov nakedly revealing this childhood tragedy for the first time since it occurred, the incident that negatively affected him and pierced his life and shattered his optimism forever.The problem I had was that I didn’t believe him at all as a stand-up comic. His jokes weren’t funny—they were puerile. If that was meant to be, then how did he earn a reputation or become a star of the dive bar comic joints? He would have been booed off the stage. I was led to believe that, aside from the secret he divulged about a day in camp when everything changed, the rest of the shtick was an obnoxious rant. Was this supposed to be a Lenny Bruce type of act? Well, even now, Lenny Bruce’s act would probably be obsolete in contemporary performances. Comedy has evolved, but Dov’s routine was basically repugnant and repetitive. I found myself removed from the narrative, as it felt inorganic and pretentious, except for the horrific incident that the act is central to. The stand-up routine felt gimmicky and sticky. However compelling his childhood tale, the framework within which it was told, and required, fell flat. One could argue that “it was supposed to be that way,” but I don’t believe that it was consistent for the character to have such a reductionist and trivial act. I would have walked out way before some of the audience did. But, the central, harrowing story was disturbing and dreadful. I give 5 stars for the poignancy of that event. My  plunges to 2 stars due to the way it didn't work for me.Contextually, I couldn’t shore up enough genuine emotion, as the horrifying event from almost half a century ago was “presented” in what I believe was a distracting, untalented way. He, Dov Greenstein, ruined its impact with his juvenile, insufferable act. Perhaps he was meant to be callow, but it didn’t convince me that his stage routine was ever meritorious, and certainly not worthy of the appalling suffering he endured. In the end, I was too weary to invest; I had already checked out. I do not mean to be disrespectful of a writer who has won such a lofty prize—the Man Booker—and this is my humble opinion, not a statement of fact. I wish I had been on board like so many others, but the story failed to reel me in or compel me to invest in his stage presence or performance. However, I do feel much empathy for the fictional character’s suffering. I don’t want to steer others away from this book, because what is not my cuppa was considered a masterpiece by many critics. I recommend to read it and see for yourself....more",Notes are private!,1,18,1,"Jul 20, 2017","Jul 21, 2017","Aug 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30408033-a-horse-walks-into-a-bar

Molly Patterson brings to life women who rebel against societal and family expectations to follow love and personal desires beyond their circumscribed roles. Although the Boxer Rebellion in China is a central event in the story that ties several characters together East and West, it is a different kind of rebellion that Patterson taps. She mines the rebellions of the heart and of woman during the eras that preceded modern feminism.Louisa leaves her comfortable Illinois trappings in order to follow her new husband to a rural farm to toil in hardship and raise her children on the farmstead. She accepts subservience to her husband and rarely questions this life. However, her sister, Addie, who follows her husband to rural China to practice missionary work, breaks through her oppression in surprising ways when she meets a fiery, independent missionary. Juanlan, a recent college graduate in 1999 China, sacrifices her independence to help manage her parents’ struggling hotel in a rural China town. Hazel, a young farm widow in Illinois in the 1950s, is Louisa’s daughter. Raising her children alone on the prairie, she battles against the bank to keep her farm. As Hazel grows closer to her neighbors, George and Lydie, she enters into a reckless season that defies her upbringing.Juanlan feels “a live wire inside her, a little burning blue coil,” which applies to Addie and Hazel, also. Even Edith, Hazel’s sister, who doesn’t get enough stage time, itches to break out of the box she was raised in. Unfortunately, she was offstage most of the book, although I thought her story had more meat and sizzle than Juanlan’s, whose story fizzled and felt more jejune and frustrating to me as a reader after the first half of her narrative.This is a densely populated and lengthy novel that takes its time pulling the related threads together, and the theme of rebellion, which crosses time and geography, is the standout trope. Patterson is a fine writer who establishes the setting and period with such clarity that I was immediately invested in her story. Her female characters were intricately portrayed, including a surprise turn of the century feminist named Poppy, whose charisma was threatening to the status quo. The men, lacking much definition, were mainly furniture in these cruel surroundings, locales whose manifestations by the author are intimately felt as I turned the pages.There is copious stark beauty in these pages, with dialogue and character to match. My biggest issue was it could have used some condensing; it would not have reduced impact or character, as Patterson’s style is so thoughtful that there was no peril of reductionism—(leave that to authors like Kristin Hannah and that ilk). Patterson is a classy writer who shapes and contours her women so that they could easily walk off the pages. But I did get weary at the minutia and, had it been more compressed, would have added some of the missing tension.

An epic that spans seventy years and 600 pages, it has a picaresque dash, but, within is a heart-wrenching story of one adopted man’s secret—that he is gay—in an Irish theocracy that doesn’t tolerate it. A heinously mean and hypocritical priest threw his biological mother, Catherine, out of the church in west Cork when she was pregnant with him, in 1945. This was done in front of the entire congregation. Later, it was discovered that the priest fathered two children. Catherine goes to Dublin and gives up Cyril for adoption. Well-to-do Maude Avery, a literary writer and dogged chain-smoker, and Charles, a tax-evading, scandal-raising father, raise him. They always remind Cyril, “You are not a real Avery,” and in fact tell him he will not inherit anything, and at age 18 his tenancy will be finished. Cyril accepts this and doesn’t complain.When Cyril meets Julian Woodbead at age seven, the son of his father’s lawyer, he secretly forms a serious crush on the same aged boy, who he meets again later in boarding school. “Even at that tender age I knew that there was something about me that was different and that it would be impossible ever to put right.” Cyril and Julian form a friendship that lasts until Cyril leaves for Amsterdam during an unforgettable event. In Amsterdam, he is able to be openly gay, finally, and finds the love of his life, Bastiaan, an infectious disease doctor who tends to those suffering from AIDS. Life opens up for Cyril, now living free from identity fear, but also fills him with somber empathy when he meets some of Bastiaan’s patients. The story then takes us to NYC, and then again back to Ireland. Except for a stint at the Anne Frank house, life as a civil servant agrees with him.I wrote a rather abbreviated chain of events that are just light containers of the heavyweight narrative beneath. In lesser hands, this could have been a story dishing out rage, platitudes, and contrivance. However, despite the several coincidences and a few straw men and women that Boyne inserts, the author is a generous writer who maintains a soulful, droll (oh, the dialogue is flawless!) character-driven story. What we see is a reasonable, ordinary and entirely normal man with noble aspects and fatal flaws. Cyril is quiet observer who is surrounded by a host of commonplace and eccentric characters, including his adoptive parents, who are assuredly offbeat and oddball. And nothing is commonplace in Boyne’s descriptions. His parents, not unkind, named him after a pet spaniel they once owned, and often treat him like he, too, is a pet of the house. But they talk to him like he is an adult, often forgetting his presence as meaningful. ‘“Do you enjoy being a writer?” asks Julian, age seven, to Maude. “No, of course not. It’s a hideous profession. Entered into by narcissists who think their pathetic little imaginations will be of interest to people they’ve never met.”’ Then, Cyril inquires why Maude doesn’t like people to read her books (she is in full contempt of popular, blockbuster books, and the less who read her books, the better), she replies, ‘”For the same reason that I don’t walk into strangers’ houses and tell them how many bowel movements I’ve enjoyed since breakfast.”’ The book is littered with quirky conversations, people, and events. But Boyne never loses track of the plot—solid and steady—or Cyril, who is in most every scene. The motif of identity is prevalent, but also, the question of what makes up a family is ripe in the themes.

Irish author Sally Rooney has written a thoroughly engaging, literary, but highly accessible contemporary novel about friendsWhat a surprise sleeper! Irish author Sally Rooney has written a thoroughly engaging, literary, but highly accessible contemporary novel about friends and acquaintances that installed me by the first page, and kept enticing me further into the narrator, Frances’s, head and heart until the bittersweet end. Unsentimental, unsparing, and droll, laced with a dash of mordant wit, the questionably reliable narrator is yet full of candid observations and uninhibited confession. Her insights into human nature are spot-on and shot through with barefaced shame and naked disclosures. But, with all her exterior cool, ironic flair, she won't admit to being self-destructive.Written in a journaling style, the lack of quotations aren’t pretentious or flippant—they are necessary to retain the personal intimacy, but easy to parse. You never question who is speaking; you only wonder how reliable, at times, is the veracity of her perception of events. But, when we chronicle our own stories, there’s always the dangling issue of the subjective. But Frances, in her choice of words and openness, is quite convincing and persuasive. When Frances engages in an illicit affair, her judgment and alliance to the facts could be jettisoned by her point of view. Or these are the questions that I found myself asking. The absence of quotation marks are fitting to remind the reader that Frances is at the center of her story, and what is de facto spoken by her and others is less important than the struggle and the consequences.Bobbi and Frances met in a posh middle school. Both are artists—Frances a poet, and Bobbi a performer of dramatic monologues and anti-war ballads. They perform Frances’s poetry at spoken word events. By day, Frances is working as an unpaid intern at a literary agency, with no firm plans for the future. Bobbi, a super wealthy trust fund baby, is considered the charismatic and beautiful one, always looking for a cause, but seriously political and sincere with her Leftist principles. They meet married photographer and writer Melissa at an event, and after a bonding night out, Melissa asks to do a feature article on them, and they agree. Eventually, this leads to an affair between Frances and Nick.Bobbi and Frances were lovers in high school, but have remained best friends since breaking up after a year. Frances realizes that Bobbi is prone to narcissism, and accepts this as part of her charm. Frances’s journal entries, laced with irony, bring the reader closer to her, because she often reveals more in her words said insouciantly than she intends. She’ll often make a casual remark that unintentionally stings, and imparts pathos. “If we were both going to die in a burning building and he could only save one of us, wouldn’t he certainly save Melissa and not me? It seemed practically evil to have so much sex with someone who you would later allow to burn to death.”I can imagine readers intensely hating all the characters, but I possess a soft spot for difficult characters that may be hard to like but are immediately and recognizably human. The story is a triangulating affair but in four-square mode, and so much is observation and reflection that it makes the almost clichéd plot (in lesser hands) appear original. It isn’t what actually happens that is so unique—affairs and messy marriages have been going on in life and in literature since time itself. Rather, the excitement is in Frances’s writing--her mixture of emotional and analytical surveillance and infinitesimal scrutiny of her situation and of those involved. But within her candid audit, did she lose herself or find herself? The finale, as it were, is not revealed until the very last sentence. And, even then, it is written organically, in that nothing ends at the end of a novel, but is only a stopping point for the rest of life to continue, and to provoke the reader into thought and discussion of what comes next.

Not because of her wealth, or her dysfunctional family, or her desperate sounding love life. No, she is a standout because she is charged in the murder of her teacher, her boyfriend and her best friend in a high school shooting. “I killed them. I killed Amanda. I killed Sebastian. And it wasn’t out of love. We can say whatever we want about it—I still did it.”But is Maja really the guilty party, or is the culprit the curse of a virulent society and parents who worship wealth and class distinction? Her parents, once learning that Maja was dating the son of one of the wealthiest men in Sweden, practically foisted Sebastian on her themselves, even when she was trying to let him go. Despite the fact that Sebastian’s father was a monster, nobody—not her parents, his business associates, or the media wanted to look behind the curtain at his true and reprehensible nature.As Maja narrates her story, she gradually fills in the background and preceding events leading up to these three weeks of the trial. Instead of merely focusing on courtroom drama, the novel zeroes in on the media effect, the criminal justice system, society’s perceptions of morality, the attitude towards immigrants, teen culture, drug culture, mental illness, friendships, family, loyalty, and loneliness, among other subjects. Giolito paints an exquisitely nuanced portrait of a girl overwhelmed by the forces that surround her. Is she an unreliable narrator? I asked myself, how reliable can anyone be if she doesn’t know the answers that could uncover the truth? There is madness everywhere, and you will find yourself, from the opening pages, asking whether the defendant is also the persecuted, or is she a cold and calculating sociopath, or an impulsive, unraveled teenager.This is a measured and penetrating portrait, but towards the latter half, I think it could have been culled, as it stuttered a bit and reproduced the same information in a cumbersome and winding manner. However, this is a small complaint against a generally weighty and absorbing novel that kept me fascinating up until the inevitable conclusion.

Benjamin BlIn 1599, when this novel takes place, Prague was the cultural center of Europe and known for the merger of alchemy, science, and the arts. Benjamin Black aka Booker Prize winner John Banville, departs from the hard-boiled detective novels and laces this historical novel with palace intrigue and an atmospheric and latticed murder mystery. The author does a fine job of installing the reader in this era, with the beauty of the city as the setting of court rivalry, dangerous chicaneries, and lurid passions.Christian Stern, a scholar for Regensburg, Germany, has left his country to look for a place in the Holy Roman Emperor’s court, alongside other learned men of science and alchemy. On his first night there, he discovers the body of a young woman lying in the snow, blood surrounding her, a “black round in which the faint radiance of the heavens faintly glinted.” She turns out to be the daughter of the court physician and a recent mistress of Rudolph II. The traveler’s first name, Christian, appeals to Emperor Rudolph II, although not to other jealous superiors of the court, and the Emperor tasks Stern with finding the murderer of his beloved mistress. This saves his life, which had been threatened by other senior court officials, but the tension mounts as Stern becomes an Emperor’s favorite, as well as a lover one of Rudolph’s mistresses. However, the plot thickens like pork gravy as clues to the murder are thin, and Stern finds himself chasing down rabbit holes and confronted by men who are deceitful, mistrustful, and shrewder more than Stern.There are some caricatures, like a cruel dwarf, but the broody Stern, surrounded by gossip, surveillance, and lots of snow and game women, is kept on his toes as others are snapping on his heels.

Let go of your idea of dysfunctional family and get ready for a vitriolic blast from first to last. Mother is 82 or so when the novel opens, and her seven living children—two are writers—are a product of her conniving, belittling, manipulative, wrathful-deity ways. At times, I squirmed vocally while reading. You may never have read such a cruel, demanding, willful, spiteful, petty, savage mother in literature. Short of murder, this may be the worst behaving mother I’ve seen in literary history. Yet she somehow delivers her spite with a façade that appears kind and fair to those outside the family. The kids, now middle-aged, are a furious, depressing lot, some more than others. The story is narrated by one of the writer sons, Jay.There isn’t much of a plot, but if you like character-based novels, MOTHER LAND is a seething, full cup for your Schadenfreude enjoyment. It is long, even exhausting with the boiling rage overflowing and ceaseless, at times repetitive. But, the writing is first class, and the emotional turmoil is authentic and gasp-inducing. Jay is likely the most insightful, although the other writer, Floyd (a bed-wetter as a child) is the most intellectually privileged, whose scholarly put-downs and schemes make for a perilously engaging scoundrel worth a blue ribbon for best wolf.The novel spans about 20 years going forward; however, the story also goes back in time at intervals, giving the reader a full and comprehensive background for this bickering bunch of shameless brothers and sisters, triumphantly ruled by a reprehensible mother. Only a talent like Theroux can bring it on so thickly without turning this family into caricatures. Instead, it is frighteningly genuine, with tender empathy couched between the caustic parade of poison doled out by mother and her brood.What is all this provocative toxicity for? I am still working that out. It’s more than shock treatment and less than an axe to grind. It’s not until you get to the last few words that you can form your opinion on the balance between damnation and redemption. Despite the malice and rancor, I was greatly satisfied when I finished the book. This isn’t for everyone. If constant animosity and revenge turn you off, it may be difficult for you to be a trouper to the end. I admit, I wondered whether I was going to make it to the end on occasion, puzzled what could possibly persuade me of any changes in anyone here. But, despite its consistent scorn, a nuance in the otherwise sardonic wit, and the drop of humanity now and then that emerged just when you thought you couldn’t take it any more, kept it from freezing my blood.

The narrative focuses most on the citizens of (the fictional town) Howland, Mass., a rural area that attracts the wealthy NYC and Boston elite in the summertime, but the locals still struggle to get by economically. Mark, a talented restorer of houses, was emptied out financially in an investment scam he fell for, which brought him to NYC to an attorney there heading up a class action suit. He arrived on 9/10/01, and was caught in the fear and fervor of the 9/11 tragedy. Once home, he and his wife had taken on a fresh perspective to their stale marriage, and, although Mark’s appointment with the lawyer was suspended until further notice, he vows to make a change for the better.Enter Philip Hadi, a NYC billionaire investment tycoon, seemingly unassuming but dripping with the understated power that comes with the confidence of his position—“a guy who had everything and from whom nothing could be taken away.” Hadi and his wife, who spend holidays in Howland (the house next to Mark’s), have now taken up residence there, due to the fear of staying in NYC. He hires Mark to do security on his house, and the dazzle of wealth attracts Mark, who feels less than equal to Hadi.Dee is seamless at segueing from one character to another, sometimes from one paragraph to the next—from Mark, to his wife, Karen, his daughter, Haley, Mark’s siblings, and other locals in the town. When Hadi takes over the job as First Selectman and saves the town from financial ruin via charitable donations, revenue deficit replenishment, and even paying some of the salaries of government employees, Mark’s cynical brother, Gerry, starts an angry blog, trying to provoke others into anti-Hadi sentiment. The great divide is seen in all its glory—or ingloriousness. Is Hadi good or bad, corrupt or incorruptible? As politics colors the individuals in the story, the reader is taken on this satirical yet poignant journey between 9/11 and the economic bubble burst. Dee is a terse and succinct, controlling his story through a sinewy narrative. I was always ready for the other shoe to drop, so tense was the feeling in my gut as I continued to turn the pages.“…whenever something major happens it’s like everybody wants to insist on their little piece of suffering…they were just overdoing it, I’m sorry. Get over yourselves. You weren’t there, it didn’t happen to you.

He never knew his dad; all he had was an old photo and a promise from his mother to fill in the story when he was older. As far as Marcus’s best friend, Wheezer, there was a falling out between them that almost ended in tragedy, not long before his mother died. Marcus is sensitive, intuitive, bright, polite, and all alone in the world. When he is sent to a beach home in South Carolina the next summer to live with his independent Aunt Charlotte, a spiky, older landscape artist, his life takes on a new texture. Also, his imagination is at its peak, ripe for haunted memories--of the past he recalled, and one he could only envision. On the island, he is met with a ghost of a boy who died in Hurricane Hazel fifty years ago, at an old house known as Grief Cottage. The unfolding of the story is Marcus’s summer of mourning, awakening, and maturity. For nature lovers, the atmospheric, raw landscape provides depth to the story, and Marcus’s absorption in the nesting season of the endangered loggerhead turtles is an emblem of the life cycle.Godwin excels at the tender and unsentimental portrait of Marcus, as well as his relationship with his forthright aunt. I was wary of a narrative about a young boy, especially a ""ghost"" story, but it is told by the older Marcus, now an adult, and not juvenile, stiff, or saccharine. The candid realism of the child was intact, but with a contoured summons of adulthood standing by. Godwin strikes a harmonic balance so that I felt I was reading an adult book about a child’s experiences, without ever losing the young boy’s immediacy and intimacy. “ ’Marcus feels the pain of others,’ said Aunt Charlotte, ‘even when they’re dead and gone.’ ”...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 14, 2017","Jun 16, 2017","Jun 28, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31450969-grief-cottage

Perhaps he isSalman Rushdie is easily in the top 1% best of writers of my generation, a sui generis, world-class prose artist and intellectual giant. Perhaps he is not for everyone, as his postmodern style isn’t always immediately accessible. For me, there’s a little work to be done to settle in, but the payoff is fantastic if you stick with it. I thought Midnight’s Children was one of the most actualized novels ever written, focusing on the independence and partition of India following British rule. Using magical realism and historical allegory, Rushdie created a powerful story about migration and transformation, war and strife, and the children who inherited this history. In his latest novel, Rushdie approaches family, love, immigration, class wars, gender wars, gender identity, social identity, heroism, villainy, the scales of justice, and the question of evil, through the eyes of a self-styled auteur filmmaker, an “imagineer,” a “camera that paints.” Rushdie’s style, in this novel, is realism, rather than magical realism, although magic is meta-referenced and winked at now and then.In THE GOLDEN HOUSE, the narrator, René, a quasi-privileged son of scholars, lives in Manhattan and shares, within his living quarters, some almost biblically beautiful secluded gardens with a titanic tycoon, recently emigrated with his three grown sons from “an unnamed country” (that will be named). It is the Obama era of hope, and René, a documentary filmmaker, wants to endear himself to the Goldens, secluded in their golden mansion, and chronicle and make a smashing film of their lives, past and present. For the first 95 or so pages, the author is introducing his characters and setting up the framework of the story. It is dense, and filled with dozens of literary allusions, both classical and modern. It helps to know (or look up) classical Roman and Greek history and mythology, certainly in order to get the most of the references. For instance, Nero has chosen the name Nero, after the Roman emperor, and pressed his sons to also choose names from classical history. “The man calling himself Nero Golden veiled himself, in the first place, behind dead languages.” His sons became Petronius, or Petya, Lucius Apuleius, or Apu, and Dionysus, or simply D. Even if you skip all the Googling and Wikipedia research, you will eventually be drawn into the Golden House, because Rushdie is a genius at particularizing his cast, meticulously creating unforgettable characters that leap from the pages. At times, René is like the fourth wall hidden, or hiding, inside the bounds of the narrative, both inside and outside the story, the self-concealer not unlike his main man, Nero; two men on different ends of a spectrum, but both struggling with the truth.“These are the times we live in, in which men hide their truths, perhaps even from themselves, and live in lies, until the lies reveal those truths in ways impossible to foretell.”Against the backdrop of the story of Nero, his new lover, his three sons, and René, the political theater is also transforming, as the Obama-era comes to an end. Running for president is a man described by Rushdie as the Joker, and NYC as Gotham City. Perhaps the world has transformed its identity, and the times we live in and the candidate we have chosen are so outrageous that it can best be described as coming from the comics. The chilling, sardonic, but surreally accurate description of the Joker-candidate is worth a read in itself.“And now that so much is hidden, now that we live in surfaces, in presentations and falsifications of ourselves, the seeker after truth must pick up his shovel, break the surface and look for the blood beneath.”Open the book and trust that Rushdie will take you on an explosive, monumental, and impossible to forget journey. The question, in the end, “is the question of evil.”…”sooner or later…the mask must begin to slip.”...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 23, 2017","Jun 26, 2017","Jun 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34128285-the-golden-house

For my first foray, there was comfort in being on the same ground as Nesbø aficionados, who came in to the book without being familiar with any major characters. THE THIRST enticed me, however, largely due to the author’s talent to meticulously architect a complex, vertical and horizontal narrative. And I was not disappointed. Here again, Nesbø scrupulously constructed an eye-popping, cerebral, emotional, and psychological Scandinavian murder thriller that grabbed me from the very first page. I don’t need to give away details that can be found on the product description, or give away any plot spoilers, so I will just share my reading experience.Enough details were given to familiarize myself with Harry Hole, the laconic, gritty, self-contained Oslo police detective that had retired to the profession of teaching and married a loving, strong, and able attorney, an equal in all ways to his stubborn and candid nature. Her son was now a rookie cop himself, with perhaps a tinge of a stain on his record. After a vampiric killer (one who sucks the blood of victims after using a metal mouthpiece [think steam punk] to accomplish this, Harry is blackmailed out of retirement into helping to solve the case. He leads a small team to investigate in parallel to an apt female detective and her large Oslo organization of police. Harry’s small team includes a new, young, bright, and charismatic detective and an older professor, sans PhD that had never been accepted in the academic world, due to his passion for studying “vampirists,” such as this new serial killer is now called, who stalks women he apparently meets on Tinder. Once tragedy strikes Harry’s family, this puts a bit of a wrench in HH’s plans. But, I won’t go into that, since it adds to reader discovery.As Nesbø veterans already know, his books aren’t meant for the faint of heart. Graphic and gritty, yes, but it isn’t gratuitous, either. The complex layers provide exhilarating plot (and subplots), and I am very impressed with the author’s ability to bring new readers into the fold. I did not feel cheated or lost by coming into Harry Hole at this late date, as Nesbø creates a fully formed HH that, with a little former context sprinkled in, allowed me to have a three-dimensional picture of the weathered detective. He even tied in connections and history to a former book, THE POLICEMAN, which weighs critically in this new one, but he didn’t spoiled the former book or make me feel outside the loop.This is a dense but page-turning crime novel that was a delight to pick up each time, to sink deeper and deeper into the gallows of adventure and dark entertainment. It’s not without levity, also, with a terse and understated wit that balanced out the grim and evil aspects of inhumanity.

Her father, a mathematics professor, is a bit eccentric and remote at times, but also full of love for his three daughters. Her mother, a musician, aborted her potential career in order to be a wife and mother. She’s restive and discontent, feeling underappreciated and condescended to by her husband. Neta’s parent’s marriage is vitriolic, largely because of her mother’s labile moods and her father’s frequent absence teaching seminars in the States or working long hours in the city. Of course, there are other, murkier reasons for their precarious marriage. Neta, the oldest, is a survivor of circumstance, a young girl ashamed of many things, not the least of which is herself. Her parents, caught up in their own drama, inadvertently neglect her adolescent pain. She is trying to sort out feelings and information, desires and thought. Although it is pre-feminism, the opinions of women and their role are discussed in Neta's household, often during passive-aggressive debates between her parents.The story is told from Neta’s point of view, but with modification. There are brief parts of the book told in the first person, when Neta is an adult. But Neta primarily refers to herself as “she,"" demonstrating her compartmentalized versions or separate selves--independent adult contrasted with dependent minor. At first, it sounded contrived, but as I settled more fully into the text, it evolved into an organic and singular separation of voice. I can’t find the meaning of Neta in Swedish, but in Spanish it means the truth, or the nature of things, which fits perfectly for the Swedish Neta of this tale. In this largely interior novel, which reads as a memoir cum Bildungsroman, Neta lays it bare for readers--her innermost thoughts, her beliefs, her distortions, and her desires.Intelligent, precocious, and curious, Neta is open to adventure. She experiments with the pleasures of her body and the challenges of her mind. From a neighbor, she absorbs knowledge of atheism and nihilism. From a bohemian aunt and uncle, she also has faith in a fortune foretold—the eponymous title--to her Aunt Ricki, of a future powered by romantic and passionate love. Often, Neta has contradictory beliefs that confound and enlighten her, cleave her as a person divided and joined.“…she was there and somewhere else at the same time. The place where she has been. Or hadn’t. It was like a duplication, a kind of reflection. Like a memory of a memory. She no longer existed. Or she existed in everything.”Darkly witty and unabashedly honest, Neta captures the narrative with her complex psychology, borne of young desires and an attempt to sort out her purpose and place in this world.

I am drawn to British crime dramas, as they are often atmospheric, dark, and haunting. And, based on the cover of this book--shadowy, eerie, with a hint of menace, I assumed it would turn out to be just as spooky as I imagined. But, no, not at all. Rather, it read more like American genre fiction, with a bubbly journalist—too perky, I thought, for her advanced age and experience, and a few high-strung melodramatic women difficult to distinguish from each other, except for the chapter headings with their names. There was a decent plot in here, and it kept me going despite the stock, derivative, and bland characters. The dialogue did nothing to dissuade me, either, of its contrived narrative.Kate, the journalist, was apparently the major character of Barton’s last book, The Widow. There was too much given away about it, though, and left little reason for me to read it in the future, even if I had been initially drawn to do so. I had no idea that the two books were connected by a major character until I read how Kate had starred in the previous mystery. Her temperament was too cooing for my taste, and somehow, everyone she met became so disarmed and confessional towards her, even after bottling up secrets for decades. Yet, there was nothing in Kate’s manner that, in my estimation, would organically bring that about, except for the author’s affected efforts.So why three stars instead of two? I did like the bones of the story, pun intended—the mystery of the buried infant bones. The set-up showed promise, and an initial discovery added more mystery and twist, so that I wanted to see how it would all be revealed. However, by the time the case was solved, I had figured most of it out already. But I think Barton was trying to write a social commentary on class justice as much as she wanted to piece together an apt crime thriller, but I think the forced nature of it brought too many compromises in the storytelling. The villains were villainous, the victims were sensitive, and Kate was indulgent. I kept turning the pages, anyway.2.75...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,Apr 2017,Apr 2017,"May 19, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32054095-the-child

And I was on board for the Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro series—for a while, until I felt that Lehane was phoning it in. His stand-alone Live by Night wasn’t up to the standard of The Given Day, either. But I am glad I took a chance on this new and vital (and also stand-alone), SINCE WE FELL (look up the one-hit wonder song). This book is, in my opinion, his very best, and demonstrates that he is at the epitome of his talent as a writer. Get ready for a big, brilliant bombshell of a story. You’ll want to call in sick—it is immersive, cinematic, lovingly written-- unputdownable.I am not going to give spoilers, even minor ones. Every new discovery made me tighten my jaw a bit more, and there were plenty of white-knuckle moments, especially in the latter half of the book. However, I was also deeply connected from the beginning, due to Lehane’s acumen for building complexity through character. What Lehane did was fuse character development with plot, both necessary and integral to the book as a whole. Rachel Childs, the fractured and caring journalist, is the fascinating protagonist, and as complex a character as you will ever meet in a suspense story. But even secondary characters in this novel have their own unique imprint—no one was generic or glazed over. The steady burn in the first 200 pages is crucial to installing the reader and hooking you into the story, preparing you for a compelling and superb completion. Every. Character. Is. Believable. And the plot never lets you go.We meet Rachel and learn quickly that she has understandable abandonment issues. Her father left when she was three, barely a flicker of remembrance for Rachel, and her mother, a once-famous writer of marriage books, is like a Susan Sarandon at her most acerbic. Figuratively and literally, Rachel is still searching for her father, and suffering with psychological issues and a cauterized spirit stemming from his departure and her mother’s controlling and often bitter tongue throughout her life. Trust is not easily gained for Rachel. And, after a journalistic trip to Haiti, the troubles intensify.The novel covers themes that work together, in tandem and flawlessly—highlighting abandonment, betrayal, friendship, PTSD, and none so potent a motif as love and trust. This is the kind of love story that can go any which way, and I won’t tell you which way it goes. Of course, the first line of the book’s prologue tells you how love can go wrong. “On a Tuesday in May, in her thirty-fifth year, Rachel shot her husband dead.” That can be a tough act to follow for a lesser talent, but Lehane kicks it up more than a few notches as the story progresses. I was caught up with clenched fists almost every step of the way. There are characters that you warm to, and others you love to hate, but you will be engulfed by events as character and plot move the story forward. Just be patient. This isn’t like the Kenzie novels, with fast action page after page, and it is as much character-driven as plot-driven. They inhabit the narrative hand-in-hand, which I can’t restate enough. And there are moments, events, and dialogues that grip you to the end. As Rachel’s mother warned her on page two:“A man is the stories he tells about himself, and most of these stories are lies. Never look too closely. If you uncover his lies, it’ll humiliate you both.

I’ve had a “reader’s crush” on Catton since her first novel, The Rehearsal—about the nexus of theatre and reality. BIRNAM WOOD reinforces my adoration of her writing. She doesn’t use her narrative as a mouthpiece for her stance or posture. Her characters are precise and complex; the pace and tempo are immaculate and powerful, and the plot is exciting, exacting, intrepid, and compelling. And satirical!It’s an ensemble cast, with arguably Mira Bunting as the main protagonist, a 30-something woman who began a volunteer collective gardening group, Birnam Wood, planting sustainable crops in neglected spaces (usually without owners’ permission). It hasn’t evolved much in the five years it has been around; money is tight and it’s a lot of work for people who have other jobs and considerations. But what would happen if an enigmatic billionaire businessman offered to lift them out of their idle state and into a thriving enterprise? How would the power dynamics play out, what are the stakes? Mira’s friend and Birnam partner, Shelley, has one foot out the door—she’s weary of being taken for granted. And adventurer Anthony Gallo has romantic designs on Mira, even though he’s been overseas for four years, and has returned with his own rigid ideology, and is suspicious of the deal blooming with the billionaire, Robert Lemoine, and Birnam Wood. Lemoine is the surveilling shapeshifter,, piloting a plane when he wants to look in on his assets. He’s also building a Doomsday bunker, a luxe underground dominion. Then there is recently knighted Sir Owen Darvish and his wife, Lady Darvish, who own the land near Korowai National Park and Korowai Pass, in Thorndike, where there was a deadly landslide, and near where Birnam Wood would plant. Sir Owen had other designs until the landslide happened, and now Lemoine wants to buy it, and they are at the tip of making agreements. Dark deals and secret agendas simmer, and you’ll be admitted to the furtive world of drones, surveillance, and other murky activities afforded the obscenely rich. I admit to my preference for the third person pov. The plot opens up, is more expansive, and you can get behind all the characters. We know the stakes, most of the veiled plans and covert motivations. Our insight into the cast is uninhibited. The pages will burn as they turn, never a dull moment or a pretentious passage, the characters drive the satire of the story. It all builds to a riveting denouement—I uttered a few loud expletives along the way. I honestly did not want this unputdownable book to end, I wasn't ready to say goodbye.

BuIf you’ve ever read Maurice Sendak’s children’s books, you may recognize the central but now dead (mort) character in Glass’s new novel, Mort Lear. But don’t expect him to be modeled entirely after Sendak; this is not a bio or even a “faction” of the great artist’s life. Instead, this is Glass’s original creation, about adults attempting to actualize their lives in a continuum of age and experience.After an accident that kills Lear, his live-in assistant, Thomasina “Tommy” Dulair, is named Executrix, and inherits his house in the Connecticut woods, the land, and a tidy sum of money. This does not please her; in fact, the future and her further obligations to her boss and friend trouble her. For over thirty years, she has been his assistant—many of these years his live-in assistant, who was his Jackie-of-all-trades, directing and organizing all of his professional obligations. Lear was increasingly reclusive as the years passed, and Tommy was indispensable to him.At 55, Tommy was hoping to finally find a path separate and independent of Mort’s life, and perhaps repair the relationship with her estranged brother, Dani, who was unknowingly the model for Mort’s main character in his best-selling book, “Colorquake.” Not only does she have a mountain of decisions and legacy requirements, she now has to accommodate a five-day visit from Nicholas Greene, the British actor and recent Oscar-winning heartthrob, who made plans with Lear to come stay at his house in order to “study” Mort’s life. Nick is doing his homework/groundwork to star in a biopic of the American Lear, playing the late, great icon’s most relevant years, the beginning and next several decades of the artist’s crowning success. A child actor will play Mort’s early years, when he endured unforgettable personal trauma that shaped him as an artist and an individual.One task that Tommy keeps putting off is dealing with Merry Galarza, a museum director who expected to receive Lear’s estate, and was shocked to be shunned. This now consigns the museum to a shaky future. Like Tommy, Merry is single, childless, and, as allegory to the museum, at a loss about her future.Rounding out the cast is Mort’s one time great love, Soren, a flamboyant partier who died of AIDS, and caused friction between Tommy and Mort due to Soren’s emotionally immature and reckless behavior. His character was the least engaging, however, as his flamboyance and illness were treated with mostly pat and derivative execution. It didn’t bring anything new to the table about either the tragedy of living with AIDS (before the latest life-saving medicines), or tortured relationships.The book as a whole shines tantalizingly, as Glass hefts Mort, Tommy, Nick, Dani, and to a lesser extent, Merry, with a robust background that allows the reader to understand the fragile, struggling, and striving children within the adults. The narrative gives weight to the pressure of celebrity, “All celebrity does is arrange and spotlight your foibles as if they were mannequins in a shop window…you become a parade unto yourself, but if you are diligent and have a decent sense of direction, you determine the route.” Nicholas considers Lear’s celebrity while anxious about his own.Moreover, there are philosophical questions that are mined: what is a full life, and what makes us whole? Do we establish our identity through the prism of others, is life a theater where we are merely players, or can we become our genuine selves, comfortable in our own skin? Glass also explores sons raised by distressed single mothers, albeit in different eras, and examines how our childhood experiences affect our behavior and trust in others as adults.A few protracted scenes and events could have been redacted or tightened, but overall it was a thoughtful, character-driven, and highly engaging sixth novel from Julia Glass....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"May 02, 2017","May 07, 2017","May 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32337896-a-house-among-the-trees

When I would sit down to read, the world shrank, and all the other books on the shelf went temporarily fuzzy. There was no book but this one on my mind. It has everything—character, plot, theme, atmosphere, dazzle, wit, drama, adventure, comedy, originality, and the ability to install me immediately. I never wanted to come back from its depths. There’s even a man who I fell in love with—move over, Mr. Darcy.This is Victorian times in 19th century London, plus a small, marshy, obscure coastal town in Essex, a place where the myth of the Essex Serpent is still alive and well. Cora Seaborne, a self-made naturalist, has finally been freed from the bonds of an abusive but wealthy husband, and, kindled by the legend of the serpent, which has been around since the 17th century, takes her companion, Martha, and her quirky, idiosyncratic, and bright eleven-year-old son, Francis, there for a long stay. (In these modern times, Francis would be diagnosed with autism). She befriends William Ransome, an enigmatic Reverend, and his wife, Stella, an ill woman with an optimistic, shiny disposition, and a love for the color blue.Stella and Francis, with a love of found treasures like feathers and glass, form a bond. Cora, with her man’s jackets and assertive and inquisitive mind (an atheist), and her intellectual Mary Anning-like mind and love of artifacts, forms a unique relationship with William, full of debate and a competitive respect for each other. There’s Dr. Luke Garrett, or the Imp, as Cora calls him, the doctor that tended to her husband. He is an outrageous, wily, beetle-browed, arrogant but superior surgeon, and in love with Cora. Martha befriends the Imp’s colleague, Spencer, a rich man in love with her and joins with her goals to stop the immorally managed housing projects of the poor.Cora, with her large-boned and tall stature, unruly long hair, and intelligent and sharp tongue, was my favorite, and the darkly moody and rugged Ransome was close on her heels. Their letters back and forth--in fact, all the epistolary parts of the book, often encapsulated the concerns of the times, such as faith vs. science and enlightenment, the class system, and early feminism. In fact, not unlike the issues we face today! Then there’s the serpent, omnipresent, seen but not seen, and blamed for the deaths of people and animals all over the coast. The serpent is a metaphor for fears, great and small, and superstitions, as well as a symbol for evil. The idea of the Essex serpent snakes it way through all the themes and issues.Sarah Perry beautifully portrays the haunting atmosphere of the Victorian era; however, she demonstrates that not all Victorians are prudish, primitive religious types afraid of science and sex. And it is decidedly not a cheap bodice-ripper. This is a sublime, sophisticated, sardonic, and wonderfully sepia-toned narrative with a twisty, pulsating plot and the most fully dimensional characters I’ve read in “contemporary Victorian” literature. I couldn’t put it down, and the characters were so realistic and animated that I truly felt that they inhabited my heart and soul, stepping off the pages into my life.

For the most part, I avoid the series genre of crime dramas, because the main character typically has minimal depth, especially after being established with the first novel. Things happen to them as they solve crimes, but they tend to be morally unambiguous, or contrite once they’ve acted in arrant ways. However, Ruth and her crime-solving accomplice from the police force, DCI Harry Nelson, are both morally flawed individuals with professional integrity. They are paired in a contradiction of probity and impropriety, yet their humanity is still stirring and surprising. Nelson’s wife has had her own blemishes, but is accepting of the out-of-wedlock young daughter that Harry and Ruth had together eleven years ago. The good doctorate and Nelson continue to be drawn together, in their work and in their desires.In this ninth installment, human bones are found in a chalk mine in Norwich, and a homeless person (rough sleeper) goes missing, which again brings Harry and Ruth together, as well as other recurring characters, such as Harry’s colleagues, Judy Johnson and David Clough, as well as Johnson’s partner in love and life, Cathbad, the Irish druid and spiritual luminary of the group. There are rumors that Barbara, the rough sleeper, has gone “Underground,” which is a cryptic euphemism that adds to the mystery, since nobody seems to know what that means.To add more riddles, a college student has come to Nelson to report that she and a gaggle of friends were out driving at 3 am and saw a Jesus-type character seem to appear in the street and then, just as suddenly, vanish. And now there is a huge pothole in the ground that is perplexing the city. All these mysteries are approached from all sides by the capable police department and Ruth. Hanging on and pressing for the bones to be dated is Quentin Swan, an industrious entrepreneur that must cease building his underground restaurant until it is determined whether there has been a modern crime—or ancient bones.I would give a 4.5 for the characters, interactions, and the wonderful detail to subplots, such as little Kate’s first role as an actress in an odd obscure play. But, in the end, it is the mystery that we desire to indulge in, we are wanting to be enthralled from beginning to end. But, when the wrap-up comes about, it was delivered too handily, too facilely, and all the tension boiled out of it in one overheated, unsophisticated moment. It was fairly predictable, and went on to some overweening positives that came out of the whole shebang. I did like that a thread remains loose, probably to link to the 10th installment, but I was already disappointed in the denouement.

Like King, Victor LaValle ably mines the struggles of ordinary families, and intertwines extraordinary circumstances, via supernatural horror and gristle. He does this to emphasize bitter realities—a palimpsest of fractured Maurice Sendak fables, with strained domestic life that ironically underscores rather than distracts from everyday family problems. What I like better about LaValle is that he does it without platitudes, but still executes a fantastical morality tale. Or is it a cautionary tale? I don’t want to reveal what the reader will discover inside these pages.It starts with the love of a Ugandan immigrant, Lillian Kagwa, a statuesque beauty, and a white parole officer, Brian West. They meet in NYC, marry, and have a son, Apollo. But, unfortunately, Brian leaves—vanishes—when Apollo is just a child. Lillian’s love and formidable endurance carry on, raising Apollo with commitment and strength, albeit with a few mistakes. But it was difficult being a single mother in New York in the 70s and 80s.After Brian vanishes, Apollo has a specific and recurring nightmare about his father, which introduces the dreamlike, supernatural elements of the book. Complete with steamy clouds and vapor, his father both frightens and promises him with his presence and absence. There was also the day that Brian leaves a gift—a box of memories—at the door, which just ratchets up the immediacy of the subsequent dreams.Tucked in the box among the various memorabilia is a children’s book by Maurice Sendak. Outside Over There, which Brian nightly read to Apollo when Apollo was a wee child. If you are familiar with this tale (not as well known as Where the Wild Things Are), then you have a jump start on the narrative’s parable—or a parable of a parable. I was not familiar with it, so the gradual reveal was another nugget of surprise for me.Apollo becomes the main protagonist of the story. He become an antiquarian book dealer, naming his business Improbabilia, and traverses all the NYC boroughs and sometimes beyond in order to seek out great finds. He meets, falls in love, and marries the lovely Emma Valentine, and they have a son. The birth scene alone has cinematic optics.As the tale settles on Apollo and Emma’s life with baby Brian, the suspense escalates with the creepy chill of things that go bump in the night—or broad daylight. LaValle keeps the narrative propulsive with a superb plot and rich characterizations. The 400+ jumbo-sized pages never feel cumbersome, because you’ll be too busy turning them with relish. The climax is both classic and contemporary, with ancient myths and modern technology fused together. But LaValle has utter control of his themes—of courage in devotion to family, and the lengths we will take to protect the people we love. I felt fatly satisfied when I finished this extravagant tale.Random fact: Interesting that Maurice Sendak features in another book being published this year, Julia Glass’s A House Among the Trees, a very different kind of book than LaValle’s.

He doesn’t intrude on his story, but rather serves as a lens to this portrait of migrants, refugees, and communities, many in the midst of uprisings or dangerous living conditions. It is almost fable-like, except for the harsh and also tender realities of the relationships between individuals and their sense of identity and home. What gives us the fable-like structure is how people move between countries (a metaphor for a visa, but so unlike one)—and the fact that the two named protagonists are from an unnamed country--probably the Middle East, based on their names, Nadia and Saeed—allowing the reader to put aside distracting geopolitics in favor of an intimate story of immigration, from East to West, and how it affects and touches everyone.Nadia and Saeed meet at a class in their city in their unnamed country. Although Nadia is an independent feminist living on her own, and decidedly irreligious, she chooses to wear the distinguishing black robe (from neck to toe) of her nation. Saeed, although a praying man, was fairly liberal and certainly tolerant of individual beliefs or customs. He prays, but not regularly, at least when they first meet. Their attraction leads to regular dates, where they enjoy strolling, eating out, getting high on weed, and even experimenting on psychedelic mushrooms. Things develop nicely, despite Saeed’s reluctance to have sex until marriage, until the city becomes unsafe to live in. Militant uprisings, government response, and civilian disorder at points make it impossible to stay and be sure of safety.Hamid keeps the story moving and the people, too. Although primarily focused on Nadia and Saeed, he sprinkles in other characters, often for a poignant cameo, to sharpen his themes of migration and also, occasionally, to expand the definition of what it is to be a migrant. For example, there is an old woman in Palo Alto, California, who has lived only in one home, despite her children and other family members who have gone away or died, and the presence of others who have moved into her neighborhood:“…every year someone was moving out and someone was moving in, and now all these doors from who knows where were opening, and all sorts of strange people were around, people who looked more at home than she was,…and when she went out it seemed to her that she too had migrated, that everyone migrates, even if we stay in the same house our whole lives, because we can’t help it.”The world had moved for this old Chinese woman who had lived her whole life in Palo Alto, and will continue to move, as it will for all of us, people uprooting and resettling, crossing countries, nations, and perhaps meeting all new natives, and other immigrants, and even running into people from your own country. And what about those we leave behind? This is highlighted, also, in EXIT WEST. We are all migrants, in one way or another. Hamid doesn’t speak for them, or tell us what it means.

But few have written in-depth about the wives that hold down the fort at home, and how they endure when the men are away. You Know When the Men Are Gone, Fallon’s rich and formidable first book, interconnected stories about the army wives at Fort Hood, placed her squarely as a commander of this new and exciting, and necessary genre. Now, with her second book, a novel focusing on two officers and their wives in Jordan during the Arab Spring, Fallon proves that she can sustain her talent about the wives’ own travails. After all, she is herself an army wife of an officer stationed in Dubai. She’s tackled the confusion of languages in a foreign country, both literal and sublime.Fallon set her addictive novel during this time in 2011, set against this background, but did not intrude with any authorial intent. I think it was clear that nobody can parse the Middle East conflicts with any overwhelming confidence, and that wasn’t Fallon’s intent. Instead, she focused on two couples, and brought the narrative down to an intimate level, inside the lives of these four people, particularly the women. The prose is straightforward, unembellished, with the occasional well-placed and organic spotlight on the etiology of a word “Because words are beautiful and weird enough all by themselves.”Cassie and her officer husband Dan Hugo have been in Jordan for two years. Childless, Cassie is often lonely while trying to fill up her days. Enter Margaret and Crick Brickshaw, and their toddler son, Mather, fresh from the States. Cassie reaches out immediately to Margaret to help her assimilate to life as an army officer’s wife. This book primarily focuses on the push-pull of their friendship. Two women, who couldn’t be more at variance outwardly, but inwardly, may share more than meets the eye.Margaret sees the striking Cassie as similar to the big-boned women of the 1800s. “She ought to have her hair in a bun at the back of her neck and be sawing off gangrenous legs in a battlefield. Someone who knows how to get things done.” But as Cassie perceives the willowy, lithe blonde Margaret, “…Margaret is a force of minor collisions, setting off small earthquakes, never thinking about what her tremors might rearrange or crack.” This oscillation in their friendship—Cassie conducting herself decorously and by the book, and Margaret violating the rules or language of the land, between herself and protocol, or toward the native Islamic people, provides both levity and tension, and downright suspense. She’s like a butterfly out of the chrysalis, a bohemian rhapsody unto herself at times, while she struggles to be a new wife and mother. Their relationship moves the book forward in unpredictable ways, sometimes careening off the pages!Speaking of minor collisions, the opening pages begin in media res, right in the thick of action, so to speak. Margaret, or Mar—-“Mar, from the Middle English marren, from the Old English mierran, to impede. To spoil. …”—has gotten in a minor car accident, and the thrust of the novel takes place while Cass is babysitting Mather at the Brickshaw home while Margaret is ostensibly at the police station, filing the necessary papers via protocol. As Cass waits for hours for Margaret to return, she gets bored, and starts reading her friend’s private journal. Fallon sets up a superbly constructed narrative, the present timeline of Cassie waiting, and the journal itself a meta-chronology or agency of the recent past and present through Margaret’s eyes, and Cassie’s interior responses. The author’s impeccable conception ushers the reader intimately into the tilt and lurch of the women’s perceptions, fears, and desires. The character portrayals are exquisitely full, vulnerable, barbed, and surprising, alternately zooming in on the friends and examining how their differences intersect into relevant connections. Moreover, it comes with an electrifying denouement!And what are we waiting for with Cass? What does this book say to us and what are Fallon’s themes, as we peek into Margaret’s journal? Friendship, jealousies, betrayals, sadness, fears-- reaching out, drawing back, through biting, sharp, and tender moments between these two women and their husbands, and even towards this misbehaving baby? I saw a quote by Henry James that the author placed squarely on one of her author blogs or pages, which is fundamental to the thesis of this novel:“Three things in human life are important: the first is to be kind; the second is to be kind; and the third is to be kind.” It boils down to that, between the two women, and the times that kindness may be missing when it is needed. Is it too late to repair and amend some self-hypocrisies? As Margaret stated, “Oh the mental anguish of trying to be nice!  Kindness,  I reminded myself. Just be kind.  Right and wrong cam be tricky, but kindness, well, kindness has a simplicity I can aim for.” Fallon aims for the heart, and hits her mark every time, with arresting compassion and grace....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Apr 04, 2017","Apr 06, 2017","Apr 05, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32739410-the-confusion-of-languages

He nourishes his mind with the daily paper and nuggets of literature, but he feeds his body with high volumes of the wrong cholesterol and carbs. One day, after buying his typical sausage meal from his favorite kiosk, he collapses, ending up hospitalized with a blood clot in his brain and an overstressed heart. His wife, Pia, twenty years younger and devoted to him, is tormented by his condition, and is vigilant toward his care and wellbeing. It is from his hospital bed that Lars is lured into a 25 year-old unsolved rape-murder case of a nine-year-old child, Yasmine Ermegan, presented to him by his neurologist, daughter of a vicar who, on his deathbed, admitted to her that an elderly parishioner confessed that she knew the perp, but the name remains unknown to all alive, as the vicar took it to his grave. Thus begins Lars’ first (informal) murder investigation since his retirement, a case, under the new law, that is prescribed, meaning that the statute of limitations has passed, and the murderer cannot be punished for that crime, even if discovered. But that doesn’t stop Lars. He is still well-connected, but this is off the books and must be done slyly and with help from old friends and new.GW Persson hooked me with the two alternate stories—one, crime-solving, with delightful deductive and inductive reasoning by Lars, supported by his caregivers with their own keen contributions, and his best friend (another retired detective, who was on the case when it was fresh), and the slender information amassed in the case files. The investigation is girdled by Lars’ precarious health condition, such as weakness, fatigue, right arm/hand numbness, an oversized heart, labile mood, and the challenge to change his lifestyle in order to survive. Previously independent in all matters, Lars is forced to rely on others to complete activities of daily living and some of the logistics of solving the crime. The pensioner’s witty observations and complaints are spoken with silent ripostes mingled with direct ones, and his attempts to undermine a healthy diet and lifestyle add humor and pathos. Although Lars ignored early warning signs to his impending neurological stroke—such as memory loss—his reasoning skills are very much intact, and he’s a brilliant, laconic, self-possessed detective. Physical recovery is the harder cross to bear, with one step forward, and two backward, the way a criminal investigation tends to go. However, the pensioner accepts the vicissitudes of the investigation with impunity, meanwhile roaring over his mortal restrictions.Despite the 400+ pages in tightly packed print, the pages soon fly as you’re sucked into the story. Johansson, who appeared in Persson’s earlier works, is fleshed out and three-dimensional here, an endearing and taciturn man fighting crime and mortality in the only way he knows—with gusto and gumption, a consummate professional but stubborn as well, facing the coldest case and the most brutal redemption of his life.

Three generations of a modestly wealthy timber family in northern Pennsylvania sustain multiple tragedies and loss, testing their will against adversity. This is no simpering melodrama; Krivák is a writer of such beauty and authenticity that I slid into this family at once, and cried when I turned the last page.The Sojourn was an excellent novel, but THE SIGNAL FLAME brought me to my knees with its quiet temperament and thoughtfulness. The sense of loss is never more powerful than when it is withstood and faced with remarkable dignity, and written by the author with a tensile delicacy. Bo Konar, the primary protagonist, reminded me of an Abraham Lincoln, strong and sensitive, a natural-born intelligent leader, like his grandfather, Joseph Vinich, who came to American from Slovakia in 1919. Faced with life-altering decisions, Bo gained strength from sorrow with the love of family and friends, particularly an exemplary priest, whose friendship and humanity is consonant to his own.At the opening of the novel, the patriarch, Joseph Vinich, lies in his casket under the roof that has held three generations of his family, the house that he built. Vinich passes down two thousand acres of logging land in Darden, (close to Wilkes-Barre), and worked hard for his prosperity. He came from Slovakia and fought in WW I, and with hard work and good business acumen, became successful.Although the book begins in 1971, the narrative unpacks its weight gradually, revealing historical details that are salient to the characters and tale, creating a poignant story. Bo was raised primarily by his grandfather, and his mother, Hannah. His father, Hannah’s husband, European born Bex Konar, became an American citizen, went off to fight in WW II when Bo was a baby, and was subsequently reported missing. It was years later when he returned, only to face more tragedy. Now Bo’s brother, Sam, who joined up during the Vietnam War, is missing in action, and has left a pregnant girlfriend, Ruth, in Darden. Bo’s family has a complicated relationship with Ruth’s father.There are no villains in this story, except maybe the formidable wars and an occasion of destructive weather. This isn’t an “us vs. them,” white hats vs. Black hats story. Instead, it is a portrait of a family and a community, living in the wooded Pennsylvania territory of lumbermen and mills, and the role of nature in the wilderness. This is not an action packed fasten-your-seatbelt story, and yet the subtle and flawless writing captures Bo and his family with flawless precision, a mixture of pointillist images woven together into a cohesive and stunning story.“The trees were always the first thing his grandfather spoke of in the morning, weaving a forecast for the day based on the curve of leaves or a bird he might see nesting in the branches. Or he would tell a story that began with the planting of a particular sapling…its root pack bound in burlap and sitting in the front seat of his rig like a passenger…”This is no MFA writing school author—Krivák pens with an exacting fidelity to story and character that seems to come from the deepest reaches of his heart, a soulful contemplation of dignity and compassion through adversity and a soulful benevolence even under the most profound suffering. Within the hardships there is still optimism and faith in mankind.

But it is also edgy, non-conformist, often sinister, and occasionally disturbing. It’s dark, even bordering on dystopian at times—but not in the standard (near-future) definition. This takes place in the past—1986 and ’87. There are also playful and sunny moments, but they tend to demonstrate a contrast to the atmosphere of menace. Not a cute little love story, but a rather in-your-face one that reveals the underside of real world sensibilities.Elise and Jamey represent the ultimate incongruous couple. She comes from the wrong side of the tracks in New Haven—of mixed racial descent, uneducated and poor, and though not conventionally beautiful, she is arresting and sexy. Jamey is a white, handsome Yale student from an obscenely wealthy NYC family—divorced parents, actress mother, and colossally successful father. They meet while renting next door to each other in New Haven. Elise has fled the family fold, and Jamey is an extension of his, but having second thoughts about familial expectations and choices. Elise is wild and wily, canny with a watchful bravado, and Jamey is pressured, oppressed, and feels cornered by the demands of his pedigree. Their romance was difficult, organically halting, slow starts and sputtering, even tortuous, but both have an authentic curiosity for each other. “There’s a baldness to Elise, a stripped-down sleekness like a car left for dead, its parts jacked and sold…What she did for him was voodoo.” “He thinks of himself as a telephone that was off the hook till now.”When Libaire explores the hurdles within Jamey and Elise, the internal struggles, she’s really on-point. It’s rough and raw, full of exposed feelings and the slow dissolving of walls and the fear of emotional decay. But, she also adds, for dramatic effect, the external hurdles of, mainly, his family and friends. At times, his side of the family seemed contrived, almost like caricatures, one-dimensional and singular in their actions. Opposition was to be expected, but it was heavy-handed at times. And Elise’s family was not without the stereotypical distinctions.The characterizations of Elise and Jamey were vivid and searing, and the narrative was rugged and visceral, and rouse empathy for their obstacles. The last 50 or so pages, the author took some big risks. At first, it felt too alien and forced—another external handicap to try and overcome. What did work was that Elise and Jamey stayed true to character, and, for me, they overcame the weaknesses of plot.

KitamuNovels about marriages gone sour are countless; a persuasive one that stands out is achieved through character, approach, style, and execution. Kitamura realizes a compelling drama, a melancholy and meditative narrative of marriage and mystery, a sustained story of suspense through quagmires and restraint.An unnamed London woman in her late thirties, a translator of foreign works, is separated from her writer husband, Christopher, a charismatic charmer and womanizer. After her mother-in-law calls in a desperate attempt to find him in Greece (she has tracked him to a locale and hotel), and begs the narrator to go there, Christopher’s wife decides to use this as an opportunity to ask him for a divorce in person. Their separation has remained a secret, at Christopher’s urging. But now the translator is ready to find and confront him, and to get her life back to something resembling normal.When the narrator arrives at the luxury hotel in a quaint and rural fishing village, she learns that he left for a side trip, although his belongings remain intact. They accommodate her to stay and wait for his return. In the meantime, her discomforts at the resort hotel accumulate, despite the air of generous hospitality. A receptionist, Maria, glares at her with a mixture of curiosity and hostility. There’s a driver, Stefano, whose cagey politeness and inscrutability makes her wary. Each interaction with a hotel employee increases her suspicion and sense of shame. Her guard is up, and as the days pass, she dwells more and more on her memories, conjectures, shame, and fears. And where did Christopher go?The passive tone of the book superbly parallels the narrator’s equivalent passivity, creating tension as her suspicions and torment leak out of every pore, even as she rigidly maintains her ostensible self-contained poise.What gives this book so much sustainability and depth is what goes through the narrator’s mind--an intimacy and immediacy, teased out of passivity, and ratcheted up with Christopher’s absence. In fact, his absence is a dire presence—the “here but not here” X factor that surrounds the narrator’s concerns. And her namelessness a thing suggesting her invisibility, like her work. “Translation is not unlike an act of channeling, you write and you do not write the words.” “…translation’s potential for passivity appealed to me…I could have been a translator or a medium...”During this time that the narrator spends with no husband, she is also relieved at the delay in confronting him. She is full of contradictions, even as she has a new and loving boyfriend waiting for her at home. As a reader, her reticence and her repression, as well as her desperation and ruminations riveted me. This may be the most inquisitive period of her life, as she begins to mine the many facets that she formerly ignored. “…between two people, there will always be room for failures of imagination.”...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Mar 22, 2017","Mar 23, 2017","Mar 29, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30407998-a-separation

Nora, 21 and four years older than Theresa, has been very protective of her younger sister since their mother died. They leave their widowed father and brother behind, promising to return to the country they love once they find jobs and raise enough money. But over fifty years later, Nora remains near Boston, while Theresa is a cloistered nun in Vermont.As the novel opens, it is 2009, and Nora is the mother of four adult children. It is the oldest, Patrick, who she adores the most, despite his reckless and lazy lifestyle and boozy habits. She gets a phone call that he has died in a car accident, which unglues her, and subsequently she makes an impulsive call to the convent where Theresa has lived for the past half century, and leaves a message informing her of Patrick’s death and inviting her to the funeral. It is obvious that they are estranged. The rest of the novel covers the past and the present and gradually tells us the story of their falling out.I was sucked into the interior--and exterior-- life of Nora, an initially complex character with her mixture of family devotion and repression. She is in denial that her forty-year-old daughter is gay, despite the indisputable clues. Her son, John, a Democrat, has made a bundle working for a Republican that he knew from childhood, a slick politician who makes Nora apoplectic. Brian is a has-been baseball player struck down by various injuries while en route to stardom. He works at Patrick's bar and lives back at home with Nora.

And now time is closing in on Nora.The nascent pages held me in its grip. Lean, and with a terse tempo and gallows humor. I was glued to the events and the dropped little reveals. But then it turned into melodrama. It became static and clingy, including the characters. Theresa goes from one extreme to another, which is about as interesting these days as stripper to saved.Other than Nora, who eventually became a parody of herself, this 50+ year span became repetitive, depleted by all the filler. It was just more of the same. The children, except maybe for Bridget, were wafer-thin portrayals. What happened off stage and referred to later (or thrown in) felt labored and inconsequential after Sullivan ran over it several times. Mundane events stood on ceremony and then withered to monotony, and the dry humor gave way to treacle sentiment and info dumps.I kept hoping it would capture the vitality and crisp flow of the beginning seventy or so pages, only to be disappointed by a baggy follow-through. I chose this book because I’m a fan of her witty and authentic last novel, THE ENGAGEMENTS. Sullivan is capable of an artful, exciting narrative, but this one doesn’t live up to her previous talents.

It also won a literary award when it was a manuscript. The biggest shocker to me was that it was primarily a garden-variety police procedural with serviceable prose and a formula plot. The tone was warm and pleasing, but there were too many glaring holes that looked more like amateur sleuthing than professional police work. The easily anticipated reveal was not jaw-dropping, and the use of italicized passages to indicate the past was, I thought, a ham-handed device, a sign that the text needed further refinement.So what was there to like? Well, it opened with enough of a bang to reel me in. An entire family--Luke, his wife, Karen, and their little boy, Billy, has been slaughtered. Only baby Charlotte survived untouched. The rural farming town, Kiewarra, is in a drought, and everyone seems guilty of something. There are also menacing characters, but their generic and stereotypical attributes lacked the visceral that can be had with imaginative and original portrayals.The federal agent, Aaron Falk, who comes back to Kiewarra after twenty years (not a new concept), was congenial, and kept the pages turning, although, again, I feel that the author relied on stringing together an overused rather than original character here. (However, a movie, in the hands of the right director, could potentially rise above the book).Aaron returns to Kiewarra to investigate the death of his former best friend, and because of an urgent letter of request from Luke's parents. He intended to stay a day and rush back to Melbourne, but extends his stay because police sergeant Raco invites him to remain and assist in solving this heinous crime. The best parts of the novel, (which kept me reading), was Harper’s openness to explore the human condition. The downside was that once she broached subjects such as integrity, decency, small-town crazy, greed, jealousy, and redemption, she either overstated it or underdeveloped what she put in motion, using a style that felt like forced mournful. And the investigation looked Keystone Kop-ish, but that wasn’t the author’s intention. Harper meant to stage the sloppy police work as, instead, gradual and incremental discovery, but I think Harper needs to do more research on police work, especially as she is going to continue a series on Aaron Falk.Gretchen, the girl+friend (but not girlfriend) from his past, was probably the most complex, contoured character. But, again, she was mostly derivative--the fiercely independent but vulnerable and attractive woman with secrets and torments that may or may not compromise her actions. As with most of the narrative, her relationship with Falk was predictable.The book was mildly entertaining, but rather light on authenticity. The red herrings were conspicuous, and the denouement was a bit hard to swallow, and I predicted it based on Harper’s tendencies, style, and choices throughout the book. I would give her another try, however (but only in a stand-alone), with the hope that she’ll grow on her strengths-- of compassion for humanity, small town concerns, and the tough road to justice....more",Notes are private!,8,27,1,"Mar 18, 2017","Mar 22, 2017","Mar 22, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27824826-the-dry

What does it mean? Like Baume’s unusual novel, it demonstrates the ideas of impermanence, motion, and relativity. Throughout this novel, the protagonist, twenty-six year-old Frankie (a woman), an unsuccessful artist suffering from depression and inability to connect socially, inserts 75 asides concerning intrepid works of art by selected artists. Some are photographs, paintings and sculptures, but most are conceptual art, installations, and performance art that reach back from the 19th through 21st century. As Frankie tells her story, the various works of art buttress and express the ideas and feelings that both entrap and liberate her. And then there are the dead animals. Frankie, who has retreated from her bedsit in Dublin to her dead grandmother’s bungalow out in the Irish countryside, next to a turbine (a somewhat disturbing totem of sorts) decides to photograph dead wildlife. It started when she found a dead robin, which inspired her to photograph a series. “A series about how everything is being slowly killed.”Frankie has rules, though. She must not take part in the death of the animal, and they must be fully expired. She will be the observer, not a participant. I felt this concept even more when Frankie discusses surrealist painter’s “The Treachery of Images,” a painting of a pipe. The point of the painting though, is to stress that it is not a pipe, but a representation of a pipe. Throughout the narrative, Frankie grapples with the idea of simulacra and simulation—the thing vs. the representation of the thing.(Unfortunately, in the ARC copy, we do not see the dead wildlife photos. This story is so breathtaking, so beautifully melancholy, that I am sure to eventually purchase a finished copy when it is published. I am itching to see these photographs).This is a niche novel, not for everyone. It is more of a story than a plot, meditative rather than action-packed, interior and reflective. Frankie, the unreliable narrator of her unreliable life, is also flush with naked truth about herself, even as she repeatedly lies to her mother, and perceptive about the world around her. She is vulnerable, lonely, intelligent, curious, and suffused with a piercing humanity. Her prose is exquisite, imaginative, and visual, mournful but hopeful about the natural world and finding her place in it; her flaws, her contributions, and her crushing misunderstandings. There’s a paradox of finding myself smile when Frankie is honest, deadly honest with others, who then are offended by her perceived cruelty. It left me almost in tears-- that smile that slipped from me. In the course of the novel, Frankie had saturated my heart and soul.“Here is another rule for my project: no pets, only wild things. So it can be about the immense poignancy of how: in the course of an ordinary life we only get to look closely at the sublime once it has dropped to the ditch, once the maggots have already arrived at work.”...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Mar 11, 2017","Mar 15, 2017","Mar 16, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30971749-a-line-made-by-walking

He’s not deaf, he doesn’t have autism, and he definitely isn’t delayed. “And he isn’t a genius, either.” Devin, the toddler, is a chatterbox who doesn’t stop talking unless he’s asleep. Lady is on a trial separation from her husband, Karl, a very wealthy man. And she is trying to write a memoir about bringing up Seth: “…the central theme…is acceptance, but if that were the case, I shouldn’t be the one writing it.” Alas, she suffers from a colossal writer’s block, due to paralyzing contradictions between what she is expected to convey about raising Seth, and the reality of her suppressed disappointments. To help herself get on track, Lady hires S—short for Esther—“I’m the artist formerly known as Esther Shapiro”--as a live-in nanny. Both S and Lady are ruthless women when it comes to defending their lives, so to speak. S is functioning as a performance artist, attempting to mimic and live inside the skin of her mother. The challenges are many. For instance, S was fierce about wearing makeup, a daily 45-min ordeal. But, playing her mother, she’s got a naked, unadorned face. And there are waged battles and inner conflicts way beyond the superficial makeup concerns. Lady is an intractable helicopter mom with her 19-year-old mute son, a college student trying to have a life of his own. She occasionally overlooks the toddler, Devin, because of her obsessive protectiveness of Seth. And Lady also harbors cataclysmic secrets. After S moves into the main house’s cottage, the deceptions pile up on both sides of the property. Twitter is the transparently insulating battleground for grievances, confessions, and manipulations between mother and son. S connects organically with Devin and Seth, and Lady gets suspicious to the point of paranoia. Pressure is about to reach critical mass.Does this sound like a soap opera? In anyone else’s hands, perhaps. But Edan Lepucki is the mastermind behind this often jarring, piercing, sometimes raunchy, and consistently compelling story of a family deep in crises and restricted by dysfunction. Within the dark, sardonic humor and awkward scenes, Karl’s character adds a touch of optimism and light levity. He is still in Lady’s life peripherally—they often meet at “Paul Feldman’s” for their weekly dinners. Paul Feldman is their in-joke for P.F. Chang, every since they found out the chain was owned by a Jewish gent, not unlike Karl himself, I suspect! There are numerous private communications between characters, but when Lady discovers that her and Seth’s confidential, special signs have been shared with others, she is outraged.Art and perception play a leading part in the themes, and the author parodies art, too. For example, Karl’s sister, once a prominent photographer, is more of a has-been now, yet utterly self-confident and condescending. She and Lady create some of the most barely restrained caustic friction in the novel. Their backstory has an enigmatic connection to the main one at hand. But wait till you grok “Woman no. 17’s” origins. As the narrative builds, the emotional tension heightens and the commanding, three-dimensional characters materialize from the pages and sink into your bones. Lepucki’s muscular prose and poignant black comedy suggest hints of Philip Roth, John Irving, Zoe Heller, and Lionel Shriver, but rather than stand on their shoulders, she stands on her own. If she continues to write at this level, I’ll be waiting impatiently for every next book. WOMAN No. 17 is nothing like the serious, speculative fiction of California. I was captivated with her arch, arresting new novel of a Hollywood Hills family in the here and now. These aren’t archetypes in a boilerplate dramedy. Lepucki wrote outside the lines and burned the box down. It’s about mothers and sons, mothers and daughters, and the heart of family bonds. Moreover, the friendship between S and Lady is the best older-younger same-gender relationship I’ve seen since Walt and Jesse in Breaking Bad! It’s filmic, too, but not formula.

After an incident at the newspaper, (thLeah Stevens left her exciting job as a crime reporter in Boston to teach high school in Western Pennsylvania. After an incident at the newspaper, (the facts disclosed unhurriedly through the story), Leah runs into Emmy, an ex-roommate she hasn’t seen in eight years. Emmy threw a dart at a board to decide where next to live. Leah, enticed by this daring old friend, agrees to join her in Pennsylvania, and her resolve to move and change careers commenced. It was the right plan at the right time--forthwith, the former journalist could press the reset, become a different version of herself and in a fresh place, an entirely new translation of Leah. But she didn’t count on veering off the road, a greased skid headed to oblivion.There are express themes that run through this corkscrew tale, and motifs that emerge throughout the story. As I return now to specific passages that caught my attention while reading, I am even more impressed with the less visible tide of events, the implications and recurrent themes that underscore and drive the story.“We forced the pieces until they fit what we thought we knew.” “They pull on pieces, let their minds fill in the rest. We crave logical cause and effect, the beginning, middle, and end. And the capstone of themes, or one of them: “I believed that life was not linear but cyclical. It was the way news stories worked, and history—that you ended where you began, confused and gasping for breath.”The relevant idea is perception, and how we filter our experience and beliefs through the prism of our limited (or expansive) view. There’s a discovery, which establishes a case. But the clues, as they come in, leave a lot to interpretation or imagination. And then there’s an absence, which creates a scrutiny, and puts Leah at the center of the case. Throughout, Leah is using her journalistic skills to stay ahead of the police, while also drawn even closer to the inscrutable Emmy, who increasingly resonates as her echo and reflects as her mirror. I realize that my description is ambiguous; I don’t want to ruin discoveries intended for the reader.As far as the plot, the initial crime is introduced in the first 15 pages, but the author is so keen at character portrayal that by then you are already installed in Leah’s head. And Miranda does a fine balancing act of action and reflection, so that half of the story lies external to Leah’s head and the other half resides within, but is just as active and enigmatic. Miranda’s obvious genre is mystery and police procedural, but it is far, far more than your standard piling up of dead bodies. The author has an intensity that places the pedigree of the book above your typical chase in the woods. The ominous mood surrounds the house, sounds and sights that spook a city gal like Leah—cats scratching below, the owls above, the coyotes beyond, shadows moving around the house, curious knocks on the door--all amidst the dark playing tricks and the moonlight seeping in.I initially assumed that the troubling pasts of Leah and Emmy, and some other common tropes, were used as a safe device by the author. However, as the story progressed, a lot of moving parts organically emerged. I was still unsure for a while, wondering how Miranda was going to juggle and conclude all the strands into one cohesive braid. But, in final analysis, not only did the author accomplish what she set out to do, she did it with an artfully constructed infrastructure, and fluid follow-through. I read on the author bio that Miranda is an MIT grad. Maybe that accounts for her capacity to create a matrix; examine an equation; and solve a complex problem with finesse. If that doesn’t make sense, it will when you finish this mystery, which is always a step ahead of the reader. Her talent for building on the simple and generating an aggregate complexity was brilliantly controlled and measured. Don’t be fooled by complacency, thinking that you got this. She’ll get YOU! I’m delighted that the author thinks outside simple formula. In the end, I was dazzled.

What stands out in eacRusso’s characters in these four stories are on the road to self-discovery, but self-deception still lurks around every corner. What stands out in each one is the yearning to become the author of one’s own life. Rather than the author’s vintage brand of comic blue-collar, the individuals here are college-educated, neurotic, and ambivalent. There are witty undertones, absolutely, but the narratives are imbued with tragic irony rather than rowdy shenanigans. In “Horseman,” which is 36 pages, a college professor confronts a student for plagiarizing, but nagging her in the shadows is a meeting years ago in grad school, when a professor outs her for being a fraud, for not expressing her own passionate, personal connection to what she writes. What she lacks is an elusive element inside her facile synthesis and perfect construction, her own self-expression.My favorite, “Voice,” at almost 100 pages, was apparently published several years ago as “Nate in Venice,” but this was my first reading. Nate, in his sixties, is a competent but unexceptional literature professor. After a year of isolation and depression, following a very disturbing incident with a damaged, talented student, Opal Mauntz, he joins his charismatic, swindling older brother, Julian, and a Biennale group in Venice. Events that led up to Nate’s undoing are gradually disclosed, while he simultaneously unravels in Venice, exacerbated by the dizzying zigzag walkways. Underscoring his confusion is the resentment of living in his brother’s shadow, failing to assert his own voice. Yet, he had felt confident that he could help Opal find hers, although she won’t speak, but whose essence emerges lucidly and genuinely through her work. He is engulfed in apprehension and loss of control.“Surely a drowning man, exhausted and alone on a sea of self-doubt and recrimination, is at some point allowed to welcome the water into his lungs.”A struggling real estate agent in Maine, faced with a serious medical diagnosis, is haunted by childhood events, particularly his father’s satisfaction with a journeyman’s life and income. In “Intervention,” Ray must reconcile whether indecision or stubbornness is paralyzing him from moving forward. And, in “Milton and Marcus,” a has-been novelist, Ryan, is called to an aging but big-name actor’s house to discuss a decade-old script that the protagonist wrote for a now-dead actor. His daughter’s phone calls from home remind the writer that he prioritized this meeting above staying home with his wife, who is undergoing chemo. Ryan, who acknowledges that screenwriters are “hirelings” compared to the producers, directors, and actors, strives for distinction.These stories are a must-read for Russo fans, although I don’t know if all of them are previously published, like “Voice.” In either case, this collection brought me back on board to the short story, which I usually avoid in my preference for novels. However, Russo generously opens up each narrative so that I didn’t feel cheated on content. Although the focus was evidently on one main character, secondary characters rose from the pages, too, and caught my full attention. Oscar Wilde famously said, “Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken.” Russo gives credence to the longing and the thirst for people to be themselves....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Feb 18, 2017","Feb 19, 2017","Feb 22, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32337901-trajectory

But if he consistently writes this well, I’ll be a frequent flyer. MY DARLING DETECTIVE is a genre-crossing novel that combines detective, mystery, literature, domestic dramady, and historical fiction into one delightful, warm, and poignant narrative. There are several moving parts that subtly thrive together in a hive buzzing with soul. That is what makes this book such a superb read—the magic and the charm, and some memorable characters.Taking place primarily in the 1970s, the mystery at the heart of this novel dates back to 1945, when Nora Rigolet’s husband, Bernie, an American soldier in WW II, died fighting in Germany. At the opening of this novel, her son, Jake, is working for a wealthy art collector, Esther Hamelin--mostly photographs, bidding for her at auctions. At his hometown of Halifax, during an auction of photograph “Death on a Leipzig Balcony,” Nora, who is supposed to be in a locked facility for the mentally ill, has obviously escaped, because Jake is astonished to see her next to the auctioneer, after she has thrown a bottle of black ink onto the framed photo, leading to her arrest.Jake’s fiancée, Martha, is the interrogating detective in this case, or as the genial Nora calls her, “Interlocutrix.” This is the beginning of a deep friendship between Nora and Martha, and a penetrating investigation into a cold case, now thawing under Martha’s hands. “I’m experiencing a fall from grace,” says Nora. “I hope I’m not embarrassing my son. But I’m experiencing a fall from grace.”This fall from grace is not limited just to Nora, a former head of the Halifax Free Library. Jake also experiences a dip, but it leads to returning to college, to study library science like his mother did. Throughout the novel, it is the relationship between Martha and Jake that stand out so endearingly. Their irreverent wit and natural devotion for each other is infectious, evident on every page. Norman executes small details with alacrity, like the intimate pleasure Jake and Martha take in their favorite radio program, a noir detective show replete with gangsters, molls, and silk stockings. The radio show often parallels the magic between the couple. “It was almost as if Detective Levy Detects intensified Martha’s comprehension of the powers of seduction.”But back to the case at hand…and that is how it goes, the narrative alternating with the mix of characters; interrogations; old letters from Bernie to Nora; and developing events. The plot itself isn’t astounding, yet I was glued to the pages. Norman’s construction, tempo, characters, relationships, and writing are key to the sum of its parts cohering into a superb whole. The text just tingles, and the members of the cast were eloquently portrayed, often with few but significant words. This could have been a soap opera in lesser hands, or an opportunity for preachy politics. However, despite the inclusion of serious topics such as anti-Semitism, betrayal, guilt, and loss, the narrative was feisty, concise, and comic-noir-ish--not dark or gloomy. It shimmers and gleams. It’s the kind of novel I could read again, for the mood and rapport, and Martha. She’s a goddess, a literary hero. I miss her, I miss these pages. Martha, my dear, you will always be my inspiration…...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Feb 21, 2017","Feb 22, 2017","Feb 21, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30971781-my-darling-detective

In Ellen Meeropol’s third and timely, moving novel, endangered species is the theme; relevance and obsolescence are the distress signals.“You are someplace and all of a sudden you don’t know where you are and all the landmarks disappear and you’re lost…” “At some point, soon, all her words would be gone and she would disappear.” The words come from Flo, as her memory continues to lapse, but it could just as easily been spoken by Jeremy, whose hallucinations pervert reality and its margins, or Zoe, confined mostly to a wheelchair, navigating her physical space differently than the able-bodied, and who is faced with daily challenges regarding the prevailing customs of her age. The women’s group of senior citizens joke about coming up with a name to parry their relevance. An ex-convict fresh out of prison feels lost. They all face the fear that they are invisible to others, even while they seek validation and constancy.“How do you stay true to the people you care about? ...While you’re trying to change the world?” Key questions for all these characters. They have worked all their lives to be a sustaining voice in a world of disposable interests and draining surplus. How can we create a sustainable future for later generations, in our food and air, but also in our collective resolve. Our sustenance, the narrative demonstrates, depends on the deeper connections to each other. We talk of permaculture, recycling, and carbon footprints, but what about keeping our memories alive, reclaiming our past, and repairing the toxicity in our own families?When Flo’s decaying consciousness fails completely, her memories potentially die with her, unless they survive through the compassion of people who care. There is also the dormant toxicity of secrets, threatening to spill and infect the very loved ones you are trying to protect. The past is about to swallow Jeremy and bury Flo for the burdens they carry and refuse to share. The planet may be polluted and poisoned, but we also contaminate our families by keeping them in the dark.Rhetoric often dishonors individuals. Buoyed by Earth Day protests, Jeremy signs on to end corporations, to stop using fossil fuels and to banish production of plastics. However, Zoe’s life depends on plastic tubing, high-tech devices and life-saving medicines. How do you reconcile saving the planet with convictions that, if made policy, would kill the ones you love? Flo faces similar pietism. All her life, she joined marches and demonstrations for civil rights, yet she is hiding explosive secrets from her family. Eco-terrorism or secret terrors threaten to derail our secure foundations. You can’t always defend a means to an end.As Jeremy is suffocating in strangulating vines that wrap around his body, and Flo is drowning in fugue states, they both suffer by grasping on to remembering, forgetting, and facing irrelevance. Their intertwined families are endangered by activism, but could be saved by a more personal stewardship—conserving and preserving humanity by conveying compassion and courage toward loved ones. Moreover, jettison the protest signs and attend to the individual. Love the ones you love.This is Ellen Meeropol’s best-written work to date. Her prose is meaty and essential, and her narrative examines the contradictions that often exist between our passionate beliefs and the way we actually live.

Privileged daughter, Nina, is a teacher in a tough Boston public school. Daughter of a video game CEO, she doesn’t ever need to work, but wants to make a difference in bringing literature to students. She falls in love with Collin, a struggling college dropout with a talent as a chalk artist. Much mention is made about the impermanence of his pictures—he erases his drawings right after he finishes them. The second story concerns Aiden, an intelligent but apathetic student of a single mother who works nights, and while she is gone, he spends those sleepless hours on his obsession—the virtual reality game that was created by Nina’s father and uncle. His twin sister, Diana, is his best friend, and covers for him while he ignores his studies, even allowing him to plagiarize her paper.The aspect that impressed me was Goodman’s ability to create a visually stunning world of Arkadia—EverWhen and an underworld of Elves, flamethrowers, fantastical horses, and a topography that really pops. I am not a gamer, and was wary of a novel that focused on this industry. But that was not my problem; in fact, delving into this netherworld was, in my opinion, the most engaging part of the novel. Goodman’s arresting Arkadia was appealing and not technical. It was presented mostly via the theme of obsession, and weighted more with the art and illustration side to it.The love story between Collin and Nina, however, was lukewarm and derivative. Rich girl gets poor boy job at daddy’s company, which seeds obvious conflicts. Love affair proceeds predictably, including the stumbles along the way. The theme of permanence vs. impermanence did offer some nuggets of insight, and helped to soften the other more obvious clichés.Even the intentional probity to Nina’s teaching skills and passion, and Collins challenges at Arkadia, seemed derivative. Goodman traded originality for platitudes, and organic moral complexity for sentimentality. I think the appropriate audience would be a YA crossover. If you have read a limited repertoire of love stories, this may appeal. Moreover, the virtual reality angle is a topical trend in some literature. Despite the flaws, I was periodically absorbed.

This becomes an oscillating feud, with complaints that Gundlach defaced the painting and subsequently that Schwind cut it with a knife, as well as discord regarding the restoration. After we discover who the subject of the painting is, the plot progressively thickens. The unnamed lawyer/narrator becomes embroiled in a love triangle that ends in a cliff-hanger and affects him for the next forty years. Ultimately, this is a love story.“’Maybe you’ll have to get older to become young. To find everything in a woman, to find it all again: the mother you lost, the sisters you missed out on, the daughter you dream of…We’re all those things when we are truly loved.”’The story has a page-turning tempo, a mystery that, even when the first riddle is solved, continues to have unraveling consequences and thrumming questions. It is a book in three parts; the third part slows down as we sink our teeth more fully into the perceptions and philosophy of the lawyer and Irene, the woman in the painting. Throughout the narrative, the narrator is faced with unresolved issues about love and betrayal. “Is that how it is with things that don’t quite come to an end? But things do not come to an end, one has to bring them to an end.”Along the way, perception about art, the art world, and the business world are examined, as well as the philosophy of possession. Within that, there’s a bit of a fairy-tale reference, too, such as Irene calling the narrator “my brave knight” mockingly, while she also criticizes her assigned female roles as trophy, muse, and distressed princess.Schwind and Gundlich, even as the story opens, are established in their separate fields, but Irene still aims for an independent identity. The narrator, who has aimed for security and equanimity for much of his life, occupies a private restiveness, which is rooted in inexperience and blurry desires. Forty years later, he must reconcile history, change, redemption, and the difference between love as illusion or reality. The novel demonstrates that the life we dream, the one we live, and the choices we make coil together on the continuum of human experience. Existence is not finite, perhaps not even in death. Even the inanimate evolves. “Paintings don’t come to rest and neither do people.”...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Feb 11, 2017","Feb 12, 2017","Feb 17, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/34204621-the-woman-on-the-stairs

Attenberg’s Andrea cleverly narrates her life non-linearly that by turns exposes and teases out info with no referenced context, but then later, when that context is revealed, it feels like a new discovery. For example, we know early on that she has a dying niece, before we are emotionally invested. Later, when Andrea narrates the background and story of her niece’s parents, it came about as a surprise, because the author is so adept at cleverly abdicating timelines, but in a controlled and timely way. Moreover, her out-of-sequence events emphasize Andrea as a puzzle with missing pieces.“What next?” is often the question that follows Andrea around after each disastrous event. Although she has a fairly successful career in advertising, she takes no pleasure in it, either. She hasn’t found the key to happiness, instead envying others who she assumes have their act together. Her sexual conquests or alliances hit a pitch-perfect note of familiarity (for many, like myself, who didn’t get married in their 20s), and her push-pull relationship with her mother is by turns tender, testy, and surly. Even her attitude toward her therapist is often juvenile. But, she is frequently honest, even when she is cagey. “I don’t really have a relationship…I have just bits and pieces of things.”Andrea’s scattered life is written in a breezy style that can be read in a few sittings.

Fortunately, I was not, and experienced it on the merits of a mildly speculative but mostly literary novel about characters facing the challenge of authenticity vs. representation, and their very (and sometimes fluid) definitions. An American astronaut, Helen Kane, a Russian cosmonaut, Sergei Kuznetsov, and a Japanese taikonaut, Yoshihiro Tanaka, spend 17 months together in a simulated mission to Mars and back, ( a test-run for the real thing, which would come afterward) run by a space corporation intent on selecting the best astronauts of different nationalities. The drama of a simulated journey on their spaceship, Primitus, captures the theme of the tale, about who we are, and what creates and maintains our genuine self, as well as our temptation to deceive others and ourselves in relationships. The narrative is best when we are thrust inside the struggles of identity.“I forget what I am because I have been so long simulating the man I wish to be that I now believe myself to be this man.”As the characters alternate with the chapters, we witness the thoughts, behaviors, and experiences of the astronauts; a member of the ground mission team; Helen’s grown daughter; Sergei’s two young sons, and Yoshi’s wife. Another common motif that is braided into the simulation theme is the idea of boundaries, borders, space--not just outer space, but psychological and physical space. “This is an opportunity to reflect on what the best of us is capable of, what we can accomplish when we put everything aside…for a common goal. My mom has always talked about how you can’t see borders from space…” What happens to our relationships, to our sense of self, when boundaries are disrupted from the norm?Although this is a simulated mission, the astronauts must treat it as a true undertaking. Howrey’s research is impressive; she combines aerospace engineering in specific and defined ways that convince me that she knows her stuff. However, I never felt laden down with dry and technical exposition. It was always saliently woven into the story--the confinement of three very different but complementary high achievers who are tested like never before. As the experts on earth create and impose spacecraft and environmental challenges on the crew, the three astronauts must act without delay. There are other heavy challenges as well, such as isolation, lack of privacy, and separation from loved ones.Along the way, the curtain is pulled back on the personal lives of the astronauts. There’s the death of Helen’s husband and how it continues to affect her relationship with her daughter, Mireille, and the attempt of Mireille to own her life--one not defined by her mother’s mission to Mars. There’s a deep wedge of grief between them, and unresolved matters about Helen’s husband. “…you had to be so careful with grief. It was like an impact crater, its surface always larger than the thing that created it.” Sergei, who had an amicable divorce, has an arm’s length relationship with his two sons. The chapters about Sergei's son, Dmitri, which focused on a teen in torment, occasionally felt like too much of a sublet to the story in front of me. It grabbed my attention, but it didn’t feel fluent with the story at hand. It kept with the theme of identity and living an authentic life, but I didn't feel a palpable connection between Sergei and his sons.And, most enigmatic and mysterious of all is the relationship between Yoshi and his wife, Madoka. Madoka observes that her marriage to Yoshi is perceived by others to be happy and solid, strong and trusting. She also identifies that her marriage might have a solid surface, but may be empty inside. There were numerous references to being an actor in your own life, for several of the characters. The question that permeated the story was whether your authentic self was organic, or whether authenticity is merely an actor playing yourself. Do they merge? Which one is real--the self that emerges without calculation, or the one that we choose to be? It reminded me a bit of Hamlet’s conception of being-ness.The smooth, symbolic prose kept me fastened to both the mission and the characters. It was balanced and inevitably suggestive—reminding us that people, like space, cannot be pinned down. And between what is simulated and what is “real” may just be semantics....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 08, 2017","Feb 10, 2017","Feb 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29966530-the-wanderers

Saturated with ethical questions about maternal love, privilege, boundaries, and the immigrant experience, the story tells itself without any authorial interference. Hard questions have no soft answers, and the reader, while adventuring through morally complex lines and barriers, will surely be exhilarated and full of empathy for all the primary characters. There are no easy outcomes to knotty disputes of immigration and the undocumented worker, as well as the foster care system and questions of class and standing. When a child is involved, the heart demands authority over statutes that are buried under benevolence. What we have is a tale bursting with humanity that traverses the invisible borders of the law, morality, and mercy that both connect and divide us from each other. There are borders and boundaries, and then there are immigrants and the law. But, when it comes to maternal love, that love IS the law, and there are no boundaries in the heart that can be imposed by the courts.Privileged Indian American Berkeley couple Kavya and Rishi Reddy are in their mid-thirties and childless. Kavya, especially, is envious of couples with children, pregnant women, and those that effortlessly conceive. They begin a process of obtaining a child with a desperation that is exclusively understood by the barren and single-minded. Solimar “Soli” Castro Valdez is a nineteen-year-old from a poverty-stricken village near Oaxaca. Her anguish resides in the unending hope of a better future somewhere else—and that somewhere else is America. What she entails to cross the border is both courageous and harrowing, but not without a pause in terror to find love.All three of these main characters are motivated by desperation and moved by certainty—the surety of their hearts that sometimes defies the law and ethics. What they would do for a child they love is limitless, unquantifiable, and borne on their own determination of their desire, their sense of right that supersedes external and murky morality defined by others. You can read the blurb on the book for content of plot, although I would suggest coming into it cold with no preconceived notions or plot-spoilers. Therefore, I am withholding from too much notation of the plot. Although it is close to 450 pages, I read this unputdownble book at a rapid pace, not wanting to tear myself away. What a fine balance between plot and theme, events and reflection. And Rishi’s job, as an air quality engineer, provides witty and scintillating extended metaphors. Attempting to create a room of “pure” air for his company (and to impress his boss, now married to Kavya’s childhood friend, who she always envied) is almost absurd. His goal is to create an invisibly bordered room of non-toxic, flawlessly healthy and breathable air. It blends impeccably with the theme of manifest borders and systematic laws that are supposed to be created for the good of its citizens, but also can run roughshod over families and the nature of love and bonds.“Air quality data was clear and quantifiable. It could be summoned and charted. Children and wives could not. Acceptance couldn’t be graphed. Nor could love.”In the meantime, Soli is attempting to navigate life as an “illegal.” It isn’t just the border of Mexico and America, but also what she will be willing to do to get what she wants. She is at a disadvantage being poor in a rich country, but now she has a reason to fight and win under any circumstances. She’s a scrappy girl with resources, despite her lack of money, education, and fluency of English. You root for her determination and empathize with her, as well as Kavya and Rishi, whose privilege obscures an underlying despair. Eventually, these characters will be fighting the same fight, each certain of their rightness.Invisible and indivisible, cleaving and cleaving (the same words with opposite meanings)—the narrative will pull you on both sides of an argument, while pushing you to new frontiers of emotion while you witness human truths that parallel ideology and undermine the law....more",Notes are private!,0,22,2,"Feb 04, 2017Feb 04, 2017","Feb 08, 2017Feb 08, 2017","Feb 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29430055-lucky-boy

She knows that Anna is no longer sentient, but she understands that “Love was. Is it no longer?...how long will it flutter by itself, reach out in the empty rooms…When does it become the memory of a feeling, no longer the feeling itself?” Ellinor comprehends that at her age, her relevance is diminishing, and by talking to Anna, the power of her words will solidify memories that would otherwise be forgotten. The entire book is framed by Ellinor sharing her deepest, most personal memories, feelings, and thoughts with her buried best friend. In this way, the living reader mirrors the best friend, and we are the receptive vessels. I felt the most intimate secrets of this unknowable woman surge through me and bring me to tears.OFTEN I AM HAPPY comes from a poem by Danish poet B.S. Ingemann that well echoes the themes of Danish author Jens Christian Grøndahl’s short novel: Often I am happy and yet I want to cry;For no heart fully shares my joy.Often I am sorrowful and yet have to laugh,That no one shall my fearful tear behold.Normally, I don’t write out an entire epigraph of a book, but this capsulizes the essence of the story. What do we have but our memories? And how do we convey them, leave their imprints, through eternity? The story is compact and minimalist, disclosing the lives of two couples and their families. The moments of love, passion, pain, sadness, tragedy, shame, betrayal, confusion--the entire sphere of human emotions, is represented here in stunning, understated ways, and yet so effervescent. Lyrical, moving, and undulating, the storytelling is tender, graceful, and heartbreaking. This is the first time I’ve read a novel by an author who translated his own work.

Her wOne of the things I liked best in MY NAME IS LUCY BARTON, Strout’s previous novella, was the understated prose that delivered evocative emotion. Her writing stayed beneath the narrative, out of the way, but the story shined. Strout is superb at illuminating small-town lives of traumatized people who are often suppressed by their abusive pasts. In this novel, the author extends or expands on LB, even including her as a character, and one referred to by other characters in the novel. The things that happened to most of these people from (or near) the town of Amgash, Illinois, are enough to diminish a person’s ego, confidence, and sense of personal safety. And, even more, they are filled with almost unendurable shame. But they endure.At first, I thought that in this serial narrative, all roads led to Lucy Barton, but by the end, I observed that it was more of an intersecting or periodically parallel cast, most characters being a protagonist in one chapter, and a small presence or reference in another. They were either related to each other or had a connection with at least one other person in another chapter. There’s a little bit of an OUR TOWN feel to it, but rated R, and more contemporary (and yet timeless in ways). And yet, MY NAME IS LUCY BARTON has a show of meta-fiction here, as several characters in ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE decided to read Barton’s memoir, the same novella that we read as fiction.As in her previous work, the prose is mostly understated, although a few times—and this could just be me, I’m not speaking for everyone—it bordered on a little bit twee, where Strout pushed the “naturalness” so that I felt I saw the woman behind the curtain. It wasn’t often, and didn’t spoil the story for me, but at moments I questioned a few granules of authenticity. Sometimes, the characters were SO nice or placid that they felt stilted or too controlled by the author. However, most of the cast was off-kilter or shaky enough to add substance. One of the most alarming but sympathetic characters was a man named Charlie who suffered PTSD from the Vietnam War. There was both sadness and a gritty edge to his character that was as good as an occasional gut punch. Strout focused more on upper-middle-aged and elderly characters, and did a fine job of giving them purpose (instead of just being props or archetypes).Lucy Barton’s memoir also serves as an inspiration to those she left behind: “…Lucy Barton’s book had understood her. That was it—the book had understood her…Lucy Barton had her own shame; oh boy did she have her own shame. And she had risen straight out of it.”Nearly all characters were terribly abused in various ways. Could the author have portrayed torment, trauma, loneliness, and shame without characters always possessing a background of abuse? That’s an issue to discuss with fellow readers. Occasionally, it wearied me, and I wanted a relief from all the abused men and women. However, Strout also framed the story with a cautious hope that included nuggets of reciprocal love, as well as junctures of insight (vs. inorganic epiphanies). This is a must-read for fans of Strout or even just her last book; however, you can read this as a stand-alone—and then go back and read LB.3.75...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jan 29, 2017","Jan 29, 2017","Feb 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32080126-anything-is-possible

The voices of the innocent victims, often children or teachers, are part of what makes up the narrative in Pachico’s novel. If it seems confusing at times—i.e. not being able to definitively point out the violent perpetrators and tyrants from the tagalongs and paper tigers, or the reason for the inclusion of grade-school antics and class bullying, the narrative can be parsed best when accepting that it isn’t linear. This post-modern and surreal story could conceivably begin or end with any chapter. It takes place alternately between 1993-2018, set in Colombia and sometimes the U.S.Often, characters appear in more than one chapter (each chapter a different and overlapping narrative voice) in greater or lesser presence. The prismatic lens that defines the author’s style portrays these people at different times/ages of their lives. One chapter, such as the American teacher, (dubbed “the profe”), has been a prisoner for 15 years in a remote place with few people (other than the guards) to converse with. He has understandably lost some mental stability, yet, ironically, in order to hang on to any vestigial shreds of memory, he daily relives, scene by scene, the event in Cali where he was captured, as well as reflecting on events of when he was a free man. From memory and a journal, he teaches literature to a class represented by inanimate objects that are now anthropomorphic to him. The profe’s relationship with the guards indicates that there is certainly some curiosity and compassion on both sides.Pachico is masterful at mingling tragedy with levity. In one chapter, rabbits with human-like qualities are addicted to coca leaves, which is both absurd and yet symbolic. To me, they represented the cocaine drug trade that influenced the war (or conflict), which is especially demonstrated toward the end of the chapter, highlighting the vacillating stronghold of the drug wars. Some of the most poignant maxims came from this section—“You’re born a certain way, grow up to play a certain role, and that’s it, you’re you, unchangeable.” This maxim funnels fluidly into the chapters on childhood play and the ordered divisions based on class, beauty, and intelligence decided by the children. From youth to adulthood, certain characteristics remain steadfast. The privileged kids, even amidst the war on their periphery, can be cruel and exclusive on their own myopic battlefields, with only a few crossing the lines.As the chapters gradually pieced together a narrative whole, I felt a closer intimacy with not just the cast, but also the setting. The Columbian conflict was a disturbing amalgam of events, groups, and motivations, contiguous in years but divided in alliances. Those affected were all classes and members of society.

Like Gods Without Men, you have to let go of pre-conceived notions of temporal events and just go with the flow. It starts off with a straightforward narrative in contemporary NYC and then, eventually, dissolves into a prism of ghosts that superimpose the past onto the present. As the history of a bigoted South is resurrected, Kunzru’s landscape heralds an inescapable future. Events are juxtaposed and connected in a stream-of-consciousness text that makes more and more sense the further you progress with the story.Carter Wallace is a privileged white trust fund baby, scion of a conglomerate whose sinister tentacles hide some dark business matters. But Carter likes to claim that he disinherited himself from his family. He collects vinyl records of old black blues music, and, as he gets older and more sophisticated about music, focuses on rare pre-war recordings from around 1928-1941. His obsession with black music lay in his belief that it was “more authentic and intense than anything made by white people.” Seth is a middle-class suburban student who meets Carter at a small liberal arts college. Seth had been producing audio recordings since high school, such as loops of his breathing, the sounds of floorboards creaking, leaves rustling, the hiss and crackle of his surroundings. They team up as connoisseurs of analog sound engineering, and with Carter’s money, they buy esoteric equipment from the pre-digital era and achieve expertise in sound production. Their preoccupation with audio becomes a rapidly growing business, and they are hired out by musicians/bands looking to add production values to their recordings. According to Seth:“I was trying to hear something in particular, a phenomenon I was sure existed: a hidden sound that lay underneath the everyday sounds I could hear without trying.” Carter was seeking the perfect rare record, or song, but Seth sought a more abstract otherness from analog recording, “…a past version of the future, temperamental, unstable, half-alive.”One day, while recording various sounds, Seth comes home to realize he had inadvertently recorded some blues lyrics sung by one of the chess players in Washington Square, and old black man whose face was obscured to him. The voice was mesmerizing, electrifying, with the ability to make one word into three tones, “the middle one spiking into a piercing falsetto buzz.” After sharing the recording with Carter, his partner insisted that Seth use his technical talent to clean it up in order to clarify all the lyrics, and then dirty it down to make it sound like it had been buried and forgotten under someone’s porch for half a century. Carter hectored Seth into producing it for the collectors market, and even made up a false name for the singer--Charlie Shaw. But something about the recording was disturbing to Seth, and the finished product sounded like “the kind of recording that only exists in one poor copy, a thread on which time and memory hang.""The description I shared above is in the early pages of the book, and sets the stage for a remarkable drama that unfolds ultimately in a surreal latter half, which Kunzru masterfully controls. The opening segues to the thrust of the story, most of which I am leaving out for the reader to discover. Narrated alternately in the first person, the reader is transported to a former time and place that is continuous and connected to all that comes after. The narrative is an alchemy—no, a vivisection, of genres. Literary fiction; murder mystery; racial exploration; and a hint of dystopian, inverted. Have you ever walked into an ancient church or basilica in Rome? I am secular (and so is Kunzru), but it isn’t religion that I feel in these churches; it is the echoes of continuous and collective pain, prejudice, suffering, love, compassion, endurance, guilt, oppression, and humanity. It’s all there between the walls, in the vapor, the perpetual voices long gone, shattered, but still heard. That is what I feel when I read Kunzru--a timeless echo of voices from the past, permeating the future. We are all connected and separate, islands of ourselves but bound infinitely in our memory and consciousness. “Slip, drop it, and that memory lies in pieces. Smashed, unrecoverable.”...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Jan 21, 2017","Jan 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30780283-white-tears

Miller’s cinematic and CATCH-22-esque story is suspenseful, and the prose is lucid and muscular. The thrilling plot threads, the robust characters, and the enduring themes develop with a fluent and resonant rhythm, keeping me fastened to the book at every turn. I wanted to call in sick rather than ever put it down! I kept turning the pages, eyes glued, caught up in the excitement of the novel.Although this takes place in Iraq in 1991, during the early days of the Iraq civil war, and 22 years later, when Muslim anti-sentiment has been entrenched worldwide (and middle east regions and their people are lumped together in many people’s minds), this isn’t a war or political novel. It is about individuals caught up in the torrent of ignorance, collective hatred and prejudice, fueled by war and conflict, and inflamed by misinformation and aggression. On top of that, it is a prismatic scrutiny and ironic double-back on media. And the fact of bureaucracy makes a sinister contribution. However, the reader witnesses the small but significant acts of kindness and humanity, which are both organic and startling, but not sentimental or syrupy.Derek Miller tells a powerful story that enlightens without pandering or condescending to readers. He doesn’t press any political agenda but does underscore the potency of rhetoric on groups and individuals. Moreover, deception and withholding of information is also demonstrated as insidious and dangerous. Hobbes Arwood, a young American soldier in his early 20s, and Thomas Benton, a 40-something war correspondent working a rank and file job for the Times, meet for the first time near the peace-keeping demarcation line at Checkpoint Zulu, near the Kuwait border, in 1991. As Hobbes naïvely asks, “When is this war gonna end?” his wake-up call begins when Benton responds, “It did. The war is over. This is the peace.” In the meantime, Hobbes’ terrific one-liners and sideways dialogue, infused with pop culture, add a droll flavor to the text. “I have this theory that everything you truly need to know…deep down and for the duration, can be learned from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off …To me, the army is Principal Ed Rooney, and you need to be Ferris.” For their brief but critical time together, Benton is now Ferris to Arwood. But serious events cloud their rapport. They witness a young girl—the eponymous girl in green-- executed by a tyrannical Baathist colonel. The subsequent but insanely risky rescue by Hobbes of a young boy is not enough to offset the hollowed-out despair left by the young girl’s death. There are also incongruous scenes of levity mixed with dread that point to the absurdity of giving aid for self-aggrandizement, the lack of humanity in a humanitarian effort. Miller’s talent demonstrates that, rather than these scenes possessing an air of writer impropriety, they emphasize the vulgarity and solecism that belong to the perpetrators. The author expresses folly and unseemliness with empathy and black humor. A spectacle, depicting frozen chickens being dropped for food aid, left me almost speechless with horror and dark mirth.The chance for Hobbes’s and Benton’s redemption come 22 years later when a YouTube video in Iraq goes viral across the globe, showing what looks like the very same girl in green in a queue with Kurd refugees. A mortar is dropped on the crowd, causing an explosion and widespread death. The date: 2013. How can the girl that died reappear? Is it her, a doppelgänger, a trick? “I don’t know. A coincidence. An echo. A midday moon in a blue sky.” What follows is the meat of the story, when Benton and Hobbes connect again in Iraq, and attempt to find and save the girl. But, nothing is easy and all goes awry. The riveting events that unfold are on point and inclusive, connecting all the themes to the plot of the story, and kept me in a buzzed state of anticipation on every page. In addition, the weight of all the red tape and competing or allied institutions and NGOs were, I suspect, purposely confusing at times, in order to highlight the burden of ""cooperation.""Miller never loses sight of the individual, and there were several that we rooted for.

For Marianne, there is right and wrong, and she never had a problem choosing her politics, even if it wasn't popular during the war to be a German woman that was outraged by Hitler and his policies. Her best friend and almost-once lover, Connie Flederman, was also executed for his part in the resistance, and left behind a very young widow, Benita, and five-year-old son, Martin.During the post-War period, when most of the action takes place, Marianne finds Martin and Benita, separated from each other, and brings them to the now ruined castle. With help from the American military, she locates a woman she didn't know before, Ania Grabanek, who has suffered severe deprivation and mistreatment. Marianne brings her and her children to the castle, also. All three women are attempting to build a future and amend the past. The story, while not filled with dazzling plot points or pulse-pounding pacing, takes its time to develop the characters, so that the truly searing (and often quotidian) events affect us organically.The women have their own crosses to bear, and this is when it departs from typical Holocaust literature. As often as I've read WW II literature about the enemies of Germany, I've not read much about the ambivalence of native Germans or those that adopted Germany as their home. Hindsight is 20/20, but at the time of the war, most Germans were ripe for the propaganda machine. Many who were struggling wanted nothing more than to see the country united and flush. Sound familiar? There is definitely a kindred spark that relates to America in 2016. What will we say in 50 years when we look back at our current leader? Many everyday Germans had no idea that Hitler was the embodiment of evil, or that his cruelties, including genocide, were happening around them. They just wanted to be safe and secure again.As the timeline alternates, we become installed in the lives of these women, and how their pasts led them to their present circumstances. The narrative is gritty, realistic, and vivid. Nobody is all virtuous; in fact, there's enough moral ambiguity to go around. Mistakes are made that cause irreparable tragedies, and each woman has blind spots that burden their lives. It wasn't a flashy page-turner, but I was fully installed in the story. Shattuck has evolved since her splendid The Hazards of Good Breeding, which was a story restricted to an elite, privileged family in Boston. In The Women in the Castle, Shattuck raises the bar by writing about European women of varied classes and backgrounds, with a nuanced portrayal of each character.The novel spans about 50 years, but the chapters that are set in the 1990s seemed more like an epilogue to me. If you are expecting ""feminine literature,"" you may be surprised. The author writes with an assured and confident style that transcends the niche of gender writing. This rich tapestry of historically relevant events takes a fresh perspective and should be required reading for all literature lovers, and anyone who is interested in the lesser known history--and its shadows--of modern times....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2016","Dec 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30653967-the-women-in-the-castle

There was more overhanging doom in this book than in AWAIT YOUR REPLY, perhaps because it was denser and longer. Moreover, the frigid temperatures added to the bleak storyline. And bleak it is, saturated with ill will, from the first line to the last. Don’t expect Chaon to give you hope; this is a novel of evil and despair. There were times I just wanted to escape from the pages into something a bit less disturbing, but Chaon kept pulling me in to his relentless and eerie terror. Dustin Tillman is a middle age psychologist in Cleveland with ISSUES—not uncommon for the metaphor to fit--“the cobbler without shoes” in the psychiatric field. As a child, his adopted older brother, Rusty, abused him with harrowing regularity. Rusty, who was convicted of murdering Dustin’s parents, aunt and uncle, is being released now, 30 years later, exonerated by DNA evidence. Dustin is fearful of just about any scenario the reader can think of. In the meantime, an ex-cop patient, Aquil, who came to Dustin to help quit smoking, is trying to pull Dustin into a rogue investigation. Aquil believes that a supposedly random series of drunk drowning deaths of college boys is the work of a satanic serial killer, and the pattern is becoming quite compelling to Dustin, who once did intense research on satanic cults. Although Dustin is an ineffective father to his two teenage boys (too meek and aloof, especially since his wife died of cancer), he is alternately trying to repair the missteps while concurrently dragging his high school son gradually into his side investigation.He pulled off what he intended, although I thought it could have been trimmed for excess (it was repetitive at times, and dragged a bit in the middle). And, in some ways, the denouement had an element of cheese; I did not figure it out because I didn’t think he would go where he did, although I considered it. I won’t give spoilers, so suffice it to say he kept things tense and suspenseful, although I wasn’t fully satisfied by the climax. However, Chaon’s polished, purposefully disjointed plot with alternating timelines, moody, atmospheric setting and understated prose held me in its grip. He fit the pieces in a tight and warped puzzle and left the gaps in just the right places to arouse, provoke, and unnerve me.

So I wasn’t expecting this sui generis author that wrote of the sons and daughters of the survivors, mostly in Buenos Aires, using satire, but with poignancy. Oloixarac’s unconventional and picaresque novel centers on these adult children, as well as former members of the resistance, academics, former guerillas, anthropologists, philosophers and others whom are psychically lost, confused, and concerned with issues of predator and prey.The two main characters, Pabst (Pablo) and Kamtchowsky (female) are a wild but celebrated intellectual couple, self-described as unattractive, even jealous of their finer looking peers. They are exhibitionists, and Pabst is obsessed with onanism, public and private. Kamtchowsky is the daughter of a Polish engineer, and inherited his gift for abstract thought. Together, this odd couple did their own fieldwork, so to speak, openly studying the mating rituals and sexual proclivities of their peers and captivating them by flaunting their sexual performance art at parties, museum openings, and academic soirees.The author almost surreally juxtaposes factual historical figures and social theories with fictional ones, creating a wholly original, exuberantly playful and yet tender story—a love story, primarily. That is what keeps this book engaging. On a lesser author, the text would be pornographic, vulgar, reprehensible. But Oloixarac does it with a larger-than-life heart, and, through jaunts of madness and juxtapositions of reality and fallacy, she pierces the jugular of human behaviors.The narrator is Rosa Ostreech, who is writing a thesis on violence in culture, zeroing in on how we as humans evolved from prey to predator. Ancient cultures from all over the world are included to illuminate the effect of our upbringing on the human condition. Included are also the most pedigreed philosophies of those like Wittgenstein, Althusser, and Rousseau, and novelists whose minds search the erudite beyond, such as Nabokov and Bolaño, but in contexts like you've never heard before!The author is exceptionally talented in not taking an authorial stance, on not judging the nature of her characters, which, to me, speaks highly of her skills. She demonstrates, without arbitration, how aggression, human herding and alienation has culturally evolved from antiquity to contemporary times, and allows her modern characters to show the cruelest and most private actions/behaviors/feelings/beliefs. And yet it underscores their vulnerabilities. The story penetrates how we evolved emotionally, politically, and socially. At times, I admit to being appalled by what I read, and yet, and yet…there is a poignant gentleness and tenderness searing through the frequently lurid, tawdry text.The omniscient narrator is periodically subsumed or even forgotten as other characters emerge and take center stage. But she comes back, the stunning Rose describing her irresistible self, and the paradox of her attraction to a hideously ugly former guerrilla, who yet has an exquisite aesthetic within his obscenity.“His mouth was still pressed tight against my hand. Then something fluttered beneath his preputial eyelid: it was passion, rumpled and lethal, capable of blowing the human heart to pieces…Collazo was (is) a horrible man, but that doesn’t make him any less attractive to my eyes. The little beast of hatred I carry inside quivers every time it hears his name.”I read this book (almost) twice. Going back over large parts of the text made it more coherent for me. Hordes of names and works of art, philosophy, or science, in English and Spanish, streamed from the book and often broke my concentration, as I tried to make sense of it all while turning the pages. But, as I re-read much of the novel, I realized that the best way to appreciate it is just to slide in and let it boil over on your tongue, your head, and your heart.Oloixarac covers everything from the customs of ancient tribes to the sweeping changes marked by the digital age, with post-modern prose and inserts of poems, songs, letters, photos and sketches. Of supreme importance is syntax, lexicon--the structure of words themselves. It is highly entertaining and irreverent, too. I loved the small but significant segment on the tide of sexual dominance being usurped by the rise of nerds—the oppressed classes--via technology, who commandeered and triumphed over the dominant factions of the swaggering, lucky few. So insouciant and yet so biting.At the end, the superb translator, Roy Kesey, addresses the readers with pearls of insight regarding the book and author. He also informs that reading it in Spanish allows the many meanings to expand. Some of the included poems and prose IS in un-translated Spanish, which makes sense in light of what Kesey says about the limiting English translation. However, he hits on the ongoing displacement that readers may feel due to the abrupt shifts in voice, time, events, characters, and even point of view. Yet, the displacement I experienced when reading also signals the internal displacement of the characters. Read it for the sensory thrill.

Because this latest book of his did nothing to urge me on further. He checked all the PC boxes on feminism, family, dysfunction, loss, and other topical issues, so blatantly that I almost thought it was going to be satirical, but no, it was taking itself seriously. On the other hand, he writes with compassion, and the pages flow smoothly, even though the content has much to be desired. What kept me going was the smooth writing, and the tenderness he evokes. I wanted to care about the characters, too, and the events, but they were too wafer-thin to relate to. There are aspects of this domestic drama that have wide appeal and significance: dysfunctional family, mental health problems, grief, secrets, communication breakdowns, and regret. But, redemption was advertised too transparently, and at every turn, so any tension that was attempted lost steam before it even got going. This is a book that thinks for you, and with a sweeping and reductive grasp of legitimacy.The first half of the book read like a YA novel, the way it simplistically raised emotional, psychological, and family issues like a paint-by-number set. Lamb then engaged in some deeper issues—particularly one mental health disease that I know quite a bit about (and have worked with patients with this problem)—and I was shocked at how easily the author dispensed with it. (I don’t want to give spoilers about what it covers). And then there was the largely reliable narrator trying to show how unreliable he thought he was. It was twee in the most banal way, with a dearth of organic material.Lamb took no risks, and the exposition sections were stilted with what read like borrowed enactments, and read like a Wikipedia research reconstruction. I even felt insulted on occasion that the author was so lazy about drawing us in, with stale buzzwords and overused truisms, sketching cut-out characters and boilerplate scenes. Felix’s dialogue with his daughter added nothing to the story, and there didn’t seem to be any family problems under the surface. As a youth, we saw the drama unfold with his parents and sisters, but in a hackneyed way. As an adult, we know he is divorced with an adult daughter who is too facilely healthy and balanced. The scenes with his ex were trite, as their issues were too shallow. The problems they DID have, such as Felix not appreciating feminism (really?), dwindled out to bromides.It’s a short book, and if topics like the history of The Miss Rheingold competition appeal to you (he made it appealing, on a fact-by-fact basis, but not as a novel insertion) then you may enjoy it. It had its moments. But the feminist angle was just too antiquated. He is in version 1.0, i.e. he is bringing up basics that have been covered for the past 40 years, but he added nothing new to the table.By the end, I saw what Lamb set out to do—to reveal how the past presses on the present, and how it affects our future. Too, he attempted to bring up the age-old Venus and Mars arguments between men and women. Felix, the film professor, was able to enter the past by seeing scenes from his life on film, brought to him by former feminists that were in the film industry before women’s employment and professional rights were part of the mainstream. They were powerful women in media, nevertheless, before being quashed one way or another. But, it didn’t resonate as poignant to this story of Felix’s relationships.There was just nothing fresh or invigorating to this novel. I kept thinking of the movie with Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep, “Defending Your Life,” but without the droll humor. It was a corny book, and perhaps it was partially autobiographical. ?? It seems possible, because the author was trying too hard to make a statement via platitudes. It is difficult, I have heard, for some fiction writers to stand back from a quasi-fictional memoir about their own histories. It appeared that he wrestled with how to advance truth-in-fact vs. truth-in-fiction.I think that Lamb could have continued to draft this book and go deeper into the characters and story, rather than the surface narrative that he wrote, and the juvenile dialogue. Perhaps if this had been written and published in the early 60s, he would have been ahead of the curve. But, as it stands, I think it could have merit for younger readers in the YA sector, but for those of us who are seasoned readers and mortals, it just didn’t take me anywhere....more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,"Oct 18, 2016","Oct 19, 2016","Oct 28, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/30363103-i-ll-take-you-there

Ruskovich demonstrates the complex nature of memories--how they can be emotionally accurate and transformative. Powerful memories experienced by one person are transmitted through love and empathy to another, so that the truth of the memory isn’t found on facts, but rather compassion, mercy, and transcendence.This elegiac, non-linear narrative of people haunted and crippled by their past is further complicated by one character’s battle with early dementia, which advances the theme in literal and metaphorical ways. Moreover, the landscape of the mind is achingly nuanced and juxtaposed with the startling clarity of the Idaho backdrop. “The buzz of the flies. The sound of someone running, the halfhearted clucks of bored crows in the mountain woods: All of it reduces to a crackling static and a darkness.” The wellspring of memories—both real and allusive, tainted or tilted, has an active voice, nigh an independent life that twists through the Idaho terrain and the various and shifting perspectives of the central characters.To reveal the plot or events of this predominantly character-driven story would be to cheat the reader of the discovery process. This novel isn’t a traditional mystery or thriller. The storytelling is meant to demonstrate the redemptive power of unconditional love and the sublime moments of grace through even the most savage of losses. Ruskovich’s haunting prose evokes terrifying and heartfelt moments of what it means to be human, with alternating timelines and figurative speech underscoring the narrative. Her language is restrained yet keenly aware, and the storytelling is both psychologically and metaphysically electrifying.""On a sunny fall day, she lay next to him on the ground, and as he dozed she felt his old life, his memories, radiate off his skin.

In this radiant novel about friendship, partnerships, artistry, love, and family, Kayla Rae Whitaker engages the reader with a character-driven narrative that directs and guides the plot. The author underscores the power of choices that define the future and redeem the past. Whitaker’s debut features two women animators trying to advance their careers while dealing (or escaping) the issues that cloud and propel them. Kentucky-born Sharon Kisses meets rural Floridian Mel Vaught in a college sketch class. Sharon is a full-figured hetero with a string of failed relationships; Mel is a wiry lesbian with expressive confidence and independence. They forge a deep friendship and successful film partnership, becoming cult favorites of animators and audiences alike.THE ANIMATORS follows the duo in New York and elsewhere through thick and thin, as it were, but unlike my cliché, this is an original and witty, piercing and gritty tale of life on the edge. There are disturbing issues of child exploitation that was integral to Sharon’s story, so if this bothers you, please take note. It is written with sensitivity rather than exploitation or shock value, and doesn’t supersede or stereotype the book. It was also something that happened at a hairline remove from Sharon’s circumstances, yet still caused pain and confusion in her childhood.What engaged me was the value of individuality and the nuanced quality of the characters. The alliance of Sharon and Mel is nailed with finesse and legitimacy, and their relationships with family and romance were handled with authenticity. Their connection was often captured in the smallest moments, such as Sharon leaning over a storyboard and Mel draped on a chair, chewing her cuticles, while talking a scene for their animation. Here’s a moment, during creation of their film, Nashville Combat, inspired by the essence of Mel’s mother and her parade of boyfriends:“…my hand reaches out and starts to draw. The form takes shape and moves across the page, just stop-motion pencil and paper, cool and rudimentary…Brett with the nasty stache…Dale, the creepy professional clogger; Alan in snakeskin boots, who bloodied Mel’s mom’s nose for refusing to change the channel…, Red Line Dickie,…who nurtured Mel’s talents as a young, petty shoplifter.”I’m sharing just some of the basic information here. The narrative contains a breadth of events and experiences, including witty ripostes and Sharon’s “white trash” family, well thought out and fresh. In fact, there were many provocative moments that stopped me cold and made me gasp, from small to epic, that occur to Sharon and Mel. It is told from Sharon’s pov, but you inhabit all the primary and secondary characters, as they are drawn with care, intense and specific, awkward and tense and immediate and true. Even breezy, droll scenes are telling.“It’s the uncut scene.’November Rain’ is playing in the bar. Fuckin love this song, man, [Mel said]… It’s sadness porn. Skanky, melodramatic sadness porn.”If you want a story to tie up in a tight and conclusive bow, look elsewhere. Whitaker is smart subtle, and on point. Life is a work in progress, and so are her characters. Stories doesn’t end on the last page.""I spent years trying to outrun myself,  Mel says. Trying to make enough noise to drown myself out. It makes me ashamed to admit this. But it’s okay if you work to catch up to the things that have happened to you. The people who deserve to experience you, undiluted and honest. Your genuine self, given to them.""  That is this novel--undiluted and honest.

I admit, her first two books, IN THE WOODS and The LIKENESS are still my favorites, mainly because of the haunting, elegiac atmospherics that bump up against contemporary issues and pop culture. This one, her latest with Antoinette Conway and Stephen Moran as partnered detectives, concerns a young woman, Aislinn Murray, killed in her apartment, not far from where Conway lives. The new beau, Rory, is a prime suspect. Conway suspects that if she doesn't solve this one, she is out of the Murder squad. It's her first big case as lead detective, but, for the most part, she has been razzed and dumped on--the only female on the Dublin Murder Squad, and she's also forceful and assertive, something that doesn't go over well with some of the other detectives. She feels that this case could set things right for her. Conway's worries about her job is part of the book's suspense.As French often does, the question of family and relationships factor in to the motif and the murder case at hand, although at a remove that is handled with care. In the prologue, Conway is remembering how her mother spun quite some yarns about Antoinette’s absent father (an Egyptian prince! A Brazilian guitarist!), so that she never learned the truth about him. This recalled the theme about fathers in THE LIKENESS, and the pain that a daughter suffers in the fallout. In THE TRESPASSER, French explores this, and also casts characters that are willing to mold their lives around the fantasies of others.Tana Fans (including myself) do not want a  with a blow-by-blow of what happens—the anticipation and coming into it cold bring the warmth to our viscera as the pages turn and we get deeper and more fully into the story. In this, we are thoroughly in Conway’s head, and her thoughts, feelings, and actions are all happening NOW and in the present or immediate past. Usually, it works, but it also has some limiting features, such as weighing it down with exposition. I missed the atmospherics that French has done so well in the past. And there was no opportunity to infer because Conway generally beat me to the punch. Too, we know that Conway is a reliable narrator; she may have a few momentary thinking errors, or doubts, but we are privy to those. The tension, essentially, isn’t commanding. But we care about Conway, and her partnership with Moran, and we come to care about the victim, through other characters.If you are a Tana French aficionado, this is a must-read. If this is your first visit to the author, go back and read IN THE WOODS, also, for a memorable and eerie murder mystery. THE TRESPASSER may not be French’s best effort, but the provocative theme will register and resonate with anyone who is inclined to live inside the stories of others. The sense of possibility that both salvages and traps you--the frenzy for the story and all its prospects. How hard it is to beat the fantasy, to make yourself into a revision.

Now, many years later, they have both disappeared and I am alone here on this pretty clearing in the woods. Alone, save for the tar and the bird and the other thing, for which I have no name.”Every once in a while I read a novel that refuses to be pinned down, with a unique formation of voice, character, story, and themes. SHELTER IN PLACE is just such a novel. Softly spoken, narrated by the protagonist, “Joe, Joey, Joseph,” but turbulent in thought; undisguised in action, but complicated in meaning; transparently frank, but inscrutably murky. “I’m not going to tell you everything. You should know that from the start. I won’t answer all of your questions. This is not every single thing. It is only one version. Please remember that. Also, there will be no continuous rhythm. We the erratic keep terrible time.”It is the grunge era in Seattle, where music strives for authenticity, singing from an angst-filled heart and tortured soul. That’s a good way to describe Joey. His mother, Anne-Marie, with untreated bipolar disorder, is now in prison for life. Joey was twenty at the time, and discovering the hereditary menace of bipolar disorder overcoming him, also. It arrived suddenly, a physical force, “thick tar inching through my body…creeping tar, blue-black bird, talons.” As time went on, Joey developed battle plans to deal with the onslaught, but its dark wings still spread, unannounced. Tess was the only person who knew about it. She was his shelter, like their home in the clearing in the woods, and their inseparable lives.Joey’s family hangs in a precarious balance. His father, who was once aloof, has made loving overtures to Joey and Tess. His sister, Claire, has disappeared from their lives, into a posh part of London, with her London husband and their upscale, London life. His mother’s act of violence betrayed Joey, and he pities her, and loves her, but doesn’t accept what she’s done. However, she has become a heroine for didactic feminists.When Tess is enticed and magnetized by Anne-Marie’s charisma, Joey’s tranquility becomes unmoored. He feels ambivalent, equivocal, weakened by Tess’s newfound cause. The tender empathy is pierced with uncertainty, shaken with vigilante bias. And Stuart, Tess and Joey’s friend, a guard at Anne-Marie’s prison, is caught in the middle of Tess’s heightened activism. The delicate bonds of love and loyalty are fraught with commotion that threatens their stability.By turns generous, ethereal, and merciless, Maksik’s new novel mines the highs and lows of constancy and the fidelity to those we love. It is told in recursive prose at intervals, like a ballad. The cost of devotion is immeasurable and absolute; the price of life is humanity, the champion of mortality.

He’s got the nature of Denis Johnson—the attitude and sensibilities, but with his own handcrafted lingual charisma, a book that forces you to pay attention without condescending or pandering to anyone. He writes about lives unwinding even as they coil together, and about worldview opposites whose hypocrisy’s overlap. Scranton created an inscrutable, intransigent loner and war photographer, Aaron, returning from the heart of darkness in Iraq to tell others how the world really is. But Aaron is mired in an exhausted, static velocity of dread that he pours on the uninitiated pot-smoking social activists/graduate students that scorch his blistered war-torn poet’s soul, and all of them are going nowhere at accelerated speeds.The novel centers on soldiers in the Iraq war in 2003, and is bookended with 2004 in Moab, Utah, where a group of friends have been “temporarily” living while they figure out their lives. Preceding and following the Iraq chapters are passages of fever-dream poetry-prose--surreal, hypnagogic verse that make visceral sense, especially when I read out loud (without overthinking its meaning). The chapters in the body of the book are war and its metaphoric war porn—the vulgar, brutal, glimpses of soldiers in wartime and its “illicit” predatory images, which Scranton conveys in his ingenious two-toned manner. We watch the context of war, but the author’s master control of war horror’s portrait is also dispatched with garish mordancy-- shattering, stout, bleak, oblique, and hell-bent for outer darkness. A robust chunk of pages are also dedicated to the point of view of Iraqis caught in the middle of the American “War on Terror.”The façade of wartime protocol masks a haywire world that is no less absurd than the moral superiority of civilians, which Scranton subtly exposes in sardonic twists that could escape recognition if you’re not receptive. One couple, Matt and Dahlia, may be desperately holding on to their relationship past its shelf-life, even while Matt lusts after their single friend, Wendy, and Dahlia has urges that appear out of the broken mirror of her mind. She wants to put her education to use back in the northwest, and be stable, but she also conceals a mercurial nature. Matt is stuck on stars and constellations and an esoteric computer program he created that will rate rates of change and may indirectly give authoritative answers to global economic questions. Or not. The friends are having a midsummer party, and Wendy brings Aaron, her current sexcessory, who’s an outsider to the group. Things get heated when Aaron’s motivations for joining the National Guard is attacked by feminist/lesbian Mel, to the point where she calls him a Nazi in shrill, expletive salvos, and he imprecates back with spitting rancor. As bowls are smoked and stars in the sky are observed, the reader is led to the gripping, shocking finale in the last chapter. But, between the short Moab chapters, we are submerged in military speak and wartime peril, which will twist whatever lens you have been observing battle from the distant comfort of TVs, computers, newspapers, and other forms of media. I almost didn’t get this book, because the cover turned me off. But, as they say, don’t judge a book…and, at the close of it, I can’t think of a more appropriate image, one I could not accept initially, but, after the searing narrative, can’t contradict.“Up out of the ancient garden of Saddam’s Ba’athist dystopia grew the fiber-optic slums of tomorrowland, where shepherds on cell phones herded flocks down expressways and insurgents uploaded video beheadings—everything rising and falling as one, Hammurabi’s Code and Xboxes, the wheel and the Web, Ur to Persepolis to Sykes Picot to CNN, a ruin outside of time, a twenty-first-century cyperpunk war-machine interzone.”...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 07, 2016","Sep 11, 2016","Sep 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27774542-war-porn

How molecules made the world. All the ugly and wonderful things people had done in the last two thousand years.”If Wavonna (Wavy) Quinn had been raised by wolves, she probably would have experienced a more safe and stable environment. Instead, this skinny little girl, who looked younger than her eight years, was shuffled between her aunt, her grandmother, the State system, and her meth-manufacturing, meth-dealing parents, Val and Liam. Val is an addict whose personality bounces between Good Mama and Scary Mama, and Liam flagrantly cheats on Val with his tarty women. Some people should never be allowed to be parents—and, often, they are too toxic to apprehend that they are damaging their children. This is Wavonna’s story, told in several and alternating perspectives, including her own.Wavy was rarely treated tenderly as a child, except by her grandmother. When she ate, her mother regularly stuck her fingers down Wavy’s throat, inducing vomiting, claiming that hands and food were dirty, and then forced her to wash her mouth out with Listerine. Wavy and her younger brother, Donal, were by turns abused and neglected, as her parents were in and out of jail, and were too toxic to care about their children. Wavy went to live with her Aunt Brenda and cousins for a while, but by then, Wavy trusted no one.As Wavy grappled with constant uncertainty and the daily hazards of her life, she stopped talking, except rarely and expediently. She also stopped eating in front of people, and snuck out nightly to comb the neighborhood, breaking into people’s homes to eat their desserts, or feed out of the trash. She was a comely, bright girl who looked like she would never be a woman. Deprived of a secure home, she provided her own shelter with the stars in the sky, where she felt grounded. The constellations were home to her.“Cassiopeia. Andromeda. Perseus. Cepheus. Cygnus. Ursa Minor…With the sun gone, I could see all the stars, and the planets, too…like stairs from the moon down to the meadow.”And, when a twenty-something greaser/biker mechanic, Kellen, an ex-con employee of Liam’s, wrecks his motorcycle in front of Wavy, such begins a long and trusting friendship. Kellen is the only adult who cares deeply about Wavy’s safety, security, education, heart, and soul. It may be disquieting to many readers to endure their deepening bond, but the contrast between a sanctioned relationship, which may yet be a cruel one, and a lawless one that is true happiness and safety, certainly made me think outside the box, despite societal taboos. The characters here were authentic and the story unfolded over the course of thirteen years. Some readers claimed that the ending wasn’t natural, but I disagree. ,Despite the reflexive unease it arouses, Bryn Greenwood acquits her controversial narrative with sound and sturdy traction. By the time you get to the finale, you realize it could have only gone one of two ways, and this option, I think, wasn’t the easier one. The end may have been a bit compressed, but certainly not reductive or incompatible with the themes and text. The prose and tempo were outstanding, and the pacing and plot had me turning the pages till the wee hours of the night.

And I was right. Only a fierce observer of humanity such as Prose could turn this preposterous plot of a motley theater group (and its audience members), struggling to breathe life into a stale children’s musical, into a poignant survey of urban life.There are so many ironies in this book—and Prose is masterful with using the sense of the absurd to reveal the sobering but distorted biases. For example, the character of Mister Monkey, who is played by a twelve-year-old boy in a confining monkey suit, is an orphan monkey from Africa (parents killed by poachers). He comes to stay with a human family in America who become beloved to him. Subsequently, he is wrongly accused of stealing a family friend’s wallet (by the jealous friend), and the play then centers on the legal difficulties of trying to prove his innocence. In the meantime, Adam, the actor, has raging hormones, and has started playing MM with aggression, so that he alienates the other actors onstage and puzzles the audience. The parodies like that serve to illuminate the incongruous perceptions that exist.The children’s play is also a vehicle that transports us from actor to actor, writer, director, and audience members. Many of the sacred cows of urban elitism are also revealed, such as Adam’s parents obsessed on which school he attends, but ignoring the fact that the dysfunction in the household has way more impact on his life. Moreover, some of the adult actors, who are getting a bit long in the tooth, express defeatism, discouraged by being stuck in a second-rate production, and dreaming of bigger things.The author covers everything from cognitive dissonance; thinking errors about our culture; romance problems; talent; technology; isolation; philosophy; extinction; religious beliefs; childhood; ageism; and elitism, among other things. And what about evolution? If a monkey can evolve, can human beings? No character escapes the adversity of their own lives and the perceptions of themselves. The author exposes the fundamental dissatisfactions that lurk in mankind, often made worse by a nagging sense that our hopes are imperfect or hollow. But, Prose surmounts a toneless cynicism, by demonstrating that desire makes us vital, if only we can locate the optimism and connection to humanity, if only we can access our superpowers. We, too, can evolve....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Aug 20, 2016","Aug 25, 2016","Aug 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28694483-mister-monkey

But sometimes it is just “factual enough” and can cause harm to others. “My God, you think, what have I done? In all innocence. But innocence is not the excuse. Innocence is the cause. And we are appalled, those of us who are in charge. The others turn the page.”Much of Ward Just’s tour de force is about the newspaper industry, and about the people who create or become the printed “piece.” And it also illuminates the fallout from scrutiny and intrusion. The protagonist, Ned Ayres, has been in the industry all his adult life. He started his career in his native berg of Herman, Indiana, the butt of many jokes about its provincial prejudices and Pleasantville-type pretensions, along with a brittle shield of cognitive dissonance. Ned later went on to be an editor in Chicago, and then to Washington, D.C. The powerful people who own the newspapers are the ones whose privacy is the most protected, but they thrive on exposing those who aren’t.Ned Ayres grew up on the embellished stories his uncle told him about his years as a soldier in the Great War. At only 52, he lived in a nursing home, impaired from a grenade. Ned’s father, a circuit judge, known for his rectitude and dry wit on the bench, often reminded Ned that these were non-factual stories. Neddy didn’t care; he loved listening to his uncle, anyway, and these years may have been his inspiration for becoming a newspaperman, and even his reliance, occasionally, on stories that were “factual enough.”Ward Just often writes novels that narrate at arm’s length—cool, rather detached, and emotionally indirect. However, compared to his earlier work, I think THE EASTERN SHORE is more intimate and stirring, although subtle--nothing overwrought or electrifying, but poignant and even bracing in its refined nuance. There were times that I felt a melancholy sorrow while reading, especially when Ned was recalling a newspaper story that destroyed a family and affected him for the rest of his career. The theme and moral inquiry of sifting through others’ lives as a profession hit home with enduring concerns. Over the course of the novel, Ned and his personal and public life touched me with its authenticity. There wasn’t one false note in this quiet but unsentimentally tender story. The backstories are gently folded into the present time, and events and experiences of other characters that touched Ned’s life took on their own velocity. It was written in the third person, but the view from Ned’s perch (and those close to him) was key to engaging the reader. Ayres and the people close and peripheral to him came fully alive.Ned’s profession informed the decisions he made in his private life, for better or worse. His ability to sustain a relationship was often interfered by the demanding work of the newspaper. Ironic, also, were the consequences of being the editor. He stood back from creating; he corrected, proofed, and chose many of the pieces, yet remained on the outside of the writers’ work. At times, he questioned the veracity of being the assembler, dissembler, attenuator, rather than the journalist/reporter.“Editing was as invisible as the work of a careful tailor. No one outside the newsroom could say, Nice edit, because readers never saw the edit. They saw the results of the edit. The edit was the live heart beating against the skin, essential yet concealed, crafted to endure. It was the mirror of the sea.”The power of this book, and Ward Just’s narrative, is the quiet, elegantly bespoke prose, straightforward but superbly metaphoric, and no tricks to move the reader via cunning or contrived drama. The beauty, tragedy, and triumphs of the human condition shone through with delicacy and strength, even rogue coarseness at times. “The reporter sought coherence, but there was no coherence…Whirl ruled. And the facts fell willy-nilly from an overburdened tree, yet habitually a few facts short. As for the newsroom cynicism, …the worst thing a reporter could be called was naïve. A parasol in a pigsty.”Read it for the passages, for the pellucid prose, for the workings and the cultivation of the news and the people who control it.

The unexpected naturalness of the prose, the spot-on temperament of the drama, and the organic interactions of 9/10 of the story impressed me. Once I started it, I was installed in the story till the end. A young woman in her 20s knows she strongly resembles an older version of a 16-year-old that went missing over a decade ago. She pretends to be her when she is caught shoplifting, because she needed a bait and switch story to cover up her crimes—or, rather, to excuse for them. The ride to her “parents” was visually and viscerally riveting, and the novel unfolds in alternating time/person sequences.The missing-girl Bec chapters (2003), told in third person, leads us from her life as it is up to the day she went missing. In between, also in the omniscient pov, it is 2014, and the masquerading Bec tells her story, also, and what led up to her impersonation. What is psychologically piquing is that the impersonator starts getting into the skin of Bec, merely by being with Bec’s family and friends, and sizing up the missing girl’s history with the people who helped make Bec’s past what it was. Moreover, her own history feeds into Bec’s. We don’t really know if the pretender has a benign agenda or a wicked, self-serving one. Analyzing motives of her deception, and watching it steadily contour around certain facts and feelings, adds a genuine psychological weight to the novel. At times, I had to even remind myself which character was on the page, as the real Bec and the fraud possess some pivotal parities as time goes by and the drama steadily mounts.When Bec goes missing, the parents, her twin younger brothers, and her best friend, Lizzie, are totally in the dark about what happened. The key investigator felt her failed the family by not solving the crime. After her “return,” he is back on the case, determined to find out what happened, but “Bec” is not forthcoming. And, of course, the woman imitating Bec is equally determined to find out what happened. All these various agendas, plus a few sinister texts that the pretend Bec receives when she is inaugurated into Bec’s family, and gets a cell phone, compounds the tension and entices the reader. Even when I thought I figured it out, I was still hedging my bets. The author did a fine job of staying a beat ahead of us. At the denouement, I was near-astonished, but the organic nature of people and events gave it an inevitability. The author laid it on a wee bit thick/over the top near the end, but not enough to disappoint or dissatisfy. No gimmicks or phony props and contrivances, which is a big plus in this genre. I may not remember this novel for years to come, and it won’t make my best of the year. However, it is truly engaging. Curl up, invest in a day and a half, and let it unfurl.

By examining how they treat the places I’ve been, I can likely assess the quality of their coverage. I use Rick Steves guide books for detailed info, but the pics in other travel books (like this one) tend to pop. This is a heavy doorstopper book, for starters, with very condensed information. I wouldn’t want to walk around the cities with it. So, I would likely leave it at home and use it for making decisions beforehand, and possibly tear out some relevant pages to bring with me.The contents are color-coded and easy to find, with the following countries in separate sections: Britain and Ireland, France, Spain, Italy, The Netherlands and Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic, and Greece. The maps are quite detailed and informational—I’d give those 5 stars. There’s a lot of different scaled scaled maps, e.g., close-ups of a section of town, such as Greater London, Central Rome, Berlin, etc., or a city, or a globe look of a country. The maps make this a worthy book. Some of the maps, like the Tower of London, are unnecessary, as you’ll get an even better map at the actual site. But I did like the river map of the Thames, with Tube stops clearly marked. The Greater Vienna street map was my least favorite. We must have walked around the Ringstrasse 30 times, and I am familiar with the area, but the map here, although busy with text, isn’t user-friendly or clearly delineated, as far as the Ring.Some of the thumbnail sketches are better than others. The Reichstag in Berlin tells you all you need to know to visit. It lists the contact website to request mandatory (free, but advanced rez required) reservations. And the thumbnails also give you the address, days and hours that it is opened, and public transport stops. But the “Checkpoint Charlie” site, although listed as a tacky tourist trap, fails to mention that it isn’t even the REAL Checkpoint Charlie! It was informative, though, about Hitler’s Bunker now being a paved over parking area (to some apts). The Venice section impressed me with gorgeous pictures. But, what happened to Burano, the city of lace and pastel houses? It was easily my favorite stop in the Venice area, a long two-hour or more water taxi ride, but I enjoyed it more than Murano (which is highlighted), the city of the famous blown glass. I definitely take points off for no Burano mention.There is a lot of helpful info, sometimes in sidebars on the pages, or colored in, or given a feature on a page. For example, “If you like German castles;” museums; a piece on Dachau Concentration camp and the times open for tours; my favorite areas in the Rhine area and Bavarian region; and even the thermal baths in Baden-Baden, where we are going this Xmas. There’s transportation info; an A-Z thumbnail directory on everything from Internet access, Gay and Lesbian Travellers, Money (and ATMs), Safe Travel, Traveling with Disabilities, and even some basic phrases (and pronunciation) in various languages. I don’t use any guide book, really, for dining (we like to be spontaneous about that), so I can’t comment on its usefulness or accuracy. Food quality is so subjective, anyway. I may use a book just to find unusual settings for dining. As far as sleeping accommodations, I didn’t find this too useful, either. Very few are listed, and most are the more pricey ones.There’s a lengthy section on Paris, as to be expected, but nothing pops that I haven’t already seen or read elsewhere. We will be going to Amsterdam, Bruges, and Ghent in December, and I plan to tear out the map pages, and use them as an adjunct to the more detailed info on the cities in my Rick Steves book.In conclusion, I would advise this book as a more superficial guide, or an adjunct to a more detailed guide like RS. The info here is more like quickie Internet guidance, but, as I mentioned, I really like a lot of the maps. The RS guides are much lighter weight due to thinner pages, but this could make a decent coffee table book. It isn’t practical to bring it whole, but parceling out pages would be useful. The maps are what shines!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Jun 2016,Aug 2016,"Aug 03, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24923440-discover-europe-4

The protagonist, Felix, is a man looking for revenge, but he is patient, and prefers to play the long game. Twelve years ago, Felix’s former friend and assistant, Tony, betrayed him by staging a coup of sorts. Tony ambushed Felix with the rubber-stamping sock puppets on the Board to terminate Felix’s contract as Artistic Director (and often central actor) at the Makeshewig Shakespeare Festival. Tony, the snaky betrayer, would replace Felix. Felix was at the height of his artistic and influential powers when he was ousted, and was about to stage a strange but wildly creative recreation of THE TEMPEST, but he was also at the depth of despair. His loving wife died a year after their marriage, and their daughter recently died of meningitis at age three, leaving him staggered with grief. After Tony had him removed (and has since climbed the ladder of political ambitions), Felix had nobody and nothing but his “imaginary” Miranda. His dead daughter became his muse. But now, twelve years later, it is time to depose the deposer, and Felix aims to do so within the confines of the Fletcher prison and its motley group of prisoner-students of Felix’s literacy project. He has used the alias “Mr. Duke,” although the enthusiastic woman who hired and helps him bring his productions to life knows who he really is. To others in the creative world he is all but dead, or at the very least, disappeared. How sweet is revenge, as Felix has as much joy in planning this revenge coup as executing it. Perhaps it may be that, the post-mortem in stage life is what gives a character, or a grieving father, his raison d'être.Although the opening of the novel was mildly constrained, I sensed an eventual powerhouse of a book, partly because of Atwood’s strength as a writer, and knowing that this initial layout was just a lead-in, to make space for the plot and characters to layer and expand. It’s a complicated genesis from prison project to revenge comedy via meta-play, by way of THE TEMPEST, easily the most “special effects” laden of Shakespeare’s plays. How to do that in a prison? Atwood, by way of Felix, did it with aplomb. I can’t seem to separate Atwood from Felix (but in a laudatory way, and without authorial interference), but at the same time, Felix comes alive as an individual that could walk off the pages. He really connects well to the prisoners, some who have been in previous Fletcher plays. One of the prisoners, an ace techno wizard, helps Felix achieve his ultimate goal.The rules for the prisoners in the literacy program are: no swear words that aren’t in the play, even during offstage discussion. Transgressors lose points, and winners win smuggled in cigarettes. The creative prison players often used words allowed like “whoreson,” “pox,” and “Hag-seed.” They rewrite the play, as a team, to make it more understandable for a modern audience. Felix also got an outside actress that he knows to play Miranda.The play is videotaped so that the rest of the prisoners can see it, too. And, this allows Felix flexibility to achieve his secret mission. Tony and company will be coming, as VIPs, to watch the videotaped version of the Fletcher Tempest. Felix is hoping for a superb outcome, especially because the politicians in the city (including Tony) have voted to axe the Fletcher Literacy Project. Felix has a lot to correct here, and it isn’t the players!I won’t reveal the particulars, but Atwood is a real magician herself, with prose, story, and narrative in a wonderful hybrid of onstage/offstage fusion (although, to be honest, we don’t see much of the onstage action, which could theoretically be disappointing to some readers, but Atwood made it work). One of the most delicious nuggets of the novel is that, after the denouement, the last section of the book deals with the prisoners predicting, based on their interpretation of the play and their characters, what happens afterwards. That really hit the sweet spot for me, because it demonstrates the superlative success of the literacy project at the prison.Canadian writer Margaret Atwood is one of most intrepid, most distinguished, most prolific and diverse writers of the 20th and 21st century, who has written this extraordinary recreation of Shakespeare’s THE TEMPEST for the Hogarth series of Shakespeare recreations. But did you know that she is also the first contributor of a time capsule project called The Future Library Project? It was conceived by a Scottish artist, and started in 2014 with the planting of 1,000 trees in Nordmarka (outside Oslo) and will evolve over the next 100 years. Every year a writer is asked to contribute a story that they write, and it will remain unread for 100 years. Finally, in 2114, after 100 contributing writers have sealed up their stories, the trees will be cut down and used to make paper for this story collection, which will then be printed and published. Even our children won’t get to read it! So, Margaret Atwood, a prize-winning, outstanding, and serious writer of the present, is truly a writer of the future (not just futuristic, as with her dystopian novels). And here in HAGSEED, she recreates a masterpiece of the past, and she is absolutely up to the task, with her novel of a play that is also itself a play within a play. So why my digression into the FLP? Because it is evident (if you didn’t know already) that Atwood cares about literature, about literacy and libraries and education, and reaching out to a wide variety of literature lovers and potential literature lovers, and keeping stories alive through eternity. And not just that, but she is an egalitarian when it comes to literature. Shakespeare isn’t just for academics, or trust fund babies passing the time in liberal arts colleges. It’s also about reaching out to everyone, including prisoners locked up and loaded with prison and class system problems, some who are less literate than others. I believe that HAGSEED is also a wink and a nod to Atwood’s personal aspirations and successes, her desire for literature to reach everyone. Again, part of Atwood’s passionate desire for literature to be appreciated by all walks of life, and not to be excluded from the fringes of society.Says “SnakeEye, as Antonio, re Prospero:“He was stuck in his book, doin’ his magic,Wavin’ his wand around and all that shit,I took what I like, and that was fine,Whatever I wanted, it was mine……I was bossin around the whole Milan nation……So now I’m the man, the man, the big man,I’m the Duke, I’m the Duke, I’m the Duke of Milan.”...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jul 30, 2016","Aug 02, 2016","Jul 30, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29245653-hag-seed

NUTSHELL may highlight his most imaginative narrator yet, as heIan McEwan is one of the most entertaining and engaging literary writers of our times. NUTSHELL may highlight his most imaginative narrator yet, as he has reimagined Hamlet, but Prince “Hamlet” is an unborn baby (as yet unnamed), swimming around his amniotic sac! And this fetus speaks to the reader in a thoroughly non-gimmicky and satisfying way. That’s it, in a nutshell, no spoilers. It is a suspenseful tale, not just a refit or redo. McEwan’s sophistication and maturity as a writer grant him the alacrity to keep Shakespeare’s play as the shell, but the nugget inside is a new, original idea. Whether you read the bard or not, you can immensely enjoy this on its own merit. There’s a sizzling authenticity in NUTSHELL’s protagonist-fetus, residing in the darkness of his devious, cunning, and self-deceptive mother. (not to mention, she drinks so much, I would expect a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome, if it were totally accurate—but, I allow for writer’s license in this case). McEwan makes him authentic, organic, and very much alive as he floats in his watery world. In NUTSHELL, although a short book, the author packs a balance of delight and dread, of comedy and tragedy. It feels like a longer book when you reach the finale, because there is so much to think about in this inverted, upside down version of Shakespeare’s masterpiece. This little nutshell is a masterpiece in itself. I could have read it one day, but chose to slow my pace and chew on it in slow-food fashion. I really don’t want to give much away; there is so much for the reader to unwrap in this compact little book. The characters are superbly drawn. The mother-to-be, no surprise, is named Trudy, and she is just as shrewd, greedy, and controlling as Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude. She is having an affair with, of course, Claude, her husband’s crass, unimaginative and greedy brother. Trudy’s fatal flaw may be underestimating her husband, John, a poet afflicted with romantic dreams and a bad case of psoriasis.You can surmise the characters' dispositions by paralleling the Elizabethan play, but it isn’t simply a mimicking cast. There are similar plots, themes and motifs between Hamlet and NUTSHELL, such as murder and revenge, the weight of one's mortality and the complexities of life and death. And, of course, our hero in both texts is invariably pondering the meaning of life and extinction. In this contemporary tale, the unborn baby is often content with his home in the womb, so he mulls over the end of his umbilical life, and deliberates, also, whether he can have more influence here in his amniotic home or later when he is born. As he agonizes over the morals of his mother and uncle, and distresses over being ignored by all involved, the stakes begin to stack higher and the emotional thrust of the story hinges on the narrator’s decisions. “The beginning of conscious life was the end of illusion, the illusion of non-being, and the eruption of the real. The triumph of realism over magic, of is, over seems. My mother is involved in a plot, and therefore I am, too, even if my role might be to foil it. Or if I, reluctant fool, come to term too late, then to avenge it.”...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jul 27, 2016","Jul 29, 2016","Jul 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29752912-nutshell

His murder mysteries are less whodunit (although that is there, also), and are more psychological and psychopathological. Motive is the last thing we generally learn, which can be more thrilling than the culprit who did it. In this case, we ask ourselves if there WAS a murder. Aging writer M, who is troubled by his current loss of relevance, was made famous several decades ago, primarily by writing a novel, Payback, that was inspired by a true news story about the disappearance of a high school history teacher in Amsterdam. The case was never solved, but M decided to solve it in his imaginative, creative way. By making it fiction, it gave him carte blanche to add his own “facts” and finale. Decades later, his newest book is tepidly received, his latest young wife is losing interest, and his daughter is mostly a prop to him.Alternating with the writer is a motley group of teenagers in high school. Koch kept me off balance with the circumspect nature of the narrative and the characters. Just as I thought I “knew” a character, a fact would be revealed ambiguously and casually, just enough to make me stop in my tracks and read the passage again, looking for a clue I may have missed. The adolescents weren’t vanilla cutouts—they lived and breathed on the pages, and all had flaws and a dark side, some more than others. There’s even a teen named Herman, who I imagine Koch to have looked like as a 17 year-old. I even googled him to see if his teeth were as unattractive as the character’s, but all the pictures of Herman Koch online are close-mouthed!Step inside the pages of this Koch mystery, and I suspect you will be engrossed. It’s about writers, publication, the life of the mind, identity, lust, secrets, and the lines we cross. Some are between fact and fiction, and some are between fact and desire. And others are the territory of memory, between the past and the present. “…you cross a line, and all that’s left is before and after. With each day that you move further away from that line, the things that happened before become more important. Become clearer, take on more portent.”...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jul 16, 2016","Jul 25, 2016","Jul 19, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29342995-dear-mr-m

However, Dundas’s debut novel is a classic testament to the omniscient point-of-view novel with a direct, successive storyline. It adds background and backstory with fluent ease, gathering suspense and character development along the way.Taking place mostly in rural Montana in the early 1920s--the age of the Volsted Act-- the story follows Pepper Van Dean, a former lightweight wrestling champ of the world, and his efforts to train an African American heavyweight-class wrestler who desires to fight the current white champion, something unheard of in those times. The contender, Garfield Taft, like Van Dean, went from rags to riches to rags, but Taft’s mildly eccentric, immature, and arrogant temperament, antagonize Pepper’s scientific approach to wrestling. Moreover, Taft has a long-suffering white wife with dark secrets.The intriguing opening line lured me in immediately: “The clowns came to get him when it was time for the hanging.” It eventually leads into Pepper Van Dean’s current status as a circus act, as “Master of the Hangman’s Drop,” and soon introduces us to his card-shark, loving wife, Moira. The events that led them to nomadic, second-class circus jobs are explained gradually, with a few choice facts revealed selectively, and serve to heighten the tension in the story. After Pepper makes an agreement to train Taft, he looks to the future, but the past is still on his heels.Dundas has superb control over his characters and story, and, as I continued to read his confident, lean, succulent prose and his taut narrative, I knew I was in the hands of a solid storyteller whose writing skills combined a command of craft, artistic talent, and creative finesse. Even his setting and descriptions are vivid metaphors to the story. As Pepper approaches Butte Montana, “The town sat out there like a coiled snake sunning itself on a rock, a murky industrial haze scuffing up the sky.”I was thoroughly gripped by the story of Pepper, Moira, Garfield Taft, and his wife. And I was installed in the era of end-stage, real-world wrestling and the oncoming age of fixed matches; bootleggers; gangsters; gamblers; circus acts; and poker players. “One of the best rules to know… Only play fair when you’ve got the best hand.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Jun 29, 2016","Jul 06, 2016","Jun 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27272423-champion-of-the-world

It’s a captive mystery, domestic drama, horror story, and philosophical questThis is a book that is ripe for discussion, and liberal with its genres. It’s a captive mystery, domestic drama, horror story, and philosophical quest. It’s a book of ideas, speculative fiction, an inquiry on the nature of the divine, a psychological thriller, the sentience of language, and a subversion of literary conventions. It challenges how narrative assumptions filter reality, illustrating that no singular truths or meanings exist. Millet throws all the tropes outside of the box, enticing a reader willing to risk a heady and sometimes disorienting adventure. There are no tidy answers to the questions that it raises. Life is messy and coiled with twists, which Millet artfully spins into a spooky, propulsive tale.So here is the premise of the plot. Anna naïvely weds handsome, cold, calculating, philandering Ned, who married her for her family’s money. Once they had a baby, Lena, he duly ignores them, chasing his greedy aspirations instead. Moreover, since Lena’s birth, Anna is burdened by hearing voices, a chronic stream of overlapping, foreign sounding chatter, except for the one English phrase, “the living spring from the dead.” The voices finally stop when Lena begins to talk, but the experience and the incomprehensible meaning of it continues to beguile Anna and influence her actions. In the meantime, the very real threat of Ned, which predominates the plot as a thriller, escalates the tension and dread.Anna moves with Lena to a seaside motel in Maine, where the setting and the eerie resident behaviors trigger a resemblance to a Stephen King novel. At the same time, Ned demands that Anna and Lena return to Alaska to pose for family pictures and join him periodically in his campaign to run for office. He makes it clear that he can find them and sabotage their lives. Ned, the family values man and “good Christian,” is anything but. As a reader, I was caught up in Anna’s anxiety, and a sense of uncertainty crept in as I mulled over her stability.The spectrum of s from one to five stars is unsurprising to me. If you expect a concrete conclusion and definitive closure, then this book may not be your cuppa. Rather, the narrative dwells in the realm of the spiritual and theosophical, the mysteries of the divine, and the enigmatic nature of language and human behavior. A wealth of interpretations are possible, based on our own experiences with the cosmic and unanswerable. I sensed Carl Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious--the innate, transcendental wisdom that guides mankind. And how does that factor into this mixed-genre novel? I won’t pretend to apprehend all the answers. However, I was absorbed by the edgy construction and provocative themes that braided myriad ideas into a scintillating story--the politics of society; the culture of family; the meaning of motherhood; the nature of the divine; lingual mysticism; neural lexicography; the tyranny of fear; and the power of humanity....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jun 28, 2016","Jun 30, 2016","Jun 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26530341-sweet-lamb-of-heaven

My favorite, THE INDIAN BRNorwegian writer Karin Fossum never fails to impress me with her diverse varied format approaches in writing crime fiction. My favorite, THE INDIAN BRIDE, transcends genre and fits more squarely into literature. Her focus is on characters and/or communities, but her novels have such varied design that you can be sure of a fresh structure to each book.HELLFIRE is an Inspector Sejer story, like most of Fossum’s books. Konrad Sejer is a laid-back, middle-aged widower-detective who is both thorough in his work and benevolent in his humanity. He is trying to solve the murder of a mother and her five-year-old son who were found in an abandoned caravan, stabbed to death. The bloodied knife was left at the crime scene, without fingerprints. In this crime, the questions are who and why.There are two separate narratives that each focus on a single mother and son. One storyline is of the victims--Bonnie Hayden and her son, Simon. Bonnie is an attractive woman who has made the best of her hardships. She’s very protective of Simon, who suffers from separation anxiety when she drops him off at nursery school. To barely make ends meet, she works cleaning homes and running basic errands for the elderly and disabled.Twenty-one-year-old Eddie Malthe lives at home with his single mother, and barely remembers his father. He has no formal diagnosis, but is clearly on the autism spectrum (I am a psychiatric nurse, specializing in autism, and I recognize Eddie’s key features). Abandoned by his now deceased father, who ran off with another woman, Eddie is obsessed with finding his grave somewhere in Copenhagen.As the storylines alternate, and Sejer pursues the investigation, the reader is pulled deeper into the lives of the mothers and their sons, and the secrets that can shatter families. Fossum, as always, does a meticulous job of rounding out her characters. But, as fleshed out as the cast is, I wasn’t that invested, because they didn’t compel me. The lack of early intervention for Eddie seemed more urgent than the sharing of family secrets, but I don't think Fossum intended it that way. I was more concerned with the medical resources he was lacking than the need to hear the truth about his father.As for Bonnie and her parents, the past devastation had an impact on her life, but the ties to the theme felt late and forced. Fossum generally hooks me in more fruitfully to her social issues, but in this book, I thought it sputtered. The plot advancement occasionally stalled, and was redundant, and at times I just wanted to get on with it.It took a while for the tension to mount, while moving toward a few surprise twists towards the end. But, despite a late reveal being organic to the characters, it was also less imaginative and nuanced than the Fossum books that have grabbed me in the past. It could be just individual preferences, but I wasn’t rewarded in the end. It lacked the understated charisma, or the impact, that I usually associate with her books. There was satisfactory closure, but I merely sighed at the end....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,Jun 2016,Jun 2016,"Jun 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25897831-hell-fire

Once called “Islands of the Dead,” itThe Farallon Islands, 30 miles off the coast of San Francisco, is a remote archipelago teeming with marine life. Once called “Islands of the Dead,” it is composed of craggy, rotting, ancientgranite, adverse to civilization, with the animals as sovereign entities. In summer, the islands are covered in a wall of fog. During bird season, the gulls will crack your skull and peck out your eyes if you fail to wear protective gear. The islands are overrun with rodents, and a pungent stench dominates the air--of guano, ammonia, mice, salt, and mildew. Scientists take a back seat to wildlife, and are there to observe without interference. Despite its hardship, the untamable landscape inspires six marine biologists and the novel’s protagonist, Miranda, a nature photographer. The scientists--Mick, Galen, Forest, Lucy, Andrew, and Charlene--are tasked with studying marine life, each according to their specialties. A few have stayed for years, and some live here indefinitely. They dwell in a crudely built cabin, and survive without technology, (other than a TV that emits only sound). There’s a walkie to the mainland for emergencies. Time is measured by the cycles of mating seasons--sharks, seals, whales, and sea birds. “The islets are central stars in a galaxy of marine life. The birds and seals are the inner constellation—…great white sharks…pulled out of their mysterious orbits to linger offshore. Whales, like far-flung comets….” The archipelago is a self-contained universe, and the marine life is the hub of importance. The scientists study the animals with reverence, without corrupting or altering the ecosystem.Miranda is a recent arrival, just starting her yearlong assignment. There’s a tacit agreement, she discovers, not to talk about your past and to keep your personal business private. To her, the residents act as remote as the islands, and come across almost as ciphers. Interspersed with the scientists’ daily life are Miranda’s interior monologues, written as melancholy missives to her long deceased mother. For the past twenty years, she has been sending the letters from all over the world, addressing them to “Mom,” knowing they will end up in the Dead Letter Office. Her relationship with her father is cordial but aloof, always at a distance. She is searching for home and stability, but so far, a sense of permanence eludes her. In the prologue, Miranda is leaving the islands, a sense of malevolence and danger personified by the savage behavior of the gulls as she races to the ferry. Geni’s image-laden prose, at turns clipped, ephemeral, and visceral, commands the story from the opening pages. The author’s photography leitmotif maintains its dominion throughout. For example, Miranda recalls learning the Dutch angle: “Used for dramatic effect. A tilt that leaves the viewer off-balance. It can convey disorientation, unease, intoxication, even madness.” And this is the realm of the narrative’s propulsion.Miranda’s compulsion to write to her mother and her shutterbug passion are inextricably bound together--to archive memories--or create them. “Each time we remember something, we change it…I imagine my recollections like rooms in a house. I can’t help but alter things when I step inside…My work is the enemy of memory…” “To remember is to rewrite. To photograph is to replace. The only reliable memories…are the ones…forgotten. They are the dark rooms of the mind.” Between the savage wildlife and the secretive scientists, the reader will experience an unsettling presence in the absence of explanation. Moreover, a mythic ghost is said to wander the premises, often seen during times of stress. Within the haunting atmosphere of the story, violence comes early and mysteries escalate with the seasons. The themes of loss, recovery, redemption, and the ghosts that follow you are played out in this mixed genre, eerie narrative. Geni juxtaposes a meditative story of the natural world with a suspenseful mystery. The islands themselves are conveyed as a principal character. Don’t expect an outcome tied up in a bow, but its provocative resolution underscores the allusive rules of the isolated island dwellers—“Noninterference is the core of their belief system.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 17, 2016","Jun 17, 2016","Jun 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25786411-the-lightkeepers

David is director of a prestigious computer science laboratory in Boston that gathers the best minds in the field. An only child, born through surrogacy, Ada was homeschooled (more like “lab-schooled”) by her unorthodox father and became an integral part of his colleagues’ lives, especially his best friend and close colleague next door, Diana Liston. For twelve years it was just David, Ada and the lab. She even participated in David’s experiments in artificial intelligence, a language acquisition program called ELIXIR. Under David’s tutelage, Ada cultivates a saber-sharp, inquisitive mind that augurs a bright future.David and the Steiner Lab provided Ada all the security, love, and knowledge she thought she needed. Occasionally, she wished for a peer group, to socialize with other kids, but they were only fleeting desires. However, Ada didn’t anticipate the sea change in her lifestyle at this age, either. When this happens, it prompts a dedicated search through David’s past, a lifetime journey of discovery that leads to an astonishing but inescapable conclusion.Suddenly thrust into a conventional social network, Ada attempts to navigate in a new, uncertain world. How to harness and express herself in new codes of conduct and engagement with others? “…she often felt as if there was something fundamentally incorrect about her, as if she was caught between two worlds, a citizen of neither.” The narrative tension arises from a meticulous progression of plot, but its beauty resides in the liminal spaces of the mind.Questions of identity, both literal and figurative, consume Ada and permeate the story. The answers, she reasons, are hidden in a patchy web of history. Her life was once so cloistered, and now her ties are loose and her bonds tenuous. What gives us the substance of who we are; in other words, what makes us human? This book probes the nature, nurture, and future of our identity.The pace is unflinchingly steady despite the structure of chronological leaps. The past, present, and future were uniformly revelatory. I was directly caught up in the story, and rapt by its graceful poise and tensile symmetry. Not one detail is indulgent or unqualified, and the spotless prose is lean, sinuous, and even cabalistic at times. The author’s portrayal of Ada was a radiant yet restrained brew of psychology, emotion, and thought. Moore masterfully stood aside from her writing; the words were a doorway to the plot and characters. Ada could have walked off the pages and breathed on her own, so authentic was her characterization. She will go down as one of my favorite female characters of this century. It’s a surprisingly swift read with a powerful denouement and fascinating but inevitable finale. I couldn’t turn the 400+ pages fast enough. The multi-genre approach will appeal to mainstream and literary readers alike, as it cross-sectioned both without sacrifice. It’s a mix of family drama, suspense thriller, speculative fiction, and mystery.

She falls into a coma, and subsequently wakes up with no memory of the events that transpired. In fact, she remembers hardly anything about her life, her family, or her circumstances. An obscure Boston journalist, Molly Swift (sounds like a name for a series), pursues the story, with her background boss in the states urging her on. The family that Quinn is staying with, the Blavettes, are missing, which makes Quinn a suspect, witness, or victim in an unidentified crime.The police have no leads. They ask Quinn to make an ongoing video diary of her thoughts/recall to help her memory return. In the non-linear approach to the story, we know from the opening pages that Quinn is out of her coma and trying to fill in the blanks.

This alternates with chapters on Molly, who has pretended to be the suspect’s aunt. Now, add a burnt out, stereotypical police detective and some secrets, lies, and a few sociopaths.Ultimately, this was a mixed bag to me. What I admired about Horsely’s narrative, right from the start, was the tone and voice. These two components can make or break my initial absorption, the incipient lure that makes me want to stay. It is especially difficult when the story is about a teenager, but aimed at adults. Horsely applies a frank, observant approach with moody undertones, and keeps it taut. She also has a knack for teenage psychology--the earnest yet flirtatious and often quixotic nature of the questionably reliable narrator.So--what is the downside?The plot holes really distracted me. Just to capsulize without spoilers, the incompetence of evidence collection is of epic proportions, but too easily explained away. This was highly implausible for a carefully scrutinized international case that made daily headlines.

This seemed more like Harriet the Spy meets the Keystone Kops, but without the intended campiness. And where are the expert analysts of social media?

In this powerful novel, Affinity Konar portrays the terrors of Auschwitz during Nazi Germany, particularly Dr. Josef Mengele’s heinous experiments on twins, and paints a picture of horror and hope with a mysticism I have not seen before in Holocaust fiction. The alternating voices/chapters of twelve-year-old “Mischling” twins Stasha and Pearl have a strength and tenderness that endures beyond the terrors of bodily experiments. “We had no choice but to share our sufferings, and I knew that in this place we’d have to find a way to divide the pain before it began to multiply.”In the opening pages, Stasha describes their birth as a memory. “Pearl was formed and I split from her.” Pearl was the first to be “spat out” by their mother. Left inside for a time before her own birth, Stasha says, “Have you ever had to live with the best part of yourself adrift, stationed at some unknowable distance?” This becomes the ongoing theme of the story, the search for wholeness, whether apart or together. In the camp, they needed to psychically divide for survival. Pearl would be in charge of “the sad, the good, the past.” She was the keeper of time and memory. Stasha was in charge of “the funny, the future, the bad.” While Mengele aimed to trick his subjects into feeling special, they had a way to fight back, to surmount their suffering. Stasha played mind games, flattering him that he controlled her bond with Pearl, that he was undoing the twinhood with his surgical tools. But to herself:“I was now composed of two parts. One part was loss and despair… But my other part? It was wild hope. And no one could extract or cut or drain it from me. No one could burn it from my flesh or puncture it with a needle.”In part two, after the liberation by the Red Army, they sought to reverse their material separation and find each other, apart and lost in the frigid landscape of Russia. This was their pursuit to become whole, to twin again. It didn’t matter whether they were part of the living or part of the dead. Konar, in her transcendent, poetic, and luminous prose, transforms these wounds to reverberate hope and closure, a different ""deathlessness"" than the one Mengele pretended to bestow. There was a time to stop hunting for the Angel of Death and find a peace in the future. Pearl means precious, something esteemed for its prized value. The name Stasha means resurrect, a metaphor that history can take forward. “What work there is, I thought, in being a real person after death!”Affinity Konar’s magic with words is sui generis.

In her latest, COMMONWEALTH, which refers to the Commonwealth of Virginia, defining moments of family history took place there on a sprawling farm estate. It is a multigenerational story that spans over fifty years and decades of secrets, tragedies, and grief. Nevertheless, periods of contentment and moments of redemption also transpire. This year, I see a trend of novels about the province, extent, and gravity of family stories. From such diverse writers as Julian Barnes, Louise Erdrich, and Laura Lippman, among others, literature has shown us that the stories that we own tether us to those we shared them with, bind us to love and anchor us to loss, burden us with guilt or release us from blame. What price loyalty? And what penalty comes with shared history? The tragic story at the center of the narrative is unpacked gradually from the heavy baggage at hand, but the drama is told lightly, for the most part, with a dry and nimble wit that contrasts its weightiness. It begins in the past, in 1960s LA, where police detective Francis “Fix” Keating and his fetching wife, Beverly, are hosting a large and overflowing christening party for their youngest daughter, Franny. An unexpected and uninvited guest, attorney Albert Cousins, shows up to the party with gin and a grin. He has a pregnant wife and three children at home, but that doesn’t prevent him from meeting his future ex-wife, Beverly Keating. And so it goes, with Patchett portraying crucial but comic scenes at the party of covert kissing and tipsy ardor. And the Keatings and Cousins duly merge in a mixed batch--or, is that a mismatch? Consequently, the six combined children spend summers together in Virginia, and create a loyal bond with each other. The four parents take turns mismanaging their children. Proximity/absence is a poignant motif, with equal means to catastrophe. The failures of the parents are surely wrought on the children. Be we are still in the dark.In chapter two, baby Franny is middle-aged, and she is sitting with her elderly father while he undergoes chemotherapy. As they banter together, we are introduced to Patchett’s recurring theme of memories, and the problem with accuracy in recalling traumatic events. As Fix recalls the fateful shooting death of his police partner, he states that his memory was distorted by trauma, and he mixed up the face of the suspect soon after the event: “It was a quirk of the brain…But to this day I’ll tell you: I saw what I saw.” He concluded that, “Half the things in this life I wish I could remember and the other half I wish I could forget.”Family history is fleshed out incrementally and non-linearly, slowly building up suspense, or more like a sense of disquiet that we can’t yet grasp. Despite the tight bond between the children, their interpretations have fundamental flaws, and facts are ambiguous or murky, particularly about one life-altering event that changed everything. That is the mystery at the heart of the novel, which I don’t want to spoil by revealing. Suffice it to say that Patchett circles around the theme of stories with every generation. Although it is an ensemble cast. Franny emerges as a bit closer to the spotlight than the other children. Her love affair with a celebrated writer, Leo Posen, ups the ante. He puts Franny’s fugitive past into a permanent, unchangeable story. As we know from the cover blurb of COMMONWEALTH, her lover makes her family history his newest novel, and makes oral history into printed blockbuster. But how much is fact, and how much is fiction? What pieces might be missing, forgotten, misconstrued, even between the keepers of the story? But, regardless of the facts, this rubric is truer:“Everything that’s happened in our lives up until now, everything we’ve done, it had to happen exactly the way it did so that we could be together…”Don’t look for all the characters to be explicit, defined, or constant. I think that Patchett was telling us that we are as mutable and intangible as our memories, as porous and transformative as our stories.

I don't remember why.""In this lean, sensuous, and meditative novel, Israeli writer A.B. Yehoshua explores themes of identity, exile, and family. Noga, at almost 42, is a harpist with a Dutch orchestra in the Netherlands. She left Israel years ago—“A country that never ceases to be a threat to itself”--when her marriage ended in divorce, because of her refusal to have children, (which is tantamount to figurative treason to a people who lost so many in the Holocaust). She was recently urged back by her brother, Honi, after the death of their father, to stay in her mother’s apartment while Ima is trying a three-month “experiment” at Honi’s insistence, to live near his family at an assistant living facility in Tel Aviv. He hopes that their mother will move there permanently, but Noga has her doubts.A chronic insomniac, Noga often wanders between the different beds in her mother’s apartment during the night. She feels displaced, and passionately misses her musical life in the Netherlands. Here in Jerusalem, memories of her past marriage, her father, her old neighbors, and her childhood, invade her nighttime thoughts and dreams. There are issues she hasn’t resolved with her ex-husband, Uriah, which continue to threaten her peace of mind.Noga seems most comfortable with her solitude, but the neighborhood has gone from secular to Ultra-Orthodox (Hasidic), a close-knit community that doesn't allow TV, are extremely religious, and have many children, often 10 or 11! Noga has to contend with the two kids who have been breaking into Ima’s apartment to watch TV while she is gone every day. Her mother allowed, even encouraged this kind of behavior. Noga’s eventual and inspired solution to stop the willful children is (as is much of the novel), sublimely witty.In the meantime, Honi, a media professional, has gotten Noga work as a film Extra to relieve the boredom. She works as a murdered refugee, the forewoman in a criminal trial, the first sweetheart of a psychiatrist who spent part of his youth in a mental institution, a disabled woman in a wheelchair, and a country girl in a stage production of Carmen, the opera, at the foot of the ancient fortress of Masada. She realizes that being an extra is like being on the periphery of someone else’s life. While in a warehouse that serves as a set, Noga has an inspired thought: “This entire huge and forbidding warehouse—…—is a metaphor for humanity, and we are all extras in its story, not knowing if a credible and satisfying solution awaits us in the end.”Noga, it seems, has lost possession of her own personal plot. Playing other people’s extras has blurred her role as the star of her own living script. She must finally take charge of the spotlight in order to be the lead in her life. As she realizes during a tavern film shoot, ""Can you tell, based on your experience, who here is an extra, who's a customer, and who's an actor?""This quiet, reflective, and often humorous narrative is also poignant and piercing, but never mannered or false. The fluid writing flowed as if it were effortless. There were times it felt dreamlike and ethereal. Yehoshua’s prose is graceful, soothing, and intelligent. No formula, no fireworks, but the climactic tension was pitch-perfect.“Don’t think that everyone else is an extra, without a mind of their own or power of their own. …if you think you’re playing me, you should pick some better notes.”If you prefer a solidly plotted and straightforward novel, this may not be your cuppa. It's largely a theme and character-based book, and leaves some meaning open for interpretation. It worked for me, but I want to give fair warning that it may come across as too cryptic for some palates.Praise to Stuart Schoffman for his eloquent translation from the Hebrew....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"May 27, 2016","May 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25897789-the-extra

If Quentin TaIn Pollock’s last novel, THE DEVIL ALL THE TIME, the writer wove a tale of religious fanatics and serial killers, lowlifes and outliers. If Quentin Tarantino had a baby with Cormac McCarthy, you might have a son that writes like DRP. His narratives are suffused with gunfights, whores, vigilantes, alcoholics, decayed and diseased animals, religious fanatics, deviant sex, psychopaths, and bloodletting crimes. THE HEAVENLY TABLE is a western style pulp fiction, circa 1917, which starts between the border of Alabama and Georgia, but with most of the action occurring in southern Ohio. Pollock parodies dime store westerns by creating the main characters, the Jewett brothers, as fans of one particular tattered copy of The Life and Times of Bloody Bill Bucket, the tale of an ex-Confederate soldier turned bank robber. The brothers dream of “gun flights on scorched desert plains and poontang that tasted like honey.” Cane, the dashing older brother and the only one who can read, hatches a plan. The sharecropping Jewetts have just lost their father, Pearl, and are near-starved with nothing but a sick hog to eat; they work for a cruel and rich landowner, Major Tardweller. In the style of Bloody Bill Bucket, they intend to steal three horses from the Major, rob a bank or three, and ride their way to Canada to start fresh. The middle brother, Cob, is slow-witted but kind-hearted. The youngest, Chimney, is hotheaded, woman-crazy, and impulsive. They are fiercely loyal to one another, however. Before too long, their crime sprees are legendary, with money in their saddlebags and a bounty on their heads. In their wake are carcasses of the unfortunate and depraved. Woven into the major plotline are other characters that alternate in brief chapters. Ellsworth and Eula Fiddler were swindled out of all their money by a conman the year before, and await the return of their prodigal son, Eddie, who may have joined the army and gone overseas. Blackie, a pimp, runs the “Whore Barn.” Then there is Lieutenant Bovard, jilted by his fiancé but now realizing that he was chasing the wrong gender. And there’s Jasper Cone, an outhouse inspector with a “manhood” so large that he can’t have sex, since it would land any woman in the hospital. His sad social life with his one friend consisted of eating and murdering rodents. The various subplots do mostly zigzag their way together, and Pollock’s vivid, warped prose about the most debauched and miscreant characters is well-controlled. In a lesser author, these people would seem like cartoon characters, but there’s just enough empathy and humanity for the reader to actually care about most of them, especially poor, clueless Cob, who only wants to live a good life in order to have a feast at the “Heavenly Table” when he goes to the land of the eternal.Pollack’s Southern Gothic of murder and mayhem in America’s early twentieth century may not be like the one written in our text books--but, scrawled in the imaginary margins of history, of modernization and industrial progress-- is the thick braid of hell and redemption, salvation and savagery, hatred and humanity. “…nothing is certain in this earthly life except the end of it.""...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"May 24, 2016","May 29, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27245902-the-heavenly-table

Maggie and Mark, an educated, financially secure couple, are experiencing bumps in their seven-year marriage since Maggie survived a mugging nine months ago. The trauma caused her to emotionally retreat, and she spent large amounts of time trolling the Internet for disaster/attack stories. Just as she was healing, a woman down the street was attacked in a similar way, but killed, causing Maggie to relive the trauma and once again feel unsafe.As the novel opens, they are embarking on their annual summer road trip from Chicago to Virginia, to Mark’s parents’ farm, heading to a secure place during dangerous weather, with their neurotic dog, Geronimo. (The dog provides some levity, the irony of Maggie, a veterinarian, owning a nervous dog.) The tense, interior atmosphere within the car juxtaposes the unending road and infinite stormy sky, as Maggie and Mark attempt to work out the dark stretches of psychic space between them.During the drive, Maggie and Mark periodically withdraw into themselves, and subsequently the conversations with each other were often small steps toward or away; from formal to informal; blank looks; silences; trepidation. “It was like living with a stranger. Sometimes, just looking at her, it was like he didn’t recognize a single thing about his wife.” “Sometimes, since the mugging, Maggie thought they behaved like a couple who’d lost a child.”They hadn’t always been so watchful with each other. At one time, their moods were natural and easy and they were on the same page. Currently, it was like a series of transactions, these implicit social contracts that drew them together or pulled them apart. “…a slow, sweet back-and-forth of trivial politesse and minor deference….The intimacy would return eventually…But first the quiet back-and-forth.” And, as the weather becomes more severe and they have to negotiate specific options—whether to find a motel or keep driving, or which road or highway to take—these seemingly banal decisions become heightened and momentous.The mounting tension of their physical journey becomes equally chilling with their internal anxiety, and as the story progresses, the reader senses a close, creeping panic. Is it real, or imagined? Are they in danger from what lies outside, or just rattled by the teakettle whistle of the windows or the sonic bursts of thunder? Pittard keeps a steady pace with lean, sinewy prose and plenty of atmospherics. I read this in one lengthy sitting, unable to tear away from the crackling visual images of the weather and the haunting, invisible spaces between words.I wouldn’t exactly call this Hitchcockian, as the blurb adverts, or a mystery, as it is categorized. It’s a niche book examining PTSD and its effect on relationships, as well as the vicissitudes of a marriage in the face of time and circumstance.

One page two of LaRose, an Ojibwe man, Landraux Iron, has accidentally killed his best friend and neighbor’s five-year-old son, Dusty Ravich, while hunting a buck. There is much room for gratuitous scenery-chewing or a maudlin plot of heartache and revenge, but this is a far cry from soap opera, and there isn’t really much of a plot. Rather, it progresses with a thematic pull of ancient traditions, tribal justice, the spirit world of guiding forces, and the healing power of stories, as well as the strength and conflicts of shared grief.Landraux’s wife, Emmaline, is half-sisters with the dead boy’s mother, Nola. They don’t like each other very much, and Nola wants her husband, Peter, to kill Landraux to exact revenge, although she cries this in a storm of grief. In an ancient form of tribal justice, the Irons give their only biological son, LaRose, who is Dusty’s age, to the Ravich’s, to atone for Landraux’s mistake. “Our son will be your son now.”There has been a LaRose in Emmaline and Landraux’s families going back to 100 years, and each LaRose is a spiritual healer, able to wander between the human and animal world, and between the dead and the living. Erdrich goes back in time to the first LaRose, back in the late 1800s, to tell her story, also. The contemporary LaRose is the key to moving on for both families. “LaRose had already changed the story.”As the novel moves alternately from the past to the present, the reader becomes intimately involved and sympathetic to both families. The Irons have also raised Hollis since he was a baby, and Hollis is getting close to graduating from high school now. His biological father, Romeo, is the novel’s clear villain; he shares a past with Landraux that is told in due time. Nola's young daughter, Maggie, becomes burdened with some stealthy role reversal as Nola’s grief becomes agony. And the Iron’s two daughters, Snow and Josette, are on the cusp of womanhood. A white priest, Father Travis, has an intriguing role as a religious leader. We see the flawed man side of him more than the priestly side. There’s also comic relief at the assisted care facility, where the elders spat, talk of legends, and impart their wisdom.Erdrich, who is Ojibwe, has written numerous potent novels about the struggle of Indians in a white man’s world, but always with nuance rather than platitudes.

Although he now has dual citizenship, he becomes inwardly livid when he is mistaken for British. It becomes clear early on that Jeremy struggles with his dual citizenship status, whether here or abroad. On top of this ongoing identity crisis, Jeremy is now receiving packages that confirm digital surveillance of every website or link he visited in the last decade. To make matters worse, he catches frequent glimpses of a man that appears to be following him. From the first chapter onwards, the novel conveys a tense atmosphere of surveillance and paranoia.Jeremy narrates the story from a largely interior perspective, but it is balanced by crisp dialogue and flashes back to the past, both here and abroad, juxtaposed with the present time. Since returning to the states, Jeremy has a comfortable position now at NYU, but suffers from a mild depression and pervasive loneliness; his social life is limited to visits with his grown daughter, Meredith, who lives in Manhattan with her wealthy entrepreneurial husband, Peter. Jeremy’s marriage broke up years ago, but he still feels guilty about leaving for Oxford right after the 9/11 attacks, although it was arranged beforehand, due to his disappointment at not getting tenure at Columbia. Ironically, Doctor O’Keefe’s specialties in political thought and theory included the coerced East German informants for the Stasi after WW II, as well as other forms of surveillance. He has a better understanding of surveillance than the average American, but his disturbance of losing his personal privacy is familiar to the reader. People are now aware of the tactics of the NSA, and the fact that the government (or private agencies) is using this technology to spy on private citizens.Flanery’s assured and mature prose lured me deeper into the world of isolation, paranoia, and fear of surveillance. Much like Gene Hackman in Coppola’s film THE CONVERSATION, which Jeremy teaches in his film class, the protagonist suffers from a growing panic and loss of control. Jeremy fears he may have broken the law unwittingly, to cause this spying, but why would the entity that is spying on him also send him all the information that they have dug up? And who is monitoring his phone, and calling his mother to annihilate Jeremy’s character?The fear and tension was palpable throughout the narration. Jeremy reveals his romantic entanglements in Oxford, particularly one doctoral student that became his lover, who has some murky ties in her family. But, was it her? Her family? A colleague? Everywhere Jeremy turns is like an accusation or invasion. This book is for the keen enthusiast of surveillance topics, and what it means to individuals and societies. It is certainly a theme-related novel more than a character-driven one, as only Jeremy is fully dimensional here. It is written as a journal or diary of Jeremy’s travails and feelings of persecution. The tension is often understated, with only occasional splashes of action. Some of these themes were introduced in Flanery's last novel, FALLEN LAND, but FL also had more fully developed characters. The finale is not wholly unexpected—it is thoughtful rather than urgent or sensational. However, the suspenseful atmospherics and noirish quality kept me engaged and satisfied.“I am not a criminal and still I demand privacy.

Todd Scott has truly captured the wide out far empty of Big Bend and the borderlands of Mexico--the endless sky, the Rio Grande, and mountains “painted purple and charcoal in the background.” The fictional town is Murfee, Texas. His trenchant descriptions are vivid, alive, and gothic, and I understand why comparisons to Cormac McCarty are bandied about. It’s his use of physical landscape to evoke dark, biblical, and pagan imagery. However, Scott is a mainstream, plot-centered storyteller, with a slant toward screenshot characters and moral comeuppance. Although predictable and meandering at times, his debut novel engaged me, kept me turning the pages. Despite formulaic aspects, I saw a spark in Scott and his curiosity about human nature.The book is divided into four sections--Bone, Blood, Ashes, and Ghosts. The omniscient voice is used in the brief, alternating chapters, titled by the various characters in the ensemble cast, with one exception. The sheriff’s son, Caleb, is narrated in the first person, keeping the reader on an intimate level with the story. The Sheriff, “Judge” Ross, is an inscrutable but dark character with a string of dead or departed wives and a chilly, aggressive demeanor. His main deputy and friend for decades, Duane Dupree, is a haunted meth addict losing his soul. There’s Deputy Chris Cherry, a good guy and ex Murfee high school football hero, who blew his knee out and lost the chance for the big leagues, and his girlfriend, Melissa, who feels trapped in these borderlands. Anne, a new teacher in Murfee, has a dark past reaching back to Austin. Caleb loathes his father, has suspicions about the Judge’s kind of law. He has one friend, America, a spunky Mexican-American girl, who worships the stars in the sky.The plot begins briskly, with Cherry finding the skeletal remains of a body in Indian Bluffs, “twenty thousand acres of crooked spine running along the Rio Grande river gorge.” He is determined to investigate until he finds an ID, but local authorities presume that it is a dead Mexican drug runner.

One woman is long deceased, but what she left behind could alter the destiny of the other two. Katya Kendall, a Russian émigré married to a Brit, is trying to save her small, financially troubled publishing house, as well as a static marriage. She’s contacted Ana Harding, a reclusive American translator, living in France (on the border of Switzerland), to translate a century- old Ukrainian diary into English. Ana’s career and personal life have stagnated; this could be an opportunity to engage with something fresh and inspiring. Two women, reaching in the past--to secure a future.In 1888, a 30 year-old Ukrainian doctor, Zinaida Lintvaryova (Zina), blinded by a terminal illness, chronicled her friendship, over the course of two summers, with a young literary artist on the cusp of fame--Anton Pavlovich Chekhov. Moreover, the diary suggests the potential discovery of an unpublished Chekhov novel, (he was known only for short stories and plays). For Ana and Katya, a dead, blind woman could open their eyes to success and redemption. The revelation of an unpublished Chekhov novel would have large-scale significance.When Chekhov was 28, he and his family spent two summers at the Lintvaryova estate in Luka, a lovely, peaceful countryside by the river Pysol. The two cultured families enjoyed each other’s company, with boating, fishing, lively dinners, music, and spirited conversation. Zina, felt renewed. “The voices of the Chekhov brothers as they laugh and prepare their lines for fishing, little suspecting that it is somewhere deep inside me that they cast their lines. They pull me up toward an even brighter light. I can almost see it glinting on the surface.” But it is with writer-doctor Anton that she feels a special, singular bond; their candid exchanges and rich observations are a shared and rare gift. “Never let a moment escape that hasn’t been turned over in your hands, inspected for honesty and fullness and awareness.” Zina’s diary is eloquently written, penetrating and elegiac, turning over the meaning of legacy and memory, taking in the sublime beauty of her surroundings. I was immersed in the delicate shape of her thoughts and her friendship with Anton. His life was just taking off, while hers was winding down. ""I could not see my own horizon. But his was made of words and mine of days.”The chapters alternate between the three women; the friendship between Chekhov and Zina were the most exquisite, but as the story progressed, the spotlight on Ana and Katya pierces both Ana’s loneliness and Katya’s reticence, pulling the reader toward a transcendent denouement, weaving plotlines together like the spun, silken threads of a spider’s web. What Ana and Katya think they seek is less than what they found—“something completely unexpected and equally precious: another way of seeing the world.” It is also about crossing borders with both mind and body.The author, Alison Anderson, is herself a translator--I read and enjoyed her English translation of THE ELEGANCE OF THE HEDGEHOG. She has also translated works by Nobel laureate, J. M. G. Le Clézio. It is no wonder that the subject of THE SUMMER GUEST is translation. This novel, inspired by facts, is also about the power of the imagination, to convey a story not only with objective facts, “but as they had lived it, and above all, felt it.” “It’s why we read. It’s why we need our writers.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Apr 28, 2016","May 02, 2016","May 02, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25843231-the-summer-guest

The oddball crowd of sad sacks in North Bath, New York is back to enterFor fans of Russo’s NOBODY’S FOOL, the long-hoped-for sequel makes its splash. The oddball crowd of sad sacks in North Bath, New York is back to entertain readers. It’s a decade later (mid 1990s) and not a whole lot has changed. A few have died, and the familiar quirky characters that remain are distressed with their foolishness and sense of personal failure. Not to mention, the town is even more economically depressed than before, while their neighboring city, Schuyler Springs, continues to prosper and grow. The new novel is an ensemble cast of well-rounded characters; although Sully plays a sizable part, the leading man, if there is one, is Police Chief and widower Douglas Raymer. Raymer earns a special spotlight in EVERYBODY’S FOOL. He’s tormented with low self-esteem and believes he was a failure as a husband and is a loser as police chief, and the stress of it outs his inner voice, so to speak. Everybody is somebody’s fool in Bath, even the overcrowded dead, who often rise in their coffins from their resting places, and slip-side out of their graves, headed to the interstate and beyond.Besides Sully, Rub Squeers is back, with a few madcap scenes reminiscent of NF, and both are brimming with ill-advised schemes. Ruth, her daughter, Janey, Carl Roebuck, Wirt, and several others flesh out the cast. Roy Purdy, a psychopathic wife abuser and Janey’s ex-husband, is now out of prison, vowing to square the moral debts owed to him.My favorite character of all is panting on the cover--Sully’s dog, Reggie, but he calls him Rub. Rub/ Reggie picked up some genital virus, creating some very bad but hilarious pup habits. He also urinates incessantly—in Sully’s truck, on the seats, on the windshield, and on his friends. Unfortunately, Carl, with his prostate problem, has irregularities, too, with comic results.Two new characters augment the narrative. There’s the bright, young lovely African American cop, Charice, who is hemmed in at the station, on Raymer’s orders, fielding calls. He’s trying to protect her, and tries to suppress his attraction. Her twin brother, Jerome, is a stylish, flashy cop from Schuyler Springs, who functions less in the field and more as a liaison between government offices, “attempting to explain the inexplicable or obfuscate the perfectly clear.”A cobra is loose from the Morrison Arms, a subsidized complex of thugs and delinquents. Mayhem ensues, and Raymer pursues. But something else, besides the cobra, has vamoosed from Bath--the Ultimate Escape Fun Park, “an economic catastrophe that had ushered in a golden age of self-loathing and fiscal pessimism…” And the great “Bath Stench” has surged from noxious leaks in the old Mill and spread through the town, perhaps a metaphor for the ennui of the city’s self-destructive citizens. The characters are accessible—OK, some are larger than life, but the issues they encounter, and the conflicts that beset them, are universal. The whole story takes place over one weekend, with just about everyone pivoting toward transformation, making a choice between moving on, or remaining stagnant. The refrain being, ""I'm so tired of being everybody's fool.""My main complaint was the flow of the narrative. Especially in the first half, Russo writes unwieldy sentences, dense with superfluous clauses and excess adverbs. He draws inferences for the reader and supplies interpretations, doing our job as well as his own. I expected a mature writer to trust that readers grasp implicit cues and subtext. However, the second half was tighter, and provided page-turning suspense. The ending was a bit twee and anticipated, but the immersion in the story was heartwarming and memorable.Thank you to Katie Schoder at Random House for sending me an Advanced Reading Copy!...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Apr 24, 2016","Apr 27, 2016","May 02, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27068575-everybody-s-fool

The raw, tragiI would never have heard of Hungarian writer Magda Szabó if it weren’t for some of my reader friends who suggested this enigmatic book. The raw, tragic beauty of the narrative took me by surprise, and I was captivated from the very first page. Szabó has a vivid, confessional writing style. “I must speak out. I killed Emerence. The fact that I was trying to save her rather than destroy her changes nothing.”Emerence is the district’s street sweeper and Magdushka’s (Magda’s) housekeeper (and just about everyone in the neighborhood’s housekeeper). However, Emerence is the one that decides if she will be hired, that is, if she approves of her employers (Magda and husband)—if they don’t “brawl or get drunk.” Although she is an illiterate atheist, her presence can personify the wrath of God and the Devil himself. She is naturally wise to human foibles, desires, and veneers. “Emerence was the sole inhabitant of her empire-in-one, more absolute than the Pope in Rome.”Like the author, Magda is a writer who was censored during the Stalinist era and is just now able to publish again. She and her husband are well known and prosperous. THE DOOR is about the intense connection and confounding friendship between Magda and Emerence, which also underscores the collateral damage in post-war Hungary. Emerence doesn’t think much of people who eschew manual labor. Of Magdushka’s profession: “In her eyes, any work that didn’t involve bodily strength and use of the hands was loafing, little better than a conjuring trick.” Magdushka eventually falls under Emerence’s spell, so strong was her personality, so fierce were her words, that the writer’s literary life takes a back seat to the concerns of Emerence at the fore of her mind.At the outset, Magdushka is having an ongoing terror dream of standing behind a door in her Budapest home, and the ambulance can’t get in because she is incapacitated. She always wakes up terrified. Emerence, who entertains on her porch, does not allow anybody to go beyond her front door, her “Forbidden City;” the contents of her apartment are unknown to the community. The two doors will gradually come to light as a symbol of their relationship, as well as an allegory for the brutality of Hungary’s past.Szabó’s narrative, filled with measured but fiery, passionate prose and the furious fall-out from Hungary’s past, is gripping and savage. Even the dog, Viola, who is shared between Magda and Emerence, has a nature that will give you the chills. The two women, opposites in almost every sensibility, draw the reader to an unsettling, emotional conclusion.Kudos to the translator, Len Rix, for translating this title for English-speaking readers!...more",Notes are private!,2,17,1,"Apr 22, 2016","Apr 25, 2016","Apr 22, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/497499.The_Door

I wasn’t expecting a sleeper hit, or the literary stunner it turned out to be! Hurley lures the reader into a bleak narrative of torment--a grim, gripping tempest that cut to the bone. The story, gradually paced, fills the reader with a sense of dread as taste, touch, smell, sound, and visions materialize from nature. Smith, the narrator, describes an annual Easter pilgrimage from London to the Loney back in the 70s, a marshy stretch of violent landscape on the Lancashire coastline, a wild and dangerous place. Every year a few people drowned, and “washed up weeks later with green faces and skin like lint.” The gauntlet appears to have dropped from the outset, but we don’t know the backstory or its implications. In 2016, the remains of a baby are found in the Loney, washed up from the tides, which bring police and reporters to investigate. In London, Smith, the narrator, recalls events of 40 years ago, on the last mission to the Loney, and the house they stayed in, the “Moorings.” We know that Smith’s older brother, Hanny, was born mute and delayed, but he is now a pastor and successful religious author and speaker, happy with a wife and children. How, when, and where was he cured, and by what influence or force? Smith was his caretaker when they were children, but what is their relationship now?Dark, conflicting forces are pervasive at the Moorings, the home of a long dead taxidermist and his decomposed trappings spread around like an ominous disease. At night, distant howls are heard and macabre sights are seen. Predators stalk their prey, and nameless horrors go bump in the night. The cauldron is stirred during this pilgrimage, and the effort to cure the narrator’s disabled older brother by prayer and sacrament brings with it menacing terrors.Hurley’s narrative is a nuanced masterpiece of complex characterization that acts on our imagination, planting ideas that are shaped by our own psychological fears. This is one of the most chilling and atmospheric novels I have read since Cormac McCarthy’s dark tales of cruelty and empathy in the rural hinterlands, blending pagan evocations with ancient religious myths and rites. Horror is most effective when it is organic. The tension is pervasive from the opening pages, and Hurley’s talent for conjuring evil is formidable.This is the kind of book that will get richer with repeated readings. The symbolism and the subtleties are legion, and I missed some poignant details the first time around. Religion’s murkiest metaphors emerge, and as fear builds, a release is sought. The poetic writing packs in countless disturbing images that inflame our unease. The Loney feels like a place that time forgot, a circle of Hell with turbulent floods and sinister secrets. Within all this disturbing imagery, a solid story is told of a family and a group of searching parishioners, a priest that seeks to lead his flock to the divine, and a door in the mind that opens to the sinner. No need to embrace religion to savor the story; the story will savor you, anyway.“…there was too much time there…the place was sick with it. Haunted by it. Time didn’t leak away as it should. There was nowhere for it to go…It collected as the black water did on the marshes and remained and stagnated in some way.”Life there was colored a lifeless grey, and death came in with the tides. God was a wrathful moon lording over a watery grave. “The Church of the Sacred Heart was an ancient place—dark and squat and glistening amphibiously in the rain.” Hurley’s prose compels the reader into a black and infinite vortex that doesn’t let go even after the final page is turned.“A sudden mist, a mumble of thunder over the sea, the wind scurrying along the beach with its crop of old bones and litter, was sometimes all it took to make you feel as though something was about to happen.”...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Apr 16, 2016","Apr 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25458371-the-loney

At intI’m not a fan of straight up police procedurals, so I was primed for a missing-person’s case that was also described as a rich character study. At intervals, I was entertained. DS Manon Bradshaw, soon to be 40, is a lonely, slightly desperate (for a relationship) detective, with a few quirks, including falling asleep to the rumblings of a police radio that she smuggled out of the station. She is estranged from her sister and cynical of men, which leaves some room for background and expansion. Although aspects of the novel’s ending didn’t satisfy me, I enjoyed the journey here more than the destination. And there are hints that this could turn into a series.When a high profile PhD student at Cambridge University goes missing, the daughter of a surgeon to the Royal Family, Manon is eager to be on the investigative team that could nail her career. According to the publisher, the story will deliver “two unforgettable women,” Manon and the missing woman, Edith Hind. In my opinion, that’s a tall order that was perhaps a bit overstated, but some of the characters were reasonably satisfying. The climax left me wanting, however.Manon Bradshaw’s single status was relatable, rife with bad Internet dates, but cushioned by a few good friends. She is insecure about her appearance, and often emerges from her flat with a rogue bra strap, a bulging button, or an overlooked smear on her face. Although Bradshaw was engaging, I didn’t find her unforgettable. She has stock traits mixed with individual ones—the kind that equate with a continuing character—flawed but likeable, potential for development, and a personal story with room to grow.Edith Hind is developed through clues, her boyfriend, her parents, and her best friend, Helen. Therefore, she is inscrutable by design. It is clear that she is effortlessly beautiful and whip smart, not exactly memorable, unless her missing status is considered unique. The hand-wringing mother, the pacing father, and the bewildered boyfriend are not that unusual to the genre. And there is a clueless character or two that stretched believability to me. Too, Steiner’s red herrings were occasionally ambivalent, as if the author wasn’t sure how to throw us off the scent while taking us closer to the big reveal. I don’t want to be too specific, because nobody wants spoilers in a detective story!Regarding the denouement, it had last minute and unforeseen character traits that weakened the disclosure. They were impromptu and convenient to the plot rather than organically developed. But getting there was rewarding at times, and I kept turning the pages on my way to the finale. Steiner is often a thoughtful author, and she cares about her main characters. A few subplots added to the mix and changed Manon’s life in curious ways, including a precocious young boy who is affecting and bright, but Steiner is too self-conscious with his twee affectations. The chapters alternate between various characters, although remain in the third person perspective; however, they would have been more distinctive from the first person point of view. This was a fair debut, but in order to make Manon Bradshaw into a series, there needs to be a tighter construction to future plots. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 13, 2016","Apr 15, 2016","Apr 21, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26141649-missing-presumed

Art belongs to all time and no time…Art is the whisper of history, heard above the noise of time.”In this histor“Art belongs to everybody and nobody. Art belongs to all time and no time…Art is the whisper of history, heard above the noise of time.”In this historical fiction, set in the Soviet Union, Julian Barnes explores the meaning and synergy of art and politics during the Stalin era (and beyond). Composer Dmitri Shostakovich, in 1936, is at the epitome of his praise, but his reputation and safety are also on a threatening cusp. His music, which was formerly lauded, is now under scrutiny by the Party, condemned by some as seditious. At the vivid opening of the story, he is waiting by his apartment’s lift, bag packed, paranoid that the Party’s apparatchik are coming to interrogate and possibly kill him, at the very least send him to a work camp in Siberia. What follows is a largely interior story, the action unfolding primarily from Shostakovich’s thoughts and reflections.THE NOISE OF TIME is not a study of music itself, but is rather a peek behind the curtain of a time when one’s art could be one’s undoing. During the Stalinist era, the U.S.S.R was not a place where an artist or composer could exercise free will of expression without consequences. Shostakovich is trying to come to terms with “whom does art belong to?” and how to be true to his art, yet not be shot dead in the process. He is forced to denounce his most influential composer, Stravinsky, and even agree, in public, that his own music is rife with insurrection. Barnes conveys this with a light, absurdist touch at times, canny and uncanny simultaneously.Dmitri reflects on his First Symphony, an open-air concert, which set all the neighborhood dogs barking. The louder the orchestra to compensate, the more the dogs yapped, and the crowd laughed. But now: “History was repeating itself: the first time as farce, the second time as tragedy.” The ers were now saying (fueled and impelled by Stalin) that that his formerly applauded composition, “Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,” was “muddle instead of music.” And, although Shostakovich had never joined the Party, he was coerced to be an appendage to the Power platform. On a technical issue, he was spared from certain torture, but he knew what the future would cost him--his freedom to compose expressionist music. He would have to compose to the masses, or risk accusation of formalism, akin to rebellion, even mutiny.“From now on there would be only two types of composer: those who were alive and frightened; and those who were dead.”Shostakovich’s internal chaos and fear is often transmitted philosophically, most memorably on the question of art’s purpose. At times, I thought the narrative redundant, and the progression of events was occasionally diluted by the baroque events of his love life. However, it was Dmitri’s laconic, aphoristic mind “muddle” that convinced me that Julian Barnes was a first-class writer. I had known he was a prize-winning author, but this was my first entrée (and it won’t be my last). His ability to integrate a tragic story of a thwarted composer with acid levity and droll contradiction persuaded me of the many subtleties of Julian Barnes.“Here the personality submerges itself in the great epoch that surrounds it, and begins to resonate with the epoch.”3.75 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Apr 09, 2016","Apr 10, 2016","Apr 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25912206-the-noise-of-time

The media news about cults and sociopathic behaviors was grimly fascinating to me, even as a young teen. It was a violent contrast to the ""free love"" hippie message of the 60s, a time of ""make love, not war"" and peace sit-ins at universities. What is the psychology and pathology of converts? What kind of middle-class girls proselytize dark, damaged, self-proclaimed demi-gods? Cults spring up and lure in the lonely and disenfranchised. Emma Cline’s novel gives the reader a glimpse at a 60s California ranch where a Manson-like cult was bred, and ultimately boiled over.“I was waiting for something without knowing what. And then it happened.”“Later, I would see this: how impersonal and grasping our love was, pinging around the universe, hoping for a host to give form to our wishes.”Evie Boyd is a lonely, grappling fourteen-year-old daughter of divorced parents, searching for identity, aspiring to be loved. Her dad is busy with a new, young girlfriend; her mother is preoccupied attending to herself. Evie is at the right place, at the right time, for the plucking. She meets an enigmatic young woman, Suzanne. “The girl was a part of a we…People who’d notice her absence and exclaim at her return.” Suzanne symbolized an enigmatic confidence, and Evie wanted to be part of it. So she was introduced to “the ranch,” where there were more girls, and a cult leader, Russell, a wanna-be musician and charismatic leader. There, with these ragged, shoplifting, dumpster-diving individuals, Evie feels noticed.Although the comparisons to the Manson family are vivid, Cline isn’t interested in a remake for shock’s sake. Instead, she examines the adolescent dissonance that many of us can relate to, and how a seemingly ordinary girl can get sucked into the dark enchantments of a mesmerizing sociopath. She observes through the now middle-aged Evie, who reflects back and compares it to contemporary times. Evie is house-sitting for an ex-lover whose immature son comes home with his teenage girlfriend. He degrades her, but the girl keeps tethered to his side.

It is also an exploration of memory, the mineshaft between facts and truth, and the precarious tunnel between parental and self-protection. “The truth is not a finite commodity that can be contained within identifiable borders. The truth is messy, riotous, overrunning everything. You can never know the whole truth of anything. And if you could, you would wish you wouldn’t.”The preplanned, sculpted suburb of Columbia, Maryland, where this story takes place—from the manmade lake to the cookie-cutter villages—is also where the fairytale façade eventually peels away after years of secrets and tweaked retrospection. During its genesis, the prim, trim, identifiable borders of Columbia are a contrast to the untidy truth of the occupants within.Luisa “Lu” Brant, the 45 year-old newly elected County State’s Attorney, is an ambitious and competitive widow of young twins and the daughter of a prior State’s Attorney, Andrew Jackson Brant. After Lu’s husband died, they moved back to Columbia, into her childhood home. She has come full circle, living with her father again, and the community in which she was raised. Her brother, AJ, who is seven years older, has made a name for himself in the green sphere of sustainable living. Lu and AJ have a close, loving bond, no doubt triggered by the death of their mother, Adele, when Lu was only a week old, and AJ seven years older. To make her mother come alive in her mind, she depends on other people's memories, the facts of Adele told to her, instead of remembered.Lippman quickly delves into a grievous incident of the past and keeps us tethered to the darker side of the Brant’s suburban childhood. A young man died while AJ was trying to save a good friend’s life, on the night of his high school graduation. Fortunately, AJ was found to have acted in self-defense, and the family never spoke of it again. “It was common then not to speak of traumatic things, to assume that a firm silence would lead to the fastest healing.”Lu’s first case as State’s Attorney is prosecuting a mentally ill man, accused of killing a woman in her home. Since murder is rare in Columbia, she’s due some recognition if she wins the case. But the investigation reveals some surprises, jogging old memories and finding that they don’t always fit the “facts” as she knows them. Plus, she has a secret life of her own, a clandestine lover who she knew as a child. “Which just proves…how very good she is at compartmentalizing.”Compartmentalizing is a concept familiar to the Brant family. Lu’s knowledge of her mother, for instance, is limited to what her father and AJ have told her, which isn’t much, but arranged lovingly in recitation format. “She was like a character in a fairytale,” her father tells her. And about her grandparents, in heightened tones: “In a twist worthy of a fairytale, they kept their daughter under lock and key in a stone house with turrets, twisting staircases, and stained-glass windows.”There are other references to fairytales, such as a “Cinderella slipper” that Andrew Brant fashioned figuratively from a shoe to win the murder case that made his career. Fairytales are an ironic metaphor that captures the bleaker side of Wilde Lake, the castles of the idyll haunted by shadows and ghosts of the past.In this Pleasantville-esque community, breaches of silence are gradual, and secrets are deftly dismantled over the course of the novel, which is divided into alternate timelines, the past and the present. The author also examines the facts of the past in light of present perceptions and mores, and she comes by it honestly. This is the place where Lippman was raised, too, so the fiction is dusted with actual experience. Lippman’s ingenious construction compelled me; she enlarged the scope of detail and then brought it down to its essential elements by the end of the narrative. She braids timelines gradually, expanding the action to include such a smorgasbord of events that I admit to wondering, halfway in, if Lippman’s themes would crash under its plotlines, which were numerous. A lesser author would have failed to pull it off, but Lippman prepared a feast of a story, down to every succulent bite. I wasn’t thinking of To Kill A Mockingbird, which she purposely used as a framework. Instead, I was installed in the myths of Wilde Lake, and the Brant family's tangled tale of conceits....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Mar 28, 2016","Apr 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26198780-wilde-lake

His hippie-ish rabbi in Hebrew school has tried to turn him on to the kabbalah, but Eli worships his surrogate Uncle Poxl, a flamboyant and charismatic scholar, and a bomber pilot in WW II. During museum, opera, and symphony outings, Poxl taught Eli to appreciate the finer nuances of art; over sundaes at Cabot’s, Eli became the “constant listener” of Poxl’s manuscript pages of his (as yet) unpublished memoir, Skylock, about his time with the British RAF. Uncle Poxl became Eli’s mentor and first demonstrable Jewish hero.However, Poxl’s story as Jewish witness to the War is also a confession of betrayal to the women he loved the most, including his mother, who he left behind in Eastern Europe during the Anschluss. Knowing his mother was sent to a concentration camp “was like imagining every star in the sky blotted out by some small boy with a pin whose touch extinguishes each light.” His bombing missions over Germany, we read, “had wrested fate from the inevitable bearing down of history.” Hence, Poxl’s revenge on the Nazis.Poxl West, aka Leopold Weisberg, is a Czechoslovakian émigré who became a bomber pilot for the British RAF during WW II, leaving more than one lover behind in his wake. Once his memoir was published, he became an overnight literary sensation, but he also cut a dashing Errol Flynn-ish figure as a bomber pilot over Nazi Germany and lover of tragic women. The memoir is included in full, told in alternating sections with Eli’s story. Eli is now an adult, looking back on his adolescent years, and trying to come to terms with his own perceptions of memory, history, and betrayal. Poxl never sent the signed copies of his memoir to Eli as promised, which was just the first in a series of disappointments.Eli’s narration provides an examination of the core of narration itself, and a searching depiction of love, told by way of a story within a story, two narratives in counterpoint to each other, but both accounts yearning to legitimize the transformation of personal odysseys. And how do we reconcile historical fact with personal truth? As Eli recalls, listening to his uncle read the memoir out loud to him, “It was as if he was crafting his great account before my eyes, and I don’t know that I’ve been so close to history since.”I have only a few complaints, which register as minor against the scope of the novel’s merit. The memoir itself, outside of the second narrative, doesn’t strike me as a book that would become an overnight sensation in the 1980s. It may be a moving addition to the many Holocaust memoirs that have preceded it, but it doesn’t exactly break new ground, at least not proportional to its colossal success. Also, Skylock was considered too sexually graphic, which puzzled me. It was actually rather tame for the 1980s. And, Torday gets a little heavy-handed with clichés at times, but it is eclipsed by the bounty of painterly and poetic images.Torday combines the structure of the novel with its theme, which rests on a twist that both undermines and underscores the memoir. As Poxl was recounting of the love of his life, a prostitute and singer of harmonies: “There was something to the act of harmonizing itself that smacked of precision: two voices doing two different things, diverging so they might come together as one, greater than either alone.” And that’s exactly what Torday does with this accomplished novel....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Mar 2016,"Mar 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21853675-the-last-flight-of-poxl-west

We are introduced to quite a few characters early on, in a secret, sequestered art colony on a Turkish island. Even getting there is fraught with secret code, from burning your passport, getting a Mission Impossible-ish direction to the island, and changing your name before you arrive.On the island, we are introduced primarily to a novelist, a playwright, an architect, and a painter, each with their own quirky dispositions. They have been here in Portmantle for ten years, and are awaiting arrival of a new resident, a 17-year-old boy whose presence clearly intrigues and also shakes up the artists’ lassitude. Although this is a story that starts in the 60s London art scene, it soon adopts a timeless quality as we read about the various artists on Portmantle. Subsequently, at least one prominent character began emerging above the others, the narrator, Elspeth Conroy, a Scottish artist in crisis (like the rest of them on that island) with a creative block. The exceptional prose kept me going forward, as I tried to figure out the center of the narrative. If you can just relieve yourself of expectation, and go with the flow, you will find yourself immersed in a unique, haunting, and complex psychological tale that continues to wrap itself around you, all the while keeping you off-balance.“I sort of get trapped in my own head.” All the artists are not unlike what you may have gathered over the years regarding creative types’ hang-ups or neuroses. There’s a certain eccentricity to their natures and also a pitfall of woolgathering for so long that they get buried in inertia. However, this art colony has an eerie quality to it—they seem as trapped on the island just as much as they are locked in their creative standstills. “Something else you will not learn at art school: real inspiration only turns up when your inspiration has expired…There is no finer company than inspiration, but its very goodness will leave you heartsick when it goes. So do not waste time asking it to wipe its feet. Embrace it at the threshold.” There is also the question of trying to reconcile artistic loyalty to the “art” with the financial rewards of recognition and success. Also, what is the ecliptic? Well, as described in the book, it is the plane of the earth’s orbit around the sun. But, from earth’s eyes, we perceive it as the sun moving along this plane instead. Furthermore, this orbit is an imaginary circle, where the sun moves through the constellations along a line, known as the ecliptic. “It’s a total fiction, really—just a construction we came up with to help us get our heads around the complexity of it all.” And how does this relate to the book? Well, I’d tell you, but then I’d have to spoil it. So, read the book, keep spinning in its orbit, stretch your senses to the upper limits of your imagination, and be prepared for an astonishing climax....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Feb 26, 2016","Mar 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24933375-the-ecliptic

What it means, to be human.”If Cronin’s trilogy were merely genre fiction, one could say that these books were“You might ask yourself the same thing. What it means, to be human.”If Cronin’s trilogy were merely genre fiction, one could say that these books were 2000 pages of “good versus evil” or a post-apocalyptic story of survival. And that would be partially correct. But the author, a literary writer from before THE PASSAGE trilogy, probes far beneath the surface of the battle between humans and virals. THE CITY OF MIRRORS is also the exploration of what it means to be human, literally and figuratively, and how our memories shape who we are now. “We are, each of us, a character in our own story; that is how we make sense of our lives.” The final battle will be waged; however, it is not just a battle of virals and humans. It is the war, also, which we wage within ourselves. “Was I the final proof that humanity dwelled in an unwatched cosmos of no purpose, or was I something more?”I can’t imagine reading this book without first reading THE PASSAGE and THE TWELVE. The first two novels create a context and set a stage necessary for readers to comprehend what is at stake and what has happened to humanity since a virus was contracted (animal to human) in Bolivia and brought to North America by a scientist, Jonas Lear. The first infected human, Timothy Fanning, also known as “Zero” in the trilogy, will become known to readers in COM. Lear’s goal in chasing down the virus was to save lives, but the outcome was sheer destruction. Humans that were infected became virals--monstrous creatures who had one purpose, in the words of Zero: “To make the world a wasteland; to bring upon it the mirrored image of my wretched self; to punish…my friend, my enemy, who believed he could save a world that was not savable, that never deserved saving in the first place.”In his third book, the apogee and finale of the towering trilogy, Cronin ushers the reader to the present, eight months after the liberation of the Homeland in Iowa, which was both the geographical place of battle between Amy and the Twelve, and the climax of the second book. The prologue begins with a document of 1003 A.V., at the third Global Conference of the North American Quarantine Period (documents of this period have been braided into the previous two books, also). Thus, we know that there is a future, one century subsequent to the onslaught of the virals. As the narrative progresses, we are given backstories that are new to us, such as the pre-viral (and post-viral) life of Fanning/Zero, which is narrated by Fanning as a drama of love and friendship that dates back to the late 1980s, and takes up about 150 pages. If it seems a digression at first, it is eventually pertinent to the weight of his suffering and his inner conflicts. Fanning’s nihilistic philosophy stems from the tragedies in his family, his lifelong friendship with Jonas Lear, and his star-crossed, decades-long love of a woman. The impact of our past and our relationship with love is a notable feature of Cronin’s themes. “It is possible for the same circumstances that draw two souls together to keep them forever at arm’s length. Herein lies the truth of love, and the essence of all tragedy.”Current events have their roots in the early survivors, several who are known to us now--Amy, Alicia, Peter, Michael, Sara, Greer, Lucius, and others. After establishing the characters that we know, (and a few that we don’t), the novel proceeds forward two decades, which has been a peaceful, viral-free period. Civilization remains primitive, compared to today’s standards, but overall knowledge is advancing, certainly enough for people to enjoy a quality but hard-working life. The Expeditionary Force is dormant, and in Kerrville, Texas, the Republic is growing. However, it isn’t only the Army that is dormant, yet there are only a few people who anticipate fate’s inexorable destiny. As for Amy, she is, as we know, both viral and human, and her narrative is complex; her humanity is what we hope will prevail over darkness and hate. Amy’s powerful status as an original recipient of the virus stirs humans and virals alike, and her voice is powerful and ubiquitous. “The feeling of the hour was the same as Amy’s song: memory and desire, happiness and sorrow, a beginning and an ending joined.”CITY OF MIRRORS is the final act of this dystopian epic, a heart-stopping adventure, with enough action and excitement to keep readers on the edge of their seats, and plenty of emotional and psychological drama to compel us to relate to all characters, whether good, flawed, or evil. The journey will take us to New York City, “City of memories. City of mirrors.” The legacy of this landmark city will be revealed as the drama is heightened. Science, technology, psychology, literature, music, art, philosophy, history and religion are all entwined deftly and poignantly. Cronin’s trilogy is both a brilliant epic of survival and an impassioned study of human legacy.“All stories end when they have returned to their beginnings.”...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Mar 19, 2016","Mar 27, 2016","Mar 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26891429-the-city-of-mirrors

And that won’t be the last of those moments that hit you like a fist. I’ve never read Swift before, but his acute word choices, lean prose, subversive undertones, recursive prose, and refined layering mark him as a mature word master and subtle storyteller. This tale centers on the life of Jane, a maid to an upper-class family, set in Berkshire, England, 1924, on Mothering Sunday, when the servants and staff are free to spend the day off to visit their parents. It is almost a tragic echo, this ritual of Mothering Sunday, considering how many young men were killed in World War I, and left their parents without sons. It reminds us that the lightness of the fairytale is offset by serious tragedies.Jane is an orphan in her early twenties in 1924. Her story alternates between then and the present, now a woman in her nineties and a celebrated writer at the close of the twentieth century, looking back at the events that marked a turning point in her life. She had been having a seven-year affair with wealthy neighbor Paul Sheringham, whose brothers died in WW I, and who is to be married in two weeks time to the affluent Emma Hobday. As we open the story, Jane has spent part of Mothering Sunday having a tryst with Paul in his bedroom at the mansion, her only time meeting him there, rather than their usual more sordid locations. It’s like being Cinderella for the first time, without the virginity.“There never was a day like this, nor ever would or could be again.” Jane intuits that, with Paul’s upcoming nuptials, that this will be their last time together. Everything is slow and languid for them—the sex, the post-coital smoking in bed--even his eventual departure is unhurried. After he leaves, Jane explores the entire house, naked, lazily, with fascinated interest, which opens up more fairytale allusion. “Can you look into a mirror and see someone else? Can you step through a mirror and be someone else?”Through Jane’s eyes, the author embraces the power of storytelling—the stories we tell, the stories we own, and those that are passed on through legacy. As she nakedly, leisurely explores the Sheringham’s library, the reader gets glimpses of Jane’s first love of the narrative. She may only have a rudimentary education at this point, but her mind is already reaching far into fantasy, fable, and adventure, into the mind of a reader and writer. Jane is a discreet woman, who matured at silences during her affair with Paul. Now, as a modern writer, she masters the art of holding back when interviewed, understanding that the absence of words can be as powerful as the telling of them. ""But she would never disclose that when she really became a writer, or had the seed of it truly planted in her...was one very warm day in March, when she was twenty-two and she had wandered round a house without a shred on--naked, you might say, as on the day she was born--and had felt both more herself, more Jane Fairchild, than she'd ever felt before...""Jane breathes in the life she was given, but writes in the lives she dreams. Some would be penned, others would be prospects, and the rest she may never know. “All the scenes.

At times, it may even seem esoteric, because beyond embracing the love of cinema and filmmaking, it goes deeper, into the technical manipulation of film to convey a narrative message--or, even the veto of a message, or the search for non-bias. It also moved me as a study of observer and subject effect on phenomenon, whether it is film, phone, feminism, friendship, or social responsibility. Spiotta explores the complexity of narratives within the lens of a long-term friendship between two different women and their separate careers in film.But let me go one further. It is also about the reckoning of the self, how maturity can help someone see the flaws of their ambitions, and how a passionate, dogged, relentless single goal can also be your own undoing. And whether this awareness of the self can lead to redemption.It starts in 1980s Los Angeles, where Meadow Mori, a trust fund teen, meets Carrie Wexler, the daughter of a single mother, at an arty high school. They are both cineastes, and spend their formative teen years in each other’s company watching and analyzing an eclectic multitude of films. Their friendship extends to adulthood, where they both end up with distinguished careers, but on divergent ends of the cinema spectrum. Meadow is a purist who follows the path of edgy documentary films, and Carrie makes feminist mainstream comedies. Meadow’s chosen artistic medium isn’t always sufficient to braid her art and her perception together: “…no camera or lens she had ever used was very good at capturing the simultaneous long and short view. Nothing like her eyes.” But she keeps at it, and pushes that envelope further, but the audience she intended to reach may have unanticipated responses. Meadow gets down to the bone, but is that what people want to really see? Or do people want more of a projection of their fantasies? The subtext of this book is like a fractured romance—the first line is “This is a love story” and then turns to a playfully rendered affair between high school senior Meadow and an unnamed man who may be Orson Welles. It later turns to a woman named Jelly, who has captured the hearts of Hollywood heavies by cold-calling and seducing them, only to vanish rather than meet these men face to face. In later years, she becomes a documentary project of Carrie’s, with unintended consequences. Meadow is the brilliant progressive that channels her ideas to achieve her goals, but results don’t always satisfy. Carrie has a tamer view in cinematic art, and is just as preoccupied with finding harmony in her personal life as in her life as an artist. Both receive a measure of fame and a measure of emptiness.The book goes back and forth in time, and slowly reveals more of the minds of Meadow and Carrie, as well as the effect on the subjects that participate in Meadow’s films. The construction is superb, with the story interspersed by transcripts of interviews, the mechanics of filmmaking, essays, and the study of film theories. At intervals, the book is as disjointed as raw footage, before the edit. Our lives aren’t the fluid, seamless narratives that we may fantasize about in our slanted retrospection. We all splice and dice our memories to validate the idea of our personal narratives, and the author parallels that process in the architecture of this novel and the making of films. As we evolve, so do our narratives, as reliable or unreliable as the limits of our memories and imaginations.“…I have some ideas. A directive, of sorts. I will work and I will work.

Where did this come from, and why does it matter? It starts with Waldemar “Waldy” Tolliver, and the opening of this novel will likely go down as one of the greatest first lines of fiction:“This morning, at 08:47 EST, I woke up to find myself excused from time.” Well, whose curiosity wouldn’t be piqued? Its message is lean and straightforward, yet enigmatic. But, lest you think that this novel is lean and straightforward, think again! This is a fat, juicy, bulky, baggy, brainy, epic, and ginormous book, with Big Ideas and a sprawling cast. The narrative is approached as a letter to a Mrs. Havens, the object of Waldy’s affections, and spans about 500 semi-dense pages and three generations. We are taken on a journey from Moravia, to Vienna, to NYC. Ottokar Toula, Waldy’s Czech great-grandfather, had alighted upon a theory of time, or a Time Accident, which he was about to prove to the world in 1903, when he was run over by a Daimler. He left a cryptic and seemingly nonsensical note of sorts, which Ottokar’s two sons try to decode. They become part of the fin de siècle Vienna when they move there to attend university and try to solve their father’s theory. Kaspar eventually seeks love and family matters, while Waldemar (Waldy’s great uncle) becomes more obsessive about the Lost Time Accidents.What follows is a metaphysical romance, as well as a romance of metaphysics, reminding me sometimes of the mandala symbolism in GRAVITY’S RAINBOW, the obsessive traits of scholars in THE DOUBTER’S ALMANAC, the nature of time in Iain Pears’ ARCADIA, and the influence of Kabbalah and the Tarot on the unconscious mind. While reading, I felt the resonance of the “totality of being” and the abyss of complete nothingness, as well as the temporal relationships of Time and of the perception of time. As well as C*F*P*--Chance, Fate, and Providence.Through all of Wray’s high-minded science and philosophy, he doesn’t forget the reader, and occasionally, the lowbrow humor. There’s Waldy’s father, Orson Tolliver, a celebrity writer of science fiction porn, with titles like “Salivation is Yours.” And, in ways that parallel STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND, Orson’s inflammatory notoriety as a “Prime Mover” in the “Church of Synchronology”—obviously a sardonic riff on the Church of Scientology. And, at the center of it is Waldy, an offbeat and oddball romantic who kept me fastened to the humanity of this story. We care, immediately, urgently, and continuously, about Waldy’s fate. His search for the Truth of Time is yet mirrored in the time of truth. And his adoration of Mrs. Havens is both his torch and his Sword of Damocles.Wray bestows a very human look at our universal concerns of love, legacy, guilt, fear, identity, and morality. Not to mention a very serious, poignant, and tragic circumstance of evil experimentation by Waldy’s ancestor, who brutally tested his theories of the Lost Time Accidents on the Jews in death camps during WW II. I’m Jewish, and grew up haunted by the Holocaust, but this harrowing aspect of the novel would horrify anyone reading this book.And then there is Waldy’s strained relationship with both parents, and his inscrutable, eccentric aunts who live in a virtual flea market of an apartment in Spanish Harlem. That’s the place where he is now, unable to get back in Time.If sometimes the ambitious narrative seems out of control, it isn’t. The author has a design to all of it. I never got weary, until near the end, when I really, really, wanted a resolve, to reward my implacable loyalty to the bending, circular, spherical text. I needed an “orbituary!” (I even allowed for poetic license when the author casually mentions a head shop in the Ringstrasse. Heady shops, certainly, but no bongs for sale in the Ring!) I admit to a certain slight droop in my bearing at the finish line, which may have been inevitable, but felt a slight bit derivative or too facile. But, it may be that I wanted what those three generations of Toulas wanted. And what was that?“…the notion that chronology is an illusion, if not a deliberate lie; that the steady, one-way current we seem to be suspended in is actually a jumble of spherical “chronocosms” that can be moved through in any direction, if some great force manages to knock one’s consciousness out of its preconditioned circuit—had grown progressively more elaborate, attaching itself to random scraps of knowledge in the course of its creator’s wandering, like a peach pit rolled across a dirty floor.”Wray’s imagery soars on every page, with fresh feeling, “and the bubbling molasses of his prose,” so much so that I wanted to underline about 900 passages. I enjoyed the journey more than the destination, perhaps. So, if the finale didn’t exactly beat me to it-- well, as Chance, Fate, and Providence would have it, Time is on my side....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 12, 2016","Feb 20, 2016","Feb 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25666067-the-lost-time-accidents

He bonds with him like no other creature or person up to this time. “I find it hard to picture a time when we were simultaneously alive, yet separate. Now you are like a bonus limb. Now you are my third leg, an unlimping leg, and I am the eye you lost.”This elegiac story is a journey between man and dog, and how Ray and One-Eye form an inseparable bond. Ray steadily talks, reads, and shares secrets with One-Eye, easing the grim exile of his life. His somber heart unburdens, and the haunting shadow of his father is lightened bit by mournful bit.“Sometimes I see the sadness in you, the same sadness that’s in me. It’s in the way you sigh and stare and hang your head. It’s in the way you never wholly let your guard down and take the world I’ve given you for granted. My sadness isn’t a way I feel but a thing trapped inside the walls of my flesh, like a smog….It rolls the world in soot. It saps the power from my limbs and presses my back into a stoop.”I was reminded of Cormac McCarthy at times, by the unrelenting melancholy tone; the vivid description of a rejected dog; the outcast of misfits; exiled souls that never knew peace, engulfed in the filth of fugitive waste, in the violence behind walls of silence. In this largely contemplative book, with sparse action, a sea of meaning exists....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,"Feb 06, 2016","Feb 10, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25009382-spill-simmer-falter-wither

Important to her is the precision of a word, whEster Nillson, a 31 year-old essayist and poet, is an academic and published writer of esoteric works. Important to her is the precision of a word, which makes me think of Flaubert’s “let mot juste.” Also integral to her perception of the world is that subjective experience should also be objective (and vice-versa)—i.e. that emotions should not get in the way of defining the truth of an experience. “She worked steadily at decoding the nature of the world and of human beings.”Ester believes, for example, that one should never resort to fooling oneself when it comes to love/relationships, that it’s possible to see the naked truth of what is happening in objective, logical terms. Despite the approach of emotional pain, it is imperative to refrain from self-deception. But what happens when she’s under her own microscope, and tries to shape disregard into reason--when she falls for a man and forfeits logic for love? Ester is invited to give a lecture on video and social artist Hugo Rask, a charismatic and self-contained man who welcomes public acclaim but is averse to intimate ties. Her affinity to Rask blooms even before she meets him, while writing her lecture.""From feeling respect on Sunday she progressed to reverence on Tuesday and by about Thursday she felt an insistent yearning, which on Friday turned into a deep sense of lack.” She discovered that “…a person could miss someone she had never met, except in her imagination.”When she meets Hugo, Ester is immediately infatuated and fantasizes a future with him, although they forge nothing but a casual friendship, and later a casual affair. But the more she spins herself around the hub of Hugo, the more he becomes detached and impenetrable. Ester’s letdown is conspicuous to anyone who has suffered from being the one who cares more--the vulnerability of being exposed, the self-deception of life together, and the invention that you don’t care when you’re pushed away. Ester convinces herself that he’s flawed and unworthy. And when he later reels her in after he’s tossed her aside, she is hooked once again. Sound familiar? Ester adapts her logic into new syllogisms to fit the object of her desire. She doesn’t realize she has negated her own philosophy. Her “girl chorus” of friends are handing her blunt but sound advice, which she cherry-picks to feel better about her fate. Her dry analysis turns to paralysis and the reader sees her myopia. I felt the shame that Ester is trying to deny, as she sinks into the role of scorned woman. Against all reason, she avers to herself that logic is working in her favor, and attempts to fit a circle into a square. “The dreadful gulf between thought and words, will and expression, reality and unreality, and the things that flourish in that gulf, are what this story is about.” With a dark wit and sly audacity, Lena Andersson’s lean, precise prose and lucid narrative propels us along. She nailed the lawless convictions conceived in the crook of desperate devotion. In other words, love is blind and words can fail in the flux of fugitive emotions. In the pursuit of love, do we surrender our principles? This is a tale about willful disregard and skillful self-regard. A labor of love.

Gentrification is not yet on the horizon. New York City, with its dirty streets, glitzy lights, buzzing art scene, porn shops, and high crime, held purpose and promise to the young and imaginative. It was gritty, grand and glamorous, a city of big hair and even bigger dreams.Three lives are inextricably linked by art and passion. Raul Engales, an up and coming talented painter, has escaped the Dirty War in Argentina, but not without the guilt of leaving his sister behind. James Bennett, a socially inept and brilliant art critic, derives his talent from a condition of synesthesia, where people radiate colors, and words have scents and tastes, “where an image was manufactured into a bodily sensation, where applesauce tasted like sadness and winter was the color blue….” Lucy is a young and free-spirited woman from the toneless suburbs of Ketchum, Idaho, lured to New York by a stranded postcard, and who becomes Raul’s muse and lover.There’s no question that the characters here are exquisitely, extravagantly defined; they pop out of the pages like a David Hockney painting. They swirl around each other in drafty hovels, sparkling galleries, and in the streets and stairwells that smelled of urine, paint, and cigarettes. Moreover, New York is a character in itself. Lucy, Raul, and James emerge as the primary protagonists, although I felt that was done by attrition; some of the secondary (and, in some cases, more interesting) characters faded over time.My biggest complaint was that the breezy prose was often too fluttery for the gravitas of the story. I think it was meant to underscore depth by contrast, but it zipped in several directions and often meandered and tread the same porous ground of artist torment and creativity. The themes of loss and exile were poignant, but it lacked strong narrative scaffolding. A chunk of the ending implied action outside the purview of the reader, which was a big turn-off.

Baron von Weinbrenner is a wealthy German Jewish industrialist, yacht racer, and thoroughbred horse trainer married to an Irish Protestant who collects Catholic medieval art. Their daughter, Karin, born on the Isle of Wight, is a German with a British passport.Buck Lange, the baron’s captain and trusted friend, was himself born on the high seas, but registered as a German citizen. Like the baron, he was married to an Irish woman. Their son, Billy, although born in the same seaside cottage as Karin (but a year or so later), also was registered as German with a British passport. There is a brutal irony to the countries that the characters are identified with, and consider home, as this has consequences, as much of the action takes place during the Nazi rise to power.Billy and Karin grew up in their parallel lives, sometimes together, sometimes separated by tragic or mundane circumstances. The Langes eventually move to the baron’s estate in Frankfurt, between world wars, where the baron and Buck raise thoroughbred horses for racing. Karin had a standard elite boarding school education. Billy attended local schools; Karin was a bit of a wild child, Billy more reserved. They both loved horses and the forests of Germany. Their affectionate bond was palpable to the reader, and their love for each other grows from sibling-like to romantic.As children, Karin introduced Billy to the novels of Karl May and his Winnetou tales, stories of the high planes of western Texas and New Mexico, known as “El Llano Estacado.” They both dreamed of the boundless place of big skies and wide-open spaces, unlike the narrowness of German woodlands and the burden of all that history. It was their dream of escape to a new land with the pioneering spirit and vast, spacious expanse. At least, that’s how they imagined it in their dreams.I’ve read numerous novels that take place during world wars, so what makes this one stand out? In hindsight, we know that Hitler embodied the very nature of evil, but during his ambitious climb to power, there were many Germans that did not understand his insidious ambitions, or what was emerging from his power. However, there’s a scene in the early 1930s, where Karin is confronted with the Führer’s rabid anti-Semitism, (when he was still a largely unknown candidate), a turning point that is both nuanced and profound. Moreover, this brings us back to the perception of home and the familiar safety of it, and the resistance to leave even in the face of terror.Behrens is a master storyteller. The prose is lean, understated, but the architecture of the novel is key to the pathos. He goes back in forth in time, generally between Karin and Billy’s Edwardian childhood, and then to 1938. Most of the story is narrated by Billy, who tells us from page one that it is Karin's story. ""Her story is not mine, but sometimes her story feels like the armature my life has wound itself around."" He uses documents, letters, poetry, and narrative to advance the plot, but it took me a while to truly understand how his construction evolved into a sublime denouement that encompasses his themes. It isn’t the ending I saw coming, and yet it was inevitable.

Well, thiYou know those books that make you want to call in sick, or safely freeze-frame the kids, tune out the rest of the world and order take-out? Well, this is one of them. It starts with a disaster that sucks you right in from the first chapter, and compels you inside a serious riptide of a story.A plane crash into the Atlantic: disaster. Afterwards we witness a truly astonishing rescue across the depthless ocean. This altruistic feat of human courage in the face of despair is so gripping and well-drawn that it felt plausible. No cliché, no absurd heroics, and no trivialities. I was there, after the crash, in the ocean, swimming strong against the odds. I don’t think I’ve ever read such a credible, impossible rescue.Subsequently, we ache at the depths of survivor guilt and grief. But, media coverage proceeds from sympathetic to implications of sinister conspiracy. And, the adult survivor descends from hero to heavy. Is this a cautionary tale or a sobering look at the human condition?Man against nature, man against man, the social and class inequities of our time, and the colossal forces of media are acutely developed and expressed here, but without platitudes or authorial cynicism. Scott Burroughs, one of two survivors, is a middle-aged recovering alcoholic and failed artist, on the crest of a second chance toward success. His paintings, like the story, demonstrate “a haunting specter of mass death that comes from the volume and character of images” (images, in the narrative, are illuminated by Hawley’s superb writing). Scott is no stranger to loss. The other survivor is a four-year-old boy, JJ, his age a symbol of incorruptibility.The story’s structure is brilliant; I was right there in every probing moment, couldn’t turn the pages fast enough. And when the vigorous plot paused for character-driven reflection, I did, too. The nonlinear chapters go back and forth in time, and alternate between the various people who were on the private chartered plane.There are two wealthy couples, the husbands titans of media; the two young children of one couple; the pilot and co-pilot; a flight attendant; one security detail; and Scott, the artist. The reader is immersed inside their heads and their hearts, all in due time. We learn the details of their histories and plans for the future, as well as their distinct psyches. If this were a one-dimensional thriller, we’d only be concerned with how the plane crashed, as that is the million-dollar question at the heart of the plot. But, the complexity of the story opens up the theater to those that survive, and the media storm of benevolence and scorn that surrounds the event. And, what of the private crimes and misdemeanors of the individuals on the plane and off?The narrative kept me in thrilling suspense throughout the story, the tension coiled and taut until the last few pages. The outcome mattered because the characters were authentic, and the details of all the components of the story were nuanced and compelling. The most poignant humanity is conveyed between a little boy and a middle-aged man, but even the most odious of the characters were resonant and wrought with consideration.What does it mean to be a hero, and how is it filtered through mass media? Who is the fraught man inside of the epithet? How is he welcomed and resented in equal measure. How is he celebrated, and then indicted? The author holds it up to the spotlight, and renders moving and disturbing answers. Hold a hero as a sacred cow, and then eat him for dinner.“He’s a fraud, I’m saying. A nobody. Muscling his way into the spotlight, playing the humble knight, when the actual heroes, the great men, are dead at the bottom of the deep blue bullshit.”BEFORE THE FALL (and during, and after) is an ingenious blend of plot, pace, character, and construction, stirred with captivating prose. Noah Hawley's a beast!And “the idea that the object itself (canvas, wood, and oil) is not the point, and that instead some intangible experience created from suggestion, from the intersection of material, colors, and content has been created.”...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jan 24, 2016","Jan 28, 2016","Jan 24, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26245850-before-the-fall

And who among hetero women haven't (at least once) desired a Darcy to have and behold, till death to us part? Sittenfeld doesn’t need to keep the story alive, as the coupledom of Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy is iconic, and the story has been kept aflame through the centuries by new and old readers alike, as well as countless movies, literary allusions, and the love struck and lovelorn. I wasn’t disappointed in Sittenfeld’s updated version. Of course it’s derivative, by definition. And we know how it ends, mostly. But, the author does shake it up by changing the locus of some secondary characters, expanding them in some cases, and adding some current and topical issues of the millennium.Austen’s seemingly simple novel, as many have learned, was fathoms deeper than the surface appeared. She employed—perhaps, initiated--game theory in her narrative. There was a mathematical precision in her storytelling, even a musical composition to it. So, she set up the pace and strategy for Sittenfeld. But, to take on such a classic story is both brave and brazen. If I wanted to read the story again, I’d go back to Austen. However, Sittenfeld’s wry, lean prose and thoroughly entertaining characters, as well as some surprising content created some suspense. Moreover, I had to admit to a few doubts, in the heat of the moment, about the outcomes of key inevitabilities--the sign of a writer who paces her story well, even if her version is aimed for the masses.In the new version, essential structure and characterization is true to the original, with some contours here and there. Technology is in everyone’s hands, except for Luddites Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. Mr. Bennet, like in the original, is irresponsible with money, and his social climbing wife has some unpleasant prejudices and a shopping addiction. Money is running out. All the daughters are single (and older than in the original, but likely parallel to the times), and Jane and Liz live in New York. The main action takes place in Cincinnati, where the parents live in a deteriorating grand Tudor with Mary, Lydia, and Kitty.The title comes from a TV show called Eligible, which is purposely, mockingly like The Bachelor. Chris Bingley, a Harvard educated ER doctor recently landed in Cincinnati, was on the show two years ago; his dreadful but beautiful sister, Caroline, talked him into it. However, he didn’t find a wife, and is still eligible. But, Liz and Jane think his stint was degrading to women. His best friend, the flinty Fitzwillian Darcy, is a neurosurgeon that went along with Bingley to Cincinnati for a job at a major hospital. Kitty and Lydia are CrossFit fanatics, Mary is a perpetual student of online courses, Jane is a yoga instructor, and Liz a magazine journalist and careerist. Liz’s love life is fairly pathetic.This is an addictive read. And don’t let the almost-500 pages deter you. The chapters are especially brief—sometimes a few paragraphs or pages; there’s lots of white space. The prose is lean, the narrative is plot-based, the pace is nimble, and the dialogue wry and cheeky. It’s a witty, unabashed beach read. If there was a hint of a pc platform, she did it with panache and style. I had a lot of fun, turned the pages eagerly, and finished in two days.

The IRA bombing/assassinatioI would describe this novel less an historical novel than it is a novel with an historical event that took place in 1984. The IRA bombing/assassination attempt of Margaret Thatcher was planted two weeks in advance, at the Hotel Grand in Brighton, the place where the Iron Lady planned to deliver her keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference. In all other respects, the novel was a study of fictional characters of the author’s imagination. Waiting for the bomb to go off adds foreshadowing, plot progression, and tension toward the end game, and it does it effectively, if not at full tilt. However, while we know that Thatcher and her husband survived the bomb, what we don’t know is which of Lee’s fabricated cast—primarily, the hospitality crew at the hotel--outlived the Provo’s violence against Thatcher and her staff. But, as that happens at the climax, we are more concerned with the main characters’ imminent choices and concerns of everyday life.The title is used as an extended metaphor throughout the novel, but more specifically it refers to Moose, the mid-forties deputy hotel manager and his lost opportunity as a professional diver in his youth. His ex-wife describes her life to him as him as being “married to a man who preferred to make a living out of falling into water. A man who was content to fall and fall.” Now, he’s out of shape, long divorced, and largely raising their now eighteen-year-old daughter, Freya, by himself, while the reader observes his repeating plunges. He hopes that, by hosting Thatcher successfully (his talent and ambition is what lured her to choose the Grand), he will be in line as the next General Manager. Intelligent, compassionate Freya, who isn’t exactly disaffected, (but plays the part well superficially), has just finished her A-levels and has disappointed her father by announcing she doesn’t want to go to college. She is working the desk at the resort, trying to figure out what comes next in her life. There are other, secondary characters, as well as a vicious cat, that Lee vividly depicts. Finally, there’s Dan, who we meet in the prologue, a sad, single, but acutely skilled explosives expert in Belfast, working for the Provos, and living with his mentally fragile mother. Getting inside his head was no mean feat; he is as humanized as the “innocents” that surround him, and his cunning superior, Dawson McCartland. The author sets aside boilerplate moral judgment in favor of depth of character. I couldn’t help but empathize with Dan’s losses, as well as all the missteps, defeats, failures, tepid triumphs, and small victories of everyone in this poignant story. Even Dan’s mother, who could easily have been one-dimensional and pathetic, surprised me with her backbone during a drowning moment.This is not a swift read, nor does it read like a thriller. The story moves along statically at times, as Lee submerges us in his literary embellishments. On a lesser author, I would have complained. But Lee has such vigor and fierceness, and such precision with his metaphors and aphorisms, that these ornamentations didn’t gild the lily; rather, they more often nourished it. But if you like your prose lean, then this could be a problem for you. Lee uses satire at intervals, but never to undermine the moving and emotional core of the characters and story. Thematically, I see the pride before the fall--some falls deep or too late, some lighter and with a more hopeful recovery. The author is wise and sharp, observant and wholly sympathetic. Here’s a passage that sticks with me""“I am interested in fictions of all sorts…Novels. Poems. Stories…I’ve never found much that’s fruitful in straight-faced facts. Can’t make myself believe in them. Second-hand is what they are, they lack the raw stuff of absurdity…as if life isn’t funny, or all-funny as if life isn’t serious. You can only get at the world if you do both.”And that’s what this novel does. It gets at both, and leaves you somewhere in mid-air of that high dive. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 18, 2016","Jan 22, 2016","Jan 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25739173-high-dive

Delvin Walker, the main protagonist, suffered for the crime of having dark skin. He was born in the Red Row (black--we'd call it the projects now) district of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1913, to a scrappy and fiery mother, whose crime he was also paying for. Charlie Smith’s novel is more of a portrait of a time, and of a people that Delvin symbolized, castigated for breathing the same air as white people.The author’s unsentimental, frank narrative portrays the black man’s burden, yes, how inhumanity is the accepted “etiquette” of the era, but also how humanity is found in some of the most unlikely places. Moreover, the author made the story specific to Delvin, the most evolved character in the story, a boy who grew to be a man, even though he was treated, by society, like an animal. It is by turns tragic, confounding, tender, rough, sharp, tangy, mournful, and uplifting. Hope, in Ginny Gall, can also be a suburb of Hell.This wasn’t just about social injustice, though. Delvin, (like other black people of the time), carved out a niche for himself, or tried to. His first benefactor, Mr. Oliver, was the well-off mortician/undertaker for the black side of town. Delvin was taken under his wing after a long stint at an orphanage. He learned the business, became part of a lively family, and also experienced life with the dead. The avuncular Oliver encouraged Delvin’s self-education, and they both enjoyed reading Shakespeare and other classics together. Delvin fell in love with the written word, and aspired to be a writer.Throughout his life, Delvin found himself having to run; some ghost or shadow of one was always chasing him (and there’s an albino named Ghost, which was symbolic). Jumping on trains was a bit of an art, but it was also the only means of transportation for many of his peers. During his travels, Delvin finds first love, odd friendships, and a lot to write about. He hooks up with a learned man with a museum on wheels—essentially, a library of the black experience, and photographs of inspired or expired individuals that the “professor” felt should be learned about and remembered.My biggest complaint—and I love a certain amount of wordiness at times—is the sheer verbosity of every scene, all the details that make up a setting. You know how certain movies provide a work of art in every frame? It works for a movie, because it presents a visual tableau for the eyes. However, in a novel, it can get bogged down; Smith never failed to enumerate every detail—whether it was every smell that was elicited, every article surrounding the setting, or the minutia of every nook and cranny. The pacing was sluggish, plodding on and absorbed by the physical features. I admit to getting weary at times, wanting to move on. This book would make a fantastic movie, as everything is laid out to see. But, in a novel, I’d like to do a little of the fill-in for myself.At other times, the author’s narrative would just break my heart. “…he carried with him for days the recall of a faint sadness…He returned to study and wonder about it, the singular occasion of reprimand and the sorrow it uncovered and the moment of silence it revealed and how this silence or space with nothing in it seemed so important.”“The world was receding from him, leaving a space that nothing had quite filled in.

In the hands of veteran author Chris Cleave, this context became new again--familiar in its general backdrop, but absorbing in the story. The book was very much about universal characters that fought their own struggles, but you feel them individually. People are flawed by nature, but, as they do the best they can do during wartime (there’s no manual for how to behave when your bosom city is being bombed and your life is no longer taken for granted), the fall-out is not just in the air raids, but also between civilians.As a preamble to the novel itself, Cleave writes a forward about his maternal grandfather, a Captain of the Royal Artillery, who inspired the story he was going to write, but he ended up with the story he was destined to write. It is about civilians and officers, friends and soldiers, family and enemies, and the heights that war makes us fall from, and forgiveness, which is sometimes a struggle, also. Death and destruction weigh in, and how love, like an errant wanderer, sometimes alights from the wreckage, but is often lost and directionless.Mary North is barely nineteen, and born into a wealthy and prestigious family. She’s a beautiful and progressive non-conformist who abides by her own values, something not done in her kind of family and in this kind of time. She signs up on the first day war is announced, hoping to be something glamorous such as a spy. When she is assigned to a local schoolhouse to teach children, she becomes especially fond of a ten-year-old black American child named Zachary, whose father is in the minstrel shows. When Zachary, like all other children, is sent to the countryside, Mary is left without the job she grew to love. Mary presses Tom Shaw, an administrator of the school district, and eventually some of the outcasts come trailing back for her to teach. At this time, it was safe. Most people, including Mary, believed that war would stay on foreign soil, and that London would remain pristine. She regularly writes to Zachary, who pretends to be tougher than he is, but is honest with Mary. She works on bringing him back to London, as he is bullied in his new place for being a Negro. In meantime, she and Tom engage in a romantic relationship.Hilda is Mary’s best friend, as tough as nails and a free spirit, too, but she has a weakness for men in uniform. She suffers a bit for being the inferior beauty to Mary. Tom’s best friend, Alistair, affluent and educated, surprised Tom by joining up for the war after being plagued by the infernal tragedies of soldiers. He was a man of aesthetic tastes, who did secret work for the government, restoring and hiding priceless art from the Nazis. His surprising decision leaves Tom filled with doubt about his own obligations.If none of these characters or this storyline seems outstanding, it is because the story is more about the extraordinary stressors of war and how it affects the lives of ordinary people. Still not convinced this needs to be added to the canon? Well, Cleave’s writing is spotless, unsentimental, but heartbreaking. London itself becomes a character as much as a setting. And the serious narrative is buoyed by just the right amount of levity. The dialogue is rife with laconic and droll humor.“In London, bedded in its clay, one viewed history as a reworkable legend, a great entertainment of doubtful veracity and liable in any case to revision whenever the next mudlark waded into the Thames at low tide and pulled out some iconoclastic sherd.”The survivors suffer an angst not even considered before there was war. As I was reading, I couldn’t help comparing the essence of war then and now, and concluding that there were a lot of similarities. It is the human condition, after all. War makes us impulsive, or compulsive, or daring, or headstrong, or angry, adventurous, reckless, withdrawn, outlandish, or all in cycling varieties. Some of their actions commence out of bounds of their typical conduct code, but war and mortality change things. People don't stay in their lane anymore.We see the soldiers’ side of things when the chapters focus on Alistair, and home in London, the nightly air raids begin to take its toll on the citizens. Tom and Mary’s relationship is beset by complications that war has produced, and her love for Zachary will have its reckoning, also. Cleave’s insights and his nuanced character reflections touched me deeply. Everyone has a fall from grace, but everyone brave is forgiven. “Perhaps there was a tiny victory, in wartime, in not being killed by the war.”This will make my ten best of the year. The ending assured that even more.

It’s light in tone but complex in plotting, and is adventurous, romantic, suspenseful, and rich in time-honored themes…or, wait, I mean, time travel themes, with a parallel universe. Pears creates a world (or worlds) so thoroughly believable and accessible that even the convolutions aren’t difficult to follow. He builds his narrative so gradually and keenly that the reader has many revolutions of the wheel to get into the groove of what is happening. There’s the future, a hostile technocracy, which can be a dangerous place of scientific espionage, but also where eccentric psychomathematician Angela Meerson is finely tuning her unstable time-esque machine. There’s also 1960, with all the paranoia of Cold War Intelligence and undercover operations. That’s the time where Professor Henry Lytton, semi-retired British Intelligence and quintessential scholar, and Rosie, fifteen-year-old brainy and beautiful girl, live. Rosie pops in to feed Henry’s cat, and Angela popped in some time ago to get away from the technocrats. She and Henry became good friends, and she surreptitiously hides her machine in his cellar.The most colorful and enchanting world is Anterworld, a place that looks like the ancient past, but might in fact be the future, after the eve of destruction. There’s no literature in Anterworld, either, except for “The Story.” The Story has its genesis in a whimsical notion by Professor Lytton, a fantastical world that has come to fruition because of Angela’s machinations--and her machine. Henry wrote the manuscript as an enchanting admixture of the secular, mythical, philosophical, prophetic, and fairytale, one that becomes a book of knowledge for the people who inhabit this world. To them, it is a sacred store of values, morality, and wisdom. Story Tellers are a select elite of the highest order. There is even a hallowed ground where judgement is sought.What makes this novel different than others of its class is the fluidity of time. Cause and effect is turned on its head, and can occur simultaneously. The scales of past and future are balanced with the present as fulcrum. As the narrative will show, “Time travel has nothing to do with either travel or time.” If this sounds deliberately confusing, it is only because you haven’t read this mouth-watering book. If you are looking for an imaginative, cerebral, romantic, enterprising, witty (and periodically comical), and dazzling story of intrepid and searching individuals, I recommend this theater of human voyage, sure to be a timeless favorite!...more",Notes are private!,-1,52,1,"Dec 26, 2015","Jan 03, 2016","Dec 27, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25614934-arcadia

The female protagonist of this story was born in Russia in the mid-twentieth century, raised by her academic parents, and was closest to her father, who inculcated her with culture, arts, and the poignancy of deep, philosophical thinking. Besides her father, her muse is a sort of Apollo’s Arrow, and she aspires to be immortal by becoming a celebrated poet. She moves to America for college, and begins a new life abroad. As a child and teen, growing up on the myths and fairytales that inspired her, our protagonist is certain of her inevitability toward divine art and the renouncement of material possessions. I can relate to that, too, as I once aimed, in my youth, to be a famous poet, and still have spiral notebooks of my (bad and good) poetry tucked away. It is the shadow or ghost of my earlier identity. But who is this woman’s real identity? At the end of her life, will she attain her goals, or will the ghosts of thwarted ambition haunt her?Forty rooms is the average number of rooms most adults will inhabit as they move from place to place as adults. In Russia, forty days has a significant symbolism for the soul, upon death; women are pregnant for 40 weeks; the rains (in Noah’s day) fell for forty days and forty nights. And the list goes on, biblically and otherwise. However, it is the forty rooms that this novel is structured around. Each part of the book symbolizes time passing in the protagonist’s life, and has a raw drawing of rooms in the abode where she lived. For example, in Part One, her Moscow apartment and dacha, the drawings depict “Mother’s bedroom or “Kitchen,” etcetera. She inhabits a room, leaves it, but the soul of the room remains, and the life lived there is ripe for reflection later.I keep saying “the protagonist” because her name, or namelessness, is key to the central character’s identity. The book begins in the first person, and then, in adulthood, she is known by her last name. The meaning of the narrator’s designation is a prime connotation for the reader to examine. That’s all I will say. I won’t talk about her adult life, either, for I remember the anticipation I felt, waiting for her life to unfold before me. I will share that Grushin’s writing is visceral, intense, gifted. Every sentence poured out like a celestial body.“There you go, Apollo, a nice little sacrifice for you--the sum of my entire existence to this day, all erased, so I can start anew, so I can create something real, something alive. There, there, can you smell the sweet rot of toy words, of dead words, rising like cloying incense to your heaven?”This is the kind of book that inspired me to see beyond just the self that inhabits the rooms I am in, both literally and figuratively. A poet creates something material from imagination, and those thoughts turn into words. But thought itself is an enigma--we can't pin it down like we can the place where it comes from. We are more than this dimension, it would seem. I found myself checking the ether while reading!

It is balanced and alluring; the more you read, the more it ropes you in. He has paid careful and loving attention to plot, character, rhythm, structure, pace, tone, and prose, so that the reader stays fully engaged through to the long end game.The main character, Roy, is an imposing man, and a strident one at times, no matter that he is 80-something years old. We know early on that he is a professional confidence man—a good liar, always sporting for a mark. His latest is Betty, also elderly but a spry and articulate academic, although she often comes across as passive. Yet, she also seems to have an agenda, however innocuous. After all, meeting strange men can cause dangerous consequences.The story centers on Roy and Betty’s relationship, as well as focusing on who they are as individuals. Roy plans to retire after Betty, his last waltz. But he tells her “one of the things I like intensely is dishonesty.” Betty declares her desire for companionship, which led her to an Internet dating site, which is how they met.I observed from the start that Searle’s writing was circumspect, holding back information that is released gradually. There are times that the characters know more than the reader, and at intervals we know more than Roy or Betty. I was occasionally impatient, that scratch I wanted to itch because I couldn’t grasp enough. But, I learned to trust the author as the narrative progressed. The story went back and forth in time, and periodically threw me off, as I had to continually reposition myself into whatever rabbit hole or design that Searle was concocting. It kept me guessing, and perhaps some of my hunches were on target. However, I was not prepared for the capstone, which left me breathless.I am being cautious in my  not to reveal plot points, because the untangling of mondo knots requires discovery. I was impressed by Searle’s ability to incrementally create an ambitious plot, one that organically evolves into something grand yet never grandiose. The writing is light on its feet, the timing is impeccable, and the architecture is fluid and immaculate. I was in the dark initially on whether this is a serious novel or a whimsical one, another mystery that beguiled me. Are Roy’s chameleon talents comical or grave, natural or necessary? This I will tell--when I reached the denouement, I was holding my breath and clenching my fists.I’ve ladled on the gravy, but for the meat and potatoes, you’ll have to read the book.

Central to this novel is the idea of sanctuary in one’s own family. As a child, you expect your parents to provide security and love. But what if your entire childhood was fraught with peril and neglect, animosity and indifference? What if your parents were self-centered and culpable for repeatedly placing you in harm’s way? Kyung Cho, a Korean-American professor, now thirty-seven, was raised by wealthy Korean immigrants in Boston, his father a well-educated, successful, but cold and destructive force in his life. Kyung now has a wife and four-year-old son. They struggle bitterly with finances, and most of all, Kyung has never been able to trust those that he is meant to love, due to his upbringing. When a heinous tragedy befalls his parents, and forces them to move in with his family, the unsaid and unresolved issues escalate to titanic proportions. What it means to be a loving husband and father, as well as a favorable son, becomes a crushing question that threatens to dislodge whatever tentative shelter and security that he has built with his wife and son. Jung Yun’s writing is smooth and accessible, building tension steadily as the pages turn. The conclusion was disappointing, however, as it lacked the organic shading that I anticipated. Although the author spent ample time developing the story and characters, he slid into a convenient but unconvincing ending. Despite the implausible ending, I still recommend this book for its thoughtful, thought-provoking, and contemporary concerns.

After she survives scarlet fever, Helena decides to move to France, live with her bohemian aunt, and go to art school in Paris. There she finds her independence, a new circle of friends, and an American love interest. The narrative focuses on her evolvement and maturity, as she gains wisdom through making her own decisions. Of course, finances are never a burden for her, so her risks are always pampered, even though she is pleasant, easy-going, and a woman of good character.I have not read the previous two books that featured the protagonist, but this one can be read on its own, as Helena’s previous history is well enough explained, and, to me, not that intriguing. Perhaps I am the wrong audience for this book, but much of it felt saccharine to me, especially Helena’s relationship with the American journalist, Sam Howard, who was perfect in just about every way--a handsome, muscular, soft-spoken man. Despite the passionate moments described in the story, it came across as bland and obvious.What kept me going was the decent writing and the setting.

It is a suspenseful thriller that starts off casually, and not very mysteriously, pointing the way to a domestic drama about a marriage troubled by external crises. Up in rural New York, Scott and Elise have come to Elise’s father’s house to assist Victor during his last dying months of life. Elise, a speech therapist, had to leave her job, and Scott’s work as a photographer was waning even before they left their place in Brooklyn to help Victor. Hoping for a quicker end, the not-too-happy couple becomes frustrated that the old man keeps hanging on. It is during this isolated time that the background story of Elise’s family unravels as Scott starts snooping on the apparently abandoned neighboring house.What reminds me of Hitchcock is the sense that, even though the story is in written rather than film form, a camera is following characters as they move from place to place. Each time Scott threads his way through the snow to the house next door, I imagine a camera behind his movements, jiggling at intervals like a nervous voyeur, or steady as a taut wire right at his back. Also, Scott himself is voyeuristic in this tale that he narrates, often with his camera or binoculars, trying to get a closer look at the empty house. Eventually, Elise joins Scott in his spy work next door. “And here we were, following each other through other people’s rooms…” turns into almost a motif as the story chillingly twists and turns to a breath-holding climax. Intermittently, I heard in my head those chaotic string instruments that Hitchcock employed, with sonic explosions of sound and a vertigo-inducing cadence.It’s worth a fair warning that there are some extremely disturbing scenes in this book, with a perverse and graphic sexuality that I wasn’t anticipating but was rolled out organically. As the sinister story progresses, a frightening, alarming set of shocks began reverberating across my chest, coiling me with its ruthless images and advancement of plot. What makes it even more intriguing is how the author combined the explicit with an air of ambiguity at times--soon, your imagination is conjuring the most riveting images.Amid all this white glare of snow, dark sky, cold air, and secluded setting, a story of suffocating intimacy and hot detachment ensues.

His wife, Adeline, a former pianist, lost her mind after their oldest son, a homosexual, was captured by the Nazis and taken to an extermination camp. Their other son, David, is living in Washington D.C. as a cryptologist. Herbert’s second cousin, Anna, a Hungarian known as the Rat, is a woman with an “exquisite ugliness,” a deformed spine and three whiskers growing from the mole on her face, but she has a beautiful face, a seraphic smile, deep, penetrating eyes, and a gentle heart, and is the unlikely hero of the story.Then there is Dr. Felix, an insane Mengele-esque doctor who performs unspeakable acts, as well as dabbling in a menacing form of genetic engineering. His relationship to the Tolstoi String Quartet, a group of older male musicians, is a form of specimen collection and monstrous science, which eventually incite Herbert and the Rat. And then there is Rasputin, who changes the Rat forever. Herbert and company form the foreground, while in the background, Hitler’s Germany rages on, yet between Herbert and Hitler is a surreal space of remove, a daub of magical realism that adds a touch of grace and a twisted beauty. It is a dark, eerie, bleak and depraved place that also resonates with hope. Art, literature, language, music, and poetry survive within the most horrifying events.What makes this novel so sui generis is the prose, which creates the touches of magical realism that penetrate the story or swirl the reality with a fantastical lift. For example: ”The instruments in their cases began to throb, their nose swelling next to their owners. From the dark cases came discordant deaf-mute sounds, a cacophony of scrapes, the meaningless tonalities of deserted music. The violins sobbed like sick women; the viola and violoncello howled.”This is such an aslant Holocaust/not Holocaust story--mixing fairy tales with human horror-- that I don’t recommend it for everyone. Without the Holocaust in the background, this story wouldn’t be as meaningful, yet it occurs at a distance, in America, and with individuals fighting different struggles, for the most part.

Well, that may not be too far from the truth here. The four Plumb siblings of the novel are thirty-nine and above, yet seem to be stuck in the baby bird phase, waiting for their Trust inheritance, or “nest,” which is reached when the youngest, Melody, turns forty. They have failed to grow up emotionally or crack the shell of their reckless risks of youth because they are stuck, waiting for the Nest to solve all the bad decisions that caused their financial woes in the first place.Jack hasn’t told his husband, Walker, that he has mortgaged their weekend property (that they planned to retire to) to the hilt. Beatrice used to be a short-story writer of some celebrity. Now she is just an underpaid editor, lonely and single. Melody hides a climbing credit card from her husband, and is worried about how to put their twin daughters through college. And Leo? He’s the black sheep. Now divorced and freshly out of rehab, he annihilated most of the nest when the Plumb matriarch used most of the funds to pay off Leo’s critical and tragic expenses. While drunk and coked up, he crashed a rented Porsche with a nineteen-year-old waitress in the car, and crippled her for life. And Leo used to be the most successful of the sorry lot of them!The Plumb patriarch intended, before he died, for this Trust to be a modest supplemental fund, not some life-saving inducement to tie up their lives for, but the stock market soared it to an amazing high. However, Leo’s debacle cost over 80% of it to be depleted, and the other three siblings are mightily pissed off. They want Leo to forfeit his share (there’s about 200k left to split four-ways). They blame Leo for the positions they are in, turning a blind eye from their own accountability (although Beatrice is softer on Leo). Essentially, the decades-long wait for the money has strapped them from evolving. This is mostly an entertaining book, but it is also a contemporary morality tale. And, although I was sure I predicted how it would all turn out, the author surprised me by keeping it real. The Plumbs (well, most of them) learn how to grow up, even if one of them flies the furthest of all from the nest.3.45...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 17, 2015","Nov 20, 2015","Nov 17, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25781157-the-nest

The family is devastated, scandal is imminent, Richard’s job is in jeopardy, and Kristin is appalled that her husband got naked and kissed one of the girls. The house is splattered everywhere with blood, and it is obvious that sex occurred in Melissa’s bedroom. This is how it all begins, and the fallout to family is the crux of the story.The narration primarily alternates between the Chapman family members and Alexandra, one of the two sex slaves that got away. We learn of her family history, as well as follow her and Sonja, the other fugitive from this mess. Her personal story has its own pile-up of tragedies. The author humanized Alexandra, but her English was too exceptional for someone in this country only three weeks, with little formal education. Her language, (except for inconsistently devised dropping of the articles “a” and “the,”) was too immaculate. It may seem a small complaint, but it was distracting, and made it more difficult to suspend disbelief.The problems for the Chapmans were expected, and Melissa’s crumbling interior world was the most palpable. Between home and school, there was no escape from the sordid story. As the family tries to mend, and find its way back to each other, the consequences of actions taken become more heightened.Bohjalian’s narrative is largely formulaic, but with a surprise twist at the end. The problem was that I wasn’t convinced. One character’s actions appeared contrived during the climax, and I had a hard time believing certain states of mind that are not supported. It was too abrupt a change of heart, and in the throes of a dangerous event, seemed incredulous.The story could also have been paced a bit better. There were some irrelevant digressions—and details of a walk-on character during the denouement were immaterial, and seemed placed to keep us in suspense. And a lot of the content was repetitive. Unfortunately, the thriller aspects seemed derivative to me. I know that the author did his research, but I wasn’t persuaded. I did engage with some of the Chapman’s distress, which helped me to keep going. I don’t want to be too harsh, or alienate any Bohjalian fans. This is just my opinion, that the author’s ambitions weren’t well realized. But I was able to finish, for wanting to know how this quick read all turned out....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Nov 11, 2015","Nov 12, 2015","Nov 13, 2015",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/25361920-the-guest-room

You have only one.”These are words recalled by now-successful writer Lucy Barton, while reflecting on her nine-week hospitalization back in the 80s, in New York City, her adopted home. She never forgot this maxim, told to her by a famous author who was leading a workshop Lucy attended. And, during her illness, her mother, who she hadn’t seen in many years, came to visit her for five days in the hospital. Lucy’s “one story” is told in moments such as these--her memories of her mother’s “urgent and compressed voice” during her visit, which she embraced. And this tender time for her also brought up sad memories from her poverty-stricken childhood in rural Illinois, frightful moments when she was mistreated. Lucy Barton never felt safe in her youth, which is the worst crime that parents can inflict on their children. Now, as an adult, mostly content, she looks back with fresh perspective, and shares her story with compassionate simplicity, which aroused my deepest emotions.This is a book that triggers the notion of quiet desperation and kindles the concept of small kindnesses. In Lucy’s memoir, whenever she relates a small kindness, and pairs it with a tragic event, or the indignities she faced and the benevolence that came from the most unexpected places and people, I felt utter tenderness and fellow-feeling for her. Her compassionate candor and clemency for others, the authentic and empathetic way that she forgives, and understands how the past impinges on the present, was powerful. It was never cloying or sugary—in fact, she has a talent for describing minute tragedies without exposition. She might repeat a thought, or share a past dialogue, or pair metaphors, and that will be enough to inflame a merciful feeling in the reader:“I have met many people…who tell me that you cannot hear the corn growing, and they are wrong. You cannot hear my heart breaking…but, to me, they are inseparable, the sound of growing corn and the sound of my heart breaking.”I recommend sitting in a quiet place and reading this book from start to finish—it will only take a few hours, but they will stir teeming sensations. The story is written in concise, lucid prose, and sparks a powerhouse of feeling in its simplicity and probity, in the little details. We can never fully know another human being--that is a universal truth, but, explored by Lucy Barton, it develops into an utterly moving one. Redemption in shared memories, reparation in embracing goodness, and grace in humanity—these are what inform Lucy’s life, and this book.

However, what makes this book utterly compelling and emotionally acute is a story of one family—(fictional) test pilot Jim Harrison, and his wife, Grace. They live in the high desert of The Mojave Desert, in Muroc, “the largest slab of uninterrupted flatness on Earth.” It’s a wide expanse of nothingness, but they love calling it home. This is where their friends live, and their life is built. The story begins in media res, demanding that the reader focus intently.I was glad that I didn’t know much about the book, and I waited to read the cover flap until after I finished the last page. Discovery and pacing are intricately tied to the suspense, and going into it blind rouses intensity for the reader. I’m going to avoid talking about much content and primarily share impressions. Jim Harrison is fearless, instinctive, brave, and equipped to handle all the dangers of his job; each day he flies, he confronts mortal hazards. But what happens when he can’t confront the pitfalls in his personal life? He is unafraid in the skies but timorous on the ground. How does this dissonance play out in a marriage? Grace is supportive and forbearing, and, at times, emotionally fragile. Empathy for both characters ripples from the narrative. The dialogue between them (and other characters) is superlative, without any clichés often present in a dialogue-heavy book. There are no quotation marks—the aesthetics are twofold--which in this book works well, as it generates intimacy, underscores the understated, and prevents messy-looking type.In a lesser author, the sections of physics, engineering, plane and rocket-craft would cause me to glaze over, and unhinge me from the story at hand. However, from Johncock, it lends a cred to the story without adding pretense. He ties in celebrated figures of the space program—Jim Lovell, John Glenn, Chuck Yeager, and many more, and the Happy Bottom Riders Club bar and legendary owner, Pancho Barnes, a tenderly mouthy and accomplished pilot in her own right. And this is the time in history that the race for space heralded operatic platitudes: “It’s a battle for the heavens. It’s good versus evil and we’re on the front line.” That was how it was then. However, it’s Jim’s family story that provides the aching nuance, often words as weapons, or talk left unsaid, a Cold War on a microcosmic level.My only complaint is the brisk ending, or it seemed that way after the sustained mental and emotional weight of the story.

Her mother moved back to England two years later, sowing the seeds of abandonment in Beryl at a very early age. Beryl’s father was a first class horse trainer, and she grew up knowing horses better than she knew people. She was a wild child, chiefly devoted to the wilderness, and was even attacked by a lion, surviving without emotional trauma. Instead, it made her even more fearless, as did the influence of her Kipsigis warrior friend, Ruta, who was her playmate during childhood (and her closest confidante as an adult).Beryl was determined to do whatever it took to stay in her beloved country, even when her father left for Cape Town when she was sixteen, as by then his farm had failed, as did most farms after the war. She was tall, vigorous, beautiful, and free-spirited, and became the youngest and first racehorse trainer in Kenya, at the tender age of eighteen. Later she became the first woman bush pilot, and the first aviator to successfully fly solo, east to west, over the Atlantic. School didn’t suit her, which, she occasionally regretted as an adult, but she was drawn to literature and poetry, especially when it concerned the love of the land and nature, and its self-sufficiency, particularly illuminated in Whitman’s Leaves of Grass.“The poem seemed to be about how naturally dignified animals are, and how their lives make more sense than those of humans, which are cluttered with greed and self-pity and talk of a distant God.”Beryl could surpass most men in rugged outdoor life. She couldn’t be tamed, not by domesticity, and her free will in love and life often caused scandal in the ex-pat community. She wasn’t the stand-by-your-man kind of woman, she was more the stand-by-myself non-conformist. Her marriages, which came at critical times in her life, did not end well. Her firebrand temperament, as well as her fearless career choices, weren’t suitable for the home saddle. She was too independent to be an appendage to a man, but was often at the center of rumor and gossip. In McLain’s reimagining, the love of Beryl’s life was confirmed bachelor Denys Finch Hatton, the longtime lover of married Karen Blixen, a Danish ex-pat (both Blixen and Finch Hatton are the center of the movie, Out of Africa). Beryl was attracted to the warrior in him, which reminded her of the warrior in herself. Too, they were both inaccessible to most others, and could not be gamely conquered and subdued.The novel demonstrates how Beryl gets right on the horse again (pun intended), even when faced with failures. And, once she masters a challenge, she continues to face new ones. Like the title—the concept of circling, and the beginning and end of the book, which is another full circle, Beryl understands the nature of her journey in life.“…it was possible everyone ended up in the same place no matter which path we took or how often we fell to our knees, undoubtedly wiser for all of it.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 07, 2015","Nov 11, 2015","Nov 07, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23995231-circling-the-sun

An attack. Islamophobia. Hatred. Fear of the future, and hardliners taking positions. But Hrbek, perhaps There’s a whiff here of the post 9/11 novel. An attack. Islamophobia. Hatred. Fear of the future, and hardliners taking positions. But Hrbek, perhaps inspired by that genre of books, created a more unconventional novel—part speculative fiction, part dystopia, thriller, particles of sci-fi, cautionary tale, family drama, and part scrutiny of social bias. It’s an ambitious novel that alternates between characters, and in different realms of time—or networks of time, while also occurring in a narrow period of eight years. It’s an examination of people who attempt to reconcile their principles with their fears, and how memories play an important part of their convictions, but may not be what they seem. Moreover, it demonstrates how hatred is a toxin that spreads to future generations.The prelude opens with an attack of unknown source and composition on the Golden Gate Bridge on 8/11/2030, “something, metal or fire or a bolt of electromagnetism.” Young college student Skyler Wakefield is babysitting when it happens, while her family is tucked safely and distantly away from the resulting mushroom cloud and radiation. The reader can’t be sure of her fate, but we know that her mind is on her three-year-old brother, Dorian.Fast-forward eight years later, a very different America, whose borders have changed into provinces and territories, due to the nuclear fallout. Although nothing has been substantiated about the cause of the 8/11 attack, the official story blames radical Islam terrorists. All Muslims have been corralled into ghetto-like camps, isolated from the rest of the country, just like the Americans did to the Japanese seventy years ago. They have been categorically demonized, although some progressive people are sympathetic to their plight.Meanwhile, Dorian, now almost twelve, is having dreams about a sister, Skyler, who he doesn’t actually remember, but is ever-present in a nighttime fever of clairvoyance. His parents state that they have no memory of a daughter, and are disturbed by Dorian’s insistence that she existed. The widespread blame on Muslims for 8/11 fuels Dorian’s suspicion and naïve hatred of them, as he connects them to the fate of his sister. Does she exist? Hberk deftly structures the book so that even the reader is questioning whether Skyler was real. Or, perhaps she exists in a different sphere of time, as promoted by a keen, long-haired outlier. Are his parents lying to him?Meanwhile, the Wakefield’s 71 year-old neighbor, who fought in all Gulf Wars (most recently Gulf War III), has just legally adopted eleven-year-old Karim from one of the camps. Karim’s parents were killed in an American drone strike, which leaves him ripe for hatred against “infidels.” His presence in the neighborhood causes a stir and escalation of convictions, and an incident that unleashes extremes of behavior, and in some cases, potential heroism.The novel achieves a great resonance of feeling, but its breadth, which came on hard and fast toward the end, also obfuscated some of the key questions it raised, or dropped them altogether. Some ideas used shallow treatment, and the portrait of Muslim characters mostly lacked nuance. Dorian and Karim emerge as the main characters, and it is their actions and interior monologues that give it pace throughout the shifting perspectives.Much of the narrative is stream-of-consciousness, which was periodically repetitive, and could have been sharpened to a finer point. However, at times, such as with this quote, it accentuated the enigma of humanity.“What we have presented here is a fraction of the whole, no more representative of the total narrative than a single cell is representative of the living body of a person, just as every person described herein is, in like manner, a fraction of a whole of greater selves.”I enjoyed it for its intriguing enterprise and imagination, as well as giving us a window into a community, and how its empathy, enmity, fears, fractiousness, and convictions are built. Additionally, the story illuminates that history and memory are intertwined, and that all our actions build on previous actions, affect each other, and have consequences....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 05, 2015","Nov 05, 2015","Nov 05, 2015",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/24869879-not-on-fire-but-burning

This is my first by him, although I’ve read other novels concerning the post-apartheid plight. There’s much more nuance than just the headlines say, such as how it affects people individually. Cartwright takes the era down to a personal level, the apartheid and post-apartheid periods never far below the surface of implication. He achieves a portrait of one family’s love, troubles, dysfunction, and loyalties, and executes the theme of history with identity and the sense of home. “Now I feel an urge to go home, even if the home I have in mind is mostly imagined.”Wealthy but generous McAllister is from Cape Town, but has lived much of his life in London. He has a home in Notting Hill, the New Forest, and a beach house in Cape Town. It’s there at the beach house that he feels uplifted, wild, and elemental, joined with nature. His lovely Swedish girlfriend, Nellie, is a lover of the natural world. “After all, the Vikings were the last pagans of Europe.” He also feels a calm stillness in Cape Town. His house, inspired by Martha’s Vineyard, is named Menemsha. Cartwright never lacks for elegant metaphors to describe the surrounding land and sea.It opens on an identity with history, as the main character, Frank McAllister, is a descendent of the Boer Piet Retief, who was massacred, along with his followers (and women and children), by the Zulu king Dingane, in 1838. (Cartwright is also a descendant of Retief, so there’s a certain biographical significance). Afrikaners have lionized Retief, but Frank thinks that there’s some unspoken rot at Retief’s core. He’s vexed by these thoughts. And even in the modern South Africa, there is the “violence and desperation that are never far away.”There isn’t much plot in the book, but as I was reading, I felt the tautness in Cartwright’s lean, sinuous, aphoristic prose, and the sense of a danger lurking underneath the family trek. McAllister, along with Nellie and her teenage son, Bertil, go down to the beach house and await the arrival of Frank’s daughter, Lucinda, fresh out of rehab in California. Frank is plagued by her fragility, and hopes she is fully drug-free now; he blames her problems on his messy divorce with his insufferable, self-centered ex-wife, Georgina. During this meditative, reflective story, memories of Georgina occasionally intrude on his tranquility. When Lucinda does arrive, she comes with a surprise guest--an African-American two-and-a-half-year-old, Isaac, the son of a recent boyfriend who is on a music tour.“He has a quality of warmth I have never before encountered in a very small child, a precocious empathy.” Isaac, (which means laughter) soon enchants everyone. Frank is immediately captivated by Isaac’s innocence and affection, and the baby calls Frank “Grandpa” right from the start.Frank’s serenity is interrupted periodically by phone calls from his cousin, Jaco, a racist, gun-loving manipulator who once achieved his fifteen minutes of fame when he was attacked by a shark. His head camera filmed his eventual subdual of the shark, and it went viral on You Tube, leading to appearances as a guest speaker. However, he is now calling to ask for a large sum of money that he owes the Scientologists in California, saying that they are holding him captive and won’t release him without the money he owes. Jaco symbolizes that element of danger invading the idyll, and the chapters of his nature are fascinating, recalling the bloodshed of the past. I find myself, several days after reading this novel, appreciating it even more. The story is subtle, sublime, with a striking denouement. The threads of the story may not initially suggest much of a unifying theme, or may come across as disparate, but, after contemplation, I recognize its transcendence. The allusions to myth, medieval history, poetry, Shakespeare, and the search for home and identity penetrate this landscape of the mind, body, and environment. Frank seeks to understand his humanity by connecting the past with the present, history with its value and essence. His effusive words of love to Nellie may come close to syrupy and unreal at times, but I give it a pass, because it is fitting that Frank McAllister is something of the dreamer himself, an idealist. “…I have understood that love is not an end in itself, but a process of learning to know another fully…Much of what I know has come from books. I have relied heavily on books in order to understand the world.”In UP AGAINST THE NIGHT, Frank shapes his imagination and idealism with reality; he conveys the essence of being human....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Nov 03, 2015","Nov 04, 2015","Nov 03, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23848179-up-against-the-night

The narrative begins right before the fall of Saigon in 1975. The unnamed narrator (how fitting!) is the son of a French Catholic priest, so in essence, his father, a man sworn to celibacy (among other vows), is also a man of two faces. His mother was Vietnamese. This is a story about identity in its many forms—the double spy, the dual ethnicities, the combined personal philosophies, and, on a personal level, divided loyalties that betray a best friend, one of his “blood brothers,” who doesn’t know that he is a spy. The tale takes the form of a confessional, from narrator to his Viet Cong Commandant, while imprisoned in a single cell five years later.I have read numerous spy stories that read like a confession, from authors such as Norman Mailer, John Banville, Don DeLillo, and Simon Mawer. What makes this different is that the story has a sardonic, droll tone, and there’s even a tragically warped and twisted lens on the making of the movie, Apocalypse Now. And, it is rare to read a novel about the Vietnamese war written in the voice of one of its citizens. The protagonist attended college in the United States, but returned to his homeland to play the mole inside the General’s secret police, in the Special Branch. One of the blood brothers, Man, is also a Communist spy, whereas Bon, the other blood brother, is unaware that his two friends are communist sympathizers. The betrayals illuminated in this book are often suspenseful, but always gut-wrenching. It reads like a picaresque novel, except for the painful and serious content.Even more than the conflict of war is the splintering of character, the dissembling and guile of which keeps the narrator in perpetual torment. How can he look a comrade in the eyes when he assassinates or causes his death in order to keep his cover? How dislocated from an authentic life? What price does he pay for his politics? And, on top of his ongoing misery is the double life of confusion. He has to hide in plain sight, but his true self must remain underground. Even when he is one of the selected few, along with Bon and the General, to escape to Los Angeles during the fall of Saigon, his job as a mole continues. Moreover, his discord with American superpower, superhighways, supermarkets, and Super Bowls “from the federal bank of its narcissism,” takes the form of social satire.The narrator, during his confession, delves into his fractured self to attempt to unmask his own identity. “A spy’s task is to hide where everyone can see him and where he can see everyone, Now ask yourself: What can everyone see about you but you yourself cannot?”...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Oct 30, 2015","Nov 02, 2015","Oct 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23168277-the-sympathizer

Over-sharing seems to be a hallmark of our times, and the most anodyne or monotonous circumstances become fodder for the confessional book, often written in generic prose. Helen Macdonald’s book is a rare exception. She broke the mold with H is for Hawk, a unique, compelling narrative that reads like a penetrating, courageous adventure chronicle as much as a memoir. Her narration of grief is sublimely braided into her arresting story of learning “how you feel more human once you have known, even in your imagination, what it is like to be not.”Macdonald is a British naturalist, experienced falconer, poet, illustrator, and research scholar who sank into depression after her father died. In her current state of overwhelming grief, she decided to train a goshawk, something she had never done, hoping to “make it all disappear.”“I’d wanted to fly with the hawk to find my father; find him and bring him home.”Goshawks are large hawks with short, broad wings and a long tail, and the female is larger than the male. They are vicious predators with tempestuous natures—a potential danger to humans who aren’t equipped to work with them. Macdonald’s experience training her newly acquired hawk is utterly fascinating, and she is never dull as she weaves in author T.H. White’s book chronicling his quasi-successful, novice training of a goshawk. White wanted to “civilise the perversity and unruliness within himself,” whereas Helen Macdonald wanted to become invisible, as she felt “hollow and unhoused.” Both authors, in a sense, “refused humanity in favor of hawks,” trying to step away from themselves and become the hawk.At turns earthy and ethereal, Macdonald intertwines White’s goshawk challenges, boyhood struggles, adult suffering, and his stories of Arthurian myth and legend, The Once and Future King, with her own peculiar imagination and affinity with myths, her grief, and her love of nature and the wild.“I’d wanted to slip across the borders of this world into that wood and bring back the hawk White lost… And…part of me had hoped, too, that somewhere in that other world was my father.”She peppers her story with scenes of her childhood and her love of her father, as well as edifying us about falconry’s archaic glossary of terms, and facts and history of falconry, such as how it used to be an aristocratic endeavor. Ms. Macdonald names her goshawk Mabel, which means “protecting spirit.” I was utterly captivated by Macdonald’s writing, the way she pulled me into her world of the wild, and the riveting demands and soulful commitment to training a goshawk. Her interior and exterior life, the friction and conflict between the two--and her hunt to reconcile them and grapple with grief through her journey with Mabel is thoroughly exalting. Hawks were never domesticated, so they have the ability to conjure history—the hawk today is the same as it was five thousand years ago. There’s something eternal about them, so it is understandable that the author would turn to something timeless, immortal, while mourning for her beloved father. Macdonald learns about the shape of grief and, while reflecting on her life, she realizes the deeper lessons that her father had taught her, and what they mean for her now. In her quest to flee and become the hawk, she learns what it is to be human....more",Notes are private!,2,20,1,"Oct 27, 2015","Oct 29, 2015","Oct 27, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18803640-h-is-for-hawk

In this complex mystery, the story alternates from the early 1930s to 2003 (with a few other past years occasionally) in Cornwall, England. An eleven-month old baby, Theo, is abducted from a loving family in 1933, from an estate called Loeanneth. It's Anthony and Eleanor Edevane's only son--they have three older daughters. The case was never solved.In 2003, Detective Constable Sadie Sparrow has been advised to leave London for a month, after leaking to the press her unpopular point-of-view on a current missing person case. The case is now remanded to a closed status, and Sadie is frustrated. She also has a secret, from fifteen years ago, one that is rearing its head, and she wants to put it aside. She leaves for Cornwall to stay with her grandfather, Bertie. There she stumbles on the old Edevane estate while jogging, and is enchanted by the crumbled, ruined estate. Then she learns about the unsolved 70-year-old case, and decides to go digging. Her refuge was to escape the present and go back to the distant past.The two oldest daughters are still alive--Deborah, and the now famous crime-writer, Alice Edevane. Sadie decides to write to Alice to ask permission to enter the old disused grounds, as she believes there exist clues to Theo's disappearance. However tragic, it is likely a dead body they are seeking, to finally put closure on the case. Sadie is also on a quest for closure for her own secret, but is that possible? Sadie starts reading Alice's novels, hoping for a clue to the crime.What we learn along the way is that Eleanor was an adventurous woman before meeting medical student Anthony, who swept her off her feet in 1911. Their three daughters are plucky and intelligent. The youngest, tomboy Cammie, wants to fly planes. The oldest, Deborah, dreams of moving to London when she is finally independent. Alice loves Loeanneth, never wants to leave this magical, enchanted forest. Her writing aspirations began at a young age, and she's already in the midst of her first story, which she shares only with a handsome employee of the estate, Benjamin Munro, with who she harbors a secret crush. They have a unique relationship.The Edervane family is troubled by their own memories--and unaware how unreliable memories, twined with secrets, can be obstacles to facts, or truth--recalled as they are by isolated perspectives. This could thwart the pieces of a puzzle coming together, or falsely assemble events with fragments, creating a family mythology that is carried by each individual, in their own, distorted recollections. But what they do remember is the moral compass that figured in their lives, such as Eleanor, guarded but morally upright and fiercely loyal to justice and family.""She possessed an innate sense of justice, a complex system of checks and balances that determined the measure of something she called `rightness.'""Her mother's integrity influenced Alice's stories, in her lead detective, Diggory Brent: ""The world had its own way of keeping the scales in balance. Guilty characters might escape prosecution, but they never escaped justice.""I have only read one other Kate Morton novel, The Distant Hours, which shares the prestige of mining the depths of family heritage, and examines how subjective memories and past traumas can unduly entrap us in the future. If you enjoy an entertaining Gothic-like mystery, with an imposing house hulking over buried secrets, then you will be nothing short of entertained. But, the author layers her complex story at every chapter, with forward, sideways, and reversed directions that will keep you guessing until the end. Even her read herrings are correlated--nothing is gratuitous. Morton's talent for connections is brilliant, scintillating, and airtight. Her overarching talent is her ability to structure a story with an elegant complexity. In the hands of a lesser author, it would have been unwieldy. In Kate Morton's hands, it is a Gothic tower.Despite a few wince-inducing coincidences, and the rushed winding up of the contemporary missing-person case, the author eclipses formula with her structure, mosaic, psychological mystery, intrigue of characters, and the universal themes-- such as the bonds between family, the toxicity of secrets, and the role of memories. And, of course, the enchanted atmosphere and almost-magical features of the house and estate come alive. If you already like Kate Morton, this fifth novel is a must-read addition. If you're new to this author, you're in for a treat. Moreover, I have a suspicion that this could begin a Sadie Sparrow series.

Groff takes the elements of a marriage—a domestic drama of sorts, and weThis is a powerful novel wherein the contents are as formidable as the title. Groff takes the elements of a marriage—a domestic drama of sorts, and weaves a compelling tale that is neither soap opera nor comfort food. FATES AND FURIES examines a marriage from two different fields of vision, or versions, but both in the third-person perspective. So it isn’t He said, She said. Often, when a novel is told from the bisecting branches of husband and wife, it is told in the first-person, allowing for contradictions to be anticipated, as we expect a certain amount of room for the unreliable narrator. However, the narrator here is the author, and the two stories don’t contradict each other, or fight to lure the reader into he or she’s said facts. In fact, the genius here is how the author manages to tell one story, with no inherent contradictions between the two parts (Part I is Fates, part II is Furies), but yet with the shock and surprise of Part II so complete that I was pitched through a dark tunnel by the last pages. I don’t think I will ever forget the impact of this tour de force of master storytelling.What I can divulge: It is the early 1990s, and after only six weeks of courtship, two intelligent and literary college graduates are married in a storm of bliss. The book starts out in their post-wedded beautitude on a beach in Maine. Lotto (Lancelot) is privileged and wealthy, a very tall and imposing man. He’s not exactly handsome—he had acne as a teen and has the scars/pits to prove it. He is still a golden boy--a charismatic, Shakespearean stage actor in college, curly and blonde—the Golden Boy with some physical and personal flaws. “Animal magnetism is real; it spreads through bodily convection.” He’s a bit narcissistic, yet committed to Mathilde. And he drinks too much, especially when in the throes of depression. His wife, Mathilde, is tall, blonde, leggy, and unconventionally attractive, also. But, together they see the other as the most beautiful on the planet. They only have eyes for each other now. But, Lotto was quite the Lothario before he fell hard for Mathilde. His father is long dead, and his mother took him to Florida to finish his high school years after a tragedy. Mathilde is an orphan with no family. She fills her role as wife largely through her support of Lotto. For a while, she is the breadwinner, working at an art gallery and later at an Internet start-up. She has feminist leanings that she keeps mostly in check, especially for Lotto. She is devoted to him, more than many wives would be for such a vain husband.The reader is more of a voyeur in Part I, with a pane of glass between the reader and the couple, although all of Lotto’s secrets are on display for us to know. The tone and the narrative construction could be seen as a bit arm’s length--in narration, but not in content. You wonder how much that Mathilde knew about his past; however, it was obvious she gleaned enough to know his interior self, and that he had some wild behaviors before they met. In Part II, we slide into Mathilde as the main character, or as the more exposed one. The tone changes; it is fiercely intimate, as if we are walking in Mathilde’s shoes with her. The drama dials up and the excitement builds tautly with every page. Even if you are restless with Part I—there is a certain wall between the reader and the protagonists—don’t give up. Once you get to Part II, it all makes sense, from why Groff chose to write the first part the way she did, to the ironies and tragedies that inflame the pages. I was shattered by the end of the story.With delicious literary allusions, from Greek tragedy to Shakespeare, you know you are in the hands of an erudite author, but it is created organically, never pretentiously served up. The raw secrets are conveyed like grenades in a landmine, and the story just about explodes. Once you get to Part II, you understand the purpose of Part I, and its architecture. This may be the finest, most emotionally compelling novel that I read this year. I'd give six stars if I could!“…life was conical in shape, the past broadening beyond the sharp point of the lived moment.

Some authors concentrate on a twisty plot, others on the enigmaticThe cloistered world of spies has long been a hot-seller of fiction and literature. Some authors concentrate on a twisty plot, others on the enigmatic personality of a spy. In TIGHT ROPE, the follow-up to TRAPEZE, Simon Mawer does both with equal ability. Although primarily character-driven, with the life of British spy Marian Sutro at the center, Mawer does a satisfying job of creating a taut atmosphere, and he does so with lean, precise prose and the heady atmosphere of the Cold War. He also delves into Marian’s work in WW II, as he goes back and forth in time. As the book opens in the early millennium, Marian is a woman in her eighties, being interviewed by a man from her past. He wants to tie up loose ends. It’s obvious that he was once enchanted by this woman, and played a small but peripheral part of her past, but there were holes, or lacunae, he wanted to fill in. This is Marian’s story, and the gentleman, her scribe.Marian was half-British, half-French, a perfect contender for parachuting into German-occupied France during WW II. She was adept at the rigors of fieldwork--killing; masking; carrying messages; and the use of explosives. At times, I felt like I was in a movie. A good movie, but nothing too original, plot-wise. Yet, it led me along because Mawer is an expert in pacing and character, and just when I think I’ll predict what is ahead (and sometimes I do), I find that I am intrigued by Marian and her disquiet. Marian was sensible and pragmatic at times, but occasionally quixotic. She had multiple lovers, and an early marriage to a PR pilot. She talks about the horrifying torture she received at the hands of the Germans with as equal intensity as her ardor for particular men that she met in the course of her work. She was captured by the Germans after being betrayed by an associate. She wasn’t certain who it was.At the age of 23, when the war was over, Marian’s adjustment to quotidian life became a struggle. She lived with her brother, a scientist, who she realized was in the wrong place at the wrong time, being pulled in to espionage on the fringes. Marian became a part of Cold War espionage, which pulled her in various directions at once. The lives of spies, and the masks of subterfuge, are riveting at times. Double agents, triple agents, keeping it straight, and trying not to get killed or tortured in the process, keeps the atmosphere both chilling and hot. Marian Sutro is a sympathetic character, closed off from people around her, yet with a flinty kind of passion, too, mixed with her duty she felt to protect the ones she loved.It’s difficult to give this a 5 star, however, because I’ve read some of the best of the best spy novels, HARLOT’S GHOST being the undisputed champion (by American Norman Mailer). Nothing seems to compare with the layers of the psyche (in this case, American) that created and sustained the CIA, and a more believable story, altogether. The posing, which is elementary to the fieldwork, is more convincing. It's not just ""what"" they did, but the core of the human character that shifts reflexively. Banville and DeLillo have also written outstanding spy novels. Mawer’s is more of a mainstream crowd-pleaser, one that could find its way into cinema. And, certainly more weighty than a Bond movie.“It felt like walking a tightrope, feeling the balance, knowing that a slight shift to either side might be fatal.”...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 17, 2015","Oct 19, 2015","Oct 17, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25380711-tightrope

Wives, especially military wives, had a rigid protocol, and their desires and dreams took a backseat to making their husband’s happy and being outstanding homemakers. Nat (Natalie) Collier is an inner free spirit, not the expected conformist. However, she tries to adapt to her role as wife and mother of two little girls, Sam and Liddie. She was unconventional, whereas her quiet, uptight husband, Paul, aimed to follow the rules. The repressive status quo in family and community dials up the tension.These are also the years of the prototype nuclear power plant in Idaho Falls (known now as the Idaho National laboratory). History buffs may know the tragic story, and that certain events remain controversial. Williams’ perspective ties in an unstable nuclear rod with an increasingly unstable family. Secrets, lies, and the oppression of formal domestic roles act as a metaphor and cautionary tale. Nat and Paul are recent arrivals in Idaho Falls. The men backslap with each other and keep their feelings locked down; the women covertly size each other up, and the neighbors have nosy natures. Nat feels tense at the arranged dinner parties and around the other army wives, but she craves friends, and is committed to playing the good wife. Beneath the veneer of composure, however, a volatile core resides.The author does a magnificent job of portraying the era. The rise of the processed foods; cigarettes smoked in closed spaces, in front of small children; the women donned and coiffed like June Cleaver; constant attention to manners; bottle-feeding over breastfeeding; and the men the solo providers. Women don’t have male friends, and certainly don’t entertain fellas while their husbands are at work, and the men don’t show emotion. The double standard is alive and kicking. As much as Nat tries to conform, she gets lonely sometimes, just for companionship during the long days. She even has to beg her husband for use of the car. Moreover, Paul is guarding a few secrets--one at the nuclear plant, and another of a night out on the town with his boss--information that torments him. But soon his sense of military propriety and the protection of his family are at odds with each other, which cause far-reaching consequences, both at home and with his post.Williams’ writing is smooth, polished, and rhythmic, the plot well-paced, and the characters complex. The novel is written in the third-person narrative, with alternating chapters headed by the main characters voices, with a few intermittent chapters by another army wife, Jeannie. Her troubles are more sordid, and accentuate the fraud of gender roles and the façade of this military Pleasantville. There are only a few facts that were misapplied (minor and medical), and the one token black woman in the novel had no part to play. Otherwise, this was a solid read, entertaining and informative.

Lennon bAuthor Kevin Barry crossbreeds the myth/legend of John Lennon with the man he was, in this fable-like, surreal story of one Beatle’s odyssey. Lennon bought an island in Western Ireland almost a decade before, also known as Beatle Island. He’d only been once. Now, it’s 1978, and he’s in the midst of his dry years. He hasn’t produced new material since the 1974 Walls and Bridges; he’s busy baking bread and being a househusband, giving all his attention to Yoko and their toddler son, Sean. He’s even gone macrobiotic.Now, John wants a pilgrimage to his island, to spend three days in solitude and see if the artist juice flows, to find his mojo again. His experience in Primal Scream therapy has given him something to work with while out there. His driver, Cornelius O’Grady, is quite the eccentric character. He helps to ward off the press and navigate to the tiny island in Clew Bay, called Dorinish (pronounced Dornish), but the circumnavigation leads to surprising detours in this (no surprise) 9 chapter masterpiece. A magical mystery tour.If you’re expecting a Beatle-mania bio or story, then you may be disappointed. Barry’s prose has more than a touch of magical realism, and in 8 of the 9 chapters he comes at the story from a slanted angle. Yes, we are inside Lennon’s head, but the lexicon and dialect, as well as the astonishing prose, play with ambiguity, and create a hypnagogic atmosphere. I had to pay attention, and eventually, the dialogue and exposition construct a moving, painterly portrait of John Lennon, the man, as it captures the myth. Chapter six is kind of an alternate chapter, wherein Barry writes an essay-like account of his own personal odyssey to Dorinish. It acts as glue for the rest of the book, and serves to answer some of the questions that may be rolling around in the reader’s head. It is also, in its realism, what turns this book from a truly excellent book to a tour de force. While John Lennon appropriately remains at some distance--myth-like, Kevin Barry's essay is almost confessional, and it draws you into his heart.If you are not knowledgeable about John Lennon, it won’t keep you from enjoying this masterly work of literature. The upside of being ignorant of Lennon history is you won’t have expectations of it being a “Beatle” book. It may heighten the enjoyment, however, to know a few things. Lennon was born and raised in Liverpool, mostly by his Aunt Mimi, as his troubled mother, Julia (the song, “Julia,” is an homage to her), squandered her life and compelled the state to remove John from her. His father left them when John was very young. He carries an eternal melancholy regarding his youth, and the author frequently furnished the story with the musician’s unresolved pain about his past.Lennon has a certain feminine side to him--Yoko wore the pants, so to speak, and handled all his business affairs. He also had an obsession with numbers, particularly the number 9. John and Yoko lived at the tony Dakota apartments in NYC (where he was also shot and killed at age forty on December 8, 1980). It’s still sad to recall that his album, Double Fantasy, his first in five years, was released just a few short weeks before his murder.On this fabled journey, Cornelius is equally a main character. His shapeshifting nature is a fitting counterpoint to John’s distress. As Lennon wears his driver’s dead father’s silver-blue suit for much of the time, the narrative dabbles with fantastical, hallucinogenic visuals that add dimension to Lennon’s loss and grief. There’s a lot of alcohol, and in the local pub, Cornelius introduces John as his half-deaf cousin Kenney. They drink, they sing, and, at one point, John almost has it out with a local. The novel is peppered with Lennon/Beatle lyrics, as well as Beach Boys, Peter Frampton, and other songs of the times.My second favorite chapter was a detour to the now-closed, occult-ish Amethyst hotel, a place that is like a twisted, perverted Valhalla, run by an Odin-like character, “Joe Director.” What happens there is captivating, and brings out Lennon’s fractious, belligerent nature when he is expected to take part in ranting and screaming with a young couple that are staying there. It is also a heartbreaking interlude, where mourning and memories infringe on John’s thoughts. Later, there’s an episode of a Plato-like cave that brings Lennon to dark, spiritual thoughts. “Deathhauntedness.”“The fear that it’s all going to end and the measuring out of the time that is left or might be…and the stewing in the past and the sense of every time being maybe the last time and everything is charged and everything glows and the night terrors that come in a soak of sweat and the sentiment and the fear and the poison and the pain…”At turns turbulent, laconic, elliptical, ancient, psychotropic, and sad, I was not the same when I exited these mystical, mythical pages. “There have been other animals among these rocks before.

She was an IVF baby that was frozen for eight yearIn this unusual, somber tale, the titular Katherine Carlyle is on the run from her melancholy life. She was an IVF baby that was frozen for eight years before being thawed and implanted in her now-dead mother. Her father, a big-shot TV news journalist, never seems to have time for her, and is always off to the Middle East or wherever there is a newsworthy war. Katherine, who moved from England to Rome with her parents when she was very young, often daydreams of the days that her mother was alive. In elegiac detail, she recalls these moments, which are woven intermittently throughout the novel. Katherine’s memories of her family intimacy—mainly her mother's—are juxtaposed with her current lifestyle of hooking up with strangers. She is also distressed by that eight-year interval that she was frozen. Why eight years, she questions? The examination of her origins, and her pursuit of validity and love, are the keystone themes of this novel.As the novel progresses, so does Katherine—toward colder climates. I saw it as an extended metaphor for her years as a frozen embryo. Of course, Katherine can’t know or remember her pre-historic life, but, in traveling to colder tundra, she is imagining it, playing out her embryonic life in her current one. She’s quite resourceful, also, for her nineteen years; she seems older in her ability to cannily out-pace others. No matter if someone is a friend or stranger, Katherine can outmaneuver older adults by baiting them to project certain fantasies onto her. She is utter control, externally, and playacts so skillfully and subtly, that she wears her masks as a second skin.“Sometimes I suspect I haven’t thawed out yet, My emotions are still frozen, my nerve endings numb. Sometimes I imagine I have been carved out of ice, like a swan in a medieval banquet, and that my heart is visible inside, a gorgeous scarlet, but motionless, trapped, incapable of beating or feeling.” Whew! A chilly hood over a hot heart!The author installs the reader wherever Katherine goes, and whatever she is thinking about. The movie, The Passenger, is woven throughout the novel, almost like a second plot, as Katherine remembers scenes that have an eerie but oblique parallel. His sense of place is superb. I felt right back on Via Giulia, for example, the most beautiful street in Rome. And the scenes in Berlin were so sharp, lucid. I was just there a few months ago, and it was as if I were stepping in her boot prints. I felt a quick tingle when she stopped at Bebelplatz, the site of one of the infamous Nazi book burning ceremonies, where “beneath the pane is a brightly lit white room, its walls lined with shelves that are pristine, empty.” In a sense, this could be an analogy to Katherine, an empty library filled with unlined shelves.The pace is steady, punctuated by brief, isolated acts of violence. Katherine’s journey unfolds with a growing suspense, taut and tensile as the denouement closes in on the final pages. When I closed the book, I continued to ponder the protagonist; Katherine Carlyle had become implanted in my reader’s soul. Highly recommended for literature lovers looking for a deep, contemplative adventure story with rich prose, ethereal moments, and a complex character.“After years in the storage tank I was finally lifted into blinding daylight, a foretaste of the birth that was to come. They moved me from one thawing solution to another…then put me in an incubator… This was the place where I divided. Cleaved… I experienced a gradual loss of control, a delicious incontinence. I was unfurling, expanding, taking shape. A sudden, hectic tumble into life.”...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 04, 2015","Oct 07, 2015","Oct 04, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24388434-katherine-carlyle

Ethan is on the extreme end of the autism spectrum, born with an extra chromosome, which inhibits intellectual development; he will always be a three-year-old child, although he is now in an adult-like body.What starts out as the first road trip between father and son turns into a fractured family odyssey of Guilt and Doubt, damage control, volatile bonding, and, finally, destination. Configurations change, planning and direction is constantly recalibrated, exhaustion is inevitable. All the dirty laundry comes out, (as well as some Jim Beam), but so does strength and courage. Ethan’s rituals and mannerisms typically turn a one-hour event into a three-hour folly. If you’ve ever been with a severely autistic individual, you’ll recognize the behaviors. I am a pediatric psychiatric nurse that works primarily with autistic children on the extreme end of the spectrum; I assert that this is one of the most genuine portrayals of autism in fiction. Ethan is both infuriating and infectious—he’s never anything but himself, no guile, no pretense. You will laugh while your heart is breaking. Kokoris has a pitch-perfect way with words and his dialogue has immaculate timing. There are no boring moments. It’s cinematic—I could visualize the movie version, but it isn’t hack humor. It’s fierce and deadpan and often awkward and dark. Additionally, the family members periodically use props, like teddy bears, to entertain Ethan, to keep him engaged and from acting out. And then there’s the family song that he demands, often at inopportune times. “He also loved his family. If we were all together, he would bring us into a circle, make us hold hands, and sing, ’Family! Family! U!...S!...Aaaaa!’” If they are at “threat level,” such as “orange,” they have to capitulate to Ethan or try to remove him from whatever stimuli is making him escalate. Sometimes Overall Plan turns to Fallback plan. Ethan is both the disruptive dynamic in the family and also the cement. “When you had a child like Ethan, bitterness was a constant temptation. It was always there, scratching at your door, trying to lure you to dark places.”“I love him…Every time I think I am incapable of love, I think about him. I think, man, I love him, like a pure love…Ethan kind of makes me normal. He makes me be nice. I’m not a nice person, but around him, I’m not that bad.”At first, when the story opens, I felt at arm’s length from Ethan. But, the author developed him so precisely and skillfully that, in the end, I felt that I’d known him his whole life. From his love of pickles, Sprite, basketball, family, Stinky Bear, and Cracker Barrel restaurants, to his terse, “Where. Mom. Be?” Go! Illini!” “Shut. Up. Idiot!” “Why? Mad?” and his various tics, traits, and his candid naïveté, I grew to know him intimately, as if I were a member of the Nichols family, too. He compelled them to see the worst in themselves, but he inspired them to be the best, too. And, now, John and family must come to terms with difficult decisions that stir emotions and generate heated conflict. What to do with Ethan was looming ahead; the family were at a crossroads. Divisive, indecisive. Coming together while they are almost falling apart required both courage and vulnerability. Finally, the long family journey comes to a satisfying end. Rolling thunder.

Cloud Atlas should have won the Booker that year; it was nothing short of a masterpiece. The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet and The Bone Clocks, while not quite up to the level of CA, were still extravagantly terrific novels in their own right. This latest, a novella, is a companion piece to BONE CLOCKS, residing in the same psychosoterica universe as the Horology section of the novel. SLADE HOUSE could work as a stand-alone, as it is a complete story. But, other than plot—a horror/supernatural/paranormal novella that had the weight and formula of a Stephen King book (and not King’s best, either), it was a pretty thin icing to frost the rest of his oeuvre. My question, in the end, is why did he publish it? I realize that the first story in SLADE HOUSE was tweeted from a short story Mitchell wrote called ""The Right Sort."" But that doesn't validate its worth or virtue, in my opinion. The novella consists of five stories, nine years apart, beginning in 1979. The rickety, Victorian Slade House is the centerpiece, where weird things happen. It’s difficult to tell any more of the plot without giving spoilers, because the story is mostly limited to the action, although the symbolism is derived from the Horology section of BC. There’s an interesting concept regarding lacunae, which provoked some thought about intervals and openings, a place out of time. The people who enter the house, as one may guess, are not quite the same once they’ve interacted with the forces inside. It was difficult for me to relate or have empathy with the characters, as they were fairly one-dimensional. Stephen King definitely has a leg up in that department. They did have some drawn characteristics, but they felt derivative rather than nuanced—the bullied but smart kid, the hardened cop with a heart, the vulnerable, overweight college girl, and so on. Moreover, Mitchell did some heavy info-dumping to move the plot along, which is generally a device used by writers who lack the very gifts that I know that Mitchell possesses. That was disappointing.As for the plot? It was adequate, but King has done it better, actually. I don't want to reveal which book(s) I would compare it to, because, as much as I did not enjoy this, I wouldn't want to disrupt the discovery process of the reader. SLADE HOUSE could also be a bit of (unnecessary) backstory to the supernatural section of BONE CLOCKS, but I didn't think BONE CLOCKS needed any buttressing. In the scheme of the entire book, the supernatural section of BONE CLOCKS worked. But, SLADE HOUSE is entirely too one-note, and mostly YA crossover. And, I expected Mitchell to be more nuanced than the straight-up good vs evil. I prefer some thought-provoking moral ambiguity.I do hope that the author isn’t planning on a future in straight up psychosoterica. Mitchell has proven himself to be a literary master of bending genre in previous works; this latest was all genre. Or, if he does go over to the “dark side,” I do hope it will be less pedestrian and rehashed than SLADE HOUSE. Moreover, I never felt scared or spooked. Maybe he just needed to get it out of his system, or possibly this is some dusty old trunk novel from his grad school days. Or…maybe he was just mining the lacuna....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Aug 29, 2015","Aug 29, 2015","Sep 25, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24499258-slade-house

The similarities of these two works are fewFor seven years, ever since I read Canin’s AMERICA AMERICA, I’ve been waiting for the author’s next novel. The similarities of these two works are few, but stand out: the downward spiral of alcoholism, and the exploration of family through the generations. But, while AMERICA AMERICA examines the price of political aspirations and fatal flaws in a family (with some parallels to THE GREAT GATSBY), THE DOUBTER’S ALMANAC is more insular by virtue of its subject. The life of a brilliant mathematician is candidly revealed in all its essence. By nature, mathematicians are often asocial, or on the spectrum of social disorders, and Milo Andret is, in some ways, a classic example of a socially awkward introvert. His son, Hans, is also brilliant, also a mathematician, who followed a different path, albeit with some of the same demons following him. This is their story.Part one, the first half, is the story of Milo. Part two is narrated by Hans, but is more expansive, about the effect of Milo on his family. Truth be told, there were a few times I wanted to give up in the first half. Although Canin creates an authentic atmosphere, with his knowledge of mathematics, topology, physics, and other related fields (it is imperative to substantiate the protagonist’s talents, otherwise it is disingenuous), the story periodically ground to a halt, with the excess of theorems and data. The obscure or esoteric information may have been integral to Andret’s character, but it also dragged the story down. Also, Andret's behavior patterns were reiterated too often, and it became almost stifling.Moreover, Andret’s alcoholism and heinous traits became alienating at times. Milo’s story became repetitive and often sequestered—and the author’s text so ponderous, labored, and verbose—that I questioned the desire to continue. In some ways, the stilted monotony reminded me of Joshua Ferris’s THE UNNAMED—a character who repeats his behaviors day after day, with no generous payoff to the reader. But, then again, I felt a spark, secreted and as yet undisclosed, that urged me to read on. Underlying the personal demons is the feeling of being irrelevant. As an exceptional mathematician, one is aware of the fact, mathematically, of irrelevance.“A molecule in the sea. An iota. That’s all he was. He’d spent the good part of his life angling for a single glance at nature’s scriptural code and yet was at every moment nothing more than an abject slave to its billions of unnamed postulates. That was the joke…It was in his nature to get jokes late.”Perhaps, part of the problem was the lack of levity. When something did have humor, it was typically sour, cynical, angry humor. A book of almost 600 pages can suffer when it’s all told through drama and earnest seriousness, especially when the narrator is telling a contemporary story about the vicissitudes of his family. But, in part two, the story picks up, and there was lightness through the darkest moments, maybe a sense of optimism at times. And the pace picked up, as it also captured and developed more characters, such as Andret’s wife and children, as well as Hans’s life as an adult with a wife and children. It allows for more reflection, too, in the latter section. The characters are sympathetic, relatable, in contrast to the first section of the book.This is predominantly a slow read, requiring patience. I am glad that I didn’t give into my temptation to skim; if I had, I would have missed the more nuanced temperament and texture of the second half. The gradual exposé and confession of a uniquely talented family unfolds, and the universal periods of torment and happiness that even undistinguished individuals can relate to are well demonstrated.“My life was all still nothing more than the world that had presented itself to me. And what had presented itself to me…seemed no more significant to my future than what I had experienced for all the years before.”If you stick with it, there are notable rewards. Along the way, there are some juicy passages.“His thoughts were the ship on whose prow he stationed himself while the ice-strewn seas leaped and dived below. They were matters of calculatedly outrageous assumption, elephantine diligence, missilelike prophecy, and an unending, unruly wager regarding their eventual worth; they were going to be attacked with branching, incremental logic, and met after months of toil…by either the maniacal astonishment of discovery or by the shame-tipped dart of folly…I knew it even as a teenager.”3.25...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Sep 21, 2015","Sep 26, 2015","Sep 21, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22318513-a-doubter-s-almanac

In darkly lush and shady colors, this noir-esque novel follows Robert, an aimless twenty-eight-year-old teacher from Sussex, as he intersects with several Khmer characters in Cambodia, as well as a charming American sociopath that befriends him. The alluring, extroverted Khmer woman that Robert meets in Phnom Penh fills his lonely days with desire and desired companionship. Little do they know what is on their periphery, closing in ever more steadily.Robert feels confined in his middle-class life in England, and often finds liberation in his travels, but now even all of Europe seems the same to him. In the opening of the novel, Robert has crossed the border from Thailand to Cambodia, and by good fortune wins $2,000 at a back-water casino. He’s decided to stay for a while and be a wandering ex-pat. Luck and chance underpin this novel in many ways, as does the intersection of cultures and different classes of people. This is the land still recovering from genocide by the Khmer Rouge, in which 25% of the population was extinguished in a few short years. It is a land believed by its people to be haunted by ghosts. Robert, who eschews the supernatural, will often be confronted by the significance of spirits.“Karma swirled around all things, lending them destinies over which mere desire had no control. It made one’s little calculations irrelevant.”And most of the characters are striving to gain by their calculations. The American, Simon, outwits Robert with opium and alcohol. A cash-poor driver, Ouska, with a handicapped wife, plans ways to make easy money, especially from tourists. Then there’s the corrupt policeman, Davuth, who attempts to fight back the troubling ghosts that haunt him back from when he was a member of the Pol Pot regime. He’s eternally on the take.As Robert settles into Phnom Penh, the reader is drenched in a kind of torpor, one that actually adds a penetrating suspense. It isn’t an edge-of-your-seat thriller, but its noir gloom is always pulling at the edges. The prose borders on the surreal at times, with its trance-like sluggishness that seduces with its elegant descriptions of earth and ennui:“Here the trees sticking out of the surface were white as bone and draped with creepers. Driftwood floated idly past them…strands of dark yellow flowers like garlands tossed from an abandoned wedding feast…the dead fish lying on their sides in the sun, the crowns of interlaced branches… …On the banks lay upturned little boats, knee-high shrines and men fishing with poles at the edge of pale and impenetrable mangroves.”The plot’s precision, and the characters that swirl lethargically around each other, create an intoxicating, humid atmosphere. The deliberately passive pace captured the stifling presence of things unseen, shadowed, and foreshadowed. But, however, lazily we get there, there is nothing lazy about this author, who can turn a meandering mood to sudden violence, and the twists are surprising and satisfying.

There are several overlapping themes, actually, but the polestar, in my perception, was about the duality of man, and how it antagonizes any presumption of moral absolution. The duality is demonstrated in many forms--literal and metaphorical.Moral absolutism, as ironically wielded with the title ""purity,"" was a philosophy of the Soviet State; one of the five main characters, perhaps the cardinal character, Andreas Wolf, grew up in Soviet Germany. Franzen illuminates sharply that when a population is forced to subjugate individualism to the Communist State, that these repressed feelings have to go somewhere. Intelligent people and outliers with rebellious natures are likely to act out their subversion in some way.Andreas Wolf, a brilliant individual and the son of privileged communist parents, struggles with a duality that never ceases, provoked by the Communist rule and his mother's rule at home. His repression and subsequent rebellion is key to the unfolding of the story. His mother, an intellectual and academic, has been the most poignant influence on his life, and has caused the most pain, but he sublimates his feelings about his mother, and the Soviet Mother, until he can't. When the Wall comes down, he becomes a celebrity icon and eventually a rival to Julian Assange, the Wiki leaks iconoclast.Now, it is the Internet that is the instrument of totalitarianism. The Internet's aim was to ""liberate"" humanity from the task of making things, learning things, or even remembering them. What had previously given meaning to life had been taken over by the Internet. And the Internet is now the formidable place for duality to flourish-- everyone can have an avatar, or present a different face to the public.""Who even cared about what a person's private thoughts about him were? Private thoughts didn't exist in the retrievable, disseminable, and readable way that data did. And since a person couldn't exist in two places at once, the more he existed as the Internet's image of him, the less he felt like he existed as a flesh-and-blood person. The internet meant death...""Andreas also has some toxic secrets that could derail him at any moment. ""There's the imperative to keep secrets, and the imperative to have them known...Sooner or later, the inside of you needs a witness.""There's Pip Tyler, the comely 20-something year-old with a $130,000 student debt, who literally doesn't know her origins--her real birth date, who her father is, or her mother's real name. She has been begging her mother her entire life to tell her, only to be shut down. Her adult quest in life is to find out the truth of who she is, and to find her father. In essence, she has been living a dual existence--the legitimate person she was born as is hidden away in her mother's secret compartment of sorts, and Pip is stuck with the lie. Her relationship with her mother is a mixture of love and resentment. She is currently adrift in aimless jobs and a dead-end life. When she gets an offer from Andreas Wolf to work for him up at his cult-ish nerd center in Bolivia, she is intrigued.Then there are Denver journalists Tom Aberrant, and his still-married long-term lover, Leila Helou, who, although not altogether against Internet journalism, still believe in the purity of boots-to-the-ground journalism. As we go back to details of Tom's early years with his ex-wife, Anabel, we are introduced to possibly the most entertainingly dysfunctional couple since anything that Philip Roth ever described. Anabel's moral absolutism, her insistence on a singular way of art and poverty, was a burden that Tom could neither live with or escape. Leila's husband Charles, the failed writer, keeps Leila tethered to him, also.Franzen mostly leaves the final dissections of character up to the reader, but there's no lack of ongoing paradoxes to explore human nature. ""And so I had to keep working with her to help her understand why I couldn't keep working with her."" Our inner contradictions and the dark parts of ourselves that wreak havoc on our lives are examined through our strengths that give way to our fallibility, and our fallibility that gives way to our strengths. Every character plays the Purity card in one way or another, but it is the Blemish one that keeps making them all so human.Although the themes are what make the story so tantalizing, Franzen also creates a combination domestic drama and thriller. Like a Venn diagram, the characters overlap and also circle each other throughout the novel. It is divided up into sections, and its non-linear construction works to intensify the drama at hand. Eventually, a seamless narrative is completed, one that is bittersweet and credible....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Sep 09, 2015","Sep 16, 2015","Sep 02, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23754479-purity

Or perhaps they just keep crossing my reading path, so I am inclined to compare them in some way (and they mostly seem to be British!). One similarity between Hadley and, say, Sarah Waters, THE PAYING GUESTS, or Rebecca Makkai’s THE HUNDRED YEAR HOUSE, is that all three novels are divided into three parts. I even titled my  of Makkai’s book “A generational triptych.” Hadley’s story is also a triptych, divided by “The Present,” “The Past,” and back to “The Present.” The three sections of Hadley’s book are bonded through family bonds, family secrets, marriage, and, of course, the house. The above titles are all very different books, but are all vested in family. And, Hadley, in THE PAST, demonstrates her chops in mastering the family drama and a flair for making her set piece come alive:“…the under-earth smell of imprisoned air, something plaintive in the thin light of the hall with its grey and white tiled floor…There was always a moment of adjustment as the shabby, needy actuality of the place settled over their too-hopeful idea of it.”At issue here is the house in the English countryside that may need to be sold, one that is rarely used. It has been in the Crane family for a while, but costs a small fortune to upkeep. Gathering there for three weeks together to discuss this uncomfortable and tension-mounting topic are the three middle-age sisters, Harriet, Alice, and Fran (only Fran is married, but her husband is not here with her children, and one wonders if there is some strain there), and the brother, Roland, with his third wife, a stunning, young, and intimidating Argentinian lawyer, Pilar, who makes the women feel quite dowdy in comparison. Alice also brings Kasim, the 20-year-old son of an ex-boyfriend, which is a feisty friction to upset the balance of sibling-ness, and to create frisson between Kasim and Roland’s teenage daughter, Molly. Moreover, the young and beautiful have brought pheromones into the house, which invariably provokes the envy and frustration of the sisters, some more than others. Too, the blossoming of young lust is igniting Harriet’s secrets, which she tries to keep hidden in a diary. She is almost acting like a teenager herself.The past provides substance and subtext for the present, and, in the second section, the reader is transported into 1968. This is probably my favorite section, and the now dead matriarch—the siblings’ mother, Jill, is the main character. I think that she is the most contoured and organically dimensional character in the novel, and this section’s events never seem forced. Even the children, who are often stylized in novels, have their own distinct and arresting personalities. In the throes of a 60’s revolution in Paris, Jill’s philandering husband has gone to participate and left her with three young children to care for. Although Jill has an Oxford education, her role is defined by unfair male standards. It is never heavy-handed as the imbalance is placed into sharp relief.“They had set out to have children as lightly as if they were playing house, and now her…domestic life bored him…The imbalance was fated, built into their biology.” “Tom had said once that anyone could do motherhood: in fact, he added, the less complicated you were, the better mother you would make. This was probably true, but not consoling.”Jill returns to her parent’s house—the house that is the set piece of the story—to initiate independence from her husband. She possesses a combination of pluck, cunning, and vulnerability, as she wrestles with both the youthful age she is soon leaving and the onslaught of middle age. And, in this section, the children demonstrate the seeds of who they will be as adults.As the novel spans generations, it also intertwines concepts of heredity. Although a subplot--of Pilar’s possible origins related to the Argentine “Dirty War,” is partly peripheral, and only briefly explored, it also serves as a metaphor for the meaning of family, bloodlines, and the curse of the outlier, or to have competing loyalties. Also, it resonates with the pain of shameful secrets.My complaints are few. Hadley, who satisfied me with quiet, nuanced strokes—I didn’t need a dramatic plotline—tried to add drama with a few of the climactic events that were just a bit contrived to me. Hadley also occasionally forced lift-off where none felt organically present. And, the sudden presence of a late-coming chracter seemed a bit too symbolically “meaningful.”Hadley’s confident prose is an instrument of quiet ferocity. She commands the page in almost every sentence, which made reading a pleasure. The more elegant her prose, the more interior the reader goes into the human condition.Thinks Alice at age 46, about never having children: “All those little eggs which were inside her when she was born: Alice imagined them like clusters of tiny pearly teeth, and the idea of them washing away one by one was a relief as well as a regret.” Eloquent and memorable....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Aug 31, 2015","Sep 02, 2015","Sep 02, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25241483-the-past

However, as is soon obvious, all of them will evolve and get what they deserve.Lately I've been drawn to English novels that take place around the years of the Great War. Like the genre-bending The Paying Guests, there's often an elegiac atmosphere reflecting loss and grief, and it is a time of great economic despair, and, in some cases, less of a financial chasm between classes then before the war. Moreover, women are gaining a foothold due to the suffragette movement, and their numbers in the work force are increasing. As shown in WE THAT ARE LEFT, the old vanguard is reluctant to change. Moreover, the air is ripe for social and domestic conflict, as citizens are forced to take inventory on their customs, and either retreat or move forward with the times. While Eleanor and Sir Aubrey are stubbornly rooted to the past, the children are mostly anxious to move on.The prose is strong, as Clark has a flair for figurative images, ""Death filled the house like dirty water, muffling sound,"" but the progress of the plot was quite predictable, with some grandstanding dialogue and overfamiliar tropes. And if I read one more early 20th century tale involving mediums and séances, I think I'll slam the book down. In this novel, the point was taken when the matriarch, Eleanor, burdened by the loss of her son, consults a clairvoyant, but it carried on too long, and too prepared, in an effort to illuminate the fads of the times. Some of the details and historical events were pleasant to encounter, but I never felt engrossed or surprised.Houses can make fine story centerpieces, as seen in THE HUNDRED YEAR HOUSE, by Rebecca Makkai.

However, as is soon obvious, all of them will evolve and get what they deserve.Lately I've been drawn to English novels that take place around the years of the Great War. Like the genre-bending THE PAYING GUESTS, there's often an elegiac atmosphere reflecting loss and grief, and it is a time of great economic despair, and, in some cases, less of a financial chasm between classes then before the war. Moreover, women are gaining a foothold due to the suffragette movement, and their numbers in the work force are increasing. As shown in WE THAT ARE LEFT, the old vanguard is reluctant to change. Moreover, the air is ripe for social and domestic conflict, as citizens are forced to take inventory on their customs, and either retreat or move forward with the times. While Eleanor and Sir Aubrey are stubbornly rooted to the past, the children are mostly anxious to move on.The prose is strong, as Clark has a flair for figurative images, ""Death filled the house like dirty water, muffling sound,"" but the progress of the plot was quite predictable, with some grandstanding dialogue and over-familiar tropes. And if I read one more early 20th century tale involving mediums and séances, I think I'll slam the book down. In this novel, the point was taken when the matriarch, Eleanor, burdened by the loss of her son, consults a clairvoyant, but it carried on too long, and too prepared, in an effort to illuminate the fads of the times. Some of the details and historical events were pleasant to encounter, but I never felt engrossed or surprised.If you've never read novels of this time period, or you are eager to replay the themes and set pieces of DOWNTON ABBEY, this may be a satisfying book for you. It's a nostalgic but, for me, too tidy endgame easily visible by the first third of the novel. Personally, I'd like to check out her earlier books, which were critical successes.

The wolf border.""In this evocative, met""She would like to believe there will be a place, again, where the streetlights end and the wilderness begins. The wolf border.""In this evocative, metaphorically rich, and sensual tapestry of language and landscape, Sarah Hall explores the context of borders--physical, personal, and psychological--through one woman's pivotal journey toward redemption. Forty-year-old zoologist Rachel Caine is returning to her native Cumbria, England, after working for over a decade in a wolf recovery project in Idaho. The enigmatic Earl of Annerdale, Thomas Pennington, has hired her to lead a wolf re-wilding project on his large estate, in the Lake District region, close to the Scottish border. He aims to re-introduce the grey wolf to England after over 500 years. He has the means, the money, the cunning, and the land. Rachel, after initially turning him down, finds herself at a critical crossroads in her life, due to changes requiring mature and decisive action.Rachel has been long estranged from her half-brother, Lawrence, and there's a fresh chance for reparation and connection. Their mother, Binny, with whom she's always had a difficult relationship, has just died, giving her space to return. Despite conflict, they shared a sex-only attitude toward men and a detached isolation from family. No love. No commitment. Boundaries were never to be crossed, the borders tight, the heart in exile. When her own rules of nature are breached, she leaves Idaho for home again, to face the ghosts of her past.""Annerdale appears like a myth out of the haze, a holy land, artificially made but gloriously convincing.""Hall mines nature and nurture together, suffusing the narrative with ancient and fable-like imagery, and with birth, death, borderlines, breaches, liminal spaces, and frontiers. Rachel is likened to the wolves in the story, even the way she lures men, has sex on all fours in a hunter's truck, the smell of blood from a deer carcass scenting the air. The wolves are almost mystic in nature, ""A dog before dogs were invented. The god of all dogs.""As the project progresses, the two wolves, Ra and Merle, move from a quarantined area to the expanded one, ready to mate. The public response to wolf reintegration is often one of hysteria, an ""almost biblical paranoia,"" the collective imagination one of fear. Moreover, the Scottish referendum is on the table--more analogies to borders, independence, interdependence-- and Hall invites more myth here as an alternate history plays out and braids poignantly into the story.The seasons are splendid in their descriptions, the setting made visceral. ""Buds and blossom; there's a sweet, spermy fragrance in the air, a scent both exquisite and intolerable."" There's a sense of the primitive, ""The snow begins to melt and the ice beneath reveals itself like broken glass, the weapons in a Saxon hoard, instruments of havoc."" Shifts in the earth, ""When the weather lifts, it feels as if a dire, convulsive event has passed: miscarriage or seizure."" And other-worldly: ""A fine rind of moon is cut out of the sky...above the horizon is the pale, near-derelict sun...She would not be surprised to see another set of moons studding the heavens...they have entered mythology, or a memory of religion.""The wolves, and Rachel, symbolize reclamation, restoration and the healing process that has begun. However, if you are seeking a wolf story, you may be disappointed. The predators form a framework for the larger story, which is one of family, forging intimacies, and the nature of borders. The wolves appear at the beginning, and the end, but in the body of the story, they serve as mostly background and symbolism.The plot is thin and secondary to theme, the conflicts quickly resolved along the way. The action is passive, and meanders, like the characters, but the tension mounts thrillingly toward the end. This is a book you gently chew, in small moments, and not devour, and the latency is part of its design. When I finished the last chapter, I felt I had crossed a threshold with Rachel, the reckoning complete. I won't say who the moral center is, even though it is only a minor spoiler to reveal a later character, but it's someone who compels Rachel to evolve. The old borders dissolve into junctures, the enclosures open, and the dark ghosts are liberated from final captivity....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Aug 14, 2015","Aug 18, 2015","Aug 22, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23315782-the-wolf-border

His latest, ICARUS, is another in the Benny Griessel series, and it may be his best, most sophisticated ever of his page-turning murder thrillers. Meyer’s characters continue to evolve with complexity, versus typical series, where the returning characters tend to become stale and stilted. His plot is as smart and sizzling as ever, the structure nimble and bifurcated, and his pace impeccable. Not only is the storytelling first class, but the South African landscape also comes vividly alive. Moreover, there are cerebral but provocative dimensions that earn ICARUS a spot in the thinking person’s crime novel. The dead body of Ernst Richter, a wealthy entrepreneur, is found in the Blouberg dunes on December 17th. Richter was Managing Director of a website called Alibi, that uses the latest in technology to create alibis for mate cheaters. If you need an alibi for a weekend getaway or night of passion, Alibi will provide cover, devising bills, receipts, airline tickets, texts, or whatever else is relevant. “All Pleasure. No Stress” is their motto. There’s also a parallel storyline involving viniculture and a deeply troubled family. As the chapters alternate between the search for the perpetrator, and the curious confession of a winemaker, the suspense ratchets up with a commanding and compelling deliverance. Prepare for an edge of your seat thriller that doesn’t let up until the very last page.Veteran Meyer readers are familiar with the Hawks team, South Africa’s Priority Crimes Investigative unit, an elite team of the best detectives. In the opening, lead detective Benny Griessel’s two-year sobriety is undone by tragedy--when a colleague kills his family and then himself. Vaughn Cupido then takes the helm as lead investigator of Richter’s murder, while he tries to cover for Benny’s bad behavior. Benny has reached a new bottom, one that could potentially ruin him permanently. Add to that a POI that is truly a person of romantic interest for Vaughn, one that puts the cupid in Cupido.The first line of the book crackles, stating how “heaven and earth conspired to expose Ernst Richter’s corpse, the universe seemingly intent on reaching out a helping hand for justice.” The next few passages describe the storm that moulded the dunes “like a blind sculptor” and eroded the sand away around the dead body’s feet. The passages have an almost mythical thrum to them, with the forces of flood and climate playing a role in revealing the body. Interestingly, the myth of Icarus refers to the son of Daedalus, who flew too close to the sun on wings of feathers and wax. When the sun melted his wings, Icarus plunged into the sea.The drama is also balanced with levity, which the author has always handled with poised impudence. Major Mbali Kaleni is back, the food-obsessed and take-no-prisoners boss who is now on a cauliflower diet. The redolence that follows her throughout the novel is priceless. Her character is nuanced, sympathetic, strong, and quirky, leaving room for comic relief:“…an argument with Mbali was like a Sumo wrestling match – you could never get a decent grip, and afterwards, it left you all sweaty and unsatisfied.” Meyer certainly has his finger on the pulse of high tech wizardry, but he blends it in so well that even a technophobe wouldn’t get bored. The information on hacking and the back doors of software buzzes with intrigue and espionage, as the threat of a leak of high profile celebrity and government names using Alibi is imminent. The floundering, remaining personnel of Alibi must cooperate with the Hawks in order for the crime to be solved and collateral damage kept to a minimum. And, the winemaker’s story builds momentously with the Richter investigation, so that I was unable to tear myself away as the denouement drew closer.Kudos to Meyer’s map of pertinent landmarks on the inside covers, and I always enjoy the inclusion of Afrikaans lexicon. For example, fyndraai is a special visit, lekker is luscious, and fokkit is, well…And round of applause to K.L. Seegers for a pace-perfect, dynamite translation.“The heart of the matter is, I can’t be Vaughn the Terrible, if you aren’t Benny the Sober.

He removes and sells the parts by the pound. In this dystopian future, “The remainder of a city within the city…A century of reinforced concrete and red brick and steel crossbeams…their torn and opened fences made an invitation to the gutting,” the landscape is an urban area of waste and disuse described as “destruction porn.” A few people still live here, but most have moved to more habitable areas. Kelly, however, is running away from his past, and punishing himself for crimes later revealed. Working in the zone is a way to wrestle with his conscience. He left his lover and her son in the South (unnamed place) and lives as a loner, until he meets a woman, Jackie, a police dispatcher with a noticeable limp due to degenerative disease. However, her crippled body houses a guardian spirit, an irony not lost on the reckless, hollowed out anti-hero.This fabled tale is about redemption--of the darkest parts of the soul, and the bleakest aspects of society. Bell’s harrowing landscape symbolizes the collapsed morality buckling under end-stage hope. Kelly believes in two parts of the self—the violent scrapper and the righteous salver, and it is these two halves he tries to reconcile, to undo the damage in a world fraught with pain. When he finds a kidnapped boy chained in a basement in one of the zone’s abandoned houses, Kelly is determined to find and confront the person who did this, and, in a twisted way, redeem his own errors and those of his father, and his father’s father before him.This is where the story breaks down for me. The prose, while sometimes piercing and filled with metaphors of devastation and misery, is just as often reworked clichés written in declarative sentences, and leans toward self-conscious.“There were no space spaces except those you made yourself. Safety could not be granted. Safety was the absence of anyone stronger or weaker. And always there was someone stronger or weaker, someone greater than, less than. The only true safety was the deepest kind of loneliness and for a time Kelly had chosen it.”“…and the man who cried said the suffering of the individual had been eclipsed by the suffering of the masses. Eartquakes in Haiti, tsunamis and nuclear devastation in Japan. Genocides in Africa…” etc, “All I’m saying, the man who never cried said, is that there are whole cities falling into the ocean, whole species going extinct…We’re here wailing about a single human life. He said, I love my wife but she’s the equivalent of a thousand starving children…”The text labors on these prosaisms where it isn’t necessary, but is murky where it needs to be more transparent. The narrative breadth reached its limit way before the author intended it to. In other words, the furnishings and philosophies are repeatedly expounded upon, the author hammering home a point that was already obvious. But the manifestation of actual events is inevitably banal, however padded, and the author gluts the reader with yet another extraneous meditation on doom. I get the sense that Bell was aiming to stretch out a thin story with a grand theme, but I became weary. He was trying too hard for effect, and the prose, which echoed Cormac McCarthy but lacked the master’s immaculate precision, was used as compensation for a strained story. And, sometimes, the overuse of non-specific pronouns, such as “he,” or descriptors, such as “the girl with the limp,” “the man who cried,” etc. seems superfluous, as if the redundancy is supposed to imply additional weightiness.Moreover, Bell’s plot unfolds evasively, even confusedly, with provocative but intended complementary events concerning the music rapper Mos Def and his visit to a detainee in Guantánamo; a scene with Michael Zimmerman in Florida, and a scene near Chernobyl in Russia. But it came off as overreaching, or gratuitous, almost like filler standing in for fullness. When the story does reach its apex, and Kelly decides on a specific act, it is an act that, to me, contorted the rest of the story, made it nearly insensate.The story searches for atonement in an inhumane world, a place where base desires and lawless atrocities have eclipsed hope and kindness, where corruption and evil have subjugated decency and rectitude. I felt that the author led us there, to reparation, but then it inevitably became pointless. Occasionally I felt inside of the zone where justice is weighed at a cost, but at other times, it seemed I was just standing there with scraps....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Aug 03, 2015","Aug 04, 2015","Aug 06, 2015",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/24388514-scrapper

The yearly spectacle, “’One million individual bulbs and strips of neon,’” the lights on the promenade are a metaphor to the illusion present in the lives of its main characters, and the artificial sunshine of their past. It’s a meditation on memory and mirage, fact and fiction.There’s Anne, the 82-year-old woman living at a sheltered residence flat in Scotland, and suffering from dementia. Blackpool is a place of her young and robust years, one that is gradually revealed at the end of the story. At one time in the sixties, she was part of a revolutionary group of young British documentarian photographers. She remembers her past as like the Blackpool illuminations—a halo glow, especially when referring to Harry, the love of her life, a man who also taught her photography.Anne’s grandson, Luke, a captain in the 1st Royal Western Fusiliers, has just returned from a failed mission in Afghanistan— to bring a turbine to the Kajaki dam, one that would help pump fifty-one megawatts of electrical power to the Afghan people--again the illuminations metaphor. The book highlighted Luke’s adventures with his fellow soldiers, getting high on weed, arguing about metal music, and dealing with a burnt-out, unbalanced commander. The mission went awry, and Luke alas, is suffering from disillusionment. In fact, he and his buddies believed that the virtual reality of video games was more real than desert combat.Before joining the army, Luke was a scholarly young man who loved to read. This is a trait that he shared with his grandmother. His mother, Alice, has always had a distanced relationship with Anne. There’s enough family dysfunction to go around, and then there’s Anne’s primary helper, Maureen, a straw character, essentially, to bring out Anne’s secret past and the story of her photos.At the start of the story, I was enchanted. O’Hagan had a knack for juxtaposing—no, almost surreally painting—a portrait of Anne’s dementia against the theme of the novel, which is the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of our lives, the narratives we construct—sometimes artificially—to reconcile the lives we chose to live. This premise, which is lucent and brilliantly rendered from the beginning of the story, hooked me immediately. However, once the story focused on Luke’s mission, it became inauthentic. The brio, language, brotherhood, and bonhomie, as well as the rage, ribaldry, and repartee of the soldiers became as artificial as the Blackpool Illuminations. I just didn’t buy it—it felt like O’Hagan did a shallow treatment of men on a mission, and gave us a theatrical version, one that may look good on the video games he talked about, but just as unreal. In fact, I thought it troubling that the author expounded on the curse of technology today—how these soldiers felt more battleborn in video games than in actual missions, and then turned around and gave the squadron just as much fakery, especially the heavy-handed reach of working-class dialogue.O’Hagan utilizes contrast and opposition as a working device for the story, which underscores the theme, such as, in photography “to work with contrast not only to get at life but to enhance it.” The contrast between the video games and reality, and the disparity between lucidity and dementia, are woven into the premise. He also uses photography itself as a metaphor: “…he understood that new light isn’t good for old film,” meaning that the present distorts the past, and to mine the past through the lens of the present will reveal some self-deceptions.Some of the novel worked for me, when it focused on Anne and the family story. But, as Luke’s commander too pithily said, “People who read books aren’t reading them properly if they stop with the books. You’ve got to go out eventually and test it all against reality.” The book periodically failed the reality test for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 30, 2015","Aug 02, 2015","Jul 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22536793-the-illuminations

In this context, theNigeria is the second most religious country in the world, and women can be stoned to death for even speaking of lesbian desires. In this context, the gay protagonist of Okparanta's novel, Ijeoma, must express her true sexuality in a clandestine manner, or risk losing her life. Told partly in the style of a folkloric narrative, with fables and biblical quotes blended into the text, the author tells an emotional coming-of-age story of love and the search for independence. Told against the backdrop of the Nigerian civil war in the late 60's, and on through Ijeoma's adulthood through the post-war 80s, the struggle for personal sovereignty and living an authentic life is at the heart of the tale.Ijeoma's and her parents live in a gated compound in Ojoto, in late 1960's Biafra, at the time that Biafra is a secessionist state in eastern Nigeria and is in the throes of the civil war. As a child, I remember being horrified and tearful at the sight of PSAs depicting starving children in Biafra suffering from malnutrition. Ijeoma's father dies when she is only eleven, provoked by despair. Mother and child go from privileged to poor, barely surviving the losses. Ijeoma's mother is comforted by the Bible, whereas Ijeoma is even more drawn to the folk tales and fables her father used to tell her.Her mother sends her off to Nnewi to live with a grammar school teacher and his wife, promising to come collect her once she resettles, ""maybe just a few days."" To a girl of eleven, it felt like abandonment. ""In a warped, war-induced sort of way, it made sense that she should...shed us all: the soldiers, me, and the house. To shed, if she could have, all memories of the war. To shed, and shed, and shed. Like an animal casting off old hair or skin. A lizard. A snake. A cat or a dog... ...To shed us all like a bad habit."" A motif of the story--to shed--is used in several ways, not just the shedding of war, but also of the old traditions.Ijeoma is left in Nnewi for two years, a trying time that is relieved by her new friend, Amina. Ijeoma is Igbo, and Amina is Hausa, which made no difference to the two girls, much to the chagrin of the adults, but soon the grammar school teacher and his wife accept Amina into their home. Over time, the girls form a special bond, as friends, and then toward a forbidden, same-sex love. When they are caught, Ijeoma is finally sent back to reunite with her mother, who is determined to purge her daughter's sexual orientation with biblical intervention.Told in a non-linear narrative, the story contrasts the mother's strident, impassioned biblical teachings and Ijeoma's recognition of her own desires. Her mother wants to rid Ijeoma of her ""abominations,"" a word that becomes ingrained in Ijeoma's mind, influencing her decisions, weakening her resolve. Yet, the bible does not console her; in fact, it leads her to question the meaning of the stories and allegories. For example, how can Lot offer his daughters up to other men to do what they want with them, just to prevent ""man lying with man""? But, Ijeoma's mother clings to the adherence of a cruel persecution of a minority population (homosexuals), despite being persecuted herself during the war, as her family and home were shattered by defeat. She doesn't recognize her cognitive dissonance, so limited is she by a harsh, rigid belief.As the story progresses with a compassionate and vital energy, the reader is taken on a courageous journey of a woman who is fighting for love, family, personal justice, and a sense of inner peace. Okparanta, in this touching novel, gives voice to the many Nigerians who have been forced to go into hiding. She speaks up for love, in different forms.""Yes, it had been Adam and Eve...Why did that have to exclude the possibility of a certain Adam and Adam or a certain Eve and Eve?...Woman was created for man, yes. Did that mean that woman could not also have been created for another woman? Or man for another man?...So why should other stories in the Bible"" (referring to allegories) ""not be conducive to allegorical treatment as well?""...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jul 27, 2015","Jul 28, 2015","Jul 27, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23719408-under-the-udala-trees

Although I haven't read Corelli's Mandolin, I was predisposed toward this book by the description of its contents. At first, the whimsical style bothered me, as the narrative dizzyingly described the death of Queen Victoria and the coronation of Edward VII, and jumped to the McCosh family. But, I stuck with it and saw that the waggish, declarative sentences were deliberately disproportionate to the more serious and tragic events they described. The style was a rather Dickensian approach, although the focus is on a privileged family that, for the most part, is sympathetic to the social inequality wrought by the devastation of WW I. In fact, except for the matriarch, I think it bordered on the (too) politically correct, with Mrs McCosh being the stereotypical class-conscious snob, a counterpoint to the rest of the family, who too easily adjusted to the changes in custom between the classes after the war. It was the servants who were reluctant to accept this change, thereby attributing eclectic manners to the once sheltered and posh McCosh's.The central McCosh family in Eltham is joined by the two families living on either side of them, an American family, the Pendennises, as well as another British family, the Pitts (well, half-British and half French). The kids become ""the Pals,"" starting in childhood. The McCosh's only have daughters, four of them, and the other families only have sons, and the young men's enlistment in the war allows for the adventures and tragedies of the times to personally affect all three families. The reflection of the women on their embattled men is often funereally fine-grained. ""And let's face it, he's an aviator. They don't last much longer than a meteorite, do they? That's what they are, meteorites waiting to hit the ground. Aviators are born to be a beautiful memory, like a poppy whose petals are ripped away in a storm.""The pivotal theme here is loss--the loss of loved ones and the loss of an era. Amidst a rich and well-defined landscape, the key character that emerges becomes obdurate with grief. This grief becomes all-consuming, developing into a defense mechanism, and even a weapon against living in the present. Although I am utterly sympathetic to the shattering consequences of death to the living, this character cultivated mourning with a stubborn religious adherence. I suppose the reader was intended to be frustrated, but at a certain point, it felt idle and cloying. What surprised me more was how it was dealt with so cannily toward the end of the book, a facile convenience that undermined all that preceded it, despite or because of the former attention that was given this character.Suspending disbelief was problematic for me at several turns. Certain hot-button topics that are controversial today--class war, racial issues, same-sex pairing, and gender bias, were mollified to the point of contrivance. The author chose safe and inoffensive sentiments, dodging a landmine of polemic views by either avoiding them or selecting the ones at a remove from the 21st century. For instance, Mrs. McCosh made derogatory statements regarding the French, but the prejudice towards Muslims and Indians were mitigated throughout the novel. The erstwhile concerns that extend to the problems we face today were inorganically diluted, in my opinion. This weakened the overall effect of the text.However, some exquisite, heart-breaking passages touched me to the core. Often, de Bernières humanized the German soldiers, and I think this was his most nuanced touch in the narrative. For example, trying to bury a fellow Allied soldier while in the trenches: ""Already five graves there, soldiers planted like vegetables, against the day of harvest...Private who'd been ordained, recited burial service...very loud and clear, so Huns would hear us. Boche tenor with beautiful voice responded, sang Brahm's Lullaby again.... Will haunt me/make me think thoughts almost too large...laid to rest by his brothers, sung to rest by a Hun."" The laments of death are universal, and the juxtaposition of mutual grief and mortar shells was horribly beautiful.The domestic battles felt feigned, but the combat in the air and in the trenches, and the crushing endurance of the men, was harrowing and credible. But there were chapters, such as flying ""aces"" and their planes, that went into such detail that only a WW I plane-hobbyist would stay captivated. These digressions fatigued me and distanced me from the drama at hand, which, in my opinion, needed way more fortification than the blow-by-blow bits about aeroplanes.The author's blend of the serious and witty was often sly. For example, an Anglican young woman hides her rosary and Madonna that give her comfort, and reaches for them in her inconsolable grief: ""She stared into the face of her plaster Madonna, and then into the eyes of the somewhat adult-looking baby Jesus. She put the statuette down, and bowed her head."" In a few sentences, the author shows how these idols console the forlorn, and yet pokes a little fun at these symbols of comfort and faith.After the war, the author lost me several times, the discursive prose distancing me. De Bernières was poignant with the nature of death, but the characters that remained appeared in and out of focus at various times, and parts of the sprawling cast and subplots often got dropped or handily managed. De Bernières can craft a beautiful passage, and there were some characters that touched me at the start, but I felt unsatisfied at the end. The aspects that bothered me may not bother other readers, and if you were a fan of Corelli's Mandolin, I suspect you may be drawn to the author's rich landscape and his story of redemption during difficult times....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jul 23, 2015","Jul 24, 2015","Jul 25, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25722634-the-dust-that-falls-from-dreams

In A Banquet ofThis is my first Elizabeth George book, and I am eager to read any more of them that combine traditional novel with a detective story. In A Banquet of Consequences, the first third or so of the book is pure novel. Had I not known George’s reputation, I never would have anticipated a police procedure with returning characters. The author did a superb job of combining the two different genres—in fact, this felt like a story that eclipsed genre altogether.For those of you already familiar with the Lynley series, you will recognize the brash but bright Barbara Havers, a detective with a history of impudence, who has been professionally scolded and threatened with a post to some back berg if she doesn’t toe the line. Havers has a charming (to readers) way of bucking authority. Her partner, Tommy Lynley, was born with blueblood breeding, and is ever the diplomat. He is in love again, after mourning the death of his wife for eighteen months. But, the woman he loves, Daidre, is reticent, and certainly enigmatic. I suspect there is more to her than meets the eye, and more for future books to explore.In this novel you’ll meet an unforgettably dysfunctional family in Dorset, England, with an alarmingly enigmatic matriarch. There’s Will, a whiz at landscape gardening, with a deformed ear and what seems to be a bad case of Tourette’s Syndrome—at least, the verbal aspect of it (but the diagnosis isn’t stated-they just say his Words)—he is in love with Lily Foster, a tattoo artist, who is happy with him in London, away from his interfering mother. Will’s brother, Charlie, is the psychotherapist which brings to mind, Doctor, heal thyself. His estranged wife India, an acupuncturist, has begun dating again. The problem with both men? Their meddling mother, Caroline, a strident, arrogant, possessive master manipulator, who manages to interfere with her sons’ lives so much that their relationships become difficult. Her long-suffering husband, Alastair, who owns several successful bakeries, raised the two boys like they were his own. Her ex-, a plastic surgeon, is remarried and happy to be away from her wiles.Then there is Clare Abbott, a confident celebrity feminist with a popular book that is all the rage in England and even beyond. Caroline met her via The Women’s League, and has managed to impose herself on Clare and make herself indispensable to her as some vaguely defined assistant. She seems to be in a battle of wills or jealousy with Clare’s publisher, Rory. Rory has a tragic past she is still coping with, and her small dog, Arlo, is her assistance dog, allowed to be with her at all times. Rory and Clare have developed a close friendship over the years, and Rory finds Caroline’s behavior to be intrusive.The book seamlessly alternates between London and Dorset (Shaftesbury), with a bit of Cambridge thrown in, and a few other places in the countryside. The story, of course, must open itself to a rather serious crime, as Inspector Lynley and Sergeant Havers are on the case. It has levity, too, as the secretary, Dorothea Harriman, attempts to do a makeover on Havers, even taking her shopping for a new wardrobe. Barbara is fairly stubborn, and feels caught in wanting to keep her job, but having to capitulate to a point where she isn’t herself any more. Lynley is the mediator between Havers and the Superintendent, Isabelle Ardrey; he and Adrey have a bit of a brief, torrid past. That’s the long and short of this , as I don’t want to reveal what happens to bring the law aboard. I was blown away by the end of the book, I will say that!My only problem with coming to a series late is that I now know certain key things about the characters that happened in the past. I know that Tommy’s wife was murdered, and that Barbara Havers has been on the chopping block (likely explained in previous books). So, when I go back to read the earlier books, and read about Lynley squiring Helen, I’ll think of her as dead before they are even married. And I’ll know that Havers is headed for trouble at work. But, such is the case when you arrive late. George is otherwise circumspect about earlier cases. She certainly can’t hide certain facts, but I am hoping to go back and read her earlier books with blinders going in.In summary, if you like a good, juicy, horrifying domestic drama, as much as or more than a detective story, go for this one. You won't be disappointed.

You don't read him for plot, and the story/characters are sometimes self-referential, or meta- sized; he will refer to characters or concerns that poke at previous novels, or even subtly refer to himself as he is perceived by other writers or critics. This is one novelist, I believe, whose novels can't be fully valued in isolation. To wholly appreciate Banville is to read his entire oeuvre. However, this is a  of just one Banville novel by a er who has read only some of his books. I can only give you this limited lens; for those of you who have read his entire works, please excuse my inadequacies.THE BLUE GUITAR is a portrait of Oliver Orme, a short, squat, married, middle-aged man, an inveterate pilferer of other people's things, and a poacher of another man's wife. Over the years, Oliver has morphed from an artist of some fame to a self-serving egoist who now calls himself the ""painster,"" because he feels failed and frustrated as an artist. He's a navel-gazer, a confessor to the reader, a solipsistic bag of gusty, restless wind, a man who runs away when the heat is on him, but is yet sympathetic. Long ago, he and his wife lost their three-year-old daughter to illness. He's a man falling down, and a thief who hasn't been caught. Acquisition, art, loss, and grief, and the power of the imagination to transform reality--these are the themes I take away from this novel.Throughout the book, Orme describes repeatedly, in forensic prose, the reason he quit painting. It boils down to his frustrating attempts to get to the essence of what he paints. He is obsessed with that liminal, ungraspable place between the material world and the representation of it, and it extends to his greater philosophy of experience, and his inability to find sanctuary and inner resolve. Oliver steals objects he doesn't need in order to reactivate the object's luminescence (essence), asserting that these objects have lost their glow, and lie inert in the owner's hands. He believes that when he ""purloins"" them, he transforms the impotent object with a renewed vitality.""It's as if a single thing by being stolen were on the instant made in two: the thing that before was someone else's and this not quite identical thing that now is mine. It's a kind of...transubstantiation...""Oliver ponders concepts that link love and stealing, or art and love, or sometimes stealing and loss. Throughout this vacillating narrative, and the protagonist's agitated wheedling, Banville brilliantly pivots from the jocular to the melancholy, as the hapless Oliver waxes wildly about his indiscretions--""I did steal her, picked her up when her husband wasn't looking, and popped her in my pocket. Yes, I pinched Polly; Polly I purloined."" Almost imperceptibly, though, the author can segue from playful to melancholy, the restive Oliver arrested by loss. ""Everything seemed hollow, hollow and weightless, like those brittle casings of themselves that dead wasps leave on window-sills at the dusty end of summer. Grief was flat, in other words, a flat dull empty ache.""And of his sequestration to his childhood home, Oliver laments: ""Here it is forever the past, here I am stalled, stilled here, cocooned; I need never move again until the moment comes for the great and final shift.""The book is a dissection of Oliver through Oliver's fractured psyche, and a potent perception of art. He's an unreliable narrator who nevertheless reveals by dissembling, his voice a fallen mask. ""How treacherous language is, more slippery even than paint."" Panic and sorrow underscore Oliver's trenchant memories, even when he tries to play the bumbling foil.In the first half, once Oliver's persona was established, I felt that that the author lingered a bit too much, and the pace became static, the narrative redundant. The prose was unparalleled, outstanding, but at times I felt that Banville indulged in his verbal linguistics and left the reader exhausted with his doomed protagonist. However, he gradually brought me back to the story. Although contemporary, I felt like I was in the midst of a Victorian setting--perhaps in a painting by his fictional painter, Jean Vaublin, whose name is a quasi-anagram of his own. But, even when Banville is writing for himself, I'll wait for him in the gloaming....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jul 19, 2015","Jul 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25241497-the-blue-guitar

Fossum, who was a poet before a mystery writer, suffuses the tragic story with fertile images and paces her stories with a pulse that keeps the pages turning. Word of caution: the jacket summary reveals crucial plot points that occur at the midpoint of the story. Don’t read it if you don’t want major spoilers.The series’ regular inspectors, Konrad Sejer and Jakob Skarre, are investigating the drowning of a sixteen-month-old baby boy born with Down’s Syndrome. Babies born with Down’s have physical and cognitive delays, and will need adult supervision (variable) for the rest of their lives. Tommy’s parents, Carmen and Nicolai, are only nineteen and twenty, respectively. Carmen never had the prenatal screening that would have detected this chromosomal disorder, so they were ill-prepared for the news at birth. However, they received loving support from Carmen’s parents, and didn’t have to face the demands alone.Tommy’s body was retrieved by Carmen in a pond fifty meters from the house. She called EMS, but resuscitation efforts failed. There was no fence or other barricade to thwart easy access to the pond from the house, and in the heat of Oslo’s exceptionally hot summer, Carmen had kept the door open, and left Tommy’s sight for a few minutes to go to the bathroom. In a flood of hysterical tears, the young mother admitted that she was guilty of taking her eyes off Tommy momentarily, and failed to consider that he might wander outside to the jetty and fall into the pond. Nicolai had reportedly been in the basement, repairing a bike.THE DROWNED BOY, as usual in a Fossim book, is more than a mystery. It is a study in human behavior, and how people cope with grief and loss. Her witnesses, even when unlikable, are sympathetic and complex. The key suspect here is Carmen, whose story is plausible, but there’s something in her demeanor and her “artificial” waterworks that give the inspectors pause. Along the way, the author candidly discusses the challenge of raising a special needs child. The narrative also considers the moral controversy of terminating a pregnancy if you know in advance that your baby has Down’s. The topic is handled delicately and honestly, without authorial intrusion.The principle mystery for the police to solve is whether Carmen, or Carmen and Nicolai, purposely drowned their boy. It isn't easy to disprove a plea of innocence when there are no other witnesses, so it is paramount for Sejer and Skarre to examine every detail and look for inconsistencies. The autopsy results provide answers, but also provoke more questions.Carmen is strong-willed and determined, ready to move on to the future. Nicolai, however, is buried in grief. Their marriage is faltering, as they cannot understand each other's mourning. There's enough guilt to go around about not erecting a fence (the grandfather thought there was plenty of time), but the reader feels an undercurrent of panic and a murmur of secrets.Sejer's grief for his dead wife, and his new worry about recent dizzy spells, parallels and intensifies the theme of loss, and the dread of the unknown. The last page is chilling, and in the hands of a lesser author, would come off as contrived.

Many suffered great loss or were marginalized as children, and thus developed a desire to help other emotionally damaged individuals. This is not unlike Forster’s protagonist, Julia, a child psychologist. Julia’s father died when she was five, and her mother, although present, was emotionally unavailable at best. “Best not to ask anything” was her mother’s mantra, so Julia learned to cope as a child via isolation and obedience. Later, when negative emotions overwhelmed her, she reacted with secret transgressions, and one innocent rebellion that caused her life-long guilt. At 48, after seeing a photograph of herself as an eight-year-old bridesmaid, Julia suffered the worst kind of cognitive dissonance. This bridesmaid was a stranger to her now, and unknown bridesmaid.As a psychologist, Julia assesses troubled young girls. The sulky and truculent clients don’t vex Julia; she sympathizes with them, and has valuable insight into their problems. “Everything, in every person’s life, led back to childhood, a truism which she’d found could not be stressed enough.” Like herself, many of the girls were injured by a callous mother, and Julia recognizes this. Despite Julia’s crimes and misdemeanors, her hardened heart is merciful, softer in the center. She’s dismal and damaged herself, but intriguing and complicated.The novel alternates back and forth between Julia’s failed childhood and her successful adult years, with an ineluctable collision and confrontation of both. Foster’s tightly restrained prose gradually peels away Julia’s protective barriers and her barely controlled panic. Underscoring this is a sense of dread. My only complaint is that the frisson of excitement I felt throughout the narrative, anticipating an electric denouement, fizzled a bit at the end.

(Does any other word capture the past, present, and future like ""before""?!) The novel is about the past holding the present hostage, while the future hangs in the balance.One hundred years ago, at the former Whitmore Hospital for Convalescent Lunatics in England, two men and one woman walk out the door, but only the men return. The woman, known only as N, remains a riddle. Thirty-four-year-old Jane Standen, an archivist at a museum that is imminently closing, has been obsessed with finding out who N is, ever since she read the logbook entries of the trio's escape. Her preoccupation with N is tied to a tragedy in her own life. When Jane was 15, five-year-old Lily Eliot went missing while in her care, in the same woods shared by the former asylum. A recent encounter with Lily's father has provoked her to run away and hide, incognito, to Inglewood, where it happened, and try to unravel the identity of N. Jane, held blameless for the little girl's disappearance, is nevertheless haunted by the past, and can't let go or move on to a full and meaningful life. She hopes that solving one mystery will put the other one at rest.The material world here is poignant, and Hunter describes the individual pieces that Jane archives with such clarity and divination that they take on a larger meaning, such as:""...the receipts for roses, inventories tucked into books, even sherry glasses or cigar boxes or the worn clasp on a velvet band--are enough to conjure whole lives.""Beyond the material is the invisible, a huddle of voices symbolic of a Greek chorus, but supernatural. Hunter's spiritual world represents and connects history to Jane's personal purgatory, her inertia due to memories that clamp its hands around her neck. Jane thinks history is a static place that sits between now and then, fixed and immutable. These agents of the past know better:""History is shifty; it looks out for itself, moves when you least expect it.""Hunter's brilliant and unique device is so convincing that it feels organic. The voices are a witness to the past, and possess a vibrant presence of the collective consciousness. The past comes to bear on the present, whether we repress or deny these memories. ""We feel a sense of having done this before every time, though we are uncertain whether this sense comes from the repetition of the act itself or an echo from some other point in our lives."" The narrative suggests that the present is influenced by an extant presence of the past. This affects our attention to what is currently in our path, that which surrounds us. ""After all, every presence has a kind of weight, something felt: moods and shifts and feelings, a steady pulse of being.""Occasionally, I wanted the author to jettison the voices and get on with Jane, whose story was the most compelling. But, as we are able to predict, the intersection of lives and former lives connect to the missing and the left behind, the visible and the hidden. Memories clot together and form a history. You can't escape it, although perceptions of the past may be unreliable. ""It doesn't matter that memories can sometimes be misshapen, that there are a hundred ways to fix or lose a sense of self.""Along the way, the reader is blessed with beautiful prose, a glimpse into the lives of a privileged Victorian family--and their peccadillos--as well as events that tarnished their happiness. As a psychiatric nurse, I was also intrigued by the routines and mini-dramas of the asylum residents. In the end, all the threads come together brilliantly. The author creates a melancholy contemplation of memories, and its yoke on the present.""It was as if we were knots in a net that could take different shapes at different times. As if we might, one day, loop back on ourselves, come so close to the past we'd be able to taste the dust of our history in our mouths.""...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 10, 2015","Jul 12, 2015","Jul 10, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22716411-the-world-before-us

His women are fully dimensional and intelligent, and a combination of rare and familiar. In this, his bildungsroman of a woman growing up in the war years, he takes us with Amory to London, Berlin, New York, Paris, the Vosges, the Rhineland, Vietnam, California, and Scotland. The journeys of Amory Clay shaped her consciousness; her father's influence shaped the journeys of her heart.Amory Clay was born in the Edwardian Era in England, in 1908, in Hampstead Heath, and moved with her family to East Sussex while very young. This is her story, told from the pages of her Barrandale Journals (Scotland) in 1977, at the age of 69, looking back at her life with a matured lens, and alternating with a linear-ish self-portrayal from girlhood to her present time. The book is divided by eight Books, separated by years, such as 1908-1927, or 1968-1977, and each book is sub-headed by titled chapters, such as “LIFE IS SWEET,” “BERLIN,” and “D-Day.”Amory is fictional, of course, but she leaps off the pages so vividly that you can hear the ice tinkling in her glass and see the smoke curling from her cigarette. She was always a forward-thinking individual, very much herself, and a keen observer. It was a pleasure to be inside her head for over 400 pages, and see the world from her sharp, adventurer’s eyes.When Amory was seven, in 1915, her uncle Greville, a veteran and photo-reconnaisance observer in the Royal Flying Corps (now a society photographer), introduced her to her first camera, a Kodak Brownie No. 2. This was the beginning of a love affair with photography, one that subsequently gave her access to high society, iconic events, and the brutalities of war(s). Amory’s life unfolds within the backdrop of a tumultuous and dynamic history, a bygone era lived by a modern woman.The turning point of Amory’s life was a shocking event ignited by her father, a struggling writer, and a soldier of the Great War. When he came home after the war to his wife and three children, he was severely damaged by events he would not disclose—we would call it PTSD in our era. I’ll let readers discover on their own what happened. However, on page three, a foreshadowing:“Was that why he tried to kill me later, I wonder…?”In fact, Amory often reveals, in a few circumspect words, future occurrences, but in the hands of Boyd, it doesn’t alter the later pleasure of disclosure. Instead, it piques our interest and adds to the development of plot and character. Likewise, Amory’s relationship with her father informs her future relationships with men.Boyd's narrative of Amory's life flickers with a vintage patina--just enough to distinguish the era. She’s not defined as a feminist or bohemian, but Amory was radiant, with dishy social skills and a fluid intellect; she didn’t capitulate to men in her work. She’s au courant with a touch of the droll, a hint of the Bacall, but not a mock-me-up stereotype. Amory is complex, with an agile, resourceful sensibility. Even during the years that she was stuck doing weddings or cheesy portraits, she continued to build her portfolio on the side. In her love life, Amory made some unfortunate choices, but she was savvy—she didn’t bury her head in the sand when she carried on a long-term love affair with her married boss. Amory told the woman’s side of a man’s world, alight in the age of exclusion. She pushed through uncertainties and refused regrets. And her ardent ambitions and unconventional talent gave her entrance to notable events, such as The Maroon Street Riot, WWW II, and the Vietnam War. Her professional practice also led to a watershed effect in her personal life.Peppered throughout the novel are Amory's black-and-white photographs, which authenticates and deepens her character, giving us glimpses of her work. (I would love to know where these photos are really from. Boyd's ancestors?)I just finished a book by Jane Urquhart, The Night Stages, where one of the quotes and themes was “the presence of the absence,” and, kismet! Here it happened again! Amory’s life began on its trajectory with the absences of her father, and it informed her artistry, which she pursued in her pictures. As she evolves, so does her artistic vision, imbued by the ripples in her life, her pursuit for the eternal moment. ""In my hands I had the power to stop time, or so I thought.""Boyd dodges boilerplate cliché by keeping it real He is obviously aware of books such as Marjorie Morningstar and The Dud Avocado, but SWEET CARESS doesn’t succumb to derivative mimicking. Amory is a singular woman written by a spirited writer.I was swept up in Amory’s character, and the way she perceived and acted upon the world around her.

The five novellas have been reportedly edited and retitled into this novel. Since I haven't read them, I am unable to comment on any of the changes that she made. If you are an Atwood fan, however, this is a must-read addition to her oeuvre.It's characteristic Atwood--bleak, with darkly comedic touches. In a grim near-future, unemployment rates are at an all-time high, and morale is at a fearsome low in this ""rust-bucket"" landscape.

They offer housing in a place not dissimilar to a ""Pleasantville"" type of dwelling/neighborhood. You live in their adult doll houses every other month, and on alternate months you stay in the ""Positron"" prison, which is supposed to be an upbeat, self-sustaining place free of violent criminals. Everyone has a job on the inside and the outside in the twin town of Consilience/Positron, and the promise of safety is more or less guaranteed. Stan and Charmaine decide to go ahead with it, even though Stan's brother, Conor, a rogue outsider, warns them against getting involved.Stan scores a job inside the prison supervising the Positron chicken farm, and Charmaine's duties are top-secret as the Medical Administrator. (Sometimes she is referred to as Medication Administrator, which would be better if corrected before the published edition.) On rotating months, while living in the house that they alternate with another couple, Stan is a scooter mechanic (nobody has cars anymore--they ride around on scooters) and Charmaine works at a bakery. The only cars you see are the black, looming, ominous Surveillance cars that patrol the area.So, this is the set-up. But, as Atwood fans know all too well, there's a sinister gravity beneath the shiny new lifestyle. As a reader, I was reminded of the illusion of unanimity inherent in groupthink, such as explored in Orwell's 1984 Underneath the townspeople's smiles, gratitude, and sense of security lurks a barely suppressed disquiet, which ineluctably leads to some acting out. I could almost taste the barely contained insurrection, and the dangers to come.In typical Atwood fashion--maybe a little too predictable--the illusions are gradually peeled away, and our two protagonists are surrounded by peril. If you are new to Atwood, perhaps the book will be full of surprises, but if you are a veteran of her work, you can anticipate some of her recycled tropes. Also, the last 100 or so pages plunged into Vegas kitsch, which created a different timbre. The dark menace morphed into a gaudy one, and, for me, dampened the elemental dread. Fortunately, through her precision writing, pulsing pace, and progressive plot, the suspense prevails, but I was less invested in the foreseeable outcome....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jun 26, 2015","Jul 02, 2015","Jun 26, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24388326-the-heart-goes-last

But there are thousands and thousands of miles inside him.” This passag“Kenneth’s [Lochhead, the Canadian artist] shadow is a thin ghost on the quay. But there are thousands and thousands of miles inside him.” This passage, to me, is a poignant metaphor for Urquhart’s latest novel, which takes place largely in Ireland, with a layover in Gander, Newfoundland. The central characters could be said to be ghosts of their selves, almost stand-ins for the miles of revenant other selves that live within, and haunt them. They are living half-filled lives, with a past that is gone but still wielding power—“the presence of the absence” (another ghost). Too, Ireland’s past of famine, hardship, and emigration is braided through the story, another specter, so that the novel is often like a diaphanous, haze-filled palimpsest, but one whose relic texts reveal themselves, and whose narrative pages are made of fog, mist, and ghosts. The word “ghost,” in fact, is probably the most oft-repeated noun in the novel. Ghosts, fog, art, arrival, departures, and that half-formed self, represents the tragedies of the past that continue to embark on the present, rendering an inertia to two of the characters, and pointing to the disappearance of a third. Moreover, the novel evokes a sense of the temporary, and a painful feeling of loss for the presence of something permanent:“You bide your time in a temporary place like this…You make no commitment. This is the geography of Purgatory…”As the novel opens, Tam, an Englishwoman, is trying to escape her personal Purgatory by leaving her married lover, Niall, a meteorologist (and son of a meteorologist) in southwest Ireland, a peninsula in the Iveragh mountains, in County Kerry. It is the 1950’s, when planes from Ireland stop to refuel at Gander. However, due to fog conditions, she is stranded there for two nights, and in this interim, she ponders the airport’s mural, painted by (real-life) Kenneth Lochhead, and internalizes and interprets the figures in the mural in relationship with her own melancholy existence. Niall, in turn, wrestles with his demons, and his refusal to take decisive action is rooted in the guilt, shame, and loss he feels for the vanishing of his younger brother, Kieran. Kieran, who is the most compelling character, had temper tantrums as a child, and went to live with the family housekeeper after the tragedy of his and Niall’s mother’s death. Tam recently learned about the reason for Kieran’s disappearance, a miasma that follows Niall like a ghost, and that pursues and prevents his ability to be intimate with others. Speaking of thousands of miles within one, Tam was a pilot in WW II, part of the woman’s air transport auxiliary. She reflects on the many planes she flew back and forth, and the fact of her full engagement 15 years ago, with her work. And here she is now, in a temporary hold (such as the planes she flew), but distanced from her life, as such. Other than her periodic lovemaking with Niall, she feels empty, hollow. Tam also examines and contemplates Lochhead’s mural (which you can view online). Urquhart’s enchanting understanding of the visual arts were evident in The Underpainter and even The Stone Carvers (and probably others that I haven’t read)—and, in this novel, she has a way of observing Lochhead’s mural and not only placing it at the center of the novel, but also building the novel like the mural is painted. Take this passage:""She allows its chaos and its odd calm to enter her mind. Some of the figures are so emplaced they seemed to be wholly defined by the act of absolute arrival. Others are caught in the process of moving away. And far back in the trees, rendered in shades of grey, one or two appear to be poised on the edge of full disappearance.""I’ve not talked much about Kieran, because almost anything I say about him would spoil the act of discovery. However, it is safe to say that Urquhart’s fictionalized history of the artist, Lochhead, and how he came to break over 5000 eggs in this tempera-based mural, “Flight and Its Allegories,” and the mural itself, evokes the lives of Tam, Kieran, and Niall. And, too, it echoes the ghosts of Ireland’s past. This book, too, is an allegory of Ireland and its people. The presence of the absence, and the miles and miles of the past, seeps through the fog. Urquhart has a preternatural sense of when it is time for her characters to leave Purgatory and give up the ghosts. Even the airport at Gander is a ghost, now that refueling isn't necessary. Metafiction? Or metaphor?Highly recommended. A++...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jun 24, 2015","Jul 05, 2015","Jun 24, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23209962-the-night-stages

Time in the story is captured in fractals, and the Dear Thief is a contemplation, condemnation and reverence all at once to the consequences of time. Time in the story is captured in fractals, and the temporal shifts are so frequent that it gave the narrative a dreamy, almost surreal effect (and sometimes, sharp and biting). The thief here IS time, but it is also the woman who stole affection from the narrator’s husband. Samantha Harvey was inspired by Leonard Cohen’s song, Famous Blue Raincoat, which I recommend listening to, especially for its moody potency. Harvey captures his melancholic longing; the impassioned fallout of a triangulating affair; as well as many of his images. But she creates her own piercing story.I am trying to put words together to write a , and I feel stymied by the task—I just want to quote passages in the book, and re-read it! The abstract and the real are bound up in each other, and the strength of the story lies in the prose, and the keen memories both imprisoned and freed by time. You can take any page and meditate on its prowess, its trenchant intelligence, its numinous passages, and Harvey’s ability to cut deeply into enduring questions about life, love, friendship, betrayal, decay, and death. She does this through her narrator (unnamed), who is writing an extended letter to a woman friend that she hasn’t seen in seventeen years.Nina, aka Butterfly, was the narrator’s friend since childhood. They met while both living close to the Welsh border, in England (the narrator’s origin). Both came from scholarly families. A Lithuanian Jew who later became an avid reader of the Vedic Upanishads, Nina was uprooted early in life (and escaped from the dangers of communism in Lithuania), which shaped her into an unsettled person who flees at the idea of permanence. (In fact, the narrator has endured several disappearances and reappearances of Nina throughout her life).“…devotion was not a quality you asked of people, commitment neither; you did not give these things and did not ask for them. If you could give and receive moments of happiness and self-escape, that was enough, that was, in fact, everything.”Butterfly encroached on the narrator’s husband, Nicolas, as we learn early on. This isn’t a plot-centered story, although you are rewarded with a thoughtful, provocative tale that covers the deepest of human emotions. The narrator knew that Nina was a threat, when Nina declaimed:“…a triangle is the holiest and most elegant of things; with two lines you can only create two lines, but with three you can create a shape. That is why three is a transformative number.”And that is when the writer knew that she would be betrayed:“…You were going to work your way into my marriage and you were going to call its new three-way shape holy, and I, pinned like a snared bird to one corner of a triangle, would have to watch it happen.”But, much of it incites the reader to ponder how the past informs the present--and does so with a dose of nihilism.“…there is freedom in the past. The self you left behind lives in endless possibility. The older you get, the bigger and wilder the past becomes, a place that can never again be tended and which is therefore prone to that loveliness that happens on wastelands and wildernesses, where grass has grown over scrap metal and wheat has sprung up in cracks between concrete and there is no regular shape for the light to fall flat on, so it vaults and multiplies and you want to go there. You want to go there like you want to go to a lover.”The unreliable narrator recalls memory after memory, and turns them over and slides her pen through them, her hands, her words, and her relationship with her husband and with her friend, turning them over and around so that time and memory are both fractured and oiled, a freedom and constraint bound up in each other. The narrator begins with a question that Nina once asked her—whether she has ever seen through “the gauze of this life.” The entire book unfolds as if through gauze, also, a kind of meta-fictional play on theme that is captured in structure, an impressionistic portrait that is framed with loss, but not just loss; there is also a sense of wonder that is subtly exciting, spiritual. Throughout the text, the narrator returns to this question, which carries both acute significance and rebellious irony.“ ‘Have you ever seen through the gauze of this life?’ …perhaps I said something first about how early morning is thinner, less real, how I felt I could pass through the mist, steam, and smoke, through the wet wool, into a reality beyond….And I said, ‘Is there a gauze?’’The narrator also projects thoughts and feelings onto the mercurial Nina, so that at times they are two people merged. The telling of Nina becomes a journey through past events juxtaposed with speculative ideas of her, peppered with metaphysical descriptions of the world around. Now that the writer works with the elderly at a nursing home, she contemplates death as a kind of landscape, and time as an inviolable threshold.“You would think that living is a kind of scholarship in time, and that the longer we live the more expert we become at coping with it, in the way that, if you play tennis enough, you get used to coping with faster and faster serves. Instead I find that the longer I live the more bemused I become, and the more impenetrable the subject shows itself to be. I sit on a heap of days.”It’s this heap of days that both consoles and ravages the narrator. Through this letter, she ruminates on the illusory and enigmatic nature of our relationships with each other, the world, and ourselves.“I wonder if not being able to see ourselves is one of the great paradoxes…--knowing ourselves intimately and also not at all. You turn to look at your own profile in the mirror and it is gone. It means we can harbor all kinds of illusions about ourselves that others can see through as clear as day.”I can only touch on a fraction of this seductive story, a book about the ungraspable, the inexplicable.“All I mean is: aren’t written words strange in this way, so inscrutable, all hurrying together on the paper to cover up reality like a curtain drawn across a stage.”...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Jan 2015,"Jun 24, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21535682-dear-thief

A GOD IN RUINS could be read without having read the previous novel, but it has so much more meaning if you read them both. This is a tour de force, and after having closed the last page in tears, and meditated on this astounding book, perhaps I am ready to attempt some sort of , or at least some reflections. However, I feel so inadequate to convey the brilliance of this luminous novel. Life After Life focused on the upbringing of the five Todd children, especially Ursula (the third), who, via Atkinson’s effective device, died and was reborn (as Ursula again) many times. These numerous iterations of Ursula didn’t come across as contrived, as it didn’t depend on the device itself to execute the theme and heft of the story. Rather, Ursula’s many lives deepened her character, and also elucidated how civilization views, revises, and categorizes history, and how the construct of memories are as impermanent as a day. It is the ephemeral nature of life, and our construct of memories in making the chronicle of past events permanent, that are explored so well in both these novels. There are many themes that abound in the Todd family struggles—love, family, authenticity, loss, renewal, and perception, among others. But, what struck me most was the outcome of a battered era, when war is over--missed connections, misunderstandings, and isolation. How to live a future when you are carrying a burden of a damaged past? Atkinson pulls off an epic tale of history, seen through the eyes of one family, with compelling genre-bending talent. This book focuses on Ursula’s brother, Teddy, an RAF bomber during WW II--the squadron leader--fierce, courageous, heroic---who saw war in all its savagery, as he bombed whole cities and watched them burn from an aerial distance. There were times when the raw beauty of the flames down below were poetic—what a paradox—how killing the innocent had a feral beauty to it. “The coloured lights were joined by the bright quick flashes of the high explosives…and everywhere there was the enchanting twinkling of white lights as thousands upon thousands of incendiaries rained down on the city.” (Hamburg burning)Both Teddy and Ursula understood the complex dualities of war--enough to understand that, in order to stay alive, and fulfill your duty as a military servant, there can be no equivocating in the field--or in the air. Only later, when it is history, can the lens shift to judgment. Judging in hindsight wreaks the havoc of guilt and the righteousness of war. Teddy, postwar, was a diminished self--quiet, passive, accepting, but full of kindness and generosity. Unfortunately, he couldn't convey his feelings with any passion, and the war figure of Teddy was subsumed and mostly forgotten. Moreover, Teddy's love for his wife and childhood sweetheart, Nancy, lacked passion. But he was devoted to her, with a robust dependability.The metaphor of war--its brutal, tyrannizing power--can also be assigned to the seismic misunderstanding in families--in this case, Teddy's daughter, Viola, who was in a solitary battle with her father. Once her mother died, she felt abandoned and betrayed, and, although she herself abandoned her children, (several times) for her selfish quests, she wouldn't forgive her father for being the parent who stayed alive to raise her.Atkinson’s postmodern-ish narrative is told through the lens of time periods and generations regularly juxtaposed, the structure of which would fall apart in the hands of a lesser author. She splices time into slivers, really, yet seamlessly segues and alternates time so that when one passage jumps a generation back and forth, it gives weight not just to what is happening now, but what happened before, and what will occur in the future. The author allows us to see particular scenes from multi-perspectives—not just from different characters, but sometimes one character remembering multiple times, at a later or earlier occasion. Sublime.Atkinson also winks at us with references to Life After Life. Certain events that happened offstage in LAL are illuminated here, and she executes the inverse flawlessly, also; she periodically pulls us offstage in her new book with nods to major events from LAL. The past and present are wrapped around each other, days of future passed. Time is not a banner laid out linearly, but rather a gossamer and vertical mass of bridged and dissonant memories.Teddy lives to be almost a century old (as we learn early on), and throughout the novel, the narrative see-saws from Teddy the child, in the mid 1920s, to Teddy the Bomber pilot during the war, later as a husband and father, then a loving grandfather, and then as a dying old man. Even though we know the outline of the future—Atkinson purposely telegraphs events—I was emotionally blitzed by her phenomenal storytelling, as she fills in the spaces of scenarios and allows us to see deeper into her characters.This will undoubtedly go down as one of my top 25 novels of a lifetime. I don't think that Kate Atkinson is finished with the Todd family yet. There's Bertie (Roberta) and Sunny, Teddy's beloved grandchildren, and then there are the lives of those that were only casually referenced. The author may choose to place them on center stage. I can't imagine Teddy as an offhand character; however, the author is a wizard at pulling her characters into the light, or dissolving them into the darkness....more",Notes are private!,4,42,1,"Jun 18, 2015","Jun 21, 2015","Jun 18, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3722183-a-god-in-ruins

Her brother; former associate; former lover; estranged husband; an imperious film critic; and college film subject are the voices that speak out to us, telling not just their stories about their relationship with Sophie, but also their personal and painful histories. Often, the stories dig back further, to parents or other family members, friends or adversaries. Stories within stories. She used these narratives to expose vulnerabilities in her actors, to catch a particular moment on film, or she employed images that revealed a potential incongruity in the storytellers' perception of events. This is what appalled the people closest to her; they felt exploited and undermined.I think Sophie was on the autistic spectrum, isolated from emotional connection. Her films were a way for Sophie to communicate how she observed and experienced the world around her. It was one of the best character portrayals I've seen of Asperger's (although the author never defined Sophie or gave her a diagnosis). Furthermore, Sophie can represent any individual who feels disenfranchised from the world, and has difficulty conveying emotional pain.North has a knack for storytelling, and the chorus of voices, by trying to analyze or understand Sophie, usually told us more about themselves. Their attraction to her was often the desire that Sophie fill a void in their own lives, and the author spotlighted these projections onto Sophie to create, in a sense, a mirror of Sophie that reflected an opaque, cinematic presence.My only issue with the characters here is that North hasn't perfected individualized voices for each character. One could argue that this was a Greek chorus of voices, not meant to be discrete, but I disagree. Their stories created such singular characters that it is clear that they were not one plural voice. Rather, I think that the author isn't skilled in voice distinction at this time. However, she pens a colorful portrait of people connected to Sophie--and, yet, disconnected, too.Although Stark is the titular auteur here, with her elliptical films, she is essentially a lonely and, the way I see it, questionably talented filmmaker who attracted other damaged individuals. She made minimalist films that connected through cryptic images. Sometimes, I wanted to believe in their profundity; she had her cult following. And her third film, INTO THE WOODS, fit the description, cutting through archetypal sentimentality in showing a dying woman's last moments, which defied our comfortable ideas. At other times, I had to wonder if the author was occasionally mocking the film industry's cause célèbre of certain underground, inaccessible films that invite complex interpretations. It wasn't clear to me.Moreover, Sophie's second film, MARIANNE, made me wonder if North truly grasped this genre of filmmaking. It was a derivative, over-popularized killer/stalker film, neither avant garde or groundbreaking. The killer of one girl stalks the victim's knowing friend and, in closing, delivers a canned, cliched last line. It almost removed me from the story, as I couldn't suspend belief that this movie turned into a cult classic with a loyal following. Apparently, it shows the oppression of trying to escape life in a small town (like we haven't seen The Last Picture Show?). This is distinguished and controversial? And her style of directing the stalked young woman, which was intended to be edgy, fell flat to me.North impressed me most by demonstrating the universal desire to connect to others and the attempt to reach into the grave and understand what eludes us. Sophie remains inscrutable; North demonstrates that there is no objectivity in attempting to dissect her. Like a film, there are numerous but insufficient interpretations. We can only hope to examine ourselves. 3.5...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 16, 2015","Jun 17, 2015","Jun 18, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23281949-the-life-and-death-of-sophie-stark

Borders are controlled, and the government restricts the Central Valley citizens (called Mojavs) by corralling them in internment camps.

Luz, whose heroes are naturalists such as John Muir and Sacajawea, repudiates the camps and sets off on her own, meeting and forging a relationship with Ray, originally from Indiana, and a veteran of the ""Forever War."" They squat at a mansion once owned by a vacated starlet; rations are scarce, but they have a wardrobe of wonders and a hatbox full of money. And each other.Their journey really begins when, one night at a raindance, they liberate an odd, lupine toddler from her neglectful, libertine guardians and abscond with her back to the mansion. They name her Ig, and vow to be a committed family together. Because of what they've done, they are motivated and paranoid enough to leave for greener pastures. They warily seek advice from an old comrade, who suggests that they head for the great swath of sand called the Amargosa, between the Central Valley and Vegas. There's alleged to be a town of outcasts run by a prophet. And, more importantly, there's supposed to be water.Watkins creates a spectacular landscape through intertextual and mystical language--spiritual and metaphysical, stark and surreal. She constructs an original, strange but strangely familiar universe using recognizable images that are altered or fused, such as a ""sandalanche."" All is parched, colorless, rust, smoke, dirt, decay, bones, and sand. And the relentless sun. In this barren, dying terrain, Watkins describes a ""Dune Sea""--a mammoth wall of sand that inspires comparisons to the ocean, and which also behaves like a vastly accelerating glacier. This superdune, which has buried cities, both obstructs movement and passage and lures transients with an occult-like force.""It has been called the devil incarnate, but also the wide, open eye of God.""As the three set out on their odyssey, they are tested morally, physically, spiritually, and romantically. I believe that all great literature is connected in various ways, and some have even a higher frequency of magnetism, like this one. Watkins pays homage to Brave New World, Stranger in a Strange Land, Gods Without Men, The Roadand the 2014 Station Eleven and The Bone Clocks, among other powerful books. There are even parallels to The Stand. She tips her hat to the best of dystopian literature, but she's an innovative, gifted and fertile writer, not a mimic.The characters in this book are seekers, fatigued and traumatized, but hoping for the sublime nuance to counteract their cynicism. They are looking for something to believe in, a new supernatural awe that promises hope, beauty, transcendence. Watkins also provides subversive wit, and her characters are ample and generous. She doesn't dumb down or wax superior. It's tough to find dystopian literature that isn't derivative or condescending, but Watkins achieves this by trusting readers, not manipulating them. The narrative is inventive and darkly enchanting.Watkins' use of paradox and extended metaphor is so brilliant and visionary that I could feast on this novel for the polychromatic prose alone. However, the story is also strong and solid, driven largely by theme and character, but on a wily, linguistic trampoline. The plot winds its way gradually to its powerful apex.Luz still resonates, even after the last page. She's part earthy, part flighty, damaged, determined. Aspects of her are transparent, but you can't reduce her to knowable. There's as much to learn about her in how she responds to the people around her as in listening to her thoughts. She's a conundrum, one of those brilliantly conceived characters that will create debate. She's unforgettable.""California people are quitters. No offense.

I am a secular Jew, and think of the bible as the original written allegory and metaphor of humanity's struggles. I gambled that Brooks' storytelling skills and her finesse in stitching the drama of history to contemporary times would be sufficient to carry me along. It met my expectations in most ways: in its simplicity and lean, tactile prose; her ability to compel with character and plot, and her ideal pacing.Some of the truisms almost bordered on hokey at times, and Brooks used comfortable, familiar tropes. However, the ancient legend of King David, as with most biblical stories, provided some solid framework for future fiction-writing. So, if you can imagine this story as the provenance of storytelling, then you can imagine it as the genesis for a hundred thousand others that borrowed from ancient scriptures. Did I say fiction? Well, if you believe that King David existed, or if you didn't, you're still just as likely to enjoy it. It's a roaring, lascivious, and even tender tale. Of course, a man like David would be in prison today for his outrageous behaviors. This story has it all: adventure, drama, suspense, war, murder, sex (of many kinds!), romance, homicide, fratricide, bro-love, betrayal, incest...and music and beauty. It was occasionally sentimental, but Brooks pulled it back with the modest restraint of an author confident in her ability to satisfy literary readers, while willing to blandish the book with a mainstream potboiler.She humanized David, enough so that I understood the combination of respect and fear, and love and hatred that he reaped. It was difficult to stomach how he failed to raise his sons with any core values, and yet his last son, Shlomo (Solomon), he allowed his prophet, Natan, to mentor, which resulted in a pure and angelic boy. Brooks definitely spelled it out, i.e. her characters came with a blast of the shofar rather than the whisper of a breath. The author, in a sense, amplified every characters' honorable vs. flawed nature, and she was almost an apologist for David. But, again, she pulled back before it became too saccharine. However, don't expect high culture here; this is unapologetic entertainment, a bit pandering at times, but still fastening me at the edge of my seat.In case you don't know the story of King David--the shepherd boy-cum-anointed one, here is a rough description. Prophet Samuel realizes that Saul is not fit for king duties, which makes Saul go mad. Samuel goes to Beit Lechem (Bethlehem) and finds the seemingly unimpressive young David, the youngest brother of a large family well educated in Jewish law. Samuel feels God speaking through him, naming David as future King of Israel.Brooks story is narrated by Natan, David's personal prophet and scrivener (whose father David slaughtered in front of him)--a man, like Samuel, who hears the ""Name"" speaking through his body (via tongue rolling, convulsions, and other shaman-like contortions). It is the story of David's vicissitudes as a king--his loves, losses, conquers, falls, courage, cowardice, transgressions, and tragedies. I fail to understand why a benevolent God would commence to create such a violent history, but then, I'm not organically attuned to what I was taught in Hebrew School. But, despite my personal beliefs, Brooks had me at ""thou."" As in People of the Book, the author is skilled at writing ancient times in a contemporary style. Instead of using a stodgy, fusty Ole English translation of Aramaic, she writes with a lyrical and modern pen, all the while capturing the mood and atmosphere of the era into times past, until you are truly transformed into the days of BCE. And yet, the moral core is relatable to the times we live in today. I don't know how she does it, but I am certainly pleased with her execution of words:""...the stories that grow up around a king are strong vines with a fierce grip. They pull life from whatever surfaces they cling to, while the roots, maybe, wither and rot until you cannot find the place from which the seed of the vine has truly sprung. That was my task: to uncover those earliest roots.

Not just because of its length (720 pages), but, because it doesn’t exactly grabThis is a novel that requires patience, commitment, and perseverance. Not just because of its length (720 pages), but, because it doesn’t exactly grab you swiftly. It took me almost 300 pages to feel installed in the story, rather than just a visitor hovering outside the narrative. Yanagihara is long-winded, although not generally dull, yet she also, in my opinion, only fully realized one character, Jude St. Francis, the successful but troubled Ivy League-educated lawyer with a tragic, troubled past. The mostly interior story is ostensibly about these four friends who meet in their teens, and their ongoing friendship for over thirty years. But, really, it is a profile of Jude (with some shared traits of the Obscure one).Jude was ritually abused as an orphan, although the author is quite circumspect about the details, which take 2/3 of the novel to completely fill in (and even then, there’s always more). However, even before I was enervated by the laboriously slow reveal, the reader ”gets it,”—this isn’t exactly new stuff for our topical times, but it always dismays us to hear about disturbed, violent people who abuse children. By the time she filled in the shocking details, I was astonished, yes, but also a bit weary. There’s also a lot of repetition of Jude’s adult coping behaviors (in ways, almost as horrifying as the abuse)— but necessary, I suppose, to really be intimate with his ongoing struggles, to demonstrate the limitless loneliness and pain one suffers when life is clouded by shame. But, I admit to some impatience, too. I was straining to believe that everyone was ALWAYS therapeutic with Jude. He was glum and intractable, refusing to talk about his past (with a few people, he revealed bits and pieces)—but, as I said, their ability to be so 110% willing and available for Jude was really too good to be true. Rarely, they lost patience-- carefully manipulated by the author to usually further the story along (and Jude).Jude’s three friends, ones he has known since college—Willem, the successful actor, Malcolm, the successful architect, and JB, the successful artist (actually, all the characters in this book are so highly successful as to be almost untouchable, no pun intended), start out as developing characters, and then slip into either straw men and/or saints. Then there is Andy, the virtuous and always available surgeon, and Harold, the law professor with the patience of Job. All these men (with one seeming exception—JB, who makes a few mistakes) are so thoroughly, unerringly, and impossibly pledged to Jude that it eventually strikes a false note. All of these very busy people—world travelers—seem to have drop-everything time and an almost pious forbearance for Jude, the enigmatic one who refuses to reveal his past and his harrowing abuses. There were virtually no female characters—well, Harold’s wife, Julia, and Malcolm’s, wife, but they were nothing but generic passers-by, even if (like Julia) they played an important role. They were all tools for the character of Jude.If I were to name a second, well-developed character, it would be the setting. No matter how many books are set in New York City, there are as many ways and more to bring it alive. Yanagihara has a sharp eye for living spaces, architecture, color, and art, and in this way, she gave New York its singular charisma. I would also assert that having an architect and an artist as two of Jude’s friends allowed her to buttress the book with her eye for these details, which I enjoyed greatly. JB’s installations (of course, mostly about Jude or himself, and conveniently about the other friends for later absorption) added shade to the story, but, again, it seemed that everything was for Jude’s character.This is a mostly interior novel, which is why I demand either faceted characters or compelling ideas. The author flirts with ideas through the art world but there's nothing inherently philosophical about the novel. Moreover, the author gave all the other characters, except for Jude, short shrift. Willem actually starts out engaging. His childhood was also tragic, but for different reasons. Yet, too soon, Willem turns into a big movie star and his character a cursory device for Jude. Willem is the most saintly of all the characters, an actor who is never self-absorbed, who isn't even aware of his fame when he walks into a room. He's portrayed as way too humble to be organic.Most of the men in this novel made me think of those Seurat paintings, where the people whose faces we never see too well are diminished or faded into the background. Is that what the author intended? I don’t think so, because in her debut book,The People in the Trees , she had several well-realized characters. Moreover, in 700+ pages, she includes Jude’s friends frequently, but the more they are present, the more absence I felt of their true natures. She also covered the topic of child abuse in both novels, but, in TREES, it’s for the reader to ascertain, over the course of the suspenseful story, whether the narrator is reliable or not, and if the child abuse really did take place. In A LITTLE LIFE, we know it took place, and we follow the abused child mostly as an adult. Just a side note: Yanagihara tends to pair abuse with a life of privilege. In TREES, the alleged abuser is a scholar/scientist. In this second book, the victim of abuse grows to be in the elite 1%. I would like to see her take it down a notch—show how many abused children are stuck in the system or live in the real world as a worker bee, not touched by highbrow living, and too impaired to put together a successful life. Jude, however, is an accomplished pianist with a beautiful voice, is well-read, and is what I would identify as that rare contemporary Renaissance man—but he works as a corporate lawyer 80-100 hours/week, where his troubles seem to melt away on the job.Regardless of the flaws, I stuck with the novel; Jude was so captivating, even in his reticence, that I wanted to see it through. I think Yanagihara could have shaved off a few hundred pages without hurting the narrative, especially as she didn’t seem intent on filling out the characters beyond a certain point.At the beginning, there was evidence that there would be nuance regarding race and sexual orientation. A few comments were made at the start, coyly referring to the fact that only Willem is white. Jude was ""undetermined,"" a mix of backgrounds, and Malcolm and JB were black. So why a white man on the cover of the book? Is that supposed to be Willem? That seems disingenuous to me, as the main character, Jude, is not Caucasion. That was just one of the several manipulations that seemed inorganic.Also, there seemed to be little or no controversy about gay issues. Some of the characters were gay or bi-, but they didn't seem to go through any hardships, past or present, with their sexual orientation. It was so smooth that it was glossed over. Parents--proud and accepting, peers--proud and accepting, colleagues--proud and accepting. Nothing in these men's lives stirred any controversy or hardship (unless it has to do with their relationship with Jude)--just success. Even JB's problems were disposed of quickly. But, I suppose if you are in the 1%, being black and gay buys you a ticket from discrimination? These men had a paved avenue, so much more than my black and/or gay friends ever did. However, her prose was always strong, solid, subtle:""...he imagined Jude as a magician whose sole trick was concealment, but every year, he got better and better at it, so that now he only had to bring one wing of the silken cape he wore before his eyes and he would become instantly invisible, even to those who knew him best.""3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,not set,"Jun 08, 2015","Jun 09, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22822858-a-little-life

For one thing, the torture of detainees-- the cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment applied during “extra-legal” interrogations. In Ellen Meeropol’s second novel, a hurricane is raging on the northeast coast of Maine, while a storm of ethical breaches is in process against prisoners held there in a civilian camp. Here, federal agents are attempting to determine whether 60-year-old math professor Gandalf Cohen is an enemy of the State. Her newly hired civilian guard, a young and naïve Austin Coombs, is a primary witness to the rogue actions of U.S. lawmen. Braided within this well-paced thriller is a tender and taut back-story involving Coombs’s grandparents. The history of the quarry on this tiny island in Maine is full of romance, intrigue, and secrets.Meeropol scrutinizes the very nature of freedom vs. safety, by examining the governmental power of extreme intervention in the name of national security. Using alternating points of view of five characters, including the two federal agents, the reader is taken on a pulse-pounding cat-and-mouse ride. What do the words “national security” really mean? Is it helpful or harmful to the interests of the individual, or does it trade the individual for the so-called protection of society? Furthermore, do the keepers of security pervert their interests into rogue factions? The word “terrorism” is emotionally and politically charged, and what Meeropol accomplishes in her novel is to bring the war on terror down to an individual level. My only complaint is that the character of federal agent Tobias, and what he represents, is too reductive. The author makes it easy to despise him, because he is a sadist. However, shows like 24, and movies like ZERO DARK THIRTY, have shown a more nuanced side of the path to torture--it was more like a continuum that escalates when results aren't obtained. What happens when a “good guy”—someone the audience usually roots for, is compelled to use torture to get results from a prisoner who has knowingly performed heinous crimes. Our armchair evaluations are challenged, because we, too, are compelled—to sympathize, even against our better judgment. Meeropol veers away from moral ambiguity, preferring to keep to a safer, if less provocative, principle regarding the war on terror. Maybe it is served up a little too sanitized; however, I can appreciate her moral stand and desire to make a salient point.

He can master the alternative present (Never Let Me Go), the WW II era (several), and, in this latest novel, the ancient past. He consistently pens flawed narrators that make critical, life-changing choices. And the narrators often leave their geographic comfort zone.THE BURIED GIANT is a combination myth, legend, allegory, adventure, and fantasy. I didn't know if it would capture my attention when I started it, because I tend to avoid medieval or Dark Age stories and (post) Arthurian legends with ogres and knights. However, this is no standard fare fantasy. Ishiguro is a wordsmith whose language stirs you to your emotional core. He is in touch with the sadder and more poignant losses of life, which he incorporates with organic and powerful subtlety. Essentially, Ishiguro is a writer of mankind's contradictions, and he accesses our deepest fears and our dearest desires.The conundrum here is the sovereignty of our memories, and a mist that shields us from summoning them. Are we better off not knowing all the shadows and corners of our past? It reminds me a bit of a book I recently read called J, by Howard Jacobson, and the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. These latter are very different in content, but all three works of art explore the power of memory and how it affects our current ability to live an authentic life, and to genuinely know happiness and sorrow.

I tend to compare any of her subsequent books to AT, and that is how I came to this rating. Although her latest is a pleasant and absorbing sprawling family saga, it doesn’t push the envelope or lay out anything new in the domestic drama genre. The novel does possess Tyler’s signature wry humor, however, and ability to balance blunt-and-confront with oblique and circumspect. At the author’s veteran writing experience, (and this is reportedly her swan song as an author), Tyler remains just as plucky and engaged at 70 as she was at 30; she certainly understands the power of family stories. “In the Whitshank family, two stories had traveled down through the generations. These stories were viewed as quintessential—as defining in some way—and every family member…had heard them told and retold and embroidered and conjectured upon any number of times.” The two stories were of Junior Whitshank, the builder of the Baltimore house where most of the story takes place, and his daughter, Merrick, a social climber. However, as a reader, we discover that Junior’s son, Red, also has a defining story, and his wife, Abby, who is Tyler’s age, is arguably the central female character.The power of this book is about family, of course, but, more than that, it is about the truths, deceptions, and interpretations of these family “stories.” As Abby describes her meeting with Red in 1959 as a “breezy, yellow and green afternoon,” we as readers will testify to the unedited version of their union—or does it just raise more questions? The author goes back in time to not just Abby and Red, but when, how, and why Junior built the house on Bouton Road, and how he met and married his wife, Linnie Mae.Although it wasn’t a page-turner for me, I was always content to return to the Whitshank family. There are secrets, lies, skeletons, and a black sheep—Abby and Red’s son, Denny. He and his brother, Stem, have a tense rivalry that rears its ugly head at times. The sisters, Amanda and Jeannie, seem to have secondary and supportive roles, at best. They even married men with the same name—Hugh—that indicated a certain comfort in a particular pedigree, (although both Hughs had their differences, you had to play close attention, and perhaps look back, to distinguish). Stem’s wife, Nora, is a self-contained and religious woman who nevertheless has a talent for organization and a sly ability to go toe to toe with her mother-in-law.Four generations—Junior and Linnie Mae; Abby, Red, and Merrick; Abby and Red’s children; and their grandchildren, are explored largely inside this Baltimore house on Bouton Road with an impressive, spacious front porch. There isn’t much more I’d want to reveal about the Whitshank family. What made it so relatable is the realism in Tyler’s writing, and the way she can expose the wrinkles in the formerly ironed-over seams, and her uncanny way of reminding all of us about the unraveling of family flaws. Don’t we all know which threads are frayed, or loose, and where hems just might unspool? Do we take great pains to keep everything tidy and locked tight, or are we the ones who are compelled to tug at those loose threads and those open seams?

The theme of J, which crops up frequently, is, WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, which would indicate a knowingness, but, for the most part, Jacobson's dystopian world, which takes place in the future (but still the 21st century), is constructed on a foundation of a kind of schizophrenic behavior, but complicit and fraught.The denial-of-reality behavior reminds me of the line in the Matrix, ""Did you take the red pill or the blue pill?"" This is a nation who took the blue pill--they don't want to know the truth. What is the truth? Read it, and you will realize it, after many oblique twists and turns and drops in the rabbit hole. It is evident that some sinister annihilation of population occurred those several generations ago. But, who? And why? And, the tragedy is, anyone wanting to find out will need to be silenced.In this strange new world, I was also reminded of Orwell's doublethink; the people in this story hold contradictory or paradoxical beliefs, and are at odds with themselves for questioning the societal norms, set by a standard called Project Ishmael, run by a monitoring group called Orfnow.""The overexamined life is not worth living."" There's an official monitoring of the public mood, to ensure that everyone is under ""moral hypnosis.""""A compliant society meant that every section of it consented with gratitude -- the gratitude of the providentially spared.""Most of the story takes place in Port Reuben, one of many renamed towns, inhabited by people with renamed (and often ridiculous) surnames. ""The past exists in order that we forget it."" The central characters, Kevern ""Coco"" Cohen and his new lover, Ailinn Solomons, might seem paranoid to members of the monitoring group, but they feel something or someone at their heels. It is dangerous to seek too much knowledge. There exists very little technology (except phones for local calls); art, music, and history have been varnished and saturated with the dippy philosophy of annoying optimism. Anything too deep, dark, or knowing is either outlawed--or, if not outlawed legally, it is frowned upon. Yet, ironically, this society is ever the more bleak for not allowing any shadows or clouds to obscure the bright and sunny disposition of life. Even the library books have pages missing, if any suggestion of ""J"" history is suggested or revealed.Suggestion, implication, intimation--this is how Jacobson slowly peels the layers of this story. The more WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED ""folklore"" is revealed, the more absurd this Orwellian-esque society becomes to the reader. And, not just absurd, but harrowing.I hesitate to say any more about the book. Like Kevern's father, who would place two fingers in front of his mouth any time he uttered a word beginning with the letter J, I will keep mum about most of this story. It is more a book of ideas than a plot, but the plot in itself is stunning. It is both comical and tragic, chilling, ludicrous, and devastating. Jacobson keeps the humor and tragedy dancing in a delicate balance on the head of a pin.If I have one complaint, it is that he was occasionally repetitive, and the story was strung out a bit sluggishly. However, these are small complaints for such a staggering story.""We've lived through the end of the world,"" says a character. ""This is the aftermath.

Scott Fitzgerald has been canonized as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. His oeuvre is not that large (for example, compared to rival Ernest Hemingway)--his 44 years on the planet came and went like a flash in the Jazz Age pan, his glamorized life with Zelda mythologized almost more than his solo presence. When I think of Fitzgerald, I think of Gatsby. How not? But O'Nan captures the screenwriting Fitzgerald, the scenarist whose work in Hollywood is largely unnoticed.This fictionalized bio of Scott's years from 1937-1940 focus on his failing health, his waning status, and the final, declining years living in Hollywood, apart from his wife, Zelda, who was institutionalized for bipolar disorder. His visits with Zelda and his daughter, Scottie, were spare, usually during Xmas season. He clung to his few friends and even less work, while battling with alcohol and living on amphetamines and a briefcase of Cokes. His affair with gossip columnist Sheilah Graham was presented with pathos and nuance, a volatile pairing at best. O'Nan captures the melancholy atmosphere and the era quite capably, the Hollywood Golden Age, burnished in some ways, tarnished in others. O'Nan also subtly envelopes the irony of producing the flashy glitz of shallow romance/war movies at a time when Hitler was on the rise and the harrowing truth of Germany's power was minimized by Hollywood.Although the author is now immortalized, his bright light was diminishing in the years before his death, and he had very few friends he could count on, and was frequently in debt. We are introduced to the weak and desolate figure of the writer and husband/father, captive to his addictions and ill-health, divided by his needs and desires. The fraught characterizations of F. Scott, Zelda, and Sheilah Graham were spot-on, but the Hollywood set, like Bogie, L.B. Mayer, Selznick, Dorothy Parker, and others, were more like set decoration, well-placed for artistic design, but flattened and sprinkled for effect. Fitzgerald also referred to Hemingway, but Ernest was always offstage. This isn't a book for lovers of the flickering, fleeting Lost Generation. It is a peek into the charred last years of Fitzgerald, his battle with writing, at war with his demons.On Tom Wolfe's death: ""I envied his powers, as I envy Ernest's, knowing they're not mine. I like to think the three of us...were after what might be called the American soul.""I found this book to be a bit flat and dry in places, but I commend O'Nan for creating a peek into Fitzgerald's soul at the end of his life, tattered though it was. It is hard to believe that this literary giant was merely a malingering has-been when he died. Like Melville, history revised and electrified him, but that was later. This novelized version of F.

The premise is intrThe tension between geopolitical landscapes and the promise of a universal domestic drama piqued my interest in reading this book. The premise is intriguing: a beautiful, statuesque photographer, Bella, daughter of a Somali mother and Italian father, is informed that her half-brother, Aar, (on mother's side) has been killed by terrorists during his work with the UN. Aar lived in Nairobi with his teenaged daughter and son; the children's mother, Valerie, abandoned them years ago to pursue a relationship with another woman. Now she is back in the picture with a lawyer, ready to take up a fight for her children. Bella leaves Rome, where she has been living for many years, to move to Kenya and take care of the children in Nairobi (per Aar's wishes) and deal with Valerie. Growing up, she was half in love with Aar herself.There's a flat, stilted style to Farah's narrative that removed any feeling of immediacy. It's a mix of declarative sentences and static details, which is occasionally heavy-handed. There's the sense that passages are being filtered through the author's socio-political lens before he shares it with the reader. I'm not quite sure if Farah thought that we wouldn't grasp enough of the nuances, or whether he wasn't able to step aside and let us come to our own conclusions. Too often, he justified a character's action or thought, which dispatched me out of the story and into the author's agenda. Farah also seemed to be edifying his readers about Somali customs and perceptions toward homosexuality, genital mutilation, and female assertion, but instead of it coming organically from the story, it had the touch of pulpit sermonizing.As for the characters, they never truly came alive for me. The author had a ripe opportunity to illustrate inner conflict in Bella, who abruptly dropped her carefree, single lifestyle in Italy to mother two teens in Nairobi. And, not a look back! It isn't just her altruism that is hard to swallow, but her too-immediate adjustment. She takes on the nurturing, mothering role so seamlessly that it is hard to believe that she was living in a fast-paced, narcissistic world of fame, money, and beautiful people. Bella is single, with several lovers and a lucrative career, but has zero qualms about her new obligation. As the reader, I did not see Bella struggling to adapt. She was also the ultimate diplomat in every situation. The few times that she was blunt to people, they were portrayed to deserve it.Aar is just the vehicle for the story, and possessed one-dimensional attributes. The victim of terrorism, his portrait was sympathetic but superficial. Like Bella, he was morally and ethically above reproach. Valerie, the ex- and the putative villain, left little to the imagination. What is even more irritating is that the potentially complicated situation gets wrapped up too conveniently in a bow. Valerie's lover, ethnically Indian but Ugandan-born Padmini, is largely a straw for the author's facile handling of Valerie.The most complex characters were the children-- Salif, the eldest child, and his sister, Dahaba. Farah showed subtle insight into the issues of teenagers facing tragedy. Their mixed feelings toward their mother were often realistic, although Farah didn't mine it sufficiently. Their cycling emotions, although not adequately explored, were realistic.It took me a few weeks to complete this novel, as it didn't compel me to keep turning the pages. Besides the stilted style, there were a lot of unnecessary details, such as mundane cooking and other domestic chores, that put the brakes on the story. Moreover, Farah periodically put too repetitive a point on things. For example, it was made clear early on that Aar and his children respected the Muslim culture but were not strict with custom; the children ate bacon, for one thing. But there was too much zeroing in on cooking bacon. It appeared that the author wanted to keep reminding us, in case we forgot!The story, which took up 339 pages, could have been shaved down to a 90-page novella. If you eliminated the excess minutiae, the result would have had more momentum, if not more intrigue. As it was, there really wasn't a lot of scope in this story of a disrupted, blended family....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 13, 2014","Oct 31, 2014","Oct 13, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20893535-hiding-in-plain-sight

The gulf beIt's a modest elegance that pulls you along in this story of 40-ish Irish widow Nora Webster and her family in County Wexford, in Ireland. The gulf between wife and widowhood is daily captured by Nora's inscrutable, withdrawn demeanor and period of emotional turmoil. She is struggling to adjust without her husband, Maurice, who died three months ago. He was a fine teacher and a capable, loving partner, although he didn't share her love of music. It begins circa 1969; no dates are mentioned, but one can assign it by historic events and people, and the story closes three years later.Over the course of the novel, we settle deeper into the conventions and conceits of Nora's provincial family, and especially Nora herself, as she strives to emerge from her quiet despair and well-meaning but stifling cadre of support. She wants to be left alone with her inner life and her sons (she chose not to have a phone), but the visitors, while trickling to few now, continue to politely intrude. Tóibín's exquisite examination of the quotidian reveals a masterpiece of character and reflection. Reading this was like listening to movements of classical music in a minor key. Many are mentioned in the book, such as Schubert's hymn ""To Music;"" I was drawn to listen to it. The text, or the context of the novel, would fit neatly inside the hymn.Nora's two nearly grown daughters, Fiona and Aine, and her two young sons, Donal and Conor, are her primary concerns. The two daughters seem to be confident and established, on to their own futures (although Fiona teaches close to home). Conor, the youngest son, and Donal, a few years older, (with a significant stammer) worry her the most. She wants to provide a steady life for them, but feels periodically inept. Her widow's fee is small (which increases), and the idea of going back to work after twenty years of marriage is grim. Then there's the idea of reconfiguring her social life, a tough one for the widow.Nora seeks structure, a soothing coping strategy that provides consistency and limits. Every summer now, she takes her children to the beach at Curracloe for two weeks. When she starts working, Nora comes home for lunch (or tea), when the boys do, and is also there to prepare dinner at the end of the day. It's as if she is trying to protect others from experiencing her grief. Her sisters and other family members observe her anxiety, and she knows that they do. She just wishes everyone would leave her alone, and stop coming to visit her with their obligatory condescension.When Maurice was dying at a TB clinic at the edge of town, she had left the boys with her Aunt Josie while she was at her husband's bedside for several months. After revisiting her aunt again early in the novel, Nora is wracked with a tremendous but nebulous psychological strain and fear. She feels something unsaid in the air, and a crushing suffocation from her thoughts about it. This ongoing duel with her inner self and the temporal world mounts with tension, and Tóibín's delicate distillation of prose down to its most spare essence allows the reader to meditate on the blank spaces, which corresponds to Nora's ""world filled with absences."" The voids threaten to topple over into discord at times; at other times, eloquent stillness. But she is rarely meek, just restrained by custom.Nora is as bordered as a button, with deep-seated zones of repressed desire. There's no grand heroics in her baby steps toward spirited liberation, which makes her that much more relatable. Her private moments listening to music, close to trance-like in her enjoyment--even that has its limits for Nora. I held my breath at times, watching and waiting (hoping) for Nora to emerge from her shell, more fully realized.As Nora gradually moves toward active engagement with the present, the music I hear picks up, and I hear a confident capriciousness at intervals. I was installed in Nora's rich, inner life--one that is stifled, boundless, and hesitantly optimistic. In an inner life, the contradictions are more congruous, spoken only to the self. That's not to say that Nora didn't have her outspoken, laconic wit; she also had moments of fierce independence and what others may think of as eccentric behavior. She wanted release from being everyone else's idea of a widow. Along the way, a nun, a music teacher, and a selfish young woman indirectly guide the taciturn widow forward toward her vocal talent.Nora's doubts and mourning are expressed superbly in her response to music by Beethoven:""The energy in the playing was sad, and then it became more than sad, as if there was something there and all three players recognized it and were moving towards it."" ""...she was sure someone had suffered, and moved away from suffering and then come back to it, let it linger and live within them.""...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Sep 17, 2014","Sep 22, 2014","Sep 17, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21412360-nora-webster

Francis Wray, age 26, and her Sarah Waters produced a fine alchemy of a story in this page-turning, riveting, erotic period drama set in 1922 London. Francis Wray, age 26, and her mother were part of the genteel class, but the Great War was not kind to them. Francis lost both her brothers in battle, and her father died soon afterward, leaving them in debt. They still have the grand old house in South London, but they can no longer afford a cook, or servants. They struggle just to stay afloat in a world that has left them behind. Francis takes on the cleaning tasks, and they have reluctantly decided to take in lodgers to help with the debt. Enter the “paying guests,” Lilian and Leonard Barber, who are from the “clerk” class, a distinct step below the Wrays. Len is a hail and flirtatious fellow, a tad annoying to Francis, and Lilian is modern, extroverted, a bit saucy. They fill up the former conservatively done rooms with gewgaws, such as ostrich feathers in jars; macramé; a tambourine; and billowy scarves over lamps.“The thought that all these items were about to be brought into the home – and that this couple…who were younger, and brasher, were going to bring them, and set them out, and make their own home, brashly, among them – the thought brought on a flutter of panic. What on earth had she done? She felt as though she was opening up the house to thieves and invaders."" The unease and conflict is almost tangible, visible. I sensed the sword of Damacles ready to strike a blow. But, when?The novel is divided into three parts, which click together, like a play. In part one, the Barbers and the Wrays are getting to know one another. The attraction between Lil and Francis, whose voltage is in the air almost immediately, ratchets up the tension. In part two, grisly action and tragic events take place, the pressure so palpable and bracing, I couldn’t tear myself away from the book. Part three is rife with police procedural, courtroom drama, and filled with class factions and domestic casualties.Waters is a master of the interior--of the house, so expertly detailed, “It was the sort of room she could remember from childhood visits to ailing great-aunts. All it really lacked…was the whiff of a commode, and the little bell for summoning the whiskery spinster daughter,” and the mind, so vividly and metaphorically rendered “She felt alive as a piece of radium.” The modulated pace of the opening gradually gives way to a controlled but intense physical excitement. ""They smiled at each other across the table, and some sort of shift occurred between them. There was a quickening, a livening – Frances could think of nothing to compare it with save some culinary process. It was like the white of an egg growing pearly in hot water, a milk sauce thickening in the pan.""Sex, transgression, scandal, and violence—Waters accelerates into the nightmarish with assuredness and skill, and she does it all without falling into melodrama, although she winks at it ironically from oblique angles. The narrative is exhilarating, the prose smooth and silky, immaculate, the pace impeccable. I was ready to burst by the end.

He stays consistently at the top of my pile of crime fiction literature, and never fails to pull me in with his muscular prose and taut, thrilling plot lines, the kind of narrative that usually takes place in a narrow period of time and with a lot at stake. In COBRA (and I won't reveal *why* the title, since it is fun just getting to it!), Benny Griessel is back again, fighting his personal demons as well as the external ones.Meyer has hit on the global zeitgeist of crime in his latest book, placing technology at the center of the plot. It is also fun watching Luddite Benny Griessel struggling to get a handle on 21st century telecommunications. Meyer, while keeping pace with progress, nails down the importance of creating rich characters to engage readers. He doesn't rely on technology alone to fasten us to the story.The first pages open with murder and abduction, with the Hawks (South Africa's top police) investigating the bloody mess at a remote guesthouse. Captain Griessel lines up a team to chase down the killer and the kidnapped. The next chapter introduces us to a petty pickpocket named Tyrone, who is trying to help his sister, Nadia, pay for university. We don't know how Tyrone figures into the multiple-homicide case, but Meyer seamlessly provides a juncture for the disparate threads to connect and catapult the story in thicker and more dangerous territory.Meyer is expert at enriching the story while moving forward vertically. For new readers, the author blends in enough for you to know that Griessel is a recovering alcoholic, and providing some backstory for his current circumstances. Although Benny is a tough, strong guy with plenty of mettle, the veteran detective has some burning issues that cause him to question aspects of his nature. Meyer has created a believable, long-suffering character in Benny.I was also delighted that he included the heavy-set, sharp, sometimes-comical Captain Mbali Kaleni, the only female in the DCPI Violent Crimes team. I first met her in Thirteen Hours, a memorable character who is both sympathetic and, in the latter book, periodically the brunt of a joke. However, when it comes to fighting crime, she is a force to be reckoned with, a crackerjack detective who is decisive, authoritative, and morally unequivocal. In COBRA, we also see new facets of her character. I'd like to see Meyer write a series of books with Kaleni as the primary protagonist.If you are new to this author, I am confident that COBRA will not be your last Meyer book. If you are already a fan, your expectations will be amply met; you'll be addicted from the first page. And, the answer to all COBRA's questions aren't guaranteed until the very last page, which keeps you guessing. Meyer is at his peak without being over-the-top!

""Some stories, the job is so clean, everything's arranged along an arc so bright that you can't see the carnage that went into making it.""How many books have been written about the rags to riches American Dream? The quest to succeed is a classic theme of literature, and this story is a realistic portrayal of chasing that dream. Many American dreams began across borders, in third world countries, such as Eastern Europe. The struggle to leave communism and embrace capitalism is one of bloodshed. Slattery's story takes us through the harsh Ukrainian and Romanian existence of the 20th century, before and after Stalin, and to South Side (Tremont) Cleveland, where much of the novel takes place.""It's the market for violence, and we're all involved: the mob, legitimate businesses, all of us. It's all for the money.""First, there's the narrator, whose voice is frank and informal. It is a let-me-tell-you-like-it-is kind of voice, one that lures you into the hundred-year history of the Hightowers, and their rise to wealth through organized crime. The patriarch, the original Peter Henry Hightower, was born Petro Garko in the mean streets of Cleveland, the son of Ukrainian immigrants. He eventually becomes a wealthy bootlegger, but his crimes don't stop there. And they didn't start without bloodshed. That is what this book illustrates--not just the sins of the father that get passed on, but what most wealth was made of, specifically early 20th century wealth in America. It wasn't just steel and railroads. There is blood on everyone's hands, no matter how removed from the direct violence. In the mid-nineties, the head is the White Lady, who doesn't pick up an instrument more lethal than a pen, an accounting book, or a phone. But, she profits in the crimes--of drugs, human trafficking, and organ harvesting.As the jacket blurb states, it is the story (partly) of two cousins born in different countries in the same year, 1968, with the same name, after their grandfather. Peter Hightower, son of Rufus, is a journalist in Granada, who has had a childhood of following his father on the lam--Cape Town, Harare, Lagos, Cairo, among others-- but not comprehending what it was all about. The other Peter, called Petey, son of hippie Muriel, was born in Cleveland, and segued into petty, and then organized crime, becoming a big shot like his grandfather. But, now his own sins are chasing him down, and, due to the mix-up of names, it is Peter, the honest journalist, who is on the run from assassins.Peter's father helps him get to America, to Cleveland, where he goes to search for answers about the history of his family. His aunts, Sylvie and Muriel, and his Uncle Henry, all have secrets, and Peter aims to get to the truth.My ancestors were Ukrainian, and I have read through some of the terror that they endured in their poverty and powerlessness under violent regimes. Slattery brings the Soviet Union to life, in all its graphic horror. Although many of the characterizations (including main characters) are fairly stock, the beautiful Romanian journalist, Madalina, is a gripping presence in the story. You know of her brutal fate from her introduction, yet her morale and spirit are so strong that I found myself believing that she might be saved. She was a strong moral center, as was Peter.This isn't a novel that you read for the characters, although they all have a part to play in illuminating the truth of how wealth is born and borne. You read this book for the chase, partly, but primarily for the themes of the self-made man and how the historical pursuit of affluence contains so much ruin. And you turn the pages learning of the savage consequences of conquest. Do the Hightowers flourish in the end? Are the descendants ensured safety--or will they be buried in their ancestor's crimes? The hydra-head of organized crime dominated the roots of our culture, and continues to rule the global economy. Slattery does a fantastic job of weaving it into the history of prosperity for the privileged few, and the widespread suffering of many.""Some of the people, in America and elsewhere, want to turn around; there must be a way back...to climb up the rim as its moving downward beneath them. Some of them are turning and facing it, to prepare their children for the harder world that's coming...How the people around them will become more vulnerable, more desperate...And...where they need to be to profit from it.""3.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 06, 2014","Sep 07, 2014","Sep 06, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20299702-the-family-hightower

That opened my eyes to the corruption, danger, and reggae music of the gang-infested island and its ghettos. Today, like many of us, I still sing and dance to the music of Bob Marley, whose artistry had more global influence than any musician I've heard then or since. The meaning of Marley's songs are entwined in James' daring book.Marlon James, a Jamaican-born writer of extraordinary imagination, places Marley in the center of his novel without giving him any dialogue. Bob Marley is where all roads lead back to in Kingston, figuratively speaking, and is known simply as the Singer. Rastas do not believe in conventional ""isms"" and schisms. Remember the song ""One Drop"" by Marley? (And, of course, the US government was over there to stop the Red threat of communism). Through James' book, many of the reggae singer's songs come to life through history, and the novel gives a fact-based historical context to an imaginative novel that leads from 1976 Jamaica to the 1980s crack houses in New York, and ends in 1991.The story's premise begins with an attempted assassination on Marley in 1976, which was ignited by rival gang kingpins. James explores the human condition of black, white, and the political colors (green/orange) among them through the minds of gang leaders, CIA agents, a Rolling stone journalist, and a young woman, Nina Burgess. She had a one-night stand with Marley, and tries to stay one step ahead of the island's instability but never fully leaves it all behind.There is a cast of 70+ characters, who (like Garcia-Marquez in One Hundred Years of Solitude) are listed at the front of the book. This will assist the reader to keep track of them and their locale. James writes in the patois of its people. His gift for language is stunning, but one needs to be dedicated and willing to indulge in James' detail and dialect. This is not a quick read. My patience paid off, and I was emotionally riveted by the complexity of the characters and their lives. James does not pander to any politics. He tells it like it is.

He allows the reader to form the visuals themselves that he graphically describes in print. Cronenberg leaves some psychological motivations to the imagination, but as far as vivid body mutilation, not much is left to ponder there. He captures it, almost casually, raw, and sometimes with an absurd delicacy. It isn’t for the weak of stomach or the faint of heart! And, like certain exotic diets, it won’t go down or digest well with everybody.Two photojournalist lovers, Naomi and Nathan, often communicate through their technology because they are usually traveling for work at different ends of the world. Here, Naomi is in Paris investigating a celebrity academic couple, Aristide and Célestine Arosteguy, existential and possibly nihilistic philosophers. An allegation that Aristide has killed his wife, mutilated her, and eaten her, is being investigated. Meanwhile, Nathan travels to Budapest to photograph an unlicensed surgeon perform cutting edge surgery on a young woman with breast cancer. How these two stories finally connect is through people, technology, a rare STD, North Korea, global politics, cannibalism, Body Integrity Disorder (particularly apotemnophilia) and Cronenberg's active, vivid imagination about the concept of beauty and artistic innovation.Cronenberg pulls off a quasi-linear narrative (albeit with some accessible jumps back in time to reveal history) that, while shocking, failed to really seduce me while I was reading it, fascinating though it was. It was cold, cerebral, and detached. However, I waited several days to write this  to see how it would linger in me. My conclusion is that the director was effective in transmitting florid and shadowy images behind my eyes, even as the characters fade. And, as a film director, it is what he does best. He frightens through hyper-surrealism, and leaves you with fears beyond the savage acts of his characters. The finale is both coy and suggestive, which conveys that the horror of being monitored, of privacy quashed by a terroristic government, may not be many steps apart from our society of social media fetishism. The crimes and the criminals have some blurry lines to navigate, and our obsession with images, the “other,” and social media have consequences.There are many themes to explore here, and Cronenberg is no doubt an intrepid genius and techno-obsessed (especially Apple and Nikon). I have to admit, though, that I didn’t enjoy this book, but was riveted by his combo of psychological and body horror, and felt compelled to see where it was going. Like watching surgery on LSD. I did feel that Cronenberg’s characters are largely straw-like—the relationships often felt contrived—selected only to further his themes and harrowing plot. Aristide did come alive, as did Sophie Roiphe, at intervals. But it was not enough to convince me to empathize. Of the Davids, I prefer Lynch.This is certainly a filmic book, in the Cronenberg-esque vintage way. And this may appeal to certain fans of the macabre. But, it is a matter of taste.

The crime itself is often less germane to the overall story than the psychological profiles of the people involved. In this book, there are definitely some straw characters (such as the police detective), which I accepted, because the main character, Riktor, a true loner, is so chilling and fascinating a protagonist that I was consumed with peeling away his layers. Fossum not only created a riveting character, she borders on farce by having Riktor arrested for a crime he didn’t do, all the while the egregious crimes he has committed go undetected. We peer inside his head and gasp in horror at his indignation at being accused, and yet his umbrage is tragically comical in Fossum’s representation of Riktor’s sociopathology. The less Riktor confesses to the reader, and the less insight he has about the world around him, the more we get to know him. When he does admit to us his crimes, we become horrified at his pervasive cognitive dissonance. He is a nurse working with geriatric patients in a nursing home, many who are close to death; his views on death are the clues to his pathology.The entire novel is told from Riktor’s point of view. The prose is lean and assured, and Rikto’s voice is subversive and contagious. As he finds himself in a cat-and mouse situation, the reader’s pulse quickens to match Riktor’s. The supporting characters, quirky--but far les dimensional, do enliven the plot. The only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is because the novel is entirely interior to one character, and therefore confined. This is just a personal preference, and I want to convey that this is not a flaw in Fossum’s writing. However, my reading predilection is generally for a more expansive cast. For Fossum fans, this is a must.

Most of us do not have any reason to deal with the Department of Family Services in our state, but in my job as a psychiatric pediatric RN in Austin, I have my fair share of in- and out-of-state hook-ups (on the phone, or they come to us). Here in the outback bergs of Montana, Pete Snow, Bachelor of Social Work (drop-out of the master's program) is the go-to person for the most extreme and sometimes most dangerous cases involving crises and sometimes threats to life. An alcoholic whose partying wife has left him and taken their teenage daughter, Pete has a pretty sorry excuse for a personal life, except for his loyalty to a few friends and the hard cases he works.In his work, Pete gets the job done. His tools are his clipboard and pen, and if the law shows up with a gun, he uses his wiles to disarm them. Usually. His clients are typically poverty-stricken and lawless, and dependent on the system that they resent; the children are the ones that Pete wants to help the most, the often innocent and vulnerable that are headed for a lifetime of institutional living. To his irresponsible wife, he has said, ""I take kids away from people like us."" His daughter has run away while in the care of his ex-, and now he is desperate to find her, while still invested in his work at home. In the meantime, he is shutting out his brother, an outlaw on the run. Snow's no hero--perhaps a flawed anti-hero. He should be more jaded than he is, but that is Snow's endearing quality--he just never gives up, on his daughter or his cases:""...these absences were twinned in Pete's mind as if the one could not be solved without the other, and he harbored the absurd hope that the revelation of the one would reveal the other.""The two cases he struggles with are Cecil, a violent and sexually deviant son of an abusive parent, and a feral child named Benjamin, who lives in the wilderness with his anarchist, survivalist father, Jeremiah Pearl. Pearl is already a living legend, haven taken American coins and punched holes in the presidents' heads; the coins have made their way around pawnshops and collectors. Jeremiah spouts an extreme Christian dogma that may be dangerous to himself, his son, and the world at large, including Pete.It becomes evident that Pete Snow is compelled by his isolation and connection to the fringes of society. He lives in a primitive cabin (no electricity) in Tenmile, and showers at the courthouse. They put up with Snow's eccentricities and the way he pushes the envelope because his compassion and dedication is consummate and tireless.This is a sweeping tale about tough human questions, such as: what freedoms are compromised for assistance--for food, clothing, and essentials? What price do people pay to meet Maslow's lowest hierarchy of needs? Is it fair to force someone with crushing demons into a society that demonizes and crushes him even more? Can you effectively help others when your own life and family is falling apart? The big questions of sovereignty, safety, family, and the pursuit of, well, individual liberty, is well wrought and teeming with moral ambiguity.Smith Henderson knows his geographical areas. He is from Montana, and participated in the Michener Writer's program here in Austin, where part of the novel takes place. This confidently written, brutal, take-no-prisoners tale does not read like a debut novel. I know that Smith worked at a juvenile group home, a superb place to gather grit for this kind of story, to study the characters of children living outside of societal norms. It is well-plotted, focusing on character, but building to a nail-biting conclusion....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Jun 2014,"Aug 16, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18651980-fourth-of-july-creek

I suspected that it would be a character study more than anything else, and in that I was correct. Eric, a small-town lawyer in Maine, finds himself half-reluctantly helping a vagrant-looking young woman after he has an odd experience with her in a grocery store. He follows her out to a rural and isolated cabin in the woods, as the snowstorm of the century (or ever!) begins to pile it higher and deeper. He intends to be the gentleman that he is and help this raggedy, dirty, disheveled woman; yet, the more he reaches out to Danielle, the more it is evident that he is a needy case, also. Danielle’s flinty, nihilistic voice is a compelling contrast to Eric’s more pathetic and tender one. He is hanging on to an obviously finished marriage with a denial and hope that is transparently futile (to everyone but him), and also reaching out to Danielle for friendship. However, Danielle is guarded at best, and generally caustic, pushing Eric away with her volatile behavior and harsh words. Eric’s life is like an open book, while Danielle’s is a closed and secret history, revealing itself gradually toward its obliquely foreshadowed but shocking conclusion. The auguring serves to authenticate the climax without ruining it.In the meantime, as the storm gets more severe, the cabin they are sequestered in starts to groan, hiss, creak, and croak. (Eric’s car, with his cell phone in it, has been towed from where he parked it—there’s a story behind that.) As the novel progresses, the cabin itself becomes like a character, a vulnerable one victimized by the snowstorm. Roorbach mixes levity with horror as Eric and Danielle’s lives become increasingly imperiled. Their opposite natures are inclined to avalanche, until it becomes clear that they are going to have to establish a sense of working together in order to survive.Roorbach creates penetrating and realistic characters. The theme of survival is both literal and metaphorical, as Eric and Danielle struggle to maintain safety and life, while any higher purposes that they possess are disclosed and put to a tense and high-wire test. At times, I wanted the plot to move along more swiftly, especially when more predictable events occurred and threatened to stagnate the story. Also, my engagement with these two stunted adults sometimes bordered on my own groans and creaks. Once the reader’s insight reaches a peak, there’s a certain amount of impatience, waiting for the characters’ get-a-clue to kick in. Her “strange retractable beauty” and his tendency toward masochism periodically stretched my own tolerance limits.

I remember, when I read Marilynne Robinson’s GILEAD, feeling immediately that I was in the presence of a great author. With Hellenga’s novel, (and this is my first by him), I was instantly engaged, but it wasn’t until the halfway point that I realized how stunning this book was, and consequential.Frances lives with ongoing doubt regarding her faith. She’s from a strait-laced Polish Catholic family in small-town Illinois, her mother especially traditional. But Frances sought to be a scholar, which creates a more expansive intellect—and with that comes dubiety. In the 60’s,when she has an affair with her college Shakespeare professor, Paul, she tries to shake him off before her two-month trip to Rome to study spoken Latin. Later, she marries him, but not until after their daughter, Stella, was born (Paul had to get a divorce first). That’s two transgressions right there!The first-person narrative is intimate and palpable, as if Frances is talking directly to you. It is laid out like a confessional memoir, which she calls a spiritual autobiography.“All narrators are first-person narrators. You can’t get ironic distance from yourself, can’t see around yourself, can’t know more than you know.”As the confessions progress, the tension rises. The erudition isn’t distracting—rather, the allusions piqued my interest, while adding texture and depth to the story. Everything from Latin, the Classics, Shakespeare, opera, classical music, and piano tuning is folded in neatly and compellingly. The events that cause colossal self-doubt, guilt about her last months with Paul, guilt about not having guilt, and concern for Stella adds piercing poignancy. Her combative conversations with God—which, in my estimation, are to be taken figuratively—buttress the weight of the novel while giving it levity.An added bonus for me is the inclusion of Santa Maria Trastevere, a baroque church in Rome that is probably my most treasured edifice anywhere. When I visited this astonishing basilica, it poetically/spiritually brought me to my knees (and I am a secular Jew)! Hellenga’s incorporation of the church in the story stole my heart.Finally, the most provocative theme of this book, to me, was the idea that “answers” aren’t necessarily the element you are looking for. Rather, it is the questions.

The Internet dried up, and the scramble to peaceably and comfortably exist was running on empty. Although it doesn’t state definitively what occurred, it is evident that climactic conditions and carbon footprints were involved.“…LA’s chewed-up streets or its shuttered stores or its sagging houses. All those dead lawns…people starving on the sidewalks…the city wasn’t just sick, it was dying.”Cal and Frida live in a remote landscape in solitude, until they find one family a bit further away. But, when Frida determines that she is pregnant, they decide to venture out into a more established community that they learn about from their new friends. Having to rely on each other for all their emotional needs can be dicey; periodically, the differences in their outlooks caused problems psychologically and emotionally. When they arrive at the new grounds and community, they discover that the charismatic leader's identity is a huge coincidence, one that, honestly, created an eye-rolling groan for me. It was a gimmick that cheapened the story, in my opinion. However, I was able to remain generally engaged in the day-to-day events of Cal and Frida's life. Often, it had a soap-opera-ish feel to it, and read more like a domestic drama for young adults, with the adolescent type of flirtations and triangulations inherent to that group. Also, the dystopian nomenclature tries a little too hard.Periodically, I felt that Lupecki was shuffling too many ideas at once, muddying the locus of the story. Some of the inclusions, like the retrospect to the college that Cal went to, were weighed as more important than it came across, i.e., it was convenient as a meeting ground for various characters, but the details about life at the school seemed superfluous or telegraphed. Often, events and disclosures didn't feel organically compelling; rather, the author had a tendency toward amplifying scenarios that were aimed at convincing the reader of more substance than the moments actually conveyed.The blurbs for this book—“Breathtakingly original, utterly gripping, inventive, arresting”—even comparisons to Cormac McCarthy and Lorrie Moore—created some high expectations in me that were not fulfilled. This was far from original—in fact, I found it pretty derivative, an imitative Margaret Atwood type story that didn’t measure up. Most of the characters felt secondhand, except for August, the enigmatic, wayfaring, mule-riding trader, whose agenda is mysterious. The prose was serviceable, but the atmosphere, rather than “darkly arresting,” was more airy. The author appeared to be petitioning the reader to believe in the characters’ authenticity. In Lupecki’s defense, she does have some fair storytelling abilities that kept me reading until the last page. And, despite the largely hereditary plot, I was pleasantly surprised by the denouement, which kept some options open and provoked contemplation.

I enjoyed his revisionist history of Abe Lincoln and the thorny disputes and complexities of abolition and economics, as well as the passionate way he evoked the Executive decision-making. The premise, whereby Lincoln survived Booth’s assassination attempt, was of course, fiction, but otherwise, it was entirely plausible and filled with historical truths and events. Here, Carter is at it again, reimagining events, while keeping aspects of historical background credible.Set amidst the Cold War and Kennedy’s crucial, pivotal days in negotiating with the Russians, the eponymous title refers to a covert conduit between Kennedy and Khruschev, a secret avenue of communication and negotiation that was initiated in order to avert full-scale war with the Russians. Carter, whose love for chess is used both literally and figuratively here, as in many of his novels, does a superb job of keeping the stand-off tense, one move at a time, even though we know how it turned out historically. (And, in his editor’s note, he reveals that there was a back channel, although not with a nineteen-year-old black, female college student).The preponderance of the novel was centered on the chosen student, Margo Jensen, the comely 19-year-old sophomore at Cornell. Although it is difficult to swallow that a young, inexperienced college student was the conduit for these secret negotiations, Carter succeeded in making me root for her. Through progressively perilous experiences, Margo loses her innocence and cultivates a refinement in the game of espionage, a trait that appears to be in her blood. The backstory of her father, an unsung hero of the Great War, adds suspense and excitement.The editor’s note or afterward is a pleasure, allowing the reader a bit of insight into the author’s technique and design for his story—the wending of fact and fiction. If you are already a Carter fan, you will likely enjoy this book.

He takes you into a surreal world, where dreams and reality overlap, classical and jazz music is imbued, and the lonely hero has a soulful journey enriched by his subconscious provocations. His latest novel is tightly focused, more tautly controlled than any of his others that I have read. It concerns railroad station engineer and loner Tsukuru Tazaki, a thirty-six-year-old at a liminal stage between letting go and going forward. He resides in Tokyo and left his hometown of Nagoya when he went to college.Sixteen years ago, our hero’s tightly knit group of four best friends (two other males, two females) ousted him for no discernible reason during his college sophomore summer break (age twenty). The novel opens with Tsukuru’s melancholy and suicidal thoughts, and leads us to the present, where he approaches life with detachment. Now, at thirty-six, he can’t seem to fully expose himself to the vulnerability of love and fulfillment unless he resolves the burning issue of why he was banned all those years ago. This book is his pilgrimage toward wholeness.Tsukuru has always considered himself an empty vessel—“colorless Tskuru Tazaki”—his name has no color, while the other four friends’ names did. His name signifies “to build,” an apt one for him, who builds for a living. Yet, he feels like a failure, unable to connect meaningfully with other people. (Even his memories of his father are inadequate). He insists that he was inferior to his colorful, vivid group of teenage friends. To himself, he is hollow, a cipher. Now, Tsukuru is on the verge of a serious romance with a somewhat mysterious woman named Sara, which could be sabotaged by his mental state. Sara, knowingly, prompts and inspires him to resolve his past.There are powerful epiphanies, which engage the theme, (such as on page 322), which I think some readers will be compelled to include in their . However, Tsukuru’s journey is a paced process, and it is imperative that the reader engage with the hero’s odyssey step by step, and (in my opinion) not reveal these later insights that bubble up toward the conclusion. However, it doesn’t hurt to know that the musical theme of the book is Listz’s Années de pèlerinage (Years of Pilgrimage), le mal du pays (Suite 1: Switzerland), especially as played by Lazar Berman. (All three suites are inevitably “heard” in the novel). I have now listened to it several times (on YouTube). It is a perfect metaphor for this book—elegant, melancholy, reflective, subtly captivating.“Le mal du pays…usually it is translated as ‘homesickness…’it’s more like ‘a groundless sadness called forth in a person’s heart by a pastoral landscape.’ It’s a hard expression to translate accurately.”The above is a splendid description for Tsukuru's state of mind, the homesickness a figurative symbol for the four friends from Nagoya, the Liszt piece a consummate harmony for the novel. I suggest listening to it while in the midst of reading this book. It led me to deep-seated places, and palpably brought forth both sorrow and bittersweet buoyancy. I immersed myself into Tsukuru's provocative dreams, and his haunted soul. The universal theme of closure is enhanced by Murakami's hypnagogic imagination. The past, present, and future does a temporal twirl. A wonderfully balanced book!

It takAs I was reading this book, I kept thinking of how it evolved like an indie movie with Greta Gerwig and Miranda July, or a Carey Mulligan type. It takes some conventional tropes of fiction and edge-cuts it with less plot, and lots of inner dialogue, as well as tart conversations. The story could be a soap opera, if done in the prevailing decorous style. Instead, it focuses on the friendship of primarily two thirty-year-old women, Bev and Amy, who met at a job at a publishing firm. They both left there for different reasons, and remain close, until the relationship is challenged when one of them becomes pregnant after a one-night stand. I hail the author for not having men come to the rescue (which is refreshing). The locus is on friendship, and a deeper exploration of what we want and need from each other, and from ourselves. It also examines how we mirror and reflect the people in life we choose as close friends. It also probes the external forces that bind us to convention while struggling to be authentic.“…I’m talking about this weird vapidity that woman seem to aspire to…This kind of Us magazine editorial voice that infects people’s actual conversations and lives. Just fetishizing children and domesticity and making it seem like they are the…only legitimate goals women’s lives can have.”Bev and Amy are struggling to create careers and find love. Amy, on her rise to the top in the blogging world, made some enemies, moved on to a different job, and remains unhappy in her work. She feels entitled to a more luminous career. Bev left graduate school in creative writing after a year, and is floundering in temp jobs, and ruminating about an old romance that went sour. A third party, Sally, complicates their solidarity, as does Sally’s husband, Jason. Sally and Jason represent that wealthy and “arrived” status that Emily and Bev have been striving for--or against.It’s a swift, upmarket beach read, but not shallow. It removes the gloss and poof of shows like Sex and the City, which has caused a whole generation of young, single women to think that living in NYC is sexy and romantic. FRIENDSHIP demonstrates the often stressful, financially strapping, and lonely life of this glamorized city. Contemporary and biting, Gould’s novel of women on the precipice is engaging and honest. Can a friendship at a crossroads toward maturity survive diametrically opposed points of view? Life choices, bonding, betrayals, and growing-up are challenges to Amy and Bev—“allies in a world full of idiots and enemies.”...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Jun 26, 2014","Jun 27, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18490619-friendship

Last year, the most popular and good-looking student, Chris Harper, was killed. His murderer has never been identified. Now, Harper's file is in the Dublin Cold Case department, and Detective Stephen Moran, who is aiming for the Murder Squad, receives a clue from Holly, who ditched school to seek him out. The clue was a picture of Chris and some alarming words attached in cut up letters from a book, tacked up on the secret school corkboard, otherwise known as the Secret Place. That was the headmistress's idea--that board for students, a place to vent about anything anonymously. But, the kids know, nothing is anonymous for long.The headmistress, Eileen McKenna, sure doesn't want the police lurking once again, potentially spoiling business. Last year, after the murder, several parents removed their kids. Holly and her three best friends insisted on staying. But as Moran finds his opportunity to team up with Detective Antoinette Conway, the partner-less Murder Squad leader, St. Kilda's is once again invaded by a police investigation, which is never good for the school's reputation.The story alternates back and forth between Moran/Conway, and Holly and her classmates. The narrative often bleeds together when the detectives are interviewing the St Kilda's population, and time shifts seamlessly between past and present. It is a contiguous and flowing style of voices/points of view, as well as alternation of time. And, although the teenagers are a substantial part of the story, this is not a YA novel. The characters are complex, and there is no simplification of text toward younger audiences. However, sophisticated YA readers may enjoy the relatable aspects of adolescent angst.Tana French is a dexterous, talented craftswoman and imaginative storyteller, my personal front-runner mystery writer of the 21st century. Her exceptional gift with words and imagery establishes her work in the category of literature, not genre mystery. However, she is one of the most intimate writers I've read--she is here for the reader who desires a penetrating, psychological character study couched in a mystery/suspense story. She also possesses a flair for ambiguity, which will keep you thinking and wondering, even after the very end. Like life, not everything is tied in a bow; it's more like a knot. However, readers will be amply satisfied with sufficient answers, unlike her first book, IN THE WOODS (although, personally, I liked the ambiguous ending of that book). French fans don't need any early s to line up for her latest jewel. Most of us can't stand the wait between books! For French newbies, you are in for a tantalizing treat.Addendum: it isn't necessary to read French's books in order, but I would recommend the first two being read in order.

You’ll like it if you can engage with the only main character, twenty-eight-year-old Elyria (named after a town in Ohio that her mother never visited). She abruptly leaves her comfortable life in Manhattan, and her job as a CBS soap opera writer, and her husband, a math professor. They had both experienced a similar tragedy that stripped their souls, and for that they bonded—and, for that, Elyria couldn’t take it any more, after six years. “I want to be that person, part of a respectable people, but I also want nothing to do with being people, because to be people is to be breakable…”Elyria takes off for New Zealand, without even giving a heads up to her husband. She is seeking, searching, for her truest self, and attempting to unscramble the cognitive dissonance between her outer and inner selves. She senses what she calls the wildebeest in her, caught between two impulses of wanting to be here in love and wanting to walk away like it never happened. Her way of thinking is often circuitous and epigrammatic, such as “…and it seems the wildebeest was what was wrong with me, but I wasn’t entirely sure of what was wrong with the wildebeest.” This strain of opposites and paradox filled out Elyria’s psyche and also made her feel shriveled.There isn’t really a plot, but there is certainly a journey—a journey through many remote, farmland areas of New Zealand as Elyria tempts fate by hitchhiking, and the inner stream of consciousness that is her thoughts and feelings. “I looked back at him like I didn’t have any trouble to tell because that’s my trouble, I thought, not knowing how to tell it…”So Elyria tells us her story, her journey, the recursive thoughts, the pain from her former tragedy; the inability to deal with loss, the pain of being with her husband and the pain of being without him, the loneliness of being without people and the loneliness of being with them.I felt that I was walking through a surreal landscape, dreamscape, pain-scape, like a cemetery of Elyria’s heart, buffered by her poetic and melancholy soul. Occasionally, it was bleakly witty, but always there was a tugging on my spirit, the knottiness and heaviness of this woman and her loss. Lacey’s debut novel was open, vulnerable, a dark glass. She captures the fragility of the human condition; I hope her next effort will carry it further, to more expansive connections. Don’t look for redemption here.“…to love someone is to know that one day you’ll have to watch them break unless you do first…”...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,"Jun 24, 2014","Jun 24, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18490560-nobody-is-ever-missing

The Georgia Flu has wiped out 99% of the population faster than you can say Captain Trips. However, this isn’A pandemic has all but annihilated life. The Georgia Flu has wiped out 99% of the population faster than you can say Captain Trips. However, this isn’t a supernatural horror and political story with larger-than-life characters; it is a quiet, introspective character study that takes place during the pre-and post-apocalypse. It opens with the polestar character, fifty-one-year-old celebrity actor Arthur Leander, dying onstage during a performance of King Lear. Arthur’s death is witnessed by everyone at the theater, including Kirsten Raymonde, an eight-year-old actress; Jeevan, a former paparazzi turned paramedic who tried to save Arthur’s life; and Arthur’s present lover, Tanya. During the course of the novel, we also meet Arthur’s three ex-wives, his former best friend, and a prophet, (among other people). Station Eleven refers to a graphic novel written and illustrated by one of Arthur’s ex-wives, a story about a space station existing in a journeying state after aliens have invaded Earth. Generally, with an apocalyptic novel, the central theme is survival. Yet, in Mandel’s novel, three words are often repeated: “Survival is insufficient.” This is about finding art, beauty, and music after the end of the world as we know it, an appreciation of culture within the spare and bleak void of civilization. In fact, it is about creating ways to connect to others, and evolving past mere survival, and joining through a society that includes artistic expression and entertainment. This includes a traveling symphony/Shakespeare acting troupe that travels via horse power, literally, and connects with others in different locales through the medium of stage and music. On the dark side of things is a cult of propagandists who believe that this plague was God-driven, to cleanse the earth, and that the survivors are the chosen ones. The self-made prophet is a charismatic who seeks to control others and spread his dogma.Arthur, as the central character, links to all the others in the cast. Gradually, the disparate souls are tied together. Not neatly, but rather, in the messy and complicated way we know of as life. There are brilliantly beautiful, elegiac images, such as the many grounded airplanes lined up on the tarmac of an airport; the snowstorm that falls on the day the pandemic sweeps the planet; and a haunting night scene illuminating a fleet of ships laid at anchor off the coast of Malaysia. The story, if it had been linearly told, wouldn’t amount to much. It is Mandel’s structure that gives STATION ELEVEN its heft and haunting beauty. She bridges the past and the present (which is 20 years after the pandemic) by combining memories of the main characters and the tough inner and outer roads that they now travel.The majority of it takes place right before the pandemic and the subsequent twenty years (now called Year Twenty in the new civilization). Mandel pays tribute to some other dystopian novels, such as (my favorite) Justin Cronin’s, THE PASSAGE, and a Star Trek Voyager episode # 122, from which the “survival is insufficient” quote is taken.This is a dark and bittersweet novel that stirs hope over nihilism, radiance beyond rage, and knowledge that transcends ignorance. Union is a universal value rooted in our nature and communion with the world, and understood through play and expression. Through art and music, the characters in STATION ELEVEN approach a universal spirituality that sustains them, even while sinister forces threaten them with captivity. Mandel conceives of a world that once was, is no more, and is just beginning. Even after the apocalypse, there is “too much world,” as she quotes from Czeslaw Milosz’ “The Separate Notebooks.” It is up to those that are left to shape it into a place that we can access, and to connect to each other. There is no artificial light anymore in Mandel’s world, so that the night is a limitless black; therefore, the stars shine the brightest white....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,not set,Jul 2014,"Jun 24, 2014",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/20262706-station-eleven

The commitment to a concrete supremacy may be the characters’ noose around their necks, but it is inherent to their principles to wear obedience like a second skin, whether it is the law, religion, marriage, or even the exacting notation of classical music. High Court Judge Fiona Maye rules in the Family Division in London. The short book opens up on what I’d call a sandwich day. It is between two tough cases for Fiona—one from the past, concerning the right to save one Siamese twin by shutting off life support for another. The parents’ strict religious beliefs contradicted medicine. This case was a media sensation, and Fiona hasn’t yet emotionally recovered. In fact, she hasn’t had sex with her husband since then. And she’s about to rule on another case where science and religion lock horns, a life-or-death decision on whether to obligate a Jehovah’s Witness family to permit a life-saving blood transfusion for their son. And now, on the Sunday before this is all to begin, Fiona’s husband, Jack, announces that he intends to have a fling with a young woman, to experience passion again before he dies. At 59, he feels that he and Fiona have become too much like siblings, as marriages are wont to do after thirty years. But he wants to stay married, “I want everything the same. No deception.” What an exhilarating opening!The irony of being a Family Law judge is not lost on Fiona, who is childless because her professional ambitions always took precedence. She has periodically considered how her decisions created empty spaces in the marriage, especially now as she grapples with Jack’s freshly declared lifestyle resolution, an unacceptable choice in Fiona’s judgment. And, now, shattered and betrayed, she must walk into Family court and shake off any biases that could potentially affect her decisions on families, many of the rulings being divorces and custody arrangements. I was engaged sufficiently with Fiona’s concerns and dilemmas to accept McEwan’s convenient polarity device of religion. He is a master with narrative, and in lesser hands, an author may have bent to the lowest common denominator. But not McEwan. For one thing, he doesn’t make it easy on anyone, including the reader. The court may be secular in nature, but “courts should be slow to intervene in the interests of the child against the religious principles of the parents.” Unless religion interferes in a way that is “immoral or socially obnoxious,” the courts are hesitant to rule against the authority of religion in a family that demands religious obedience.I even questioned my own sense of justice a few times. The story emphasizes that it is imperative to adhere to lawfulness in the courts, and not be swayed by personal values. The author is sensitive and nuanced on his main religious characters—the father and son—-and if any readers think that the scales were already tipped one way or another, they were ahead of me. McEwan wrote a little drily when he provided legal clarity, but he was succinct in informing the reader, and the storyline inevitably trumped polemics. The dynamics between Fiona and the seventeen-year-old Jehovah’s Witness, Adam Henry, is the fuel that gives the story its potent energy. As far as Fiona and Jack, I felt somewhat detached, and recognized that it primarily provided state of mind for Fiona, which gave suspense to how she may react in court, and toward Adam. However, Jack was mostly a cipher to me. The characters, other than Fiona and Adam, were largely peripheral. In fact, I felt that the presence of music had more character than most of the cast in the book. Music was the metaphor--maybe an allegory--of Fiona’s inclination toward strict obedience. Whereas Jack adored the jazz masters, Fiona not only revered the classical artists, she even performed them with with a tenor-voiced barrister within her narrow circle of judicial friends. As noted years ago:“No pulse, no instinct for syncopation, no freedom, her fingers numbly obedient to the time signature and notes as written. That was why she was studying law…Respect for the rules.”Obedience, in this story, is the dark muse of Fiona and Adam. Adam, while accepting death as an acceptable outcome to a higher purpose, is so full of life and vigor, learning violin and writing poetry, that he is an enigma that contravenes his reverence. McEwan, in fleshing out his story, illuminates that the rule of family law and obedience to authority is rife with ambiguity and chaos.""…a professional life spent above the affray, advising then judging, loftily commenting in private on the viciousness and absurdity of divorcing couples, and now she was down there with the rest, swimming with the desolate tide.""

Here, too, his themes are largely about the displacement of foreigners. In this case, the protagonist and unnamed narrator, a New York attorney, was born in Switzerland and raised in the US. (A bit of cheeky irony--we don't know his name, but we do know his alter ego or alias). He was hired by an obscenely wealthy Lebanese family to move to Dubai and act in the role of fiduciary and legal overseer--Family Officer--of their funds. They also ask him to keep a close eye on and mentor one of their 17 year-old family members, an indolent boy that lacks ambition.O'Neil's urbane postmodern writing is both sardonic and sad, yet there was no escape from the increasingly foul funk of it. At its best, he echoes a combination of Kafka, Thomas Pynchon, and even George Orwell (in his auguring humor). His depiction of the class system and byzantine legalese of Dubai is nothing short of brilliant. ""...for the non-national the emirate is a vast booby trap of medieval judicial perils, and Johnny Foreigner must especially take great care in interactions with local citizens...because de facto there is one law for Abdul Emerati and another for Johnny Foreigner..."" However, his turgidity, combined with the relentless repugnance of the narrative, was wearying. he is a polished writer, but of tasteless content.O'Neil uses shock value at the mid-point of the novel, perhaps to resuscitate it from flat-lining. The narrator enjoys his afternoon Internet porn following his noontime bathroom constitutional. However, the lurid vileness that he added to the porn disengaged me from the character. On the other hand, I have to hand it to O'Neil--he bravely pushes the envelope of human depravity. But...why? It's deeply superficial; he is teasing the reader to be hip enough to accept his brand of purposeless vulgarity.The narrator's break-up with his girlfriend, a lawyer he met in the Manhattan law firm he worked out, is detailed in the problems that drove them apart. O'Neil did a stellar job of making the reader uncomfortable, observing very private things behind closed doors. He adds on a little mystery with the case of the missing scuba diver, Ted Wilson, and then (purposely) turns us off with the narrator's interactions with Wilson's wife. And then there is a place he refers to as Project X, a building project that he desires to know more about. As far as the attempted levity related to his periodic pedicures, it was thoroughly lost on me.If you are looking for a plot, you won't find it here. It is largely a Kafkaesque study of the labyrinth legal and social system of the UAE, as well as a soul-stripping story of our hero's loneliness. Too, it illuminates the crushing of the human psyche and dignity.

The deep cut goes back almost 100 years, to 1900, but you have to get backwards via forward progression of pages. Makkai did a bold and brave thing in her narrative, inverting the timeline, which starts in 1999. Section two starts in 1955, section three in 1929, and the prologue, where the beginning of the tale ends, or the end begins, is set in 1900. This story in no way resembles the narrative style of her first charming book, THE BORROWER, a tender but easily accessible caper-cum-coming of age tale. As these pages move forward/backward, the story gets denser, with gothic filigree, and I had to concentrate (in fact, a second reading would help me tie the looser ends). The thread that heads back one hundred years looks not so much like a straight line as it does an elaborate cat’s cradle. Or Chinese boxes. And don't look for a haunted house/horror tale in the conventional sense. It isn't nail-biting, gasp-inducing horror. But it is mercurial.The centerpiece that embraces the story is the house, on an estate named Laurelfield, near Chicago, now 100 years old and once an art colony for writers, artists, dancers, and musicians. However, by 1955, it was closed down. One thing that survived is a haunting oil painting of ancestor Violet Devohr, a portrait that doesn't follow you with her eyes; rather, you can’t even stand at an angle that directs her vision towards you. It’s a different kind of creepy. Violet supposedly killed herself in the attic.Zee, Violet’s great-granddaughter, a scholar on Marxism, is reluctantly living in the next-door coach house in 1999 with her husband, Doug, who is keen to get in the attic of the main house and search through papers to find information on the homosexual poet, Edwin Parffit, a former member of the art colony. Doug is writing a book on him, but is suffering from writer’s block, so he’s doing hobbyist work for a series of YA books, and hiding this embarrassing information from his wife. Zee is slowly unraveling, almost like a nineteenth century or early 20th century heroine. The matriarch, Zee’s mother, is mum and guarded about the attic and most things about the house’s history. The section ends with lots of unanswered questions and a few trails on the interconnected road to yesteryear.Section two, the shortest (other than the prologue) and most acutely intense, focuses on Zee's ancestors. The threads from section I tie around, and lead to even more baffling and cryptic questions, which are revealed in various ways as we visit the art colony in the final section, in 1929. The characters from the past 100 years mirror and appear in different guises, connections, and descendants, supplying the fuel for this metafictional comedy of manners. The prologue, although only a few pages, is a hot coal of lore and lowdown.The response to this book is going to be divided, I am certain. Those seeking a more lightweight read may be disappointed in its dense complexity of story, which combines farce, satire, gravity, even violence. It takes patience and dedication to read this circuitously constructed tale. But, I love that Makkai is, like her first book, impassioned about the importance of the arts, which comes to light in the poignant telling of the art colony. However, I want to give a heads up--not to convince you to read this book, but to hopefully help in your decision-making on whether this is a book for you.I was struck by the quote about Daphne that begins the book, from Ovid’s Metamorphosis—“Nothing of her was left, except her shining loveliness.” Although I have yet to read Ovid, I was entranced by Bernini’s sculpture, Apollo and Daphne, at the Galleria Borghese in Rome. This quote, magnified for me by Bernini’s artistic devotion to Daphne’s enigma, is an uncanny key to the novel’s themes. Rebecca Makkai is a commanding writer--whimsical yet dense--a romp, but one with gravitas.

There's a handful of authors whose entire oeuvre I have read, and Robbins is one of them. He got me through college, some low times, and some high times. He authored my favorite quote, which I continue to utter: ""It's never too late to have a happy childhood.""--Still Life with Woodpecker.Austin, Texas, as he writes in his ""un-memoir,"" is where he first truly recognized his influence on the hipper generation of those of us who at least shared the same spiritual zip code. I wasn't there for that five-hour book signing where young college girls bared their breasts for the inking of his name--but, my future ex-boyfriend was, and he was who turned me on to the wooly, quixotic imagination of TR. (I will always thank him for that). Tom Robbins celebrates the magic of the paradox, the fault line between the absurd and the tender, the laugh out loud and the Sirius, the cosmic pumpkin, the anthropomorphic hyperbole, the beet, the bean, the jelly doughnut and, alas, the tomato sandwich.Was this book a little bit varnished? Revisionist? Hmmmm...I think so. In his eighties now, I think Tom wants to mitigate rather than underscore some of the wilder times he had with, say, the McKenna brothers. He even got close to the edge of cloying at intervals, especially when he became his own apologist, or minimized the important role that hallucinogens played in his life (at times in this book he was playing both ends against the middle on that score). And he over-explained himself when he didn't need to.Yet, if you are a unabashed TR fan, this book will offer a lot of playful pauses, if not the outright pandemonium of the heart, mind and spirit that I experienced with his novels.

WIn homage to his father, who was an Australian POW during WW II under the Japanese, Flanagan wrote this novel about people on both sides of the war. What is provocative is that the eponymous title is taken from the enduring 17th century Japanese poet, Bashō; the title is a haibun (combining haiku and prose), which commemorates the Japanese spirit. The Australian POWs were forced into slave labor to build the Burma Railway Line, or the ""Death Railway."" In other words, the Japanese ""spirit"" here was to crown the Emperor with this rail line, no matter if they had to beat, starve, and impose the most horrifying living conditions on the POWs. However, Flanagan nuanced his historical novel, a true masterpiece, with a number of contradictions within the book, often philosophical contradictions, and the title seems to be in the timbre of Flanagan's purposeful incongruities. The sum of its parts equal an astonishing, extraordinary whole.""...all life is only allegory and the real story is not here...it was like the long autumn of a dying world.""And:""...all his life had been a journeying to this point when he had for a moment flown into the sun and would now be journeying away from it forever after. Nothing would ever be as real to him. Life never had such meaning again.""These quotes come in the first few pages, when the protagonist, Dorrigo Evans, is an old man (the first quote) and a young lad. The first lines of the book harken to the bible--""Why at the beginnings of things is there always light?"" and Dorrigo cradling a football in the light of the sun, which, several times throughout the novel is referred to as a moment that he had when he stole from the sun.A bulk of the novel takes place in the POW camp, where Dorrigo is a surgeon working in an operating theatre with very few tools, and coarse, crude instruments made of kitchen ware or things found in scraps or nature. Dorrigo and the soldiers he was traveled seven miles/day under the most profound physical atrocities in order to build this railway line. The men had names like Rabbit Hendricks, Chum Fahey, Tiny Middleton, Darky Gardiner--Pynchonian names that stuck with me as I read. The novel itself begins in an almost disjointed manner, more so for me because I was unfamiliar with this Australian history. I paused a few times in the first 50 or so pages to bone up on Wikipedia and other sources. But, by page 60, it began to collate.Time moves in a surreal fashion, back and forth but yet seamlessly, as if the different times didn't really matter, because it moved in the realm of a philosophy of life, part existential, part mystical, an intersection or a paradox of nihilism and open-hearted beauty. The life led by Dorrigo and his mates was very physical, graphic and harrowing. And it was juxtaposed beautifully with a love affair that Dorrigo had with a woman named Amy Mulvaney, who was married to his uncle. Dorrigo himself had a wife, Ella, but his thoughts always turned to Amy.""His army life...When he looked at patients they were just windows through which he saw her and only her.""And Amy: ""...love was the universe touching, exploding within one human being, and that person exploding into the universe. It was annihilation, the exploder of worlds.""In the camp, the narrative refers to the Line as more than a railroad. Not just the horrifying conditions, but the fact that men walked in columns, a linear line, so to speak. Yet, the novel itself pays tribute to Japanese poetry, such as Shisui's death poem, a circle, something eternal. On his death bed, the 18th century haiku poet painted a circle (the drawing reproduced in the novel).""Shisui's poem rolled through Dorrigo Evans' subconscious, a contained void, an endless mystery, lengthless breadth, the great wheel, eternal return: the circle--antithesis of the line.""And that is what underscored everything for me as I read this novel. The forward progression under duress, with death as the finite point, and the philosophizing of the circular, endless, eternal. Dorrigo, his mates, his women--all searching for meaning, and often arriving at contradictions, narrated with astounding prose by Flanagan. It's the search for the meaning of existence, and periodically the rejection of it. Woven in the story are sections wherein the Japanese officers and guards are focused on, both during the war and afterwards. One of the cameo characters, a Japanese doctor named Sato, who did vicious acts during the war, says to a former Japanese Colonel, who is listed as a war criminal,""There is a pattern and structure to all things. Only we can't see it. Our job is to discover that pattern and structure and work within it, as part of it.""I see that as an underlying theme, an aspect of man's search for meaning. There's the beautiful, elegant, mystical essence, a feeling that beauty is within and without. On the other hand, a starving, broken and hollowed out POW will see things from a different vantage point:""...Australia meant little against lice and hunger and beri-beri, against thieving and beatings and yet ever more slave labour. Australia was shrinking and shriveling, a grain of rice was so much bigger now than a continent.""The essence of one's outlook can be fluid and optimistic, but when one's eyes are empty, or dead, they are just ""black-shadowed sockets waiting for worms."" I have so many yellow stickies in this book--passages that touched my core emotions. If you are a literature lover, like Dorrigo Evans is, this book will unnerve you, amaze you. It all may boil down to a line that is a running motif in Flanagan's story, ""The world is. It just is.""Is it? What is? There is so much to ponder here, from knowing that the world will continue on and on and on, even after we are dead; to profound solitude when we are alive; to memory, dreams, reality, existence, war, love, betrayal, poetry, godlessness, freedom, and the perceptions through this kaleidoscope of a novel.

Yes, it had echoes of Jhumpa Lahiri (by virtue of evoking the Indian-American experience), and it also at times echoes Richard Ford’s CANADA, as well as Richard Russo, John Irving, and any number of master storytellers that tell an epic story about family. I applaud Mira Jacob’s decade-long investment in writing this book, as it gave me a few days of unadulterated bliss. I didn’t want to say goodbye to the Eapen family when I turned the last page; at times, I felt them brushing against my arm, cupping my elbow, and feeding me samosas and chutney.The nuclear family here is Thomas Eapen, a neurosurgeon, Kamala, his wife, their intellectually gifted son, Akhil, and their photographer daughter, Amina. Only Amina was born in America. Through most of the novel, they live in Albuquerque, although Amina, as an adult, now lives in Seattle and works as an events photographer, after leaving the serious business of photojournalism. The novel alternates back and forth between the early 80’s and 1998, but the offstage history is woven in seamlessly. I don’t want to reveal more of the story than is told in the book jacket. There’s a lot of discovery that is meant for the reader to unearth. And, even though a tragedy is revealed early on (in a handful of words), the narrative keeps you on tenterhooks until you actually get there, hundreds of pages later.This isn’t a book with political polemics or sermons about social justice—but there is a lot of delicious Indian food that made me hungry. It’s a domestic drama about a family dealing with love, loss, adjustment, flux, sleepwalking, and candid photos—a very human drama that is also witty and sharply observed. It moves swiftly, a charismatic, unputdownable tale told with levity and moving intensity. Jacob’s prose is astute and intrepid, the kind of sentences that get into your blood, and is laced with smooth and cinematic dialogue.If I could give this 6 stars, I would....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"May 29, 2014",Jun 2014,"May 29, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18507827-the-sleepwalker-s-guide-to-dancing

He wrote a book called FAME,German-Austrian author Daniel Kehlmann is already known for his surreal, tragicomic, and subtly macabre style of writing. He wrote a book called FAME, which also begins with an F. F in this book does refer to fame, as well as family, fate, forgery, faith, fear, and Friedland. And I’m sure I will think of some other F words later on. It’s a dense story presented in a deft, lyrical manner, folding some of the ideas of historic philosophers (such as Nietzsche and Hegel) into a thinking man’s existential, metaphysical mystery. Moreover, the meaning and interpretations of art, beauty, and the very act of existence give the reader a lot of lofty ideas and contradictions to ponder.Aurthur Friedland is a morose and unsuccessful writer with three sons. Martin, the eldest, was born from the first woman Arthur left. As the novel opens, Arthur is living with his second wife, the mother of their identical twins, Ivan an Eric. After taking Martin and the twins to a hypnotist, he abandons his second wife, all three of his kids, and becomes a successful author. Once they mature into adults, Arthur’s offspring receive surprise visits from him at irregular intervals.Martin finds solace in food, and as an adult is quite obese. He becomes a Catholic priest, despite his atheism. He keeps hoping that his “faith” will stir his belief. He is also adept at the Rubik’s cube, and regularly enters tournaments. Eric grows into a wealthy investor, but is on the verge of becoming a fugitive in 2008, as his fraudulent (Ponzi) investments are about to blow up in his face. Ivan, the scholar, has a passion for art, but is tortured by the belief that he can only be a mediocre artist. So, he commits to art forgery.Arthur’s lucrative book, which has also instigated a rash of suicides, is titled My Name is No One. It is steeped in meta-fiction, and is an essential construct of Kehlmann’s book.“The sentences are well-constructed, the narrative has a powerful flow, the reader would be enjoying the text were it not for the persistent feeling of somehow being mocked.”I admit that this was an aspect of my experience reading F. However, I don’t mind being mocked, as long as the author is also mocking his own experiences, which I suspect may be so. And that he feels a bond with the reader, which is evident:“But there is a sense that no sentence means merely what it says, that the story is observing its own progress, and that in truth the protagonist is not the central figure: the central figure is the reader, who is all too complicit in the unfolding of events.”F is the sixth letter of the alphabet, and there are six members of this immediate family (Arthur, his three sons, and the two mothers), and there are also six sides to a Rubik’s Cube. Too, there are six chapters to this book. Whether this is purposeful symbolism by the author or just a flash of my own ideas, I can’t know for sure. However, what is recurrent is this idea of whether or not we exist. This is a central motif, which is observable through the jungle of elliptical themes that Kehlmann purveys. Kehlmann is an agent of Consciousness, and all the 3D rabbit holes in the brain's abyss. The end may leave you alarmed, or wanting, or a little bit of both.Kudos to Carol Brown Janeway, who melodically translated the book from the German....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"May 25, 2014","May 26, 2014","May 26, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19288090-f

It is a very British book with a Hollywood ending, although, in her defense, the author created a plot that had a natural and organic conclusion. The ending was inevitable, so it wasn’t hamstrung. But, I agree that it could have been arranged in a less predictable outcome. The plot itself wasn’t the aim, though; it was the authentic and gimlet eye that Jones possesses when it comes to all things theater, and the romantic complications and stickiness that ensue—the theater as an incestuous and cloistered space. I was very involved in theater in my twenties, particularly one playhouse that performed cutting-edge productions, and what they called New Theater. I performed in plays that were written by local, regional, or other innovative playwrights that were just getting started. It was exciting, full of discoveries. And, it all came back to me when I read FALLOUT.The novel is an ensemble piece, focusing as it does on several different characters involved in theater, primarily in 1970s London. Luke Kanowski is from the poorer provinces, with a sad past. His mother is contained in a hospital for the mentally ill, and his father tries to overlook it, mostly with his head in the sand. Luke has talent, is writing plays, and is eager to test his ambitions in London. He meets Paul Driscoll, who is a talented producer, and Leigh Radley, a student. Eventually they bond together and start a theater company on a shoestring. The company they form is a passionate start-up, and a prelude to later buying space for a theater. The members are jacks-of-all-trades, doing everything they can to get it off the ground. Financial matters, building renovation, set design, and play production is done democratically, while Luke continues to write plays on the side (that he isn’t ready to share). As the three become closer, love and romance walk a tightrope. These triangulations were so common, in my experience, especially as theater becomes your life 24/7. However, in this case, Paul and Leigh clearly become a solid couple.Intertwined with this narrative is the story of Nina Jacobs, an aspiring actress with a domineering, meddling mother, who eventually introduces her to a theater producer, Tony Moore, who has lots of posh connections. Tony is a chilling, enigmatic figure, and Jones’s development of him was unnerving and formidable. Although feminism stakes a claim in the 70’s, Nina is subsumed in in a passive role, a second to the man who controls her. She is beautiful, damaged, and starving for the spotlight. She has a fragile but alluring presence on stage, which captures Luke’s hungry heart.Jones has a gift for dialogue, which is good, as this book has a considerable amount of it, and she keeps the pace and intimacy sharp and vibrating. Her characters are supple, fully dimensional, so if you are a lover of character-driven books, you'll be delighted. Moreover, the author conveys the contradictory ambiance of the theater métier, the alternating lather and lassitude. I wouldn't recommend this book for a mass audience--it is going to appeal more to readers with some insider experience of theater. I am not speaking of commercial theater, either, but rather the more incipient art houses that are both fertile and hopeful, but also vulnerable to fallout.“Paul, Luke, Leigh…text-cut and set-built in a frenzy of broken deadlines, late nights, and long mornings…Its successes inspired him, its failures provided counterpoints. In any gap, with any opportunity, he wrote, controlling his own work as he could not control his collaboration.”...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,May 2014,"May 23, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18498563-fallout

Jim Stegner cuts a searing, Hemingway-esque figure, the beard and the bigness, the love of fishing and the outdoors, and the laconic mask. However, Stegner doesn't possess much in the way of academic roots. He was essentially a punk, belligerent kid who dropped out of school, had an epiphany at age seventeen after viewing some art that blew him away, got accepted into the San Francisco Art Institute (and dropped out), and somehow became a sensation in a few circles--certainly he makes a good sum of money. He also lost a fifteen-year-old daughter, Alce, to murder a few years ago.The novel captures the span of a few weeks when Jim is losing control. He does have a history of violence even from before Alce was murdered, and he served time in the pen for it. Now, his rage is coloring his world, and in the space of less than a week, he kills two brothers--one, Dell, for his abusive treatment of horses, which he witnessed one day on the road, and the other, Grant, in self-defense. In the meantime, the authorities are watching him, and interviewing his friends and neighbors, like his model and sometimes lover, Sofia.Alce was a good kid, but as teenagers are wont to do, she got caught up with a reckless and dangerous crowd. It would have been a temporary rebellion, but she was viciously murdered. Since then, Jim has been finding solace in fishing and painting--but, even after cleaning up his heavy drinking, he is stuck in despair, and contemptuous of the world around him. Yet, his paintings are also an aching, nuanced outpouring of his burdens, the daughter he lost, the brothers he killed. Stegner has a mountain of guilt that he can't unload, and he feels responsible for Alce's death.""She died because she was just like me."" And, in his descriptions braided through the novel, he conveys it well. He never married Alce's mother, and after this tragedy, they permanently separated. Whereas Cristine moved on with her life, Stegner was consumed in torpor. And yet, his paintings are dynamic.Stegner lives in the flank of mountains that lead to Crested Butte, Colorado, which is a beautiful place I have stayed at, so I get a buzz when he describes the setting; he captures the landscape superbly. He spends most of the days fishing and, of course, painting. His style is sort of a Zen approach--to get inside the movement of the creation, and allow the spirit to move him forward. His large-canvas paintings are often executed in a matter of a few hours, and are more about momentum and color than studied technique. ""...I wonder if painting isn't a way just to be like an animal for a few hours. To be in the stream of eternity... ...To feel like that. Same as fishing.""At a certain point, the plot becomes a cat-and-mouse suspense, which has a manic sort of pulse. Stegner has a manic pulse, too, one that is both a gift and an albatross. It could redeem him, which he desires, or finish him off. ""Things pile up... ...What they mean by the weight of evidence. It just piles and piles up and you carry it with you until you're walking around like a hunchback.""Heller gets to the heart of Stegner's grief, and evokes a compelling perception of how art and life, and the life of the artist, are intertwined. At times, I was annoyed at how often Stegner scoffed at Southwestern art, especially because Heller came right at the edge of Stegner being a parody of himself. Stegner criticized his peers in a way that occasionally made me think less of him as a painter. After all, his breadth of knowledge should also clue him in that there are more than a few ways to skin a cat...or render a chicken! But, as the novel progressed, this was at least partially defended, i.e., Stegner's perceptions were thwarted by his rage, and he was often pessimistic about the agendas of others.Also, the spacing of this novel almost dumbed it down. It was inorganic and distracting. Too many uncalled for spaces between dialogue, passages, and paragraphs. (This is also in the published version, so it is not just an ARC quirk). However, this tale was so superb, and Stegner such a riveting protagonist, and the prose itself unbearably beautiful, that I didn't let the flaws undermine my five-star assessment. His landscape/settings were stunning and the inner dialogue of the grief-stricken artist was breathtaking and poetic. In the end, I see this as a memorable and captivating novel about loss, redemption, and reinvention, and how art moves through it all, with love.""The reason people are so moved by art and why artists tend to take it all so seriously is that if they are real and true they come to the painting with everything they know and feel and love, and all the things they don't know, and some of the things they hope, and they are honest about them all and put them on the canvas.""...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"May 17, 2014","May 18, 2014","May 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18310201-the-painter

Pavone's book hits the spot, in ways I wasn't expecting. From the opening pages, there is a filmic cat-and-mouse suspense; a manuscript of a text called The Accident is floating around in New York's publishing world. Ambitious, successful, and quasi-successful editors and publishers, and others who are in a slump, would sell themselves to Beelzebub to snag it, and there are people who would kill to destroy it.What does the manuscript contain, and why is it such a hot and volatile property? It is an exposé on media mogul, Charlie Wolfe, who reminds me a bit of Rupert Murdoch. There are some deep and toxic secrets from his past that he shares with the enigmatic, anonymous author. And it is all on paper.""Digital is too easily duplicated. Too easily stolen. Any digital storage device, no matter how secure, is in the end essentially insecure. What's not insecure is a stack of paper that no one knows about. That no one will go looking for. So we typed, and printed, and destroyed the word-processing files. The manuscript exists only in word-processing form. Somewhere.""Numerous characters connive and collide, elude and ambush, maraud and murder, all for this explosive manuscript (which, with the aid of copy machines, succumbs to spontaneous generation). In my quest to find out what was just around the corner--and Pavone's settings cannot be beat--I finished this jumbo novel in just two days. And, oddly enough, despite my disappointment in the contents of the inflammatory manuscript, which is incrementally revealed within the story in an old-fashioned typeset font, and despite the rather trite denouement, I enjoyed this story, for reasons other than the author's intentions.The inciting manuscript-within-the narrative was not well written, was in fact prosaic, and other than revealing hidden crimes and tawdry behavior, came off rather flat. The finale wasn't much cause for celebration, either. And yet...and yet...it was the incidentals of the story that charmed me. Pavone can write turf, he can make the streets of New York City thrum with an almost animal magnetism. If you liked the city and street scenes in Pessel's Night Film and Wolitzer's The Interestings, (two books wholly unlike this one or each other in content), you will groove on Pavone's talent for capturing the surroundings with immediacy and scale. In fact, anywhere this story roves--Zurich, Paris, and other places dotted along Europe, Pavone's talent and brio is evident in scenic muscle. It is that, and his tuneful cadence, that gives the energy and momentum to the narrative. Moreover, the insider's look at the publishing industry is scintillating.Pavone is also skilled at characters, and he would be even better if he trimmed down the excess jumble of them. For purposes of story, the number of characters proliferated, and some of them were stock-in-trade. On the other hand, Pavone lit up Isabel Reed, the moral center, and the author of the eponymous manuscript, who possessed a sputtering moral compass. Hayden, the black ops leader, was more intriguing when he wasn't prefigured. If it weren't for Pavone's particular choice of story, he'd intrigue me more.My conclusion is that Pavone is an excellent writer who is writing partly in the wrong genre for his talents. His eye for detail, and observations of human behavior and motivation, as well as his scenic depictions and apt metaphors, would be more fitting in a character composition, where he could flesh out his cast, perhaps in a domestic drama, adventure tale, or bildungsroman. Or a roman à clef. He writes in the espionage genre, but that is not his forte, in my opinion. The aspirations of this story were derivative. But, Chris Pavone, I see you peeking out from hiding undercover.

But, perhaps a backwards glance would reveal some truth behind those words. Lucky to be alive—and what I mean by alive is more than just breathing. These characters fight for their footing--they courageously and sometimes unwittingly climb out of many sad and tragic moments, and use their wits to move forward and carve out a niche for themselves, even if that niche is largely precarious. If I described the plot, my  might end up as long as the book (which isn’t long, but so very full). It is about two half-sisters, Eva and Iris (Iris being the elder), who finally meet in their teens when Iris’s mother dies and Eva’s mother dumps Eva on Iris and Eva’s mutual father’s doorstep. Edgar (their father) steals Iris’s hard-earned money that she won for speeches—she was very talented. So the sisters begin hiding Iris’s earnings, and they take off for Hollywood together after Iris graduates high school. Eva was the scholar but since she was fourteen, she didn’t get to finish (although she had skipped grades). However, she was a compulsive autodidact.Eva and Iris undertake the hard knocks school of survival, especially Eva, because after a horrifying accident, Iris ends up in London, doing plays and setting up a clinic, leaving Eva and their life in America. We learn about Iris through her letters. “I don’t have much confidence in what people remember…I remember some things at a gallop, some moments…bearing down upon me in huge detail, and other things are no more than small leaves floating on a stream. Memory seems as faulty, as misunderstood and misguided, as every other thought or spasm that passes through us. …I still thought I was made to triumph. That I was, in fact, owed a triumph.”The story is a combination of Eva’s narrative, intermixed with various characters' epistolary accounts. Braided within the novel are many wonderful songs of the times, lyrics that lend a buoyant context of the era. Even some of the short chapters are titles of songs, or lines from popular tunes. After being kicked on her ass by Hedda Hopper and blackballed from Hollywood, they take off for more rogue adventures. Fortunately, Iris’s hairdresser, Francisco, becomes a close family friend. Their dad, Edgar, back in the picture, secured a job as a butler with a fairly wealthy Italian family in a NY suburb, and moved the sisters in. Then there is Gus, who was married to Reenie, the cook where they lived. Iris, looking for love in all the wrong places, falls in love with Reenie, and subsequently has Gus captured as a spy. This was, after all, the years of WW II. Many of the letters are from Gus, and his adventures in Germany.Although Iris had essentially kidnapped a young boy from a Jewish orphanage (because she wanted to mother him with Reenie), Eva was left to raise him, with her dad and Edgar’s black-almost-pass-as-white girlfriend, Clara, a successful jazz singer.It is okay to know all this, because the plot grows not linearly, but in a varying, circular, and alternate pattern (if there is a pattern to speak of). The novel is often like a romp, where characters pile on to characters, and the definition of family takes on new proportions. LUCKY US is about luck—good and bad, and about what makes a family, and how to renew and resuscitate the non-working parts. With Bloom at the helm, you know there will also be the perils of being Jewish during WW II, and the horrors of that period. But Bloom is a master of style and unflinching portrayals. She doesn’t depict all ethnic minorities as flawless, heroic, and victimized by the ethnic majority. Her characters are fully dimensional-- flawed, striving, and unorthodox. She is a gifted, gregarious, piquant writer, who is both light and weighty, a wizard with her words, a booming heart through all her passages.

But they don’t know that yet.”Is this the beginning of a great story, or just a gimmicky hook? If you are looking for a suspense or crime thriller, you will be largely disappointed. This is a domestic drama about a Chinese-American man (born in the US), James Lee, his blonde, Caucasian wife, Marilyn, and their three children. Lydia, just sixteen, is the middle child, the one that they have projected their dreams onto, although James and Marilyn have different approaches and aspirations for her—which is a problem for Lydia, one she doesn’t share with them. I felt that Ng's overall result was a mixed bag. I was on board with Ng’s type of story and style—the family dynamics that make unhappy families what they are, but there were inherent problems in the author’s assertions, and some heavy-handed pronouncements. The most bothersome of these was the premise of almost draconian racism that was supposedly present in the mid-seventies America. I remember the late 60’s junior high, and the most popular girl in our school (and head cheerleader) was a Chinese-American girl (the only one in the school). I did not see any evidence of her being ostracized. In Ng’s book, all three of the children were severely blackballed by their peers, and even the newspaper made some statements that read as if out of 1920. I lived in small town New England, the Lees lived in small-town Iowa. Perhaps Iowa IS different, but it overreached, and became ham-handed after a while, with the author constantly (repetitively) returning to this issue. And, James, who was a graduate of Harvard in the 60’s, apparently suffered from the same thing.Marilyn’s hang-up was that she never went to medical school; her plans were jettisoned when she got pregnant, and then she and James married. Her mother implied disapproval of James, so she never spoke to her mother again for the rest of her mother’s life. Marilyn decided that her daughter was going to pick up where Marilyn left off, and started buying her stacks of books oriented toward the math and science she would need to accomplish in order to get into medical school. James was determined that Lydia would have the social life that he had been barred from all his life due to discrimination.The other two children, Nath and Hannah, are not as special to James and Marilyn. Although Nath is graduating high school, and was accepted at Harvard, his parents’ delight is peripheral to the centrality of their especial child, Lydia. The core of their lives is Lydia, and the core of this novel seems to be how the impact of racism affected this family and created disharmony and dysfunction. Yet, towards the end, the author tacked on a new issue, one I won’t reveal except to say that it didn’t feel organic, and the authorial intrusion intensified for this reader.Ng writes lovely passages, and for that alone I would be open to reading her next novel. It was evident that she was illuminating the contrasts between external feelings of marginalization and the internal struggles that we all have regarding our differences. Regardless of the outward and pointed distinctions, it is a universal problem to feel alienated, and that came across well. However, Ng's approach periodically felt like a disquisition on cultural diversity, which pulled me out of the story of these specific characters.

The plucky and delightful protagonist is Nombeko, who at the start of the novel is fourteen and cleaning latrines in Soweto, her hometown. It is the seventies, and apartheid is the social/political/economic cloud Nombeko lives under, and yet she makes the best of her situation, and eventually saves the world. The novel takes us from 1970's South Africa to 21st century Sweden.In a picaresque novel, it is paramount to have a captivating group of characters, and nimble writing that compels the reader forward. Jonasson's talent is magnificent, and his largesse and wily wit, as well as his ability to create a thrilling plot, kept me in suspense until the very end. Nombeko is both humble and noble, a mathematical genius who lives by her wits and her virtuous cunning. Then there are the twins in Sweden, Holger One and Holger Two. But only one of them exists on paper. The Holgers' father is a fanatical republican who is determined to depose the monarchy. When his wife gives birth to twins, he decides that he can keep one hidden at home, while one goes off to school. Unfortunately, the one in school is none too bright, but is a fanatic like his father, while the non-existent Holger Two is both intelligent and principled. Inevitably, the Holgers and Nombeko cross paths.""All these people found themselves in nuclear-weapons-free Sweden. Right next door to a three-megaton bomb.""As it says in the intro, ""The statistical probability that an illiterate in 1970's Soweto will grow up and one day find herself confined in a potato truck with the Swedish king and prime minister is 1 in 45,766,212,810. This, according to the calculations of the aforementioned illiterate herself.""One of my favorite sections of the novel is when Nombeko is forced into indentured servitude. She is run over by moronic engineer, Westhuizen, in Johannesburg after a long journey on foot from her shantytown (her goal is to make it to the National Library of Pretoria). The judge decided in favor of the alcoholic engineer, who made it through engineering school through nepotism and cheating. He is now in charge of a secret nuclear weapons program in South Africa. Because of his stupidity and constant inebriation, and because of Nombeko's mathematical brilliance, she becomes his ""right hand man."" Officially, she is the cleaning woman. This episode in Nombeko's life puts her in contact with Mossad Agent A, Mossad Agent B, and three Chinese woman skilled at making ancient, fraudulent pottery and in the poisoning of dogs--also in forced servitude to Engineer Westhuizen.""Nombeko imagined that the engineer might soon be able to devote himself to his brandy full-time; he could sit and dream his way back to the years when it was possible to convince those around him that he had a clue.""As zany as this novel may sound in description, Jonasson's finesse in making this believably unbelievable story engrossing is because of the characters, particularly Nombeko and the Holgers. His moral compass is a ticking time bomb, and he connects with the reader rather than condescending, so that I was in on his humor, and charmed by his narrative. The translation from Swedish by Rachel Willson-Broyles is luminous and lyrical. I can't believe that the original text wasn't in English.Holger Two's problem of non-existence, as well as the lack of birth certificate/paperless Nombeko, provide for a deep and provocative philosophical theme in this novel about identity and permanence, as well as some fascinating real-world questions.I can't recommend this unforgettable, supple, radiant novel enough!...more",Notes are private!,0,87,1,not set,"May 10, 2014","May 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18651998-the-girl-who-saved-the-king-of-sweden

THE GHOST APPLE is sheer entertainment, transparent in the most casually ironic and bald-faced, brazen of ways.When I read, at the start of this mash-up, culturally hip novel, ""Founded in 1794 as a free school for Native Americans, Tripoli opened its doors to tuition-paying students of all backgrounds in 1795,"" I knew I was in for a clever and cunning story. It begins with a letter from the founder of the school, Israel Framingham Tripoli, grandson of John Morehead Tripoli, a man who was marooned on the Caribbean island of St Renard and well taken care of by the Carawak Indians for a year, until he was (unfortunately, for him) saved. His grandson intended for this school to be a free school for the education of the Wapahanock Indians.Now, three centuries later, the American Tripoli college, as well as its proxy on St Renard, is nothing less than an abomination of greed and mandatory slave labor, veiled by its propaganda of ""field studies"" for students. On St. Renard, sugar cane is harvested by the natives, who work alongside of the students (and never allowed to speak to them). Big Anna, a huge corporation of sugar-intensive foods disguised as all-natual and nutritious, sponsors it all, since Tripoli College agreed to a financial relationship with them during the economic downturn. Big Anna professes to be ""green"" and use sustainable practices for their manufacturing of foods. Yes, well, hmmm...Moreover, a dietary supplement is harvested on St. Renard, and forced down the throats of unwitting subjects. Some of the more hilarious side effects of the drug are ""bioluminescence, syncopated mindbeat,"" and ""Harlequin-like ichthyosis."" And, indications for taking it are, among other reasons, ""Can't find the television remote, are experiencing shifting political allegiance,"" and ""Have heard recently that pine blight is destroying the Rocky Mountain Forests.""Thier's talent in telling this story is to combine blog posts by a seventy-year-old undercover dean (posing as a freshman), pricelessly uproarious course listings, the minutiae of faculty meetings, proclamations from a former professor-cum-head of a Liberation Army stationed on St. Renard, and other documents. The glue that ties it together and gives it gravitas are the emails to her twin brother (and the undercover dean, who she had befriended) from a perceptive, wise-beyond-her-years college Junior, Maggie Bell, a black American student who elects to go to St. Renard for the field studies program. And then, later, her slave narratives, which are poised and arresting.""Now that Big Anna was endeavoring to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and indeed to adopt sustainable environmental practices, it had reverted to a much older method of processing the cane.""I am gobsmacked that this is Thier's debut novel.

Rarely do I read what is considered an historical novel that is written with such intimacy, and with a voice that is both individual and universal. Katie Crilly lives in Dublin with her large family. Her twin brother, Liam, forgoes medical school to fight in the Great War, and is killed at the Front in August, 1915. (This happens at the start of the novel, and isn’t a spoiler). A year after his death, Dublin is consumed by the Easter Rising, a six-day armed insurrection, enacted by members of the Irish Republic. The bulk of Mills’s novel takes place during the Rebellion, and the pall on humanity caused by violence and loss in Katie's own city intensifies her contemplation of Liam’s battles in Flanders. Seeing the horrors in Dublin brings her closer to comprehending Liam’s experiences, both personally, and through a former comrade of Liam’s, Hubie Wilson. However, this is neither a political or war novel; it is about finding your life amid grief, destruction, and death.Katie is devastated by Liam’s death, and turns to his wartime letters to her for comfort. Many of them she keeps from the rest of the family, as he shared some of his wartime perspective that would appall her parents. Her mother is especially conventional, forbidding Katie to go to graduate school—she very reluctantly allowed her to get her undergraduate degree in history. Her mother also considers the suffragettes insufferable, and keeps Katie oppressed with her thoroughly un-modern views. Katie’s only consolation, other than Liam’s letters, is assisting a progressive female scholar who is writing a history of the sculptures in Dublin’s public squares, parks, and streets. I would not be surprised if Dote (the scholar) is based on a true biological figure.Through Katie’s association and blossoming friendship with Dote (and Dote’s roommate and friend, Mary), Katie eventually meets Hubie, who was wounded in the war and lost most of his right hand from shrapnel. Through Hubie, and her encounters in the Easter Rising, which occur simultaneously, Katie matures and is, ultimately, transformed. Her independent mind emerges more as the days pass. This isn’t brought about by epiphany or via deus ex machina, but rather through subtle storytelling.I recommend this for literature lovers who appreciate beauty in prose and nuanced characterizations. The plot is not the thing here; it is the theme, and the character of Katie, that kept me turning the pages. I look forward to Lia Mills’ next novel.“…fell.

And here are those themes again, but in a much different style, plot, and story. Thomas's debut novel is an epic saga, a tersely executed but moving tale of an Irish-American family, and spans a few generations, from the early 1950s to 2011. The story predominantly focuses on Eileen Tumulty, who is a first generation American, and opens when she is just a child. However, it is her married adult life that is the heart of the novel.The story is both broad and specific. Thomas expands his lens to incorporate Eileen's life experiences growing up in New York, her hard-bitten childhood, especially dealing with her mother's alcoholism and her father's more veiled gambling problems. At the same time, we get a sense of each era that we pass through, but just enough to strengthen the story at hand. Too, as neighborhoods change or gentrify, we see how they evolve from what preceded them. The details of different suburbs in New York City make them come alive, both physically, socially, and emotionally--an analogy to how people evolve in families. Each generation leaves its fingerprint on the next one. Eileen, in her quest for self-improvement, and her status-conscious nature, is tenacious in her ambitions to climb the ladder of success, ""the ineffable something she'd been chasing.""Eileen loves to entertain, and to take pride in her home. Her husband, Ed Leary, a quirky academic/scientist, cares little for furnishings and material trappings. He cares about his work and his students, and playing baseball with their son, Connell. Ed has no aspirations to attain financial wealth, especially if it means sacrificing his principles and giving way to what he calls the decadence of capitalism and consumerism. It is all about the students to him. He has no interest in being an administrator, dean, or corporate executive, positions that were offered to him but that he turned down. Eileen was frustrated at his complacency; she yearned for Ed to aspire for more, specifically a climb to the top of the food chain.""She needed him to be her partner, because she loved him terribly...and so she was going to save him from himself...He needed a real home no less than she did. His mind had grown smaller as he'd bunkered himself in his ideals...He needed to regroup, to see new possibilities, to think bigger than ever. If there was anything she could help him with, it was thinking big.""Life throws some curve balls at the Leary family, and what is most vivid about the book is the gravitas of Eileen, Ed, and Connell. Eileen is the polestar of the family, and I deeply felt every twist and turn in her life. There are chapters devoted to her husband and son, but it was mostly though Eileen's eyes that we experienced their lives.Despite the large page count, the pages move swiftly--it isn't dense and wordy. The prose is lean and assured, and the characterizations were supple and organic. There were a few times that I felt the story editing could go a bit smoother, as far as which events were captured and which were not. Periodically, I felt I had missed something, and realized it was just that some events that happened offstage were referred to only later, and it came out slightly unnatural. There were also a few anachronisms, like ""Oh, snap,"" said by a character in the 1990s. However, these are minor irritants, and although it may have removed me from the novel for a few seconds, it didn't have severe consequences.I don't want to cover much detail, as the surprises and developments in the story daunted me as if I were one of the Leary family, a sort of free-fall that I felt for them when life handed them lemons. And, although Eileen is a completely different character than Scarlett O'Hara, both Irish-American women possessed a certain degree of self-possession, and, especially, resourcefulness. Both women had threats to the nature of their home and home lives (one in Civil War, the other in the everyday war of life), and yet they both persevered with determination and resolute aim. It took me no less than 75 pages to really engage, but eventually it fully absorbed my attention....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,not set,"May 03, 2014","May 05, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17830123-we-are-not-ourselves

But you do begin to see it when you step away.”These sentences are spoken by the narrator, forty-seven year-old Augusta “Gus” Edelman, who is an artist. She and her husband, Owen, live out in rural Pennsylvania, in a rambling old 1918 farmhouse that they bought and renovated three years ago, leaving their social life in Philly behind for a bucolic setting that would also stir the creative juices. From the opening, we learn that Gus had an affair in 2005, before they were wed, and then got married “because I had broken the promise that we had never made.” And, it is evident that she is narrating the past, after Owen’s death. Tragically, he had an affair since they moved out to the country--and only had one neighbor! As a matter of fact, they enjoyed their solitude until Alison, a private high school science teacher on sabbatical, rented the property next to them. This novel is a rendering of Gus stepping away from the landscape, metaphorically speaking, and reflecting how their relationship with Alison shattered their lives.I have read multitudes of novels about adulterous love affairs, and am quick to put one down that is prosaic or melodramatic. I’m delighted to declare that Black’s debut novel is fresh, literary, and ripe with extended metaphor. Rather than focusing on the love affair, it follows the arc of a marriage. The subplot concerns Owen’s prolonged writer’s block and Gus’s recent artistic inspiration. While refurbishing one of the bathrooms, Gus discovered old newspaper used for insulation inside the walls, dated from WW I. They contain photographic obituaries that propel Gus to want to draw them--they who died in the war--and place them in a quotidian domestic scene, one that conveys a story. Portraiture/human likeness is not her forte—she likes vistas and buildings--anything that could be seen from a window, so this is indeed a challenging project. In the meantime, Owen goes out to the renovated barn every day, and produces nothing. Their current work efforts and the affairs of the heart become symbolically laced with each other.The prose is lean, taut, and butter-smooth. The secondary characters are as full-bodied as the primary ones, and Black provides a suspenseful premise from the beginning, and the reader follows the thread excitedly through some surprising twists. Be prepared for some unsettling moments, and all are authentically portrayed. She is confident, assured, and writes like a veteran (she does have a collection of short stories).

There’s a central premise that hovers (literally!) over the story and provides a pique of low-grade excitement. Thirty-eight year-old Barrett Meeks, a scholar and underachiever who is low on funds and works in retail at a vintage store, has recently received a break-up text from his latest boyfriend. Walking through Central Park four days later, he sees a transcendent, numinous image in the sky.“ A pale aqua light, translucent, a swatch of veil, star-high, no, lower than the stars, but high, higher than a spaceship…””He believed—he knew—that as surely as he was looking up at the light, the light was looking down back down at him…No. Not looking. Apprehending.” Barrett is conflicted about the apparition—whether it is real, or imagined, or a collection of gases, or a signal of a brain injury. So he decides to keep this a secret, and not even share with his older brother, Tyler, who he is extremely close to, and lives with, (and with Tyler’s fiancé), in a progressively gentrifying neighborhood in Brooklyn.Tyler is an unsuccessful musician and secret coke addict, but claims he has quit (he even tries to fool himself). Tyler is trying to write the perfect song for his marriage ceremony to Beth, who has terminal cancer. One thing Tyler does well is take care of her. He is also loyal to Barrett, who is in turn loyal to Beth. Barrett and Tyler have a close and unusual brotherly affinity, almost like a latent and incestuous, but chaste, love.“They possess a certain feral knowledge of each other, excrescence and scat. …They…keep their affinities secret when they’re in company…and keep their chaste, ardent romance to themselves, as if they were a two-member sect, passing as regular citizens, waiting for the moment to act.”The third central character is Beth, who is likely the moral center, yet her strength of character and earnest love is not as pressing to the story as it is the projection of an integrity that galvanizes Barrett and Tyler. She is their shared revelation, in a sense. And her remission signifies a change in the trio’s relationship.“Tyler is Beth’s, now. Now that Beth has been restored to health, they’re a couple in a way they were not, when Beth was dying. The Beth who was slipping away…had been both Tyler’s and Barrett’s, their flickering saint, their runaway princess who was being reclaimed…Tyler and Barrett were her attendants. They were Team Beth.”I do think that Cunningham, somewhat of a writer’s writer, controlled his narrative, yet I wasn’t certain of his chief premise, or whom he was attached to in this novel. If he were a lesser writer, I would have perceived this as a desultory story, with no real center. However, Cunningham periodically seemed to be a step ahead of the reader, and it was up to us to comprehend the gist. All the characters (and there were other secondary characters that he focused on for brief interludes) seemed to be at a crossroads in their lives. And there were special connections between the two brothers that had historical poignancy. Their mother was struck by lightning on a golf course years ago—her death seeming to be strange and even too banal for her eminent presence in their lives. She had said to Barrett, in the past, that some magic had been granted to him on his birth—an inexplicable magic, and that he also needed to watch out for his older brother.As Barrett’s gradually shares his mystical experience with others, deeper philosophical discussions ensue over its meaning. And, Barrett, who begins to attend church, more for its ambiance and collective spirituality, hides a notion that Beth’s subsequent remission is connected to his singular, visionary experience.The author also allows us to regard what different characters are reading into each other, through italicized comments that are unspoken thoughts (that one character believes that the other actually means). This channeled a scintilla of standard neuroses that floats between all the parties, and gave the reader more insight into the characters’ conjectures or nagging doubts about each other.One thing that did not resonate with me was Barrett’s need for secrecy about his celestial vision, his fraught feelings about disclosure. It seemed that Cunningham attempted to create tension and suspense with the inevitable reveal (to Tyler, especially), but I didn’t grasp the dread or alarm that Barrett felt at confessing his experience to others. The proportion of its significance seemed larger to the author’s imagination than to this reader. I heard what he imparted—that Barrett feared revealing a supernatural experience, which was a contradiction to his secular beliefs. But I wasn’t convinced that it was organically acute.Cunningham possesses a gift for language and a knack for conveying characters in just a few keystrokes:“Barrett is a bigger guy, not fat…but ursine, crimson of eye and lip; ginger-furred…the prince transformed into wolf or lion, all slumbering large-pawed docility, awaiting, with avid yellow eyes, love’s first kiss.”That, and the darting through of consequence and connection, was enough to keep me fastened to this compact novel, which progresses from 2004 to 2008.

Victims of childhood trauma often won't have the vocabularies to describe their emotions.""I have been working with abused children for 30 years; Johnston's description of a family trying to heal from a traumatic ordeal is spot-on-- beautifully written, nuanced, and heart stopping. This is neither clinically rendered nor a potboiler. Rather, as it says in the book description, this book begins where others tend to end. `Happy ever after' after a rescue from an abduction is not this book's premise. This deals with post-traumatic afflictions of family after one of the sons, Justin, who was kidnapped at age eleven, returns four years later.Roxanne Gay's 2014 novel of PTSD, An Untamed State, concerned the kidnapping, captivity and post-rescue of a young mother, and how it affected all the family members. That book started with the amplified action and graphic displays of trauma, and later moved into the more nuanced territory. However, Johnston's book is consistently understated. There are no overt atrocities; if anything, Johnston curtailed the gruesome events, and delicately implied what we tacitly understand about the trauma, allowing the reader to interpret and move on from the headline-grabbing type of action and into the deeper recesses of the emotional wounds. That is what this is about--how a family's life is permanently altered from the events, an upheaval that requires therapy and time.""Her life--everyone's life--seemed rigged with trapdoors and hidden, collapsible walls, panels that would open without warning and claim what had been yours, claim it only because you'd allow yourself to believe it couldn't be claimed.""Justin's parents, Laura and Eric, his grandfather, Cecil, and his younger brother, Griff, all possess their own turmoil after Justin comes home. Johnston reveals the contrast of before and after--how their lives have been capsized in innumerable ways. And, especially, he depicts the isolation that each family member feels, and the way they walk on ice to give a wide berth to each others' fragility. But, we feel the tension of that ice about to crack. Johnston's luminous use of extended metaphors, such as conveyed in Laura's volunteer work with ailing or impaired dolphins, invariably brings it home to the central premise.Johnston's prose is flawless, and every passage is organic and lucid. He doesn't put too fine a point on things, allowing the reader to translate what is revealed to what is not. He tells you enough, but does not telegraph events. There isn't one inauthentic moment in this novel. His descriptions of Corpus are so ripe that I felt that I was there, as I have been numerous times as a tourist. He brought the city into sharp relief--the Harbor Bridge, the brackish water, and the townspeople. And, he sets up a suspenseful plot line in the prologue, which keeps us on tenterhooks until the very end.This is mesmerizing writing, and I am not using hyperbole when I say that Johnston is easily one of the top 1% of American writers living today. I am astonished that this is his debut novel (but he does have short story collections under his belt). (No wonder he is Harvard's creative writing director.)

Every time I see the author's name in print on the pages of the latest of his or her fiction, I am jettisoned out the story and into the basking novelist's quasi-biography.Mitchell, rather than transmitting a duplicate self, creates an arterial pathway and an organic conduit from Bone Clocks to all his other novels--Black Swan Green, Number 9 Dream, The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, Ghostwritten, and Cloud Atlas at different times in various ways. He bolsters the theme of connection literarily and in temporal and perpetual ways so that time is unleashed, not as a Western mindset, but rather in something like a boundless circle, mounted from an ancient ziggurat, and understood through the all-seeing eye. If that doesn't make a lot of sense, it will when you read it.It would be egregious to spell out this plot, which is its own exciting discovery. But, fans of Mitchell will be familiar with how he can change course and slip into a linguistic detour. Less so in this novel, and BONE CLOCKS coheres more obviously so than CA. Holly Sykes is the clear protagonist, even when she isn't always steering the POV. The book doesn't read so much like separate novellas that run a course together, even though there are six delineated parts; it reads like an epic novel with several turnoffs that lead you back to a central story with fair transparency, but persuades you to visualize a maze of narrative junctures and coronas.If you don't like the paranormal genre, there's a possibility that you might abandon the book at this turn of narrative style, which comprises about 400 pages. There's also a chunk of the dystopian. If you can stick with it, there is much reward that transcends the genre.""We live on, as long as there are people to live on in.""...more",Notes are private!,0,114,1,not set,"Jun 20, 2014","Apr 19, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18949650-the-bone-clocks

In fact, much of this noveThis is not that WW II book where all the Germans are monsters or menacing racists and the Allies are unassailable saviors. In fact, much of this novel takes place in Saint-Malo in Brittany, a walled city that was nearly wiped out by American bombs in 1945. War has its own logic and agenda, and casts a long shadow over people just trying to survive and protect the ones they love. War has no furlough for the civilians.“Now it seems there are only shadows and silence. Silence is the fruit of the occupation; it hangs in branches, seeps from gutters…So many windows are dark. It’s as if the city has become a library of books in an unknown language, the houses great shelves of illegible volumes, the lamps all extinguished.”Doerr’s elegant, intricate and intimate portrait is like a poetry painting of two central characters whose lives inevitably intersect. Werner Pfennig is an orphan in Germany living in near-poverty with his sister, Jutta, at a Children’s Home outside Essen. He is expected to enter the coalmines at 15, in support of the unification and Nationalist cause of the Reich. But, he has a brilliant technical aptitude with radios and transmitters, which may be a way out of the infantry. “Radio: it ties a million ears to a single mouth. Out of loudspeakers…,the staccato voice of the Reich grows like some imperturbable tree; its subjects lean toward its branches as if toward the lips of God.”Marie-Laure is a blind girl in Paris, daughter of the locksmith of the Natural History Museum. She has learned to feel her way around her neighborhood, because her father brought her on walks where she learned to count steps and storm drains, and built an elaborate scale model of the city for her, carved from wood. Moreover, there’s a diamond locked in the museum with a mythical history, a curse.Maie-Laure: “I hear that the diamond is like a piece of light from the original world. Before it fell. A piece of light rained to earth from God.”The novel is divided into sections Zero through Twelve. Within each section are a multitude of very short titled chapters. Some chapters are less than half a page long, some a few pages in length. Each section covers a date—such as 1934, or May, 1944, or August, 1944, and so forth. Much of it takes place in the few months before and after D-Day (June 1944). During that time, Marie-Laure and her father leave Paris for Saint-Malo to escape the invasion. Her Uncle Etienne lives there, and is a victim of PTSD (although the term wasn’t used then) from the First World War. Etienne’s brother used to be a pirate radio broadcaster a decade ago, and Werner and Jutta picked up on the signal when Werner, at age 9, constructed a raw radio transmitter from old parts. Etienne’s brother would broadcast fascinating facts regarding the natural sciences. The story alternates, for the most part, between Werner and Marie-Laure. There’s a subtle sense of excitement and tension, as I knew that eventually their lives would cross. Doerr’s prose is poised and musical, metaphorically masterful, and I just wanted to weep at the delicacy of the author’s humanity. As the book description says, this novel is mainly about people trying to be good to one another.

RegardiThere are unforgettable female protagonists in novels, such as Anna Karenina, Jo March, and Scarlett O’Hara, distinguished figures of fiction. Regarding more recent novels (of the 21st century), no heroine has enchanted me quite so much as Teresita Urrea of THE HUMMINGBIRD’S DAUGHTER (even if she is from a different century). That is, until Rachman’s Tooly Zylberberg. All my favorite fictional females are inimitable, and destined to be copied by later writers —iconoclasts that in later years become icons. Tooly possesses that natural charisma and disarming independence that distinguishes an unforgettable character—a woman that desires love, but dares to live outside its chambers. Too smart to dumb down, she’s a titanic presence in a diminutive frame, who often feels there’s no niche where she belongs. She concedes that she doesn’t know where she’s from; she’s on a journey to discover who she is-- literally.At 32, Tooly (Matilda) lives above the money-losing bookshop business that she owns in a centuries old former pub (which she rents) in a tiny mountainside village in Wales. There are so few people who live in this isolated berg that it would be all but impossible to keep it afloat with customers. Her one employee is Fogg, his name an obvious ironic allusion to Phileas Fogg in Verne’s AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS. Rachman’s Fogg, who travels thousands of miles in books, never leaves this miniscule village, but develops an imaginary parallel life as a globe-trotting academic and Francophile. He’s a contemplative fellow who feels a kinship to Tooly.“We’re like a lost tribe, people like us…No traditions, no birthright…All of us have an acorn of sadness…You notice our tristesse, only in passing, like a door to a small room in a house where outsiders may not enter.”Other than Fogg, and a music teacher that coaches her in ukulele lessons, Tooly’s link with other people are limited to those in the literature that she reads. She is largely an autodidact, who received a boost in education as a child, when she met an aging Russian, a poor and hermetic scholar and consultant for wealthy book collectors named Humphrey, whose English is full of charming malapropisms. Humphrey introduced her to the finest minds on the printed page.Tooly’s life was an aggregation of never-ending voyages-- a disrupted childhood of itinerant adventures with alternate caregivers and one enigmatic, and increasingly apparitional, avuncular figure named Venn. Venn was all-points latitude and longitude, the vortex on which all her emotional life was conveyed. But, for a decade now, he seemed to have dropped off the earth. The one constant companion in her life was literature, especially Dickens’ Nicholas Nickleby, which she had read countless times. Rather than lay out the entire plot and all the juicy characters, I would rather persuade you to just open this book and travel back and forth in diverse countries and various decades—1988, 1999, 2000, and 2011, including several chapters headed with beginnings, middles, and ends in backwards order. All this anarchic time is not without purpose, however. The story develops as the pieces and people influential in Tooly’s life are revealed in measured moments and junctures. Tooly mines the seminal events in her life, delving into her biological heritage and her inclination to repeatedly uproot. Rachman’s prose is nothing less than delicious, with quotable passages and phrases and superbly captured settings. The tone and voice is warm, wry, tender, and even scalding at times. It is tied together organically, not one disingenuous moment in this story. Even as Tooly is beguiled, she is the most beguiling of all. Her artless social skills are offset by a learned ability to cross thresholds, both mental and physical.“It was intoxicating, the unholy control of another human…--engineering another’s fate was not necessarily destructive.”...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Apr 12, 2014","Apr 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19104786-the-rise-fall-of-great-powers

At 28, she is stagnating in ABD status, trying to finish her dissertation in economics, wholly disliking her field of expertise. It's the eighties, and Reaganomics doesn't suit her. But she found a way to integrate her affinity with art with her thesis--she's writing about the value of art in the marketplace. So she moves to her parents vacation A-frame in the Sierras, intending to wrap herself in the mountain air, solitude, and writing.Soon enough, Cress seeks out disruptions and distractions, and becomes absorbed in the community. I was installed in the story quickly, as I noted that her quirky supporting cast of characters were humanized and sympathetic rather than straw caricatures. Her parents are demanding and difficult. They are building a new cabin and come down periodically, often on the verge of suing the contractor, Ricky Garsh. Cress's father is peevish and parsimonious to the point of churlish, even to his own children. Cress's sister, Sharon, now living in London, goes through the primal birth therapy, so popular during this era. This alerts the reader that the sisters had some significant issues. Cress is largely unaware of her deep-seated problems, and acts out by entwining in a difficult relationship. Twice. And with much older men.""She wasn't making specific plans, but that hairline crack, she knew, could widen instantly to accommodate her, and day by day, its thin blackness grew less frightening, more logical and familiar, as if she could now walk right up, touch it with her fingertips, and, with a quick last smile over her shoulder at the fading world, slip right in.""This is not a prosaic domestic drama, not with Huneven at the helm. As in all her novels, she is plugged into collective concerns such as alcohol abuse and complex, obsessive relationships. And always, nature. The landscape, wildlife, and climate buttress the story and provide ample adventure and scenic beauty, as well as some brassy comedy.This is Huneven's most fully realized novel, with a stable focus and a memorable denouement.

He will shoot down divine belief in coincidences with statistics, theories, and candid, rational, un-magical thinking. That is whom Azalea Lewis seeks out to question all the tragic coincidences in her life.Azalea was born in the Isle of Man and orphaned at three when her mother disappeared while with her at a Devon fairground, Midsummer’s Day, 1982. Later, she finds out her mother was abducted and killed that day, and that her father could have been one of three men. She was adopted by good-natured, loving missionaries and moved to Uganda. Her adoptive parents were also killed on Midsummer’s Day, in 1992. Will she die, too, on the next Midsummer’s Day, June 21, 2012? She thinks so. There are more coincidences to be revealed as Azalea and Thomas kindle an affectionate relationship, and she tells him what she knows of her life story.As Thomas and Azalea become closer, they deliberate and examine the theories surrounding coincidence, luck, synchronicity--all the different and loaded words and beliefs that it entails. Thomas insists on the element of free will and randomness, and edifies Azalea on theories of determinism and providence, among other arguments. Azalea is open to the possibility of a master-controller, or divine intervention; Thomas trusts the scientific principles as explanation, although he is compassionate and sensitive to Azalea's position. Ultimately, he disregards the idea of a non-random influence.“…coincidences…aren’t the responsibility of any malign force—or even benign force. They’re just things that happen from time to time. That’s all.”Ironmonger’s euphonious narrative seamlessly alternates different time periods from 1982 to 2012, weaving in disparate events and settings. From the Isle of Man, to Uganda during the brutal civil war, and present day London, the author constructs a riveting, page-turning story that will appeal to readers of popular and literary fiction. Although the framework of coincidence calls attention to the mechanics of plot design, it is accomplished with subtlety. Occasionally, it veers into over-deliberation, but when it does, it is brief and doesn’t deter from its credibility.

There's the physical structure of a house, there's the city, state, or country, and then there's the more complex and individual idea of home, the home that lives within our hearts. Maybe because I was a huge fan of THE WIZARD OF OZ since I was a little girl, I gravitate to these stories. Too, I was uprooted right before high school to a different part of the country, and I wobbled for a while with my environment, until one day I realized that home is something more abstract to me. Sue Miller's latest novel addresses all my favorite themes by exploring the various concepts of home. I hoped that her execution and style would entice me as much as her ideas, but, unfortunately, once the lively set-up was established, the book just coasted on and became a bit drab, like it was searching too hard for reinforcement. The gravity of the story hovered in mid-air, but never hit ground. I didn't feel it emotionally.Frankie Rowley has been doing aid work in Africa for fifteen years, and after her last love affair goes south, she returns to the States to stay with her parents, at least for the time being. Her parents have retired and settled into what used to be their summer home in Pomeroy, New Hampshire. Growing up, Frankie, her sister Liz, and her parents moved around a lot, because Frankie's father, Alfie, worked in academia and had a hard time settling. Frankie's most steady home was actually the farmhouse in Pomeroy, since they went there every summer. Alfie was intellectually gifted, and attained many master's degrees and a PhD. He was eclectic but yet shallowly involved, and self-absorbed. Eventually, Alfie got tenured by an undistinguished college in Connecticut.Along with Alfie's intellectual restiveness, he was arm's length from his daughters. He taught them scholarly material, but was a hands-off kind of father. So, Frankie's relationship with Alfie was restricted to her achievements, more or less. Her mother, Sylvia, also an academic who taught college English, possessed some bitterness and resentment due to her subservience to Alfie's capriciousness. When she inherited the farmhouse, she felt like she had her own place of solitude, finally, and she would often leave Alfie in the city and come here by herself.But, now, Alfie is in the early stages of Alzheimer's, and in keeping with the theme, it was a brilliant stroke of Miller's to examine home as the most personal of places--the identity--the place where the mind resides. What happens when you lose that? Moreover, Alfie tends to wander. Miller subtly parallels the aimless wandering of Alzheimer's with the wanderlust of Frankie.This is all information that is set up near the start of the book. Frankie is ""homeless,"" as she puts it, because she is conflicted about returning to Africa. She meets an attractive man in Pomeroy, a newspaper editor named Bud Jacobs, who left the fast-paced, competitive journalist's life in New York in order to live in a peaceful country community, and sought Pomeroy out when he saw the newspaper was for sale. Frankie, like her father, has a hard time settling, staying in one place.Compounding all these questions of home is Pomeroy itself. There have always been the year-round people and the summer people.""In the old days...the lines had been more sharply drawn. There were the summer people, and then there were the townspeople. The summer people had work elsewhere, personal lives elsewhere, all of which were invisible when they were here, whereas the townspeople's lives and their work were visible to anyone who cared to look--especially when they were working in the summer for the summer people.""And, now, some of the summer people (like Frankie's parents) have become year-round people. Any lines that were once drawn are now blurring.And, the motif of home is edged even further when a streak of fires occur to houses in Pomeroy. The incidents happen close together, and at the start, it only happens to the summer people's homes, while standing empty, awaiting the families' arrival.The framework/bones of this book, with the themes of home, drew me in. But, it didn't engage me for the long haul. Once Miller set it up, and I was into it for a while, it kind of went flat for me. Rather than organic growth spurts to the story, it became either predictable or redundant. And, although she created distinctive characters at the start, they kind of sputtered as the story progressed. Some prosaic events occurred, and the entanglements and interactions between characters failed to have lift-off, unless it was forced. It lacks dynamism, energy, charisma. It was like a talented singer that only sings one note. Miller has all the right tools in there, but the execution, after the first several chapters, felt bland.

American Nell Stone (who is inspired by Margaret Mead) already has a best selling book on natives of the Solomon Islands. Nell's Australian husband, Fen, is jealous of her success, and is often reproachful and competitive. He is desperate to make a name for himself, and, instead of collaborating with Nell, he keeps his work hidden. However, Fen admits to a genuine regard for his wife's work.The couple had recently studied the Mumbanyo, a frighteningly barbaric tribe, and left abruptly, at Nell's request, resigning to move to Australia to study the Aboriginal peoples. Fen wanted to stay in New Guinea; he is after a totemic flute that he learned of during their last days with the Mumbanyo, and believes that securing it is the key to his glory. However, out of love and dedication to Nell, he capitulated.Andrew Bankston is a tall, lanky, wistful anthropologist who recently failed at suicide. He met Nell and Fen quite spontaneously, and talked them out of Australia and back into New Guinea, promising to find them a stimulating tribe to study. He corrals them on his motorized boat, and helps them settle in with the Tam people, about seven hours from where he is studying with the Kionas. Periodically, he comes to visit, and their developing friendship provides much of the adventure and drama of the novel. Each of them has their own talents and approach to ethnography. Fen thrives on experience, on doing, saturating in the culture by joining the inhabitants, almost impetuously. He's a hustler, and can learn languages swiftly--""he absorbs words like sunlight."" Nell is a thinker with a deep empathy and imagination. Language is limited, in her estimation.""You have to pay much more attention when you can't understand the words. Once comprehension comes, so much else falls away...words aren't always the most reliable thing.""Andrew is an excellent theorist, who ponders the science itself.""I find I am more interested in this question of subjectivity, and the limited lens of the anthropologist...Perhaps all science is merely self-investigation.""The study of cultural differences by these individuals is not a tendentious prop to raise our consciousness. Rather, there's more of an allegory that coils and tightens, and ultimately astonishes. The intersection between the anthropologists and the tribes that they study is the predominant theme and the fulcrum of suspense in this story. I finished this novel a few days ago, but the parallels between the text, subject matter, and reader continue to heighten and captivate me. As the story progressed, it revealed clues that were intensified by the reader's observation of the anthropologists and the their immersion in the cultures.""When only one person is the expert on a particular people, do we learn more about the people or the anthropologist when we read their analysis?""And, too, there's the correlation to quantum physics that Nell and Andrew consider, i.e. that objectivity is impossible because the application of observation changes the matter being studied.Although narrated in the first person by Andrew, the journal entries by Nell provide the potent drama, often in a subtle manner of extemporaneous observation. I felt like I was living with the Tam people, and exploring their behaviors and customs.""Fen claims that if you just let go of your brain you find another brain, the group brain, the collective brain, and that it is an exhilarating form of human connection that we have lost in our embrace of the individual except when we go to war. Which is my point exactly.""I applaud everything about this novel--setting, characters, prose, and story. However, it is the voice of the novel--Andrew's and Nell's--that moved me the most. Their back-stories of past losses, and the disclosure of how Fen and Nell met, add dimension to the present. There's a lightness of spirit and yet a poignant acuity of their deepest thoughts and perceptions. The author avoids reductive and clichéd writing and characterizations. This was fresh, buoyant, and tender storytelling.I've read numerous novels that embrace anthropology; however, this was more fully realized than Berlinski's FIELDWORK, less conspicuous than Yanagihara's PEOPLE IN THE TREES, and not cerebrally self-conscious like Rush's MATING (although I enjoyed all of those books). Lily King's approach is more intimate, and the presence of the reader as observer is exploratory and essential. EUPHORIA is emotionally compelling sans melodrama, gripping in its taut finesse, compassion, and colossal humanity.""And maybe I will never find it all in one culture but maybe I can find parts of it in several cultures, maybe I can piece it together like a mosaic and unveil it to the world.""...more",Notes are private!,1,287,1,not set,"Apr 06, 2014","Apr 08, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18467802-euphoria

So, when this stand-alone was offered, I decided to give it a go. Therefore, I can’t compare this to any book other than related thrillers or mysteries. It held its own, and I ripped through the pages in record time (just a few days), as I was riveted to the well-paced narrative. Nesbo did not squander character for plot; the main players were well-rounded and sympathetic.Sonny Lofthus, now thirty, has been in prison for twelve years, since his father’s death. Ab Lofthus, a police officer, apparently committed suicide, admitting to corruption in his suicide note. Sonny was a wrestling champ at school with a good future ahead, but after Ab’s death, both he and his mother descended into despair. After his mother died of an overdose, Sonny became a heroin addict, and eventually agreed to take the fall for several murders and go to prison in return for being supplied heroin while locked up. In prison, Sonny stays chiefly silent, and is known for having healing hands, almost holy hands that mend the broken soul. During a session where he lays his hands on a fellow inmate, at the start of the book, Sonny learns some startling news about his father—that, in fact, he was killed, and the corruption placed on him was bogus. This changes everything for Sonny, and in a convincing plan, he breaks out of prison with the help of the other, trusted convict. Thus begins a cat-and-mouse game between Sonny and the police force, particularly Simon Kefas, a fine detective who once hit rock bottom with a gambling addiction, but pulled himself together with the love of a good woman (who is losing her eyesight and needs an expensive operation), and is now a solid member of the Homicide Squad, and a keen, Colombo-ish detective.The thing that sets Sonny apart from other rabid drug addicts is that he is a well-mannered gentleman, like his father, and says “Please,” “Thank-you,” and other niceties in a soft-spoken voice. Although he is socially awkward, his kindness and integrity attract people who want to help him, including Martha, the manager of a group home for active drug addicts. Martha senses that he isn’t using anymore, but something about Sonny penetrates her jaded veneer, and he is able to hide in plain sight, between the facility and his parent’s now-empty house. Sonny has a plan, and people to see, and bad guys to confront. Along the way, Sonny grows up in unexpected ways.The thrumming pace is largely due to the alternating chapters that go back and forth between Sonny and Simon, and a few other players in-between. Although the arc has a familiar formula, Nesbo maintains a fresh, complex plot by gradually revealing the back stories of Sonny, his father, and Simon. Simon’s new partner, an ambitious and educated officer named Kari, is a sturdy addition to the story, and serves as Simon’s sounding board and student. I waited a few days before writing my , as I had to think about the twist at the end. Was it organic, convincing, or was it a second-rate Shyamalan gimmick? I had to ponder whether it was trying to outsmart the audience, or whether the story affects the characters in authentic ways--how it changes them, what it teaches them, and what they gain or lose in the process. After thinking this through, I concluded that Nesbo did it right.

Some books, whether self-help, memoirs, or novels, have an agenda to assist the readeThere are as many books on grieving as there are ways to grieve. Some books, whether self-help, memoirs, or novels, have an agenda to assist the reader through the grieving process. Hemmings’ novel, however, doesn’t overreach, patronize, or even subtly attempt to provide lessons in grief or a helping hand. Instead, it is an engaging character study of specific people going through a universal process in very personal ways. It isn’t narrated in a maudlin or elegiac voice, or expressed through histrionics. Rather, the voice is frank, natural, and entirely authentic.It took a few chapters to settle in, because I was thrust into the story in the midst of things (in media res) rather than with a preamble or introduction. Hemmings gently reveals the recent and past history of her characters by immersing you in present day matters. Moreover, circumstances at hand hint at conduits to the future. The author is skilled at evincing a moment with a narrow lens, and then gradually expanding the scope of the story into a mature and contoured portrait. Sarah St John is the main character. Three months ago, she lost her twenty-two year old son, Cully, in an avalanche while he was skiing in their hometown of Breckenridge, Colorado. Cully was an only child, and Sarah never married his father, although they remain on amicable terms. Her best friend, Suzanne, is a reluctant divorcée, mourning over the ex-husband she still loves. Her daughter, Morgan, was Cully’s best friend. Sarah’s father retired from Breckenridge’s ski resort industry last year and temporarily moved in with Sarah and Cully, but he hasn’t left. He’s wrestling with the tragic death of his grandson and the ennui that retirement created. Years ago, he lost a wife, Sarah’s mother, when Sarah was five. He never remarried. Still handsome, in his lugubrious way, he copes with emptiness via a fixation on QVC television. In the meantime, Sarah considers leaving her job as a co-host on “Fresh Tracks,” a taped show that is aired in all the best hotels and resorts in the area. At one time she aimed to be a serious reporter, but a surprise pregnancy at twenty-one ended that, and Cully began. Right now, she’s contending with uncertainty--beginnings, endings, and a tug of war in the middle. Hemmings does a stellar job of illuminating several conflicts in one scene. Suzanne longs for support, but Sarah’s loss of a son competes and eclipses Suzanne’s divorce. In the thick of grief, seeds of weary judgment, sharp resentment, and entitlement obtrude. And the guilt impinges.“Guilt came for feeling hungry, for having that sensation. It came from yawning, from putting on make-up, dressing nicely. It came when I felt sexual desire…feeling so awful that…I still felt anything at all. The body just keeps going. It doesn’t care what you’re up to. I remember how guilty I felt for not buying him the most expensive urn.”Enter a young, enigmatic woman named Kit, who offers to shovel Sarah’s driveway. Her comely youth and mien ignite a spark of generosity in both Sarah and her father, a spirited sense of congenial familiarity. As the story progresses, recovery takes a turn toward redemption. But something more than redemption, too--clarity, connection, and the balance of experience flicker; recurrence and a dynamic kinship evolve and involve all the characters. I did predict and anticipate some plot points, but the journey here is what is sublime. And, don’t be so sure of the destination until you reach the end. And even then, the possibilities are endless…“Something is breaking in me, but instead of feeling broken, I feel as if something better is building in its place.”...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Apr 04, 2014","Apr 04, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18144068-the-possibilities

Perhaps seeking the apt aphorism.“Everything was always something, but something—and here was the rub—could never be anything.” Paul’s Jewish ex-girlfriend, Connie, works in the office. When they were together, he became consumed with Judaism (but not God) so that he could belong to her family. Years before, he tried to belong to a Catholic girlfriend’s Catholic family (but not God). Betsy, his upright dental hygienist, is a religious Roman Catholic, and Paul often enjoys debunking God in her presence. But he appreciated her rituals.“Her internalization of Catholicism and its institutional disappointments suited a dental office perfectly, where guilt was often our last resort for motivating the masses.”Paul’s emptiness was bottomless, and he was desperate to find a dedication to something bigger than himself. Replacing a rotten tooth with a pontic so that a patient could smile again, or watching David Ortiz bat a homer, and even drinking a mochaccino—these were no small things. But they didn’t promise eternal fulfillment or facilitate his restive soul to the submission of God.“I would have liked to believe in God. Now there was something that could have been everything better than anything else…It could all be mine: the awesome pitch of organ pipes, the musings of Anglican bishops.” However, he can’t make it past the Bible’s talk of “firmament.” He starts bleeding tears of terminal boredom.He also keeps a low profile online—no Facebook, no Twitter. But the world’s preoccupation with Smart Phones, which he calls “me-machines,"" intrigues him. Occasionally, he Googles himself. Then, one day, he notices that someone has hijacked his identity, created a Facebook account of him and his dental practice, and alleges to be Paul O’Rourke! Moreover, the other Paul starts writing controversial religious excerpts from a bible that belongs to an ancient tribe or sect.He (this thief of O’Rourke) claims to be an Ulm, from the Old Testament people known as the Amalekites—people who were even more persecuted than the Jews; in fact, they assert that they were destroyed by the Israelites. These online declarations in Paul’s name create contention with the Tweeting public; it hints of a political incorrectness bordering on anti-Semitism. Unless, of course, it is just the facts, and it is true. Is it true? Is Paul doing this to himself, has he lost his mind? The narrative advances a viable history of the Ulms, one that is provocative and convincing. Its doctrine is the belief in doubting God. As the plot progresses, Paul’s inner contradictions become an external force, one he has to reckon with, which demands him to take action, adjust his creature-of-habit lifestyle, and face the unfamiliar.The story moves along like a locomotive, propelling me forward; I read it in two breathless sittings.

You don’t need to be interested in the application of it; rather, it is more about one man in particular, whose life brought him to this secretive, isolating practice. Rong Jinzhen is a brainiac in mathematics and also likely a man with Asperger’s syndrome. Jia’s novel is a portrait of this unusual individual—an introverted, focused, and solitary genius. The narrative is subtle, unsentimental, yet tender and captivating. The translation by Olivia Milburn and Christopher Payne is so smooth and nimble that it reads like English was the primary language of the novel.The story begins in 1873 with the youngest member of the seventh generation of the wealthy, salt merchant Rong family. He is leaving the (fictional?) city of Tongzhen to study abroad, the first academic in the family. The last pages of the novel indicate it is now 2002 (when this novel was published in China). In between is a combination spy, historical, and family drama. Most importantly, it is a character study of Rong Jinzhen, born in the 1930s. The story is lyrical and literary, but also page turning and suspenseful, ripe for espionage fans and literature lovers alike.Rong Jinzhen’s life had inauspicious beginnings. His mother, Youying, an academic genius who had studied at Cambridge, died giving birth to him, and his profligate father was stabbed to death. Jinzhen was raised by an elderly European dream interpreter, Mr. Auslander, who recognized and encouraged the young boy’s mathematical abilities. When Auslander died, Jinzhen was taken back into the fold of the wealthy Rong family. Jinzhen’s intellectual gifts and emotional well-being are given support and stability, and he is educated at his patriarch’s university.There are 150 pages before Jinzhen is lured into the secret cryptography Unit 701. The author’s detailed brushstrokes of Jinzhen paint a fully dimensional and often agonized man, who joins a group of other like-minded souls. By the time he joins the Unit, the reader has an animated, distinct profile of Jinzhen. He and his colleagues find their purpose and sanction inside the hallowed, secret life of cryptography. What vitalized the story even more was the emotional power given to the intellectual field of numbers. These professionals find comfort and solace in cryptography. The reader isn’t subjected to dry and abstruse text. Rather, Jinzhen’s work and the man himself are impassioned twins, a binary coupling that is both his strength and his weakness. (If there were an American cinematic example, it would be John Turturro in any number of movies where he plays a tortured genius).Along the way, there are twists and turns, surprises in narrative form that Jia dared to execute. Part five of the novel is a collection of fragments, and, just like the riddles of cryptography, I was confronted with trying to decipher a cipher. Only an able, assured writer like Jia could persuade a reader in this direction. Not only that, I was haunted by the figure of Jinzhen even more. I wanted to penetrate the impenetrable.

Ted Thompson’The negating emptiness of a man’s late middle age is examined alongside of the encroaching isolation of America’s late-stage capitalism. Ted Thompson’s debut novel is reminiscent of Cheever and Updike, rightly so, and his narrative, to me, was warmer and less self-conscious than Updike. Most of the novel takes place in a tony exurb of Connecticut during the Christmas holidays, as Anders Hill’s life begins to unravel. In order to support his early retirement, Anders needs to sell the house that that his ex-wife, Helene, still lives in; the payments are a year overdue, his finances are stretched, and Helene is uninformed. In the meantime, his neighbor’s teenage son, Charlie, is consumed with a drug habit. Anders, ignorant of this fact, is guilty of sharing a loaded pipe with him at Charlie’s parent’s annual party. Subsequently, Charlie passes out.Although divorce is a frequent trope in novels--and how it changes families and children, senior life break-ups are less common. Anders asked Helene for a divorce after the sons were grown, and he was approaching sixty. Put on hold for a year after Helene was diagnosed with breast cancer, he resumed the split after she recovered from the surgery, the chemo, and the loss, and was once again cancer-free. Helene was stunned, but moved on with her life, much to the alarm of Anders, especially when she moves her new boyfriend, an old college friend, into the Connecticut house he desperately needs to sell.Much of the novel is introspection--Anders and secondly, Helene's, but the poignant episodes that move the plot along, or reach back to the past, illuminate the deep fissures in this land of steady habits.

Immigrants are attracted to the glitter and hustle, the urbanity and promise of remaking themselves and securing wealth. In Tash Aw's Booker finalist novel, four Malaysians with different stories and backgrounds come to Shanghai to score their dreams. Their interconnected lives are slowly revealed over the course of the story; on the way there, I was immersed in each one as the narrative alternates back and forth with finesse and a solid momentum. This is about characters--but the main character of all is Shanghai, who subsumes and sometimes devours a person and their dreams.Phoebe is a young village woman who comes to Shanghai full of hope and hunger. Changing her identity to Chinese and buying knock-off designer garb, she is naïve enough to believe that material wealth is deserved and attained by her desires and the absorption of numerous self-help books. Gary was an abused child who became a sensation as a Taiwanese pop star, but due to some poor public conduct, has been reduced to obscurity and singing in shopping malls. Yinghui is an above-average success in business, but lonely in her personal life. She is about to embark on an exciting business venture with the elusive billionaire, Walter Chao, who is the author of the self-help book, “Five-Star Bilionaire.” Justin CK Lim is a lonely riches to rags gentleman who has become a recluse, enervated with depression. The links between all of them are disclosed in the course of the story.Shanghai, for all its promise, can be an icy, unforgiving city. For all the earnest aspiration and optimism, there’s a tint of grim foreshadowing in every chapter. There’s no easy success; Shanghai provides a certainty of doubt and facile exploitation to the willing and the desperate, the lonely and determined, wherever you come from and no matter your ambitions. Aw’s silky prose and strong characterizations swept me up into its dangerous charm and universal themes. Ruin and revenge, doubt and trust, integrity and dissolution, and the capriciousness of affluence inhabit the story’s heart. The prospect of love in an indifferent city reaches out like a fateful redemption. “…a mixture of excitement and apprehension that people exhibited when still new in Shanghai, in search of something, even though they could not articulate what that something was—maybe it was money, or status, or, God forbid, even love—but whatever it was, Shanghai was not about to give it to them.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Mar 2014,"Mar 28, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16071831-five-star-billionaire

As teenagers, they banded together in their communal Beijing neighborhood. Shaoai, an outspoken dissident of the Chinese government, was poisoned, apparently an accident, in the shadow of the Tiananmen Square protests. She takes twenty years to die, although the massive deterioration begins early. Soon after this harrowing event, the three friends, in a tacit pact, drift away from one other, circumscribing their adult lives with self-imposed emotional quarantines.The novel opens in Beijing, and seamlessly alternates in time and place between China and America. As the story examines the lives of Boyang, Moran, and Ruyu, as teens when the tragedy occurred and now as middle-aged adults, their shared parallels of solitude are probed, and the mystery of Shaoai's poisoning is gradually revealed. They haven't spoken to each other in twenty years, and all three are divorced, childless, and detached from passion and fulfillment.Ruyu, an orphan from the provinces, is sent by her grandaunts at age 15 to live with Shaoai’s parents in Beijing. They want her to get a better education. Shaoai and her friends treat Ruyu with a haughty truculence. Ruyu, however, is an inward girl, lacking social graces, a cipher to others. She is aloof, inscrutable, and privately prays to God. She doesn’t seek others out, much to their frustration.Boyang and Moran, longtime friends, reach out to Ruyu, who accepts their friendship with a general indifference. She is unused to the community spirit of her new home, where many families convene together in the shared quadrangle. Boyang is the son of wealthy college professors, who he visits on weekends; they left him to be raised by his grandmother while they pursued their ambitions. Moran is the equalizer; she is eager to nurture. For her, life was a series of ideal moments, filled with “a larger dose of joy.” Unfortunately, Shaoia’s poisoning leaves them all contaminated with psychic toxins. As adults, they sought out lives to subvert their memories, at the same time reeling from them.""Those seeking sanctuary in misremembering did not separate what had happened from what could have happened.""Boyang stayed in Beijing, while Moran and Ruyu left for separate parts of America. All are locked away in prisons they have built for themselves. Boyang, divorced, is a wealthy businessman, getting by in a series of superficial relationships with younger women. Ruyu keeps herself sequestered in a restrained life as an underachiever. Moran, working for a pharmaceutical company in Massachusetts, still keeps in touch with her ex-husband, but divorced him in order to maintain an emotional void. And yet,“She was afraid of meeting another person like her, but more than that she was afraid of never meeting another person like her, who, however briefly, would look into her eyes so that she knew she was not alone in her loneliness.”Li’s measured narrative combines finely calibrated characters and elegant, elegiac prose. The tone evoked a grey chill, but not entirely bleak. There was a haze of something brighter around the edges of the story—a wish for redemption and forgiveness. There was sympathy for their guarded enclosures, like a sweet spot buried under their memories and their isolation.“To know the world, for a child, is to ask questions, but the situation leading to those questions, once answered, are forgotten; having garnered enough knowledge, one enters adulthood only to be confronted by more questions, which, no longer answerable, form the context of one’s being.”...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Mar 2014,"Mar 26, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18077906-kinder-than-solitude

Of course, what they see is the surface of each other, the conspicuous exterior. The running motif concerns the peeling of the veneers, to acutely reflect on their own lives and unearth their authentic self.Leon, a therapist, is married to Claudia, a scholar of the sublime mural and stained glass artist, John LaFarge. Their grown daughter, Emma, is engaged, but ambivalent about her writer-fiancé, Steven. She is temporarily living with her parents since she broke her ankle, and is equivocal about her dissertation studies in French. Lately, she has noticed that her parents are not what they once seemed.With a view onto their window, Nina perceives a life for Leon’s family that derives from her own imagination. Nina is married to a workaholic lawyer, Jeremy, who is trying to make partner, while she takes care of their two small children 24/7. She feels oppressed in the affected posture of parenthood, i.e. pretending consummate content. The contemporary parenting style incorporates the cardinal rule of never losing your temper, but beneath all this perfection lay terror.“The only language spoken was certainty. Outwardly, she was reciting the maxims with everyone else: The kids were always delicious and she wouldn’t miss this for the world.”Nina hides her restiveness, observing the masks of other mothers, while participating in this tacitly agreed temperament and language. Here with the other Upper West Side mommies, it is a sin to complain about motherhood.In the midst of inescapable unease, there’s noisy construction next door, as old historic buildings are razed to make way for new steel and glass high-rises. Leon welcomes the new construction; Claudia is livid about the destruction of momentous old buildings, and periodically screams from her open window at the noise outside. Eventually, all these lives begin to entangle, and the boundaries between neighbors gradually dissolve. The author is a sharp observer of the inner contradictions that denude people’s lives. This is demonstrated through the characters’ thoughts and inner dialogue. However, the intersecting of these individuals, which is the narrative purpose, is also the narrative’s shortcomings. The dialogue is stilted and prosaic; the emotional connections feel forced and cursory. The extended metaphor of La Farge’s stained glass--always dynamic, the colors in a continual state of creation when exposed to light-- can’t save this boilerplate story. I could not connect with any of the characters, because the emotional seams were weak, the interactions contrived.This was a quick read, easily finished in a couple of sittings.

She was criticized for her small architectural works that consisted of too much busyness--cluttered with figures and text that didn't fit into any schema. Her husband, Felix Lord, was an influential, successful art collector, but who couldn't help his wife for alleged fear of nepotism. After Felix died, Harriet came back with a vengeance, and under three male artist's pseudonyms (artists that she sought out), she created a combination art (part performance, if you consider the pseudonyms as part of the process) a trilogy which was successful, and even more lauded posthumously. They were shown individually under the names of ""The History of Western Art, "" ""The Suffocation Rooms"", and ""Beneath."" Later, when unmasked (so to speak), they were identified as Maskings. I am reluctant to reduce and categorize Harriet--although labels such as ""feminist"" may apply.Harriet wanted to:""...uncover the complex workings of human perception and how unconscious ideas about gender, race, and celebrity influence a viewer's understanding of a given work of art."" Moreover, it is about unmasking ourselves--which includes the hermaphroditic selves. We are all an amalgam of male and female, or male and female perceptions and the plurality-attributed behaviors. There's seepage beyond the paradigm.Again, that may be too reductionist for the complex workings of Harry's art, and of her psychology and her life. This novel is like an exposé of Harriet's life, as told via her friends, colleagues, children (including one passage by her son, who suffered from Asperger's), lover (her significant other after Felix's death), critics, roommates, and herself. The chapters by Harriet come from her private notebooks/diaries, labeled by letters of the alphabet, and found after her death.One could call this a presentation novel--a novel that appears more as a collection of writings that make up her life, replete with footnotes. Included are esoteric and big ideas about art, art movements, and philosophy. However, Hustvedt is such a spectacular writer, that it feels very much like a biography, and often an autobiography (sometimes reliable, at other times unreliable--you as reader decide). Hustvedt combines big ideas with story. There are novels, such as written by David Foster Wallace, Richard Powers, and others, who are famous for this style. The novelist Nicholas Mosley writes his story and characters as subservient to the big ideas. This alienates some readers. It is purely subjective to taste, but, personally, I love a cleavage of ideas and story/character. In my opinion, Hustvedt did a superb job of integrating the two. The character of Harriet was pervasive, even in the chapters that didn't belong to her, because of her inimitable voice that saturated all others who populated the story. Harriet habituated these big ideas, so that it was organically composed.Harry's emotional and psychological presence was forceful, formidable. We learn that she saw a psychiatrist twice a week for the last eight years of her life, and her best friend was a psychotherapist. She was a dedicated wife to her husband and children, fraught over the secret life of her husband, and protective over the fragility of her son, Ethan. All vectors pointed back to Harriet--the enigma of her, and the magnitude of her vitality. She was ubiquitous in every page of this book.I was familiar with some of the scholars/academics/artists/philosophers that Harriet mentioned due to other novels and books I had read. Parisian Guy Debord, leader of the Situationist International movement, had a prominent place in BILLY MOON. The Situationists advanced the notion of the spectacularized--a mass consumerism where every experience is packaged by the market to be seductive and glamorous, and sooner or later, we experience the copy as an original experience rather than the experience itself--all is commodified. Harriet assimilated this philosophy (and others to demonstrate the conundrum of perception). One of Harriet's favorite philosophers was the German, Edmund Husserl, who expounded on phenomenology, the study of the structures of experience and consciousness. It all ties into the assemblage of Harriet--like her art, she is made of many miniature selves that together form a whole. Or, perhaps, a panoply of selves.And, most dear to Harry's heart--perhaps her heroine--was Margaret Cavendish, a duchess and groundbreaking, prolific writer of science, predated science fiction, and a utopian romance called ""A Blazing World,"" from which the eponymous title of this novel originates. Cavendish died in obscurity, having published a memoir in which she yearns to one day be recognized. Hundreds of years after her death, her desire is realized. Is this a key to Harriet's psyche?One doesn't have to be a scholar or artist to relate to this book. In fact, it is written in a highly accessible style, with a smoldering, emotional, and psychological expressiveness. In my opinion, this is a subtle meta-fiction--one that draws attention to itself as a work of art, while keys to the truth of Harriet Burden are revealed. As individuals, we all have our perception of quality and merit; therefore, readers will come away with our respective portraits of Harriet, and the thrumming purpose of her story. For fans of Siri Hustvedt, this is highly recommended. It equals the power of WHAT I LOVED, while being different in approach. Hustvedt has a nimble way of disclosing the incongruous features of her characters that make them both distinctive and sympathetic.

The 1966 CharlesAlthough MONDAY MONDAY is a multi-generational family saga with a strong story/plot, this is also a novel of solid, energetic themes. The 1966 Charles Whitman sniper spree from the University of Texas, Austin, clock tower forms the framework of the novel. Graduate students and best friends Wyatt and Jack save a stranger's life, a young undergraduate named Shelly, when she is shot while crossing the South Mall plaza of the university. Both Jack and Shelly were injured, leaving post-trauma scars. In Jack's case, it affects him and his wife in an unfortunate way that cannot be undone. For Shelly, the physical scars create a minor disability and loss of body image. She is also shocked, and too frightened to immediately return to college. Wyatt returns to his uncertain marriage and toddler son, expressing his trauma through his paintings (he is an art student and teacher). However, all three lives become inextricably connected, stemming from that fateful Monday.It is difficult to express the themes without spoiling the plot, and I don’t want to ruin the proverbial reader discovery. However, the themes are universal, and also very personal to the characters. How do our (physical and figurative) scars affect our lives, and those of our families and friends? Shelly, the story’s primary protagonist, veers from her established plans after the shooting. She had wanted to graduate, join the Peace Corps, and volunteer in foreign, exotic countries. Instead, transgressions follow the tragedy, creating a domino effect that reaches into future generations. Secrets and unorthodox decisions, especially for that era, generate more confounding problems—a sort of *damned if you do tell, damned if you don’t* set of conflicts. Every choice is weighted with gravity and reverberating consequences.In the book's ending acknowledgements, the author declared that this novel illuminates what it means to be a wife and mother. This is true for Shelly, and Wyatt's and Jack's wives. But this is also applicable to being a father and husband. Moreover, and what gripped me the most, is the question of how we identify our heroes. There are the lifesaving deeds that cleave us to that person, such as what subsequently happened in Crook's novel after the Whitman tragedy. But, what about the small, almost imperceptible, accumulating acts that a parent or spouse conducts every day, over a lifetime, for their families? What characterizes courage, heroism, guts? This novel also explores the sense of shame that comes with the failure to step forward and help another, and how one copes and compensates for that deficiency. As Shelly, Wyatt, and Jack become parents, and then grandparents, the novel illuminates that day to day mettle and faithful commitment is one kind of courage that amasses in less dazzling ways than saving someone's life, but is no less significant.Although I finished this book over a week ago, I had difficulty rating it, and trying to be ""objective."" Although Crook writes some exquisite and soulful passages, many of her sentences have a boggy syntax. A good copy editor could purge the surplus of dependent clauses and superfluous adverbs that slow the momentum of the story. Periodically, Crook's focus is wobbly, and she follows a secondary trail too far from the center. However, time has only enhanced this story for me. For one thing, Austin is my home, and UT Austin my alma mater. The author's details of the landscape, geography, and atmosphere from Austin to Alpine was spot-on, and elegantly described. More importantly, there are elements of the story that mirror my own life, which provoked a lot of deep reflection several days after I finished the book. The setting, and the organic portrayal of humanity, eclipsed the flaws. Therefore, I am awarding 5 stars. Crook manifests how the chain of life is wrought from our virtues and vices in equal measure, and that the power of grace and forbearance can atone for the deepest of scars.“Maybe he [Charles Whitman] had chosen her on nothing more than a random impulse. That was probably the case. But the older she became, the more she wanted to feel that she’d had a hand in the matter—that some action of her own had determined the outcome, that she had plotted her own misguided course. It seemed better than being a luckless victim of fate.”4.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Mar 2014,"Mar 12, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18490557-monday-monday

Mireille Jameson is a lawyer, wife, and mother, born to wealthy Haitian parents, Sebastien and Fabienne Duval, raised in both America and Haiti. Once he stockpiled his wealth, Sebastian, a successful contractor, returned to Port-Au-Prince from America with Mireille's mother. As the story opens, Mereille is visiting her parents from Miami with her Caucasian, Nebraskan-bred husband, Michael, and their baby, Christophe.The beginning portrays the kidnapping; the reader is thrust immediately into propulsive action. Unfortunately, for me, the execution felt derivative, copied from the legion of TV shows and movies that reduce it to stock effect. However, as the story progresses, it is evident that the kidnapping was only a tool to reach deeper into Mireille's tragic circumstances, and open up the genuine feelings and conflicts that come with PTSD. The book is essentially one-half captivity, and the latter half the after-effects.The prose was initially (for me) just serviceable, but this is another instance where it works just fine as the story develops. It gains more power as you learn the back story, also, which is revealed gradually. Gay is superb at mixing the past and the present without losing any momentum.The thrust of the story is how Mireille and her family deal with her PTSD. This is something Gay narrates with subtlety and compassion. As a psychiatric nurse, I believe that I am well-equipped to distinguish credible symptoms of PTSD from boiler plate copying. There wasn't one false note in Gay's portrayal of Mireille and her family members. I was turning the pages with eager anticipation and suspense.

Grace’s self-help/relationship book candidly opens up to women about their penchant to ignore signs of toxic partners. She identifies the red flags that one should detect when hooking up with a lifetime partner. Grace claims that most of us “know,” even from the beginning, when a partner isn’t right for us; too often we disregard the evidence in our quest to try and reconcile that other person into our lives. Fortunately for Grace, she has had 17 happily married years with Jonathan, a compassionate pediatric oncologist. Until one day, her life turns upside down.Grace's book is on the verge of being published; already she has had interviews with different magazines and TV news shows. Jonathan is supportive, her practice thrives, and their twelve-year-old son, Henry, is a bright student at a private, prestigious middle school. They live in the New York apartment that Grace grew up in. Their lives are content and balanced. And, then, a tragedy throws Grace into the teeth of an emotional storm. Her life has convulsed, her world is tilted, her compass is in uncharted territory, and misaligned. She has only herself, her comfort zones (special places in NY that she has known since childhood, a rural farmhouse in Connecticut, eateries she frequents), and her beloved son. Now, she thinks, who should have known?There’s a crime, but this isn’t a crime book or police procedural, despite some conspicuous detectives. Rather, this is a narrative about one woman’s examination of her life and her memories, with the threat of facing shame, humiliation, fear, and sorrow, and the horror of admitting that she may have failed to follow her own advice. Everything that Grace’s life is about--her life in New York, the safety of her son, her marriage and her practice--it is all in turmoil as she tries to uncover the truth of her husband, as she stands on the precipice of disaster and ruin. Most of her friends have withdrawn, or feel awkward to help. Some have gossipy curiosities. The captivating intimacy created by Korelitz draws the reader into Grace’s state of mind. We are taken on a journey of her past, including the details of how she revisits her memories. Grace begins to question the truth of her perceptions, which produces a chronicle of retrospection.

I knew Like many people, I am aware of the Dreyfus affair that took place in France in the late 19th century, but my knowledge was mostly peripheral. I knew that Alfred Dreyfus was a French soldier who was accused of spying on France for the Germans. I was born and raised Jewish, so it was also part of my heritage to recognize the persecuted Jews of the past. Harris’s novel awakened my understanding of the political and social climate of that period in history, and informed me of how this colossal miscarriage of justice was authorized, permitted—concocted! And the blatant antisemitism of the time sanctioned the demonization of Dreyfus.I am an avid novel reader, and historical milestones/events “stick” better if it is chronicled in a novel, where I can engage with the characters and narrative structure. Harris’s book both edified and entertained me on the Alfred Dreyfus affair. It alternated between reflective and dramatic action, as the author constructed a suspenseful spy story that also happened to be credible. He states in the Author’s Note that he used his imagination to dramatize some events, invent personal details, and cut out some figures entirely. However, he remained faithful to the truth.Georges Picquart, the principal character and narrator, is a Major who served at the École Militaire as a professor of topography. Dreyfus had been his student a few years back. After he attends Dreyfus’s degradation ceremony (stripping of his military honor), the Major receives a promotion to Colonel (at 40, he would be the youngest), and directed to command the Statistical Section (espionage).“Espionage is grubby work,” he thinks. “Everything I have seen of the Dreyfus case has reinforced that view. It isn’t what I joined the army to do.”However, as a patriot and devoted army officer, he has no choice but to accept. Early on, we learn that Pacquart played a minor role in Dreyfus’s apprehension, but Harris teases the facts out gradually, providing an air of mystery that heightens as the story progresses. As Pacquart uncovers sinister lies and conspiracies related to the Dreyfus case, he begins to keep his own counsel, and demonstrates what an adept spy he really is. The fallout from that threatens his career, and possibly his life.One of the most intriguing characters in this story is Dreyfus himself. As described by Harris--inability to observe social cues, poor eye contact, idiosyncrasies, lack of facial expression, and impaired social communication--he would likely be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder if he lived in contemporary times. (This is not stated in the book--autism is my professional specialty, and I recognize the traits). Is this relevant? Possibly so, as it made him unsavory to the French public (beyond his Jewishness). He failed to elicit their sympathy.This is my first Harris book. It took me a few chapters to engage; he isn’t literary—his prose is plain-spoken (and sometimes just plain). However, his pacing is excellent, and the structure is measured and tight. Ultimately, the prose works, and nuances deepen. It’s a subdued nail-biter by a superb storyteller....more",Notes are private!,2,61,1,not set,Feb 2014,"Feb 21, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18007532-an-officer-and-a-spy

I think that it was the reason I enjoyed ALENA more than readers who hold REBECCA in such high esteem. But, how many readers of JANE EYRE were negatively critical of REBECCA, if they read Brontë’s book first? I mention these considerations, as it may be a factor in a reader’s potential engagement with ALENA.The Midwestern narrator, a young and naïve aspiring art curator with a natural eye for beauty, is offered a job by Bernard Augustin, the dapper, moody, wealthy, and gay founder/owner of an art museum on Cape Cod called the Nauk. They first meet at the Venice Biennale, and aligned over the exquisite art that he shows her in this ancient City of Masks and canals, and then the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua. (Interesting that the climax of Rebecca, according to my research, occurs at a masked ball. There is no masked ball in ALENA, but it is in the City of Masks that the story takes off). The Nauk museum sits on a sand dune, and has a gothic demeanor that progressively translates into a menacing presence. The museum has been closed for two years, since the mysterious death of the now enshrined Alena. Her death is manifested on the tragic face of Augustin, who rarely speaks of her. Our unnamed narrator will plan the first show since Alena’s death.The prose is sensuous and narcotic, faintly erotic, and glimmers, like flashes in a fog, with vestiges of relics and ghosts. The emerging theme is how the absence/death of one person (Alena) can create a phantom ubiquity that vibrates more than the living and sentient. Even the fact of “unnamed narrator” gives Alena more substance than the woman who stepped in to her position! It implies the narrator as the ghost, rather than Alena. Or, at least, Alena’s paler shadow. The narrator is in the void, vacated by Alena, who lingers.ALENA is also a scathing portrait of the self-serious and often pretentious contemporary art world, and paints a searing portrait of the elitist, provincial, and mysterious town of Nauquasset. Themes of dismemberment as a powerful reminder of the dead—or how the inanimate can come alive with its disconnected pieces—an earring, a boot, a stocking--—gives the novel an extra sinister touch. It is also braided into the worship of body artists, performance art, and others of the cultural vanguard. As the narrator describes herself:“This was the knack, the disembodied voice that lived like a twin inside me…and at the same time isolated me, the subtle sentences a kind of sticky silk, cocooning me in a chrysalis of my own making.” And this thought arose before she appropriated Alena’s job at the Nauk.The author’s sense of place is tremendously specific and ethereal at the same time, as is the eponymous Alena, the woman whose ghost inhabits every pore of the story. Perhaps another reason that I adore this book was locale. I spent many summers on Cape Cod (Massachusetts was where I was raised) and felt intimately familiar with Pastan’s luminous descriptions of the Cape—“…curled out from the mainland like a beckoning arm,” and “the hushed, monotonous sucking like the indrawn breath of a beast, and then the distending roar of the wave building, breaking, shattering against the sand.”And, to excite me further, Pastan illuminated Venice with a lush, sensory allure. I spent a week in Venice last year, and when Pastan conveyed this magical city in her lyrical, poetic prose, I was overcome with emotion. I knew the story of Saint Mark’s burial in Alexandria and how he was smuggled to Venice. I trembled to hear it again in this novel, and intimately followed the lunettes on the basilica illustrating the story in images:“…dark domes, white Istrian stone, and figures in gold and green and blue…” Art and death are fused together, personified into the perpetual specter of Alena, haunting Augustin, the Nauk, and the narrator.“Alena…I began to understand that he never stopped thinking of her. She was the shadow in which he was always walking. Maybe he didn’t want to be free.”...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,Feb 2014,"Feb 20, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18079673-alena

The drama is not particularly new, and the characters are essentially shallow and flat. However, this is one of those rare times that, although I didn't enjoy the mundane journey, I was stirred by the final destination. The closing pages of the book was one of the few times that nuance availed itself, and allowed me to contemplate the first complexity that this book had to offer.It is WW II, and Juliet is just finishing high school, with a love of chemistry. However, her brother Tuck, who surprised them all and joined up, is now MIA somewhere north of Rome. Subsequently, Juliet lies about her age, and joins the war effort as a nurse in a MASH unit, hoping to find word of her brother.Too conveniently, who should turn up in her field hospital but a patient, Barnaby, who knew Tuck. The novel teases out Barnaby's knowledge of Tuck gradually, in order to keep up the suspense (by rendering him catatonic at first). However, I felt minimal suspense and zero tension. Actually, a lot happens that is too convenient and calculated, such as Julia running into Tuck's best friend, her first kiss; he, too, had become a soldier. And there she was! In a cave with him! In the north of Rome! But, of course, Beau had heard nothing from Tuck. This was just so Juliet could lose her virginity to someone she knew. And some other pithy and predictable scenes could ensue.Tuck, for one thing, was a cipher. The few scenes with him and Juliet at the start of the novel were hackneyed. I could never miss him, engage with him, or care about him, except through Julia, whose character was straight out of central casting.Willard, the psychiatrist, was insubstantial. The attraction between Willard and Juliet was telegraphed throughout the narrative, but was inorganic and manipulative. The characters in this novel were flimsy; the novel, for the most part, uninspired. There was the tough but brave head nurse, the troubled Brother Reardon, and every other stereotype you find in a war novel that aims for the mass market.Scenes of graphic dismemberment and the violence of war, or depicting the shell-shocked victims, felt trivialized. Vanderbes covered ground that has been covered before, and it felt so superficial and check-boxed, and full of platitudes, that I couldn't believe that this was the same Vanderbes that wrote the sly, subtle STRANGERS AT THE FEAST. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, such as:""I enjoy your company very much--perhaps too much. Maybe I shouldn't say that; maybe I can only say it now that I'm leaving.

He returns again to the pain of exile and the quest for identity, as well as the need for a foreigner from a poor and developing country to reinvent himself. In addition, he alternates the landscape of post-colonial Uganda with the racially tense Midwest of the 1970s, and demonstrates that the feeling of exile can also exist in an American living in her own hometown. The cultural contrast of both countries, with a narrative that alternates back and forth, intensifies the sense of tenuous hope mixed with shattered illusions.“I gave up all the names my parents gave me,” says the young African man, who moves to Kampala in order to be around literary university students.

Mengestu explores the hurdles they face, as well as examining how these obstacles relate to Isaac’s past.The restrained, artless prose penetrates with its somber tone, and the emotional weight of the story and characters surge from the spaces between the words.

The story takes place primarily in the years leading up to and including WW II, although the shifting narrative perspectives also encompass contemporary time reflecting back to that period. Paris comes across as more than a setting--its atmospheric presence comes alive, as if it, too, were a character in this luminous tale.Through Prose’s glowing lens and Rashomon effect, we see the darkness of the soul, the murkiness of memory, and the shadows of human existence. The central character of the novel is Lou Villars, a French lesbian, cross-dressing athlete and racecar driver, based loosely on the life of Violette Morris, who spied on France for the Nazis. She was one of the lovers in the photo, taken when she worked at the Chameleon Club. How did this poor French orphan, in love with France, come to spy on her country? The biographer in this novel is Nathalie Dunois, who she tells us is the great-niece of Suzanne Dunois, Gabor’s wife. Nathalie tells the story (in alternating chapters with other characters) about what happened during this period. In addition, she describes the psychological/philosophical experience of being a biographer--of not just Lou Villar, but of the mystery of evil.“…having encountered, time and again, the concerted efforts to remove Lou Villars from history…, I have had to embroider a bit, fill in gaps, invent dialogue, make an occasional imaginative leap or informed guess about what my subject would have thought and felt.”Besides Nathalie, Suzanne Dunois is writing her memoir (to be destroyed on her death), chronicling back to her salad days with Gabor, including memories of when Lou worked for the Chameleon Club. Other main players are American writer Lionel Maine, Gabor’s best friend, and the Baroness Lily De Rossignol, married to a wealthy industrialist/manufacturer of elite automobiles. The baroness was the main patron of Gabor, backing him financially in his photography business. Gabor’s letters home to his parents in Hungary are braided within the narratives. The chapters on Yvonne, the Hungarian who owned the Chameleon Club, are written in third person.What unfolds is an inventive story about love, betrayal, secrets, lies, identity, vice, moral truth, historical verity, the mystery of evil--and the slaying of tin gods by an author who does it with panache, and sympathy for her characters. Each person in the novel searches for sanctuary of some kind, whether concrete or ideal. The reader picks up subtle hints of contradiction between narrators, or maybe just a parallax view.Gabor’s transcendent use of his camera captures the streets and places in Paris, from lowly squalor to high society, preserving memory or manipulating it; revealing or concealing; promoting or poisoning; metaphorically reflecting or refracting a moment in time for future pondering and present unease. Gabor can capitalize on wartime tragedy:“I am thinking, It’s fabulous for my art. Is it my fault that desperation looks so stunning through the camera lens?” The truth is full of shadows and dreams, and the story questions the tilt of history’s moral compass; by the end, it seemed more like a prism....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,Feb 2014,"Feb 01, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18498529-lovers-at-the-chameleon-club-paris-1932

It isn’t character-based, and yet, it is, if you allow for the land to be a character, and for the setting to evolve from geography/geology to the essence of the life cycle, the tincture and elixir of existence. “The landscape gathered all men, across the ages, as the anguished, hungry, confused, and even tortured blood of man surged this way and that, sloshing around in the soft human vessels as if such blood no more belonged in the brief reservoir of their bodies than would a flock of wild birds, bright birds, belong in a rusting wire cage.”It takes place in and around Castle Gap, in West Texas, near Odessa, a place whose rimrock suggests the parapets of a castle, with a mile-long narrow gap that allowed passage, thousands of years ago, over the Pecos River. Geologically, Castle Gap originated over 135 million years ago as marine limestone deposits that subsequently resulted in a great mesa split by erosion. The inland salt lake sat atop a subterranean salt dome, an eighteen-thousand-feet tall underground mountain of salt. It is from the ancient history of Castle Gap that the story develops.The land, literally and figuratively, becomes a reliquary of human and animal bones and skulls that have become buried, entrenched with the ghosts of those that came before this time, and a notice of those that will come later.Richard, a geologist working in the oil fields in 1966, is an itinerant in the time of careless youth, who falls for a beautiful woman, Clarissa. Clarissa wants nothing more than to leave Odessa, so she prevents herself from falling in love with Richard. During this section, the author demonstrates his ability to parallel human relationships with the natural ossuaries in these limestone cliffs. The author’s setting becomes anthropomorphic, or where man and land become fused. “The weight of the overlaying world was constantly squeezing down and reforming slightly this shifting, malleable, underground salt mountain, so that its movements were like those of an immense animal lying just beneath the surface, and almost always stirring, even if only slightly.”The themes are powerful, profound, and envelop the timeless quality of what constitutes perpetuity, and the weighty meaning of our return to the earth, and its effect on the eternal evolution of the life cycle. Evolution itself becomes more than a scientific or philosophical theory; it is physicalized in a way that underscores what it is to be animate. Not just to live a life, but to share that inexorable connection to everyone, and everything in nature.The narrative alternates with different people and a generation of time. After the section of Richard and Clarissa, another love story is described, this one with Marie in 1942, who married Max Omo, an industrious man who lived, and seemed to worship, the salt mines. As the reader progresses into their story, it is apparent how everything is rimed with salt—the air, the brackish water, and the house they built on this crusty whitened hardpan ground.One night, Marie wakes to the distilled purity of one sound, a rhythmic thrashing, that she finally recognizes as an elephant, and begins to follow it. As she absorbs what she sees as the magnificent loneliness of this animal, she notices one wet, bright, shining eye, “filled with both terror and resolve, as well as bottomless loneliness…” And in that moment, “amidst such a surreal vision, Marie felt more grounded, sane and hopeful than she had in years.” The elephant’s presence alters Marie’s life in sublime ways that become more penetrating as she is maddened by her life on the salt dunes.As the novel evolves, Bass’s utterly exquisite, lyrical, peerless prose binds the reader to the land, and to the fate of the characters, which also include a one-legged treasure-hunter, Herbert Mix, a broad-minded Mormon schoolteacher, Ruth, and a keen, intelligent ten-year-old named Annie. The peril of the environment, the dwindling of fresh water, the endangerment of life and innocence, and the greed of the exploiters that create it are integrated with individual human tragedies and suffering, love, regret, and redemption—all this is raised to colossal heights because of Bass’s mastery of prose.There is no real plot here, but there is story—the story of mankind and of individuals, and the story of the land that ties us together. In the end, I felt the gravitas of my connection to all of humanity.“Even from the beginning, and even in his youth, he understood he was tiny against the world, belonged merely to an unending procession of such desire…no more and no less than any other traveler who pressed against the world like one great animal swimming by itself in a vast sea…”...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,Jan 2014,"Jan 31, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15814437-all-the-land-to-hold-us

Additionally, the premise of the story, as wI selected this book because I enjoy an absorbing legal thriller, and the accolades were mostly positive. Additionally, the premise of the story, as well as the author's academic creds--Yale and Harvard--were heightened by the fact that he is a U.S. district judge in Massachusetts. The story is told mostly through the eyes of the federal judge, David Norcross, presiding over the case. Massachusetts (my original home state) doesn't have the death penalty. But what if a RICO crime, linked to a drive-by murder, allowed the case to be tried in federal court as a capital punishment case? Ponsor's debut novel sets out to probe the ongoing controversy of the death penalty.The primary problem stems from the alleged controversy. The author, instead of exploring both sides of the death penalty argument, advanced his platform against execution. Characters that regarded the death penalty as acceptable sounded flat, faulty, sinister, or doltish, and emanated from stock, one-dimensional voices. Ponsor did attempt to show inner conflict in the prosecutor, but, as it turns out, it was just another way to articulate his stand against capital punishment.Instead of a true polemical novel that challenges the reader, it hand-fed me all the (intelligent) answers from one angle. I already agree with Ponsor's views, but I don't want a PC book to reinforce what I already know. It lacked a convincing character with intelligent views that sympathized with the death penalty.And, speaking of characterizations, the people that populated the novel sounded forced and borrowed. You know when a character feels organic and authentic--he or she inhabits the traits written by the author. Instead, they were either mouthpieces of Ponsor or cut-ups from derivative material. The defendant, ""Moon"" Hudson, was a black man accused of pulling the trigger, killing a drug dealer and a white woman. Hudson was the poster prototype for the black martyr. The white victim was a volunteer at the clinic and the niece of the police captain. She had bent down to pet a dog when a bullet shot through her carotid artery. She was, of course, almost a saint.I applaud Ponsor for putting together this novel, and I can see what he was attempting to do. But, his ambition, to tell a suspenseful story and create dialogue about the death penalty, failed to animate the pages with any subtlety. There was a consummate absence of suspense. Also, the judge's bland romance added little to round out his character; again, it felt placed upon him, rather than coming FROM him.The prose was lackluster and generally pedestrian, lacking nuance and contours of character, although speckled with witty adages that did nothing to buoy the narrative, characters, or story. I did enjoy some of them, like ""trying to put pants on the wind,"" or describing a particularly attractive person as ""an orchid in a potato patch"" (I may not have the adages word for word, but you get the point). But, beyond looking forward to these witticisms, I was bored.The pace was adequate, but overall it was a stilted story with a colossal deus ex machina (or three) that would be ludicrous even in genre fiction. It was a lazy wrap-up that even included a stereotyped grieving eleven-year-old boy. Instead of thorny and wise, it was all rather banal. There was also an arbitrary bomb scare, just to show Norcross' chops for making tough decisions, which distracted from the already wobbly narrative.THE HANGING JUDGE is a telegraphed story that broadcasts its ending. If the author could move himself out of the way, he might be able to write a story that speaks TO me, rather than AT me.

ItThe American edition book cover, with the name “Wicked Girls,” shows an amusement park in the somewhat seedy seaside town of Whitmouth, in England. It provokes a promise of mystery and fear inside the pages. Well, it is a book of terrors, but not in typical chiller story fashion. The horror here had more to do with the British tabloid media culture, as well as the tension of exposing a grisly, twenty-five-year secret.The leisurely pace, which doesn’t grab you with cheap thrills, unfolds with a more incremental suspense, as the alternating narratives eventually tie the secret past of 1986 with the present day. A murder at the amusement park triggers a flurry of fear and stigma, alarming the community, which is already struggling with economic depression. Subsequently, the media storm rears its ugly head of hack journalism, showing its taste for scandal and violence, or obscuring it with “balance,” in order to temper civic concerns. It’s best to say more about the plot, because a detailed story description would point to some unwanted spoilers. Marwood’s story is more about the social and economic anatomy of its setting than it is the depravity of the crimes that bring it about. I was a little disappointed at the Deus ex machine ending, which cut corners and produced a corny resolve. However, the theme of how the corruption of the media can eclipse the crimes of individuals that they are exposing was well-considered and subtle. WICKED GIRLS is an intelligent, nuanced mosaic of the internal and external influences of people and community, and the hierarchical pressures and complexities of social justice.  “She feels…ashamed of her colleagues and their ability to use words to throw any light they choose to on a situation. Innuendo, allusion, and false connection: the staples of a media that’s still awaiting facts.

Elspeth is trudging miles from the train station to her family’s isolated home, and she is carrying gifts for her five children and pious, Bible-quoting husband. She’s been gone for four months, not unusual for her midwifery practice. As she rises up the crest of the last hill, she sees her house:“The small plateau seemed made for them, chiseled by God for their security, to hold them like a perfect secret.”Although the novel, stark and lean and elegantly written, progresses with a measured, lingering pace for most of the novel, it goes for the jugular at the outset. After a shocking tragedy that sets the premise for the rest of the story, the narrative continues languidly, but with terse prose, weaving in background information with current concerns. The momentum slows considerably, yet the writing keeps you absorbed, as the author delves into the deep-seated corners of character. Elspeth has morally wretched obsessions and impulses that underlie the events of this bleak and troubled tale. Guilt, shame, retribution, sacrifice, and the lengths we go to protect our family are mined with lyrical and somber mercy. Or is it merciless?I’d rather not go further in describing this searing, harrowing story. As Elspeth and her twelve-year-old son, Caleb, journey by foot to search and avenge, the reader is immersed in the sense that the hunters are also the hunted. Scott’s descriptions are masterful, his extended metaphors gnawing and scorching.

Holly Judge senses something dreadful in her midst, and at the start of the novel, she says, several times (in italics), ""Something had followed them home from Russia."" Holly is a blocked poet wanna-be, insisting that if she could just pick up a pen, she could write down these strange thoughts that are curling around her head.The beginning of a novel often sets the pace and potential, and I was slightly turned off by this one line repetition. Instead of haunting or poetic, it began to irritate me; it came across as clunky. Holly was very anguished, but it was taxing to start off so soon with hysterics. It opened with her woe that the family overslept on this holiday, which distresses Holly beyond what seemed organic. Alone in the house with her daughter on Christmas day, Holly narrates the entire novel. The guests invited to her house for the holiday are homebound, stuck because of a blizzard occurring in their Michigan city. Eric, her husband, braves the blizzard to pick up his parents at the airport, and becomes delayed returning home because his parents are ill.Holly and Eric's teenaged daughter, Tatiana, came from a Russian orphanage. When Holly and her husband went to Siberia to adopt her, they saw that the poverty-stricken conditions of the orphanage affected the care that these babies and children received. Holly was always very protective and loving to Tatiana, but it is evident that Holly and Tatiana aren't very close right now. Tatiana appears to be going through a rebellious phase, and is rude and smug to her mother. As Holly waits for her husband to return, she recounts to the reader her medical history (why she can't get pregnant), her experience at the orphanage, and her years as a mother, as well as her aborted ambition as a poet. You sense something is eerie when strange things happen on Holly's iPhone.As things heat up, the reader is taken into a dark place, one that Holly is swept into as the narrative progresses. The problem I had was that, although the writing is capable, it is also inconsistent. There's too much repetition, perhaps on purpose, but it had the opposite effect of building tension. Holly's voice is overwrought and fatalistic throughout the novel, way before the denouement, so that when it occurs, I was too prepared for it. I kind of figured it out, at least 80% of it, but I wasn't significantly compelled, either, by any surprises.I think this would have worked better as a short story. I stayed engaged enough to finish it, and at times, I was absorbed in Kasischke's descriptions of Holly's experiences in Russia. But the iterations came off as filler.

Her boyfriend, Eric, a science journalist, keeps her at bay due to his own traumas and buried past.Alternating the story of Charlotte and Eric is another narrative that starts with two adolescents, Bo and Rainey, and the deep bond that grows between them over their spotty years in each other’s company. Bo is a lanky, well-to-do city boy, whereas Rainey is a tomboy from out in the sticks, and an aspiring painter. Even at this young, tender age, they learn some hard lessons about the prickliness of life’s vicissitudes. Events and obstacles occur that thwart their desires and put them on a star-crossed path.The title of the book is increasingly symbolic and revealing as the story progresses. In mythology, Gemini refers to the twin brothers Castor and Pollux. Pollux asked Zeus to let him share his own immortality with Castor when Castor was killed, to keep them together. They were transformed into the constellation Gemini. How this relates to the book is eventually transformative to the characters and the readers as well. Also, it informs a remark that Charlotte’s colleague turns to about doctors playing God. (And note that the author, also a doctor, has two sets of twins, one set fraternal and the other identical.)“And we are all Gods within our realms…Especially doctors…Anyway, it worked in the myth. Except, of course, the twins could then live only in the stars.” Pondering this quote, I was also contemplating the spiritual and philosophical questions that this novel provokes when a doctor is faced with a comatose patient with brain damage and failing systems. How far should one go to save a life? Charlotte says, “My job is to keep people alive as long as possible. Whatever they find on the other side will still be there waiting.” Since we are not able to split ourselves to save a life, we depend on external sources (medicine) and the natural homeostatic mechanisms of the human body in order to heal. Life and death, when hanging in a precarious balance, carries the burden of legal and moral judgment. There are no “right” answers, but there must eventually be a resolve.Cassella is a warm, sensitive writer, and her narrative is rich with sensuous, lyrical prose. She lives near the area where the story takes place, and captures the region with an elegiac beauty that wraps the reader in an immanent sense of place. I half expected this to be a genre medical thriller, but it is more of a reflective family drama about love, family, friendship, and loss. The author has nurtured her characters so that they inhabit the reader’s heart, and the outcome holds some unexpected surprises. It’s a fine story and morality tale of human triumph and redemption amidst hardship and adversity. It examines the dualities of the human condition and reaches into the corners of our hearts. If you like to empathize while you read, I recommend this contemporary tale with timeless themes....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,Jan 2014,"Jan 14, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17742914-gemini

It's like driving down a remote, one-lane dark road surrounding a black reservoir, the starless sky doomy and vast. You are headed toward a forgotten city. Now and then a beacon in the distance blinks like a metronomic eye. Brewster is a static town in upstate New York, where it always feels like winter, ""weeks-old crusts of ice covering the sidewalks and the yards, a gray, windy sky, smoke torn sideways from the brick chimneys.""It was the end of the sixties, and studious, unpopular Jon Mosher, the narrator, connects with rogue, slanty, Ray Cappicciano, and Frank ""Jesus"" Krapinski. They were 16 and wanted to get out of Brewster, dreamed of a better life. Jon, whose Jewish parents fled Germany to America, and opened a shoe store in Brewster, survived in a gloomy atmosphere, because his parents never recovered from Jon's brother's premature and tragic death years ago, for which Jon feels responsible.Ray's father is a racist, truculent ex-cop who drinks all day. Ray was the more mysterious, taciturn, and enigmatic of the three friends. His mother left before he could remember her, and his stepmother left when his baby brother, Gene (barely a toddler now) was born. Ray is devoted to Gene. Frank teaches Sunday school and believes in Jesus as the savior. All carried their parents' burdens, and all vowed to leave Brewster for greener pastures after graduation.Jon finds a sense of purpose on the track team, and Frank begins to question his faith when his family demonstrates hypocrisy, shunning his sister when she becomes pregnant. Ray hooks up with smart, beautiful Karen Dorsey, and they become a fearsome foursome. Oftentimes, Ray would disappear for days and come back banged up and bruised, from fights he said he competed in in Danbury. As more disappearances occurred, the tale hints at more ominous consequences.This is a coming of age story, sans sentimentality. It is a tale of loss and the long shadows cast from tragedy and adversity. The tone of the novel is both reflective and melancholy, and the sense of suffocation and imprisonment, and thwarted hopes, swirls like the icy wind of Brewster's winters. There's a feeling of paralysis, and yet, woven within Jon's voice is the promise of a thaw, of a hibernating redemption within an unquiet stillness. This hope buoys the narrative from a relentless pessimism, and also mitigates the pressure cooker of looming menace. I couldn't be sure how it would evolve, the youthful dreams suspended and the freighted sorrow of their lives more dire as the novel progresses.""There was no going back, though thinking about it, I'm not sure there was much to go back to anyway. Truth is, there's nothing more stupid than fighting something there isn't--a lack of love, a lack of respect. It's like fighting an empty room...You punch the air, you yell, you weep, but there's nobody there--just this feeling that there's something holding you back, that there's a place outside that room that could answer everything, that could tell you, finally, who you are. And you're not allowed to go there.""Slouka's prose is assured, meditative, and beautiful. I was a fan after I read THE VISIBLE WORLD, which shared some themes of displacement, the legacy of war, and urgent love. This novel is a sterling tour de force, which left me both shattered and hopeful.

Jonah Jacobstein has two beautiful girlfriends devoted to him, and a law firm ready to hand him a meteoric rise to success by doing their dirty work. Jacob is ready to choose one woman and leap into eminent success, when a Hasidic Jew on a subway asks him deep religious and provocative questions about his chosen life. The best Jonah can answer is ""I feel guilty on Yom Kippur.""Jonah dismisses the man from his consciousness, until he begins to have frightening and disturbing biblical vision at a party. Psychically, it is a vision he can't escape. The story follows Jacob as he responds to this ""divine intervention"" in his own stumbling ways, until the epic climax that mirrors the force of his faith.I was fastened to the first part of the novel, as Jonah is torn between the two girlfriends and driven by success. The characterization seemed organic and I related to his conflicts. However, as the book moved ever toward its pantheon of biblical twists, and the allegories intensified, it became touched with melodrama and heavy-handed narrative. Jonah became a bit lost to me, and I sensed self-consciousness as the author morphed his very human character into a contemporary Old Testament archetype. Jonah's connection with Judith, which was supposed to compel us, felt inorganic and flat. The middle of the book was filled with long-winded philosophizing, although, admittedly, I enjoyed some of the gems of thought out of context, but not so much as part of the whole.I suspect that Feldman was appealing to both the faithful and the faithless, attempting to blur the lines of secular and religious; however, perhaps I am too much a secular student of life to appreciate the message of the book. The author writes well, but not consistently. This is his debut effort, and I was interested enough to look forward to his next book, if it isn't another biblical allegory. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Nov 2013,"Dec 30, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17910118-the-book-of-jonah

That piqued my interest in reading this prequel, which clues the reader into how and why David Loogan (Malone) became interested in investigating crime, particularly murder. It begins in David’s hometown, Rome, New York, where David is a home inspector, and engaged to a surgeon. When she admits to sleeping with a colleague, David disengages and ends up having an affair with a beautiful law student, Jana Fletcher, a first-year law student. After a ten-day intense involvement, he discovers her dead in her apartment. The rest of the story focuses on David investigating the crime, against the wishes of the lead detective, Morelli, who possesses a menacing streak. Morelli becomes Malone’s nemesis, with secrets of his own to hide.As David probes deeper into Jana’s life, he discovers she was working on the Innocent Project, run by a veteran lawyer and aimed at helping select convicts prove that they were wrongfully convicted. Jana’s pet project, assisting a man who was convicted of killing his wife, piques David’s interest, and leads to more potential clues in her death.Dolan provides a sleek, lean narrative that moves at a crisp pace.

At times, I felt that Dolan slipped too far into genre and appointed his suspects and persons of interest with facile strokes. Some of the motivations of characters and turns of plot felt less than authentic, but Dolan constructed his connections neatly as the bodies pile up.

Her latest is back to form: excellent, character-driven, and providing substantial scenes that build tension without excessive police work or cat-and-mouse scenes. This novel is more of a study of people and families. The police work reminds us that there is a cold case to be solved, but it doesn’t take over the story. There’s as much “why” (maybe more) as “who.”Widow and retired detective Roberto Sanchez, “Sandy,” is lonely and fills up his hours doing consulting work on cold cases at the Baltimore PD. The case he is trying to solve involves a racketeer, Felix Brewer, who jumped bail before his trial in 1976, left town, never to be found again. He left a wife, Bambi, and three young daughters (one who was too young to remember him). He also had a girlfriend, Julie, who went missing in 2001, and found dead in the woods in 2012. Who killed her? Nobody knows, and Sandy is determined to find out. He believes it is connected to Felix’s disappearance.What unfurls during the course of this novel is a close character study of Bambi and her children, her lawyer, Bert (husband of her best friend), and the bail bondsman who is now in an assistant care facility. Sandy also pieces together the last years of Julie’s life, while simultaneously investigating Bambi and her family. Lippman has a knack for mining the complex domestic troubles, such as Bambi’s children trying to cope while growing up without a father. And…there’s some missing money. Where is it? And what connects the past to the present and future? How does memory clarify or complicate the unraveling of Julie’s murder? Over 35 years has passed, and the contours of a story behind the crime can distort or diminish the facts and the truth.“Did you know the more we tell a story, the more degraded it becomes? Factually, I mean. It’s like taking a beloved or fragile item out of a box and turning it over in your hands. You damage it every time.”As pieces of the crime, backstory, and even the city of Baltimore materialized, I became invested in the outcome. This is a slow, simmering, casually paced novel. Tension builds subtly; characters organically evolve. The structure of the book is a superb framing device, positioning the beginning and end as bookends.

Spanning 50 yAmy Tan’s derivative new novel covers the familiar themes she has recycled from her previous novels about mother-daughter relationships. Spanning 50 years in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the saga takes place largely in the courtesan houses of Shanghai, when vast changes were occurring during the early establishment of the Republic of China. Told in the first person by a daughter from each generation, (but mostly from one named Violet), the reader is taken on an epic journey of love, illusion, betrayal, abandonment, and redemption. Tan doesn’t break any new ground here. Arthur Golden’s 1997 MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, about Japan’s geisha houses, was written more lyrically and subtly, and used a very similar framing device. Tan didn’t create any original characters, nor did she introduce a fresh premise. However, her pacing is astute and her flourishes are vivid.Tan’s beach read would more accurately be listed under historical romance, and its inelegant prose and broad characters failed to hit any visceral and emotional registers with me. Violet, precocious half Chinese/half American daughter of Lulu, a beautiful American woman who runs a prestigious courtesan house in Shanghai, is separated from her mother by trickery. As Lulu sails sadly away to America, Violet is forced to begin her life as a courtesan at the age of fourteen, but in a second-class establishment. Her only ally is her attendant, Magic Gourd, who serves as a mother figure and protector.Violet learns all the details of the life of a courtesan, such as storytelling, zither mastering, sartorial nuance, conversational alacrity, and, most importantly, the art of seduction. These women are referred to as “flowers,” and at fifteen are bought by the highest bidder in a “defloration” ceremony to lose their virginity. By their late 20’s their bloom is fading, and they are too old to compete against their younger counterparts.The courtesans are warned against the illusion of love and the fantasy of marriage; at the most, they can hope to run their own courtesan house someday. Of course, the passionate Violet periodically succumbs to her desires, and suffers disappointment at every twist and turn, as well as episodes of bliss. It is terribly contrived but also colorful, and despite predictability, I found myself turning the pages to see what would happen next. Tan creates so many obstacles for her characters that I actually got involved in the storyteller’s weave. Unfortunately, she left no room for authenticity, and the great passions felt expository, while the erotic scenes were awkward and lackluster. It sounded a lot like “And then she…” “And then she…” “And then she.” Scenes that were supposed to be horrifying fell flat in the telling, subverting Tan’s intentions to grip the reader. The title of the book refers to a painting that appears throughout the narrative, symbolizing clarity and illusion, beauty and eternity.“It captures many moments, many emotions…hope, love, and purity. I see in it immortality, neither beginning nor end. It seems to be saying all moments are immortal and will never disappear, nor will peace in the valley, or the strength of mountains, or the openness of the sky…”This motif of the painting is rendered with lovely abstraction and brush strokes, yet, ironically, the plot of the story is more like paint-by-number. Tan's novel is like a composition on a canvas, but you are disappointed by the lack of contour and occasion for personal translation. Everything is right up front, with no mystery. Like the art that graces most office buildings, it is familiar and undemanding. Occasionally, it darts out with colorful swirls....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,Nov 2013,"Nov 06, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17383934-the-valley-of-amazement

WhenAt a small, prestigious New England liberal arts college, a brilliant young undergraduate student, Maud Stack, is killed by a hit-and-run driver. When it happened, she had been standing outside with her college professor ex-lover in an angry confrontation. There were many witnesses, and opposing points of view about how she died, why she died, and who killed her. Additionally, there are characters either central or peripheral to Maud's life that provoke the reader into asking questions about truth and illusion; religious rearing; the connections and responsibilities of our patrons and protectors; and the security of our civic structure.Maud, who has an increasing problem with alcohol, had just posted an article in the college Gazette, railing on the anti-abortion fetishists who have placed grizzly pictures of dead fetuses on protest posters to shove in the faces of women on their way to abortion clinics. Maud, angry with the vigilantes, decides to turn it around, by publishing pictures of fetuses with birth defects, with the argument that two can play this game of propaganda.Did Maud's death come as a result of this article? If not directly, then indirectly? Or was it related to the affair with the married professor? Or did she bring it on herself, with her increasingly outrageous and self-destructive behaviors? The truth is hidden in plain sight.There are several other characters that have relationships with Maud. There's her actress roommate, Shelby, who has a schizophrenic, stalking ex-husband who is obsessed with a punitive Christian dogma. Maud's one-time counselor, Jo Carr, is a compassionate ex-nun, who also works at the hospital and believes in a woman's right to choose. Jo is certain that she has seen a menacing preacher from her younger years in South America, one who may have come to pursue and shadow Maud. Then there is Maud's father, a former detective with the NYPD, slowly deteriorating from emphysema, due to exposure to Ground Zero. He also harbors secrets that trouble him, and he worries that he may have Maud's blood on his hands.There are also characters that represent the class division of the city. This appears to be a crumbling Massachusetts mill town. Apart from the scholars and students at the college, it is a depressed place. Most of the inhabitants are meagerly educated malingerers and blue-collar workers, some who hold the esteemed college in contempt. There is also a strong presence of mental health patients who stroll in clusters of support for each other, very near the college grounds. For the most part, there is a hospitable understanding or informal agreement between the haves and the have-nots. Or is there?The plot is less important than the themes, but it is the plot, or the unanswered questions, that keeps the reader reading. Stone writes sparingly, similar in some ways to DeLillo, examining academia and exploring themes of intellectualism, piousness, and the fractures of the family. Most of the characters live in internal disenfranchisement, in a desperate isolation from each other. Stone explores the woefully and ruefully marginalized, and his prose enhances that feeling--the hollow and bleak existence of those that fail to connect, and a mournful dependence of doctrine that breeds exile, and chains them to their transgressions. And he tinges it with dark humor and irony.""People's religion -- it's not like opium. It don't work that way. It's their mother, you understand. They may not understand their mother at all. They may hate their mother. Maybe they're ashamed of their mother. Sometimes a mother makes someone hate other people. Any thing can drive such people to anything.""Stone's new novel is not straightforward mystery or police procedural. He is a former National Book Award winner, known for his stylized narration. The detached tone required some adjustment on my part, and I never felt an emotional attachment while reading. What lingers is the impressionistic images of a complex moral universe that Stone creates through his prose, and that evolve into a composition of exile, dependence, and internment....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Oct 27, 2013","Oct 28, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17165876-death-of-the-black-haired-girl

I was afraid that her mass popularity would lead to a dumbed down book with pandering social/political agendas or telegraphed notions. I am thrilled to conclude that this was not the case. Gilbert is a superb writer who allows her main characters to spring forth as organically as the natural world that they live in. This is a book of well-considered people of the times, who are emblematic of daring and discerning ideas, as well as an absorbing story that will keep the pages flying. The 18th and 19th century comes to life, and botany keeps the composite parts anchored to the earth. It is a both beautiful and intermittently appalling story of humanity and nature.The book begins with British ex-pat Henry Whittaker, a boy of humble origins, who, by the time he is an adult in the 19th century, turns himself into a captain of industry in the botanical and pharmaceutical industry, particularly quinine. As a boy, he pilfered from the Royal Botanical Kew Gardens and sold to others, and showed his mettle as an entrepreneur. The director, Sir Joseph Banks, eventually apprehended him. Whittaker’s penance was to be sent on faraway travels, in order to prove himself worthy and edify himself in the realm of plants.When Whittaker returned, he made it his life’s work to eclipse Banks and become a wealthy self-made industrialist of the natural world. He got himself an educated Dutch wife, left Europe for good, and settled in Western Pennsylvania, where he built an elaborate estate that truly did rival the Kew Gardens, called White Acre. All alike envied his ostentatious mansion on the hill, and were impressed by his breathtaking, unparalleled gardens. He sired one daughter, Alma, and adopted another, Prudence. Whittaker became one of the richest men in North America, or anywhere. But, more important than riches, to him, was the power to command others, and the talent and skill to master your work. Education was the tool to that end. Therefore, his children received a scholarly education at home.Henry's prominence on the pages segues into his daughter's, Alma. The beautiful Prudence becomes an outspoken abolitionist, while Alma grows into a scholarly, tall, large-boned, homely, and privately carnal woman who becomes the flourishing main character. I would list her as one of my favorite protagonists of contemporary times, as unforgettable as Teresita Urrea of THE HUMMINGBIRD'S DAUGHTER, although of polar sensibilities. Alma is so fleshed out that I can smell her, and every moment in her life is organically rendered. As she becomes her father's daughter as a scientist, (but with a gentler disposition), the reader is taken ever further into her inner and outer journeys. She is not just a botanist and taxonomist, but in many ways, a philosopher, a noble thinker, with a sexual and sensual hunger.Gilbert doesn’t portray Alma as flawless or unbelievable. Rather, Alma is a construct of her environment and her gifted mind. She is also metaphorically imprisoned by the life of a proper woman in the 19th century. However…Alma’s portrait is the fruit of this elegantly written, lyrically cadenced, engrossing tale. Gilbert braids in the enigma of life from botany to the human body, and folds in science, mysticism, spirituality, psycho-sexuality, all in a vibrantly flowing historical novel. Some of the characters make a brief or lucid appearance, and then fade, but Alma grows more luminous with each passing chapter. A few sections focus on scientific philosophies and the question of creationism and evolution (the way a discussion would happen in the 1800’s), but it fits radiantly into this story. But, mostly, it is Alma who pollinates this ripe and exhilarating tale. I still see her bending over a leaf, or examining moss with a microscope, or hunched over her scholarly tomes and writing her books on the mysteries of plant life. Being at her father’s beck and call, but carving out a solitary but teeming life. The title of the book refers that all life contains a divine code or print, and was put forth by a 16th century German cobbler and early botanist, Jacob Boehme, one rejected by the Whittakers, for the most part, as medieval nonsense. He had mystical visions about plants, and believed there was a divine code in “every flower, leaf, fruit, and tree on earth. All the natural world was a divine code.”You can see it in a curling leaf, a nesting bird, and when the stamens of one plant stick it to its receptacle.

As an explorer and thinker, she is compelled to understand this notion.Alma’s professional and personal life leads her to contemplate the “struggle for existence.” As the reader follows Alma on her odyssey of the natural world and beyond, the wonder of life becomes ever transcendent--that “those who survived the world shaped it—even as the world, simultaneously, shaped them.” This exquisite novel feels like a gift to humanity.

A thirteenth, Walter Moody, an educated man from Edinburgh who has come here to find his fortune in gold, walks in. As it unfolds, the interlocking stories and shifting narrative perspectives of the twelve--now thirteen--men bring forth a mystery that all are trying to solve, including Walter Moody, who has just gotten off the Godspeed ship with secrets of his own that intertwine with the other men's concerns.I felt a warmth and a shiver at each passing chapter, set during the last days of the New Zealand gold rush. Catton hooked me in in this Victorian tale of a piratical captain; a Maori gemstone hunter; Chinese diggers (or ""hatters""); the search for ""colour"" (gold); a cache of hidden gold; séances; opium; fraud; ruthless betrayal; infidelity; a politician; a prostitute; a Jewish newspaperman; a gaoler; shipping news; shady finance; a ghostly presence; a missing man; a dead man; and a spirited romance. And there's more between Dunedin and Hokitika to titillate the adventurous reader.Primarily, THE LUMINARIES is an action-adventure, sprawling detective story, superbly plotted, where the Crown Hotel men try to solve it, while sharing secrets and shame of their own. There's even a keen courtroom segment later in the story. And, there are crucial characters that are not gathered in the Crown that night who link everyone together. The prostitute and opium addict, Anna Wetherell, is nigh the center of this story, as she is coveted or loved or desired by all the townspeople.The layout of the book is stellar: the spheres of the skies and its astrological charts. You don't need to understand the principles and mathematics of astrology (I don't), but it is evident that knowledge of this pseudoscience would add texture to the reading experience, as it provides the structure and frame of the book. The characters' traits can be found in their individual sun signs (such as the duality of a Germini). The drawings of charts add to the mood, and the chapters get successively shorter after the long Crown chapter. The cover of the book illustrates the phases of the moon, from full moon to sliver, alluding to the waning narrative lengths as the story progresses.""But onward also rolls the outer sphere--the boundless present, which contains the bounded past.""Take note of the cast list at the beginning, which is quite helpful for the initial 200 or 300 pages. With so many vivid characters coming at you at once, it is difficult at first to absorb. However, as the pages sail (and they will, if this appeals to you), you won't even need the names and professions. The story and its striking, almost theatrical players become gradually and permanently installed, thoroughly and unforgettably. From the scar on Captain Francis Carver's cheek, to the widow's garment on Anna Wetherell's gaunt frame, the lively images and descriptions animate this boisterous, vibrant story.Catton is a master storyteller; she combines this exacting 19th century style and narrator--and the ""we"" that embraces the reader inside the tale--with the faintest sly wink of contemporary perspective. Instead of the authorial voice sounding campy, stilted, and antiquated, there is a fresh whiff of nuanced canniness, a knowing Catton who uncorks the delectable Victorian past by looking at it from the postmodern future.You will either be intoxicated by this big brawl of a book, or weighed down in its heft. If you are looking for something more than it is, then look no further than the art of reading. There's no mystery to the men; Catton lays out their morals, scruples, weaknesses, and strengths at the outset. The women had a little poetic mystery to them, but in all, these were familiar players--she drew up stock 19th century characters, but livened them up, so that they leaped madly from the pages. There isn't much to interrogate except your own anticipation. If you've read COLOUR, by Rose Tremain, don't expect any similarities except the time, place, setting, and the sweat and grime of the diggers. Otherwise, the two books are alike as fish and feathers.The stars shine bright as torches, or are veiled behind a mist, like the townspeople and story that behave under the various constellations. Catton's impeccably plotted yarn invites us to dwell in this time and place. At times, I felt I mined the grand nuggets of the story, and at other times, it blew away like dust.""But there is no truth except truth in relation, and heavenly relation is composed of wheels in motion, tilting axes, turning dials; it is a clockwork orchestration that alters every minute, never repeating never still...We now look outward...we see the world as we wish to perfect it, and we imagine dwelling there.""...more",Notes are private!,0,224,1,"Oct 05, 2013",not set,"Sep 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333230-the-luminaries

Milne, this is not the book. Although some facts of Christopher Robin's real life are woven in here (and some turned upside down), it is not frequently germane to this surreal labyrinth, a unique story of identity, dreams, and time. It isn't just ""Who am I?"" but, more, ""Who am I"", relative to a personal and social world in flux, and a life trying to forge an identity outside of a character in your father's books. This tender, compassionate, genre-bending novel is more imagination than a re-imagining. History, childhood, philosophy, revolution, memories, dreams, identity --and the memories and history that fold up in time--that is what this story is about.In Part 1, we are introduced to Christopher Robin, his wife, Abby, and his autistic son, Daniel (in truth, Christopher had a daughter with cerebral palsy). The title Billy Moon comes from Christopher's childhood nickname. As an adult, he owns a minor bookstore in Dartmouth, England, but he is loathe to sell Winnie-the Pooh-books. As a child, he was mercilessly teased about being Christopher Robin. He desperately seeks liberation from the fake Christopher Robin that his father created. In 1959, he is 38, and at a crossroads of purpose. He takes long walks and straddles the line between reality and fantasy, where, for example, a stuffed cat becomes animate. In 1961, a poster mysteriously appears in his store, with Pooh as a symbol of protest against the French authorities, of a Paris uprising six years into the future, 1968. Between the poster and a letter from a Parisian college student named Gerrard Hand, Christopher is compelled to take his family on a trip to Paris. He enters an unreal world of time and space, where the ground beneath his feet has turned to a pool of mud. (What a perfect metaphor for the historic Paris or ""Lutetia--""city of mud"" of ancient civilization.)When Gerrard was ten-years-old, his father told him, I'm working on reality, but the world won't meet me halfway."" Gerrard, who has a brilliant imagination, discovered that ""in dreams, the past is hidden inside the present.""All this wordplay from Portland Author Douglas Lain helped me dissolve the concrete world of dimensions. As Abby says, ""Sometimes in order to be realistic you have to accept the impossible."" And that is what happens inside this novel. While keeping us fastened to Christopher Robin, Gerrard, and Gerrard's girlfriend, Natalie, as well as other peripheral characters, the reader is taken on a journey of juxtapositions and metaphors that lead us to a place where poetry is perilous and the imaginary is real.In Part 2, Gerrard and Natalie lead Christopher to the Situationist movement in Paris, a (failed) revolution against advanced capitalism, made up of artists and intellectuals (such as Guy Debord, who is a also a peripheral character in the novel) who believed that social alienation and commodity fetishism had degraded everyday lives. Instead of responding to directly felt experience, individual expression was now encumbered by a desire for objects, or objects that replace legitimate action and interaction with each other. The revolutionaries wanted to create moments of authentic experience, to construct situations that reawakened our genuine desires. Lain was also alluding to today's Occupy movement.I could point out all the political, social, and philosophical aspects of the text, but the aspect of the narrative that really stands out is the coming-of-age of these characters. Natalie tries to live ""authentically"" by acting out the life of Cécile in Françoise Sagan's Bonjour Trisstesse and following the tenets of Debord, who believed that a real revolution had to be total. Gerrard's fate becomes linked to Christopher Robin's, and both have issues with their parents to muddle through. But, events occur that are often impenetrable in the real world. But--and this is what struck me about Lain--it stops mattering! He pulls us into his magical realism by always anchoring his characters emotionally, so that the reader is connected to each of their secret histories. And a bear. Yes, there's a bear, and a Paris zoo.""History has chosen us. Not the grand history of kings, and of wars, or of dates in textbooks, but rather our own secret histories. The history of our childhood, and our grandparents' childhoods, that's what has chosen us. History has chosen us, chosen us to take part in the creation of memories out of the present.""Part 3 is the most opaque, on the surface. I wonder if Christopher Robin's degree in mathematics, and his father's, may have something to do with Lain's chapters of ""probability."" So, open the book, let go, follow Lain labyrinth's, and be enchanted by the power of dreams and memories, in and out of time, and some that exist in our imagination. Just imagine. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Sep 2013,"Sep 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16059311-billy-moon

She fell in love with this island country south of the Arctic Circle, and returned several times to do extensive research on Agnes Magnúsdóttir, the last woman to be beheaded in Iceland, in 1829. Kent imagined the interior psychological states of various characters, especially the enigmatically alluring Agnes, and successfully penned a suspenseful faction tale that transcends the outcome. It reveals a complex love triangle and double murder, and a provocative examination of the religious and social mores of the time. Knowing the fate of Agnes prior to reading the novel won't change the reader's absorption of the novel. The strong themes hinge on the backstory and viewpoints that are woven in and reveal characters that go through a change of perception as the circumstances of the crime come to light.Each chapter begins with official or private correspondence or testimony, which reflects the judicial process and established standards of the time, which was then under Danish rule. The title refers to whether the dead are fit to be buried on consecrated ground. Agnes is sent to northwest Iceland, to stay with the district officer, his wife, and two daughters, pending her execution. The family members are outraged at first, some more than others. The farmers in the area are also hostile to her. Over time, as her story unfolded, I became emotionally engaged with Agnes, and touched by the young cleric, Toti, Agnes' appointed spiritual advisor.Kent is a poetic writer, whose descriptions of a grim, harsh, bleak landscape and a socially rigid terrain are told with a striking beauty.""Now we are riding across Iceland's north, across this black island washing in its waters, sulking in its ocean. Chasing our shadows across the mountain.""""They have strapped me to the saddle like a corpse being taken to the burial ground."" ""...waiting for the ground to unfreeze before they can pocket me in the earth like a stone.""The restrained savagery and cruel irony reflects in those that persecute Agnes and accept the official story of her acts as gospel. The gradual overtures of Toti and certain members of the family were organically developed, allowing for tension and intimacy in equal measure. The slight stumbling block for me was accepting Agnes' relationship with her lover, Natan, one of the men she is convicted of killing. I understand that very smart women can often make poor choices in men; however, Agnes was depicted as a self-contained woman. I had a difficult time accepting her bottomless apology for Nathan's consummate cruelty and selfish barbarity.Despite my tenuous acceptance of Agnes' love for Natan, I did register the isolated, punishing terrain of 19th century Iceland, especially in the winter months, when loneliness was crushing, and reaching out for companionship a pressing need. The landscape came alive as a character, and Kent folded in an Icelandic Burial Hymn and bits and pieces of the Nordic sagas and myths, such as ""I was worst to the one I loved best."" Poet-Rosa, who also loved Natan as passionately as Agnes, writes a bitter poem to her. (Interestingly, I have just read the first 80 pages of the 1934 Laxness novel of Icelandic sheep farmers, INDEPENDENRT PEOPLE, in which a character named poet-Rosa is described.)This is an impressive debut novel, easily read in a few sittings. The pov shifts back and forth from third to first skillfully. By the end of the novel, I was able to answer the question of whether a condemned life can have meaning, and whether the person who is condemned can change the perceptions of others --for the better. I will be looking out for Kent's next novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,Sep 2013,"Sep 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333319-burial-rites

Sara’s son, Jason, who is a literature/poetry lover with eight well-connected godfathers, seemed to be Harvard bound. But after 9/11 happened during his senior year of high school, he decided he wanted to become a Navy SEAL. His father, who he last saw when he was 8 years-old, and who was reported dead years ago, was a CIA-type journalist who was 30 years older than Sara (they never married). David remained a mostly absent father. Sara, while holding tight to Jason emotionally, knows she has to let him go. And Jason, who loves his mother, wants to grow up and begin his independence.Ten years after Jason begins his service to his country, he is a well-respected, distinguished navy SEAL, a soldier, a scholar, a son. He is known as the “priest,” because of his ways of pacing the hallway and night, and because he is so quiet and “that he must have a direct line to God from the pool.” He can stay under water for a superhuman amount of time, so that his colleagues and officers joke that he has a third lung. He keeps his mother in the loop in a need-to-know kind of basis, writes her letters, calls her when he can, tells her minimally about his deployment missions. He has learned the art of being on the Team: restraint.“Restraint might not be the first thing next to Godliness, but it’s close. Restraint is part of the ethos.”Sara is as fiercely independent as Jason, and except for a few tentative involvements (one with the most visible and active godfather), has remained single, and her love and energy is all for her son. She is content editing papers at home, running through the woods and countryside for exercise, and tending her garden. As the story begins, it is 2011 and Jason has been missing 11 days on his latest mission/deployment. It is all Sara can do to keep herself together while she waits. One of Jason’s close friends and former mate on the “Team” (as the SEALS are referred), who lost an eye on a mission with Jason and is now a civilian, comes to stay with Sara, which gives her great comfort.The book explores Sara’s relationship to Jason and his to her, her relationship to David, and how Sara and Jason perceive his role in the war, on the Team, and their shared love of literature a strong bond that reaches out between the two, even when the secrets he must keep distance them. “If it be now, ‘tis not to come;If it be not to come, it will be now.If it be not now, yet it will come:The readiness is all.""ELEVEN DAYS had a transformative effect on me; it allowed me to understand Jason’s chosen life, and what it meant to choose “Sparta” over “Athens.” This book is tender, fierce, and, like Jason and Sara, restrained in its beauty....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Aug 31, 2013","Sep 04, 2013",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/17182207-eleven-days

This story takes place in the present, in an unnamed city in the American Heartland, which I imagine as the author's hometown of Omaha, one of the twenty-five cities that the riots took place.The story of land ownership and dispossession reaches across generations and families. A contemporary family, the Noailles,' buys a foreclosed house on farmland that had been recently carved up by owner and builder Paul Krovik. Krovik's houses were poorly built in an upper-middle-class subdivision somewhere in the heartland, where the weather is extreme and biblical in its extremity. After he went belly up, his wife left with his young son and moved to Florida. He is determined to turn his bad luck around, so he burrows in a hidden basement of the house.The family who buys Krovik's house hails from Boston. Nathanial Noailles, who works as an executive in the menacingly NSA-like security company called EKK, his wife, Julia, a scientist, and their 9 year-old quirky, eccentric, and highly sensitive and intelligent son, Copley, move here to start a new life.Retired schoolteacher, Louise Washington, owned the land that Krovik bought and violated. Her ancestor was a black sharecropper that was lynched during the race riots. She was forced to sell her farmland to Krovik, and now the government has condemned her house in order to make a turn lane. Louise has found a way to secretly remain in her condemned house, at least while it is still standing. The Poplar Farm history or back story is fascinating, and the sinkhole where Louise's forebear still hangs in a tree becomes a motif in Flanery's story.In the opening pages, we learn of the history of the farmland. It then segues to a chapter of Louise reluctantly visiting Krovik in prison. How this all came about is the story at hand, and oh what a story it is. If Stephen King had Kafka and John Cheever's DNA, he might have written this story, or something like it. Flanery is brilliant at capturing a vanishing suburbia and the paranoia of growing surveillance. It's both creepy and literary, climbing to an ineluctable horror story of human nature. The author is also nuanced with the themes of redemption, and creates characters that not only inhabit the Poplar farm, but also burrow right inside your marrow. Read it and weep; just try to sleep!""We have to assume that everything we do is always under scrutiny."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Aug 20, 2013",not set,"Aug 28, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17707696-fallen-land

During this time, Lisbon is filled with spies and royalty and people in exile. Leavitt's story primarily concerns two ex-pat couples waiting for the S. S. Manhattan to come. The novel is narrated by one of the main characters, Pete Winters.Pete and Julia Winters are Americans who have lived in Paris for over 15 years; Julia insisted on following her Parisian dream and never returning to America. She spent her idle days trying to write, but never got past reams of the first chapter. Pete is a fairly successful car salesman, who feels it is his duty to make Julia happy. Edward and Iris Frelang are wealthy itinerants and writers of a French detective series, written under a pseudonym.The two couples meet at a café one evening, when Edward mistakenly steps on Pete's eyeglasses. One couple is staying at Hotel Francfort and the other at the Francfort Hotel--hence, the title. Although the novel focuses tightly on these two couples, it is also peopled with anxious characters either waiting for passage overseas or denied visas. This adds color and atmosphere of a world in flux and unmoored. Julia is a Jew, who understandably doesn't want to let it be known. However, her insecurities run much deeper than is at first evident, and beyond her Jewishness.The restlessness of the Winters and Frelangs start to show early on, like a sleeping beast awakened, as the long claws of latent behaviors crack the surface and Edward and Pete begin an affair. Their attraction to each other is evident from the first, and perhaps in a different time, when the anxieties aren't so ubiquitous, this would not have occurred. At least, that is my assessment, or the reason that allows me to consider that their pairing is organic, and that who we are is fungible.This is my first Leavitt novel, although THE INDIAN CLERK, a much fatter novel, sits on my shelf. Now, I look forward to it. Leavitt's prose is lean and assured, and he manages to surprise the reader with a few twists, especially toward the end, when it is understood that the craft of writing is an important subtext of Leavitt's work, or at least, has a talismanic presence. Or, perhaps, it is incidental to the recalibration of our sense of self--and those closest to us.""It is really astounding to me, the human capacity for self-delusion, of which I myself am as guilty as anyone, and as much when what is at stake is something to be lost as something to be gained.

DuBois has taken many liberties with the familiar Knox chronicle, so that it is a decidedly different story. It reads like a mosaic of a family and a haunting labyrinth of mirrors.American exchange student Lily Hayes, on the verge of 21, travels to Buenos Aires to study abroad for a semester. She plans to immerse herself in the culture, improve her Spanish, and re-define herself. As it is, she feels that her parents perceive her as an afterthought. Tragedy struck the family before she was born. Her parents lost a 2 ½ year-old daughter, Janie, to a blood dyscrasia, and now, she and her younger sister, Anna, feel like props in their parents lives, a consolation prize to the sacred and forever 2 ½ year-old sister.Lily and her roommate, Katy Kellers, live with a host family, and Lily feels the prickliness of being poorly appraised by the family, and is always getting in trouble with them, due to her guileless naïveté. She begins a romance with the mercurial neighbor, Sebastien LeCompte, another fall-out of tragedy. His parents, who were spies, died in a plane crash, leaving him a young millionaire in an old, crumbling house next door to Lily and Katy. Five weeks later, Katy is found brutally murdered; Lily is the prime suspect. These details and events are all revealed very early in the novel, and set up the meat of the story's riddle.The novel unfolds gradually, even leisurely, as DuBois takes the time to pause and dig deeply into each character. The chapters alternate between characters and time periods, and the reader sees circumstances and events through a prism of different eyes and sensibilities and prejudices, and through the personal histories of Lily, her parents, the prosecutor, Sebastien, and Anna. There is tragedy or fierce rejection/abandonment in everyone's past, and how that affects each one's judgment and awareness is germane to the evolution of the story.As Lily says of her parents, Andrew and Maureen, about their divorce:""...when it finally came, after years of existing in a collective state of medicated and vacant life-tolerance, they merely drifted off into separate ethers, and that was that."" And the death of Janie:""...life was short...yes, a terrible thing had happened...long, long ago and one day everyone would be dead and nobody would get any extra points for having hated life so much. Because Andrew and Maureen did hate life, really; they were just always very polite about it.CARTWHEEL does not fit the mold of genre crime fiction. If you are looking for a pulse-pounding, propulsive, cat-and-mouse thriller, this likely won't satisfy that desire. Dubois' novel progresses at a dilatory pace. it is a psychological character study and a penetrating reflection of what it is to face the impossible odds of life. How do you reconcile the immutable past with the unreliable present?I don't think that Lily's guilt or innocence is even central to DuBois' purpose in writing the story. More importantly, it's about Lily as seen through a spectrum of various observers--for example, her ""inappropriate"" behaviors--a cartwheel, a kiss, a cold reaction to murder. The fact of Lily's guilt or innocence is not the apogee of this novel at all. Rather, it is built on the question of perception: How do we perceive others, and how do others perceive us? How much of that is determined by how we see ourselves? In the hands of the prosecutor, Eduardo Campos, he has the power to force his will on others. In the case of Lily, her carelessness and reckless free-spiritedness could destroy her life. She is powerless against the forces of a foreign country or the capricious media's thirst for tawdry scandal.As Eduardo imagines saying to Lily:""We must act as though our understanding, as limited as it might be, is the most panoramic and complete understanding possible. We must act as though everything in this life counts; as though we only have one shot to get things right. We must act as though nobody would see the truth if we did not see the truth.""There's a set of facts and there's forensic evidence, and then there is the truth. Do the facts support the truth? Or are they two different organisms? CARTWHEEL weighs facts that reflect remembrance, and evasions that simulate lies-- to safeguard the truth.

Norton PerinIn this riveting story, narrated as a memoir, the life of a (fictional) Nobel Prize winning scientist is recounted by the man himself, A. Norton Perina, who is writing from prison, and edited by a friend and colleague, Dr. Ronald Kubodera. Perina's fame resulted from a 1950 expedition taken to a remote Micronesian village, just after he finished medical school. He went down with anthropologist Paul Tallent, and returned with a turtle purported to be responsible for the long life of the villagers of U'ivu, which led to his Nobel Prize. During the many subsequent trips he took there by himself, he adopted a total of 43 children; he was convicted in 1996 of molesting one of them. Perina's defense, outside the courtroom, is told in this page-turning account of his life.The fictional village of U'ivu is depicted as an almost mythical, illusive, dreamlike place. The dwellers are actually called ""The Dreamers,"" people who seem from a different strata altogether, who ""looked like a man and moved like a man but who flailed and could not speak, who shrieked like a monkey and, though he seemed strong and healthy, was without sense.""As Perina, the scientist, advances toward professional recognition, and Tallent continues the obsessive record of the U'ivuian culture and life, the tiny village is eventually overrun by big pharma, and the lush forests are eventually stripped of vegetation. Modernity makes a wasteland out of what was pure and primordial. But, even more fascinating, on a microcosmic level, is Perina the man and his own values and morals.In some technical ways, it reminded me a little of Fieldwork: A Novel, by Mischa Berlinski, because of a strong focus on cultural anthropology and the question of moral relativism (and the footnotes and the superb description of a culture that lives outside of time). Moral relativism may even be the key theme, or the underlying examination regarding human values, along with questions about science:""To be a scientist is to learn to live all one's life with questions that will never be answered,"" written in a footnote by Kobudera.What is acceptable in the name of progress, and what is simply self-serving? These are the questions that will undoubtedly emerge as the reader gets deeper into the novel. Yanagihara is a gifted novelist, and unafraid of probing unsettling and thorny issues.

Now that I've read it, I see the irony in the cover art. Moreover, the novel contains a substantial chunk of dark moments and cultivated topics. It is an ensemble piece of five separate stories (four of them about marriage), with a trajectory of over 60 years, that connect by the subject of diamonds in general and one in particular. Eventually, four of the stories are wedded together. One of them, the story of true life Frances Gerety, is the historical thread that illuminates the height of advertising--creating a market for diamond engagement rings out of thin air. Eventually, diamonds become a symbol of wedded bliss, thanks to the psychology of N.W. Ayer and Son, the advertising giants of the 20th century.Each story has its own year (1947, 1972, 1987, 2003, and 2011). However, the 1947 story, which belongs to Frances Gerety, jumps forward in time as she gets older. Gerety is the copywriter that worked for Ayer (and handled the DeBeers account) that came up with the signature line, ""Diamonds are Forever."" She is an icon in advertising history, and her story as a progressive woman in the world of men is fascinating. As a female, she was subjugated to men, and was paid half as much. She was indispensable, but was treated more like a secretary than a brilliant creator. She accepted it with grace and panache, despite her secret desire to rise to the top. She never married or had children; she was married to her career.What you learn about the propaganda campaign of diamond hawking? Well, don't read this book if you are near to the altar. The cultural history of the engagement ring is reason enough to call the whole thing off. The 4 C's should add a 5th--cartel, for the manufactured consumerism. Perhaps a 6th--campaign, for all the work that Ayer did to engineer the mindset that the size of the diamond equaled the commitment to marriage, as well as the groom demonstrating his worth and ambition.The individual stories were absorbing, each a strong example of the times for which they were written, topped with a gay wedding planned by the cousin of one of the grooms, a woman emphatically against the institution of marriage.

A few years later, he met someone else that he hoped would help heal him. This is a story about the presence of the past, PTSD, grief, lives falling apart, bodies falling soundlessly. It is a story of love and hope from on high, and the crumbling and dissolution of that love and hope, the profanity of it when it runs out of fuel.Narrated by Yammara, the story is set against the backdrop of Colombian history, from the sixties through the nineties, during the ruthless, violent years of drug trafficking and drug wars. The story focuses on Yammara and the people in his life, and one tragic event that made time stand still for him while the rest of the world moved on. He witnessed a casual friend, Ricardo Laverde, an ex-pilot and ex-convict, killed in the streets of Bogotá. Antonio was also severely injured. This event consumed him, and he was unable to focus on his family--the woman, Aura, he had met and romanced during the same year as he met Laverde, and the baby they had together shortly afterward.What happens next is a journey to the past--Laverde's past--one that Yammara is compelled to understand. He follows a cassette tape to the Magdelena Valley, to Laverde's daughter, another walking wounded of Colombia's history, who is also stuck in time by previous events. Together, they attempt to fill in the missing pieces of Laverde's history, with the hope of liberating them both from the prison of pain and trauma.Narrated with eloquence, intimacy, and warmth, Vasquez' story resonates with a heartbreaking lyricism and poetry that captivated me from the opening pages.

In his latest novel, set near San Diego, 2008, Boswell explores the world of mentally/emotionally challenged individuals and their caretakers/counselors, rendered with an eagle eye and a tender heart. Peopled with well-defined, original characters, it revolves around the theme of keeping your grip while life tumbles down around you, and aiming to encounter a slip of hope and normality within the chaos of a broken world.“Every sane person has to find every day some manner of accommodating the impossible, some way of covering up for the failures of the rational world. This might actually be a reasonable definition of sanity.”The story is set at the fictional Onyx Springs Rehabilitation and Therapeutic Center, one of the largest treatment centers in the US, which houses dormitories for the high risk clientele, and an outpatient facility. Many of them come together at the sheltered workshop—a pantyhose packaging workshop that allow patients to earn money and learn assembly line skills, preparing them to function semi-independently. The characters engage, collaborate, and collide in a circling and revealing narrative that allows the reader to witness a share of their all-consuming lives. Thirty-three-year-old James Candler is an affable, attractive therapist, a yearning counselor who has, even with his flaws, found his niche in counseling individuals. “He thought it might be more important to be heard than to be understood. It was almost certainly the greatest benefit of therapy: that someone was willing to listen.”Now, however, he is pursuing the directorship at Onyx Springs at the persuasion of the vacating director. Candler bought an expensive house and a fancy car, steeped himself in financial debt, compelling him to require the lucrative directorship position. His fiancé, who he barely knows, is about to arrive; his sister, who recently lost her husband, is also on her way. And James is drawn to a woman (he doesn’t recognize) from his past, and who he counseled once—which turned her life around.In the meantime, James’s distant past is hurtling toward his present, pressing on him emotionally. During James’s youth in Arizona, his parents—pretentious artists--refused to get professional help for his brother, Pook, who was autistic and fragile. Pook was also an artist, but his talent was his curse, one that underpins James’s journey of self-awareness, which takes place through the arc of the book.Billy Atlas, James’s best friend since childhood, has emotional problems that have interfered with social adjustment, but he comprehends Candler better than anyone. He is temporarily living with James, who has propped Billy up with a supervising job at the shelter, an assignment that Billy may not be emotionally competent to handle. Then there are the clients, a variety of characters with their own exquisite torments. If the mind is an elaborate system of pulleys and levers and delicate balances, then what happens when a portion is altered or missing?The most sympathetic character is Mick Coury, a client of Candler and the workshop, a handsome twenty-one-year-old suffering from schizophrenia. When he is on his meds, he functions steadily, but he is dissatisfied with the flattening effect. He has had several suicide attempts in the past, but appears to be coping. Mick falls head over heels for Karly, a beautiful client, but with the intelligence of a small child. Maura Wood, who lives on-campus, has superior intelligence, like Mick, but suffers from extreme emotional problems. She is desperate for Mick, who is desperate for Karly. Everyone struggles for an anchor of something possible, grasping for certainty in this tumbledown world.One must have clear boundaries to work effectively in this field. In Tumbledown, boundaries are getting blurred and often violated, and both clients and counselors are potentially headed for a fall. Moreover, as the story flows back and forth between characters and time periods, we begin to understand, for example, why James became a counselor, and his desire to reconcile the past with the present. Billy strives to capitalize on the present and secure a footing in the future, as a way of erasing the past. Mick’s greatest desire is to “return to the world as it had been before. The simplicity of it, the basic clarity of existence, would once more belong to him.”In the dedication at the front of the book, Boswell states “This book is dedicated to all the clients who survived my tenure as a counselor and to the one who didn’t.” That line resonates in every character that appears in this narrative, in the precise way that he portrays the domain and the people who inhabit it. As a psychiatric nurse for thirty years, I recognize a credible setting from a badly contrived one. I am reticent to read a book with this context, due to occupational hazard, but I wasn’t disappointed here, as I recognized the authenticity and acumen of Boswell’s depictions. What sometimes detracts from the story is the densely crowded narrative. Most of the characters are introduced early, and they pile on before the reader has an opportunity to absorb them. Eventually, they are given dimension and place in the story, but the torpid momentum periodically drained my senses. Moreover, Boswell goes off on tangents, and the narrative was weighted with infinitesimal details, and the tension I craved was diminished. This was a brave and incisive book about the tyranny of the psyche, but at times it was overcome by a tyranny of verbosity. If you stick with it, though, you will be ultimately moved by a compassionate story of humanity, and the conflicting and complex nature of surviving in an impossible world.“He had a vague belief that the ability to do the right thing and the ability to do the wrong thing were the same ability, and it existed like a great body of water on which floated your personality, and you could never tell just what might seep through, or in which direction a tide might take you.”...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Jul 2013,"Aug 13, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16059652-tumbledown

You did it again! Well, let me first digress.Ever since the outrageously popular series, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, Scandinavian mysteries have been flooding the American marketplace. How to parse which ones are good, mediocre, or flat out bad? Some of these mysteries preceded DRAGON in its original country, but were printed in English after the Dragon Fever, capitalizing on the notion of region. Readers are hungry for Scandinavian mysteries, and I am no exception. But, after reading some stinkers, I decided to do my homework. Norwegian Karin Fossum was a published poet before being a crime writer, which bodes well, as this is obviously a writer who cares about the power of lyricism. Her descriptive prose is subtly poetic.Karin Fossum books were not released in the US in chronological order (unfortunately), but she was here before Larsson, which alerts me that she didn’t arrive BECAUSE of Larsson. THE INDIAN BRIDE, which was published here in 2005, demonstrated Fossum as a writer who is not just interested in the good guys catching the bad guys. It is a fascinating story that is more sociological and character-driven, one that I can comfortably recommend to my non-crime book reading friends.EVA'S EYE, the first Inspector Sejer book, has finally arrived. It has a more unorthodox approach to the series genre. Sejer doesn't come across as the main character. He is integral to the story, and the necessary moral center. But, instead of HIS categorical perspective, it is Eva, a self-contained, beautiful, but too-thin woman, who carries the book. This is brilliant, because ""series"" books that focus primarily on the crime-fighter eventually peter out, because the cop or detective either becomes a parody of him/herself or a stock-in-trade cardboard figure. Even though I am obligated to read the Sejer series out of order, it is evident that Sejer's (and Skarre's) characters build gradually, and keenly. I finally get to see the genesis of Sejer, and I appreciate the light but revealing touch by Fossum.The narrative swings back and forth in time, but ever so delicately, and accessibly. Artist Eva is a divorcee with a young child, Emma. She is committed to her work, and makes her living solely on her art. Her art is best described as a style of underpainting in order to capture light, shadows, and the play of both. She uses black and white exclusively (and some layers of grey). Often, an observer asks, “What does it mean?”While Eva is down by the river with Emma, she sees a dead and decomposing body floating in the bank among the stones. And by the way, here is the description of the river, to illustrate the power of Fossum’s prose:“The river cascaded through the countryside, splitting the cold town into two shivering gray floes.” Fossum’s descriptions go hand and hand with the characters’ tensions and fears. The mood of the town, the atmosphere, directly correlates to that of the characters who inhabit it.Eva assures her daughter that she will call the police from the phone box nearby. But she doesn’t. That is all one needs to know. The rest of the story unfolds at a superb clip, keeping pace with the reader’s demands while creating a creeping thrill of tension and awe.The ending, as all Fossum books I have read, gnawed at me. Some of her books are open-ended; however, if you are one who likes for major points to be revealed, you will be satisfied by the close of this book, as there aren’t a lot of loose ends. Yet, there are jaw-dropping surprises. Even with this debut novel, it is evident that Fossum is a first-class writer.

Douglas, the recently deceased, was the acolyte of the group, the maestro.Back in the 1970's, these four friends prided themselves on their subversive wit and forward-thinking ways. Walking out on foreign films at the Thalia that they judged as overrated, writing inflammatory letters to their college newspaper, playing frivolous but highbrow literary games with each other.They were going to be social renovators of some kind, and always have a sense of unity and brotherhood between them. ""Subtle bodies"" was a term that meant the ingredients of their future selves, an inner shine that emanated and eventually emerged. But now that Douglas was dead, there were concerns within members of the group that all of this future accomplishment together had now been foreclosed. Yet, they hadn't even kept in close touch over the years.Ned, the main male protagonist of this story, is a political activist (this is 2003, before the war with Iraq), assembling, with his wife, a protest march called the Convergence. He's had to postpone this in order to converge with his friends for the funeral of ""Le Grande Douglas."" Ned's wife, Nina, was desperately trying to get pregnant with the help of fertility drugs and timed sex, and as the novel opens, she is angry at Ned for taking off to this gathering in the gloaming, and has followed him there, primarily because she was in a fertile time of the month.The other members of the group were Elliot, the smug organizer of this quasi ""media event"" memorial, Gruen, who owned an agency dedicated to PSA announcements, and Joris, the smartest of the bunch, who had a fetish for married woman and prostitutes.It is difficult to describe this novel, which isn't so much a cohesively arranged story as it is a collection of incidents and self-reflections that take place up at the estate. It is avant-garde, brainy and didactic Big Chill-y type of story (it is not ""entertaining"" and smooth flowing like Big Chill, the only similarity is superficial, i.e. the framework), where the characters test themselves and each other. Themes of love and friendship materialize, particularly the interplay of marriage and friendship, and how these loyalties and former ideals are regarded and evaluated in the present day. But it was so pointedly intellectual/cerebral, without the needed emotional connection, that I felt at a grave distance.Nina, the ""outsider,"" is the most passionate character in the novel, and the glue that does allow some consolidation, a forward progression, and narrative tension. To me, she was the only lifelike character of all the characters, whereas the others seemed often like mouthpieces for Rush's politics or social activism. It could be argued that Ned was the second most palpable character, but without Nina, Ned would have been more broadcast than substance. It is intriguing to note that Rush was imprisoned as a conscientious objector during the Korean War, and it seems that Nina and Ned's Convergence stems from that experience.It is painful for me to give a 3-star rating to Rush, as he is one of my literary champions of the modern novel. MATINGS was one of my most treasured books of all time, a colossal achievement. His prose may have been self-consciously erudite, but his story was emotionally hefty. His protagonist was female, and I never felt that Rush had taken over her story. MORTALS was a monumental and absorbing tale, also, about the conflicts of a CIA agent, the inner demons that cleave you to and from your true self. Both novels were set in Botswana. Rush had spent five years in the Peace Corps there, and he penned both books with a remarkable backdrop, based on his genuine comprehension of the area and the social iniquities of the time.Like the past two novels, Rush has this Renaissance Man's ability to cover subjects from anthropology to zoology, and fold them into a tale about humanity. He can use a third person POV and, by the end of the sentence, corral us to the first person. His prose is unparalleled. Here, in his new novel, there is no loss of stunning and brainy words, sentences, passages. And there are concrete, down to earth assertions that make you think, such as:""Douglas's death was bound to bring out all the anxieties that go with looking back and summing up what a life came down to, the choices made, what the verdict would be if life ended suddenly without any warning or chance to do the things that were left to do that could improve the judgment an existence got.""In the end, however, I didn't feel satisfied. It was arm's length, for the most part--observational, scholarly, and contained scintillating philosophical insights. But, as a story, I felt a bit cheated out of any emotional gratification or connection. However, if you are a Rush fan, that is a compelling enough argument to read this and decide for yourself....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Jul 2013,"Jul 31, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262474-subtle-bodies

Once the first ninety pages or so go by at a casual clip, you will be pinned like a fly in a spider's web.Ever since I read Harris' debut novel, THE OBSERVATIONS, I knew that I was in the hands of a first-rate writer. THE OBSERVATIONS, written in the patois of a Scottish scullery maid who narrates the story, takes you gradually on a sharp, twisting, dark tale. As in this book, it starts out rather chipper and mannerly, like a book of habits and manners would do, replete with subtly braided social commentary and Dickensian characters. And then...it seizes you by the throat. In GILLESPIE, it also starts out decorous and Jane Austen-like. The territory then morphs to something like Poe. Both books are what I would call ""sleepers."" As in THE OBSERVATIONS, this takes place in 19th century Scotland, this time in Glasgow rather than Edinburgh.I'll reveal the set-up only: Harriet Baxter, a British woman in her 30's of independent means, befriends the Gillespie family of Glasgow in 1888. Ned Gillespie is an artist on the rise, but still struggling to make ends meet. He lives with his wife and their two young daughters, Sibyl and Rose. As the novel starts out, Harriet has saved the life of Ned's mother, a hovering gasbag, who has fallen down in the street. Thus their friendship begins. Harriet is narrating the story of their friendship, and Ned's ultimate suicide (this is revealed on the first page), as Harriet says:""Who is left to tell the tale? Ned Gillespie: artist, innovator, and forgotten genius; my dear friend and soul mate.""Harriet is writing her memoir from her home in Bloomsbury, in 1933. She is now 75 years old, and seems lonely but proud, living in the house with her two beloved finches and an assistant to help with household tasks.There are a few courtroom scenes that are a bit loose, at least as far as my understanding of legal proceedings, witness examination, and cross-examination. But these are minor irritations, and don't spoil the story. Moreover, I am no expert in 19th century Scottish law.So, find a comfortable spot and settle in for a wild ride. Something along the lines of Jane Austen that either skyrockets or plunges into the Bad Seed. And then some. It is tart, tangy, and eventually adrenaline-fueling. Don't let the 500+ pages daunt you.

In short, it is a coming-of-age and a look back.This is the kind of languid narrative that takes the long view of a life, and allows for deep reflection of the narrator and asks for concentration from the reader. Events move along at a dilatory pace, starting when Regina is just 21. These few years of her life are primordial, sticky, and really messy, when the superego isn't yet developed, and she acts on her own self-interest. Her entanglements with a married couple of charismatic English professors and their infant son are a time of watery boundaries and shrill desire.Choi balances optimism with cynicism quite well; I was expecting her to do the hip thing which she does do, but she goes further, allows Regina to actually grow and, as she says in middle age:""Middle age only meant that the least reconcilable times of one's life would in fact coexist until death.""That will make more sense when you read the long passages of self-analysis.There were times I felt a little restive while reading, wanting the pace to speed up a little. The book is mostly written in a passive voice, recalling, subjecting each moment to scrutiny. But, by the end, you are satisfied, and understand that the navel gazing is what it is--a book of contemplation....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jul 16, 2013","Jul 17, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16158566-my-education

You can catch on immediately that it is self-referential, at least to some degree. The memoirist's name is Ruth (like the author)--both Ruths have a husband name Oliver and live on a remote island in British Colombia. And both are writers. The Ruth of the novel suffers from writer's block. She has been trying to write a book of her mother's last years living with Alzheimer's, and to illustrate her own feelings about her experience as daughter and caretaker.One day, Ruth finds some barnacle-encrusted belongings washed up ashore, possibly from the 2011 Japan tsunami and the tidal drifts that deposited debris in their direction. Inside is a Hello Kitty lunchbox, a wristwatch circa WWII, letters in Japanese, a French composition book, and a diary of a 16-year-old Japanese girl named Nao (pronounced ""Now"") written in English. The diary itself is set inside a hacked copy of Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time). Proust's novel is removed, leaving the shell as a cover protecting Nao's secret journal.In the meantime, a native Japanese crow has inhabited the island where Ruth and Oliver live with their moody cat, eerily haunting the island with its ke ke ke song.According to the narrative, the ancient Zen master, Shōbōgenzō, stated, ""Time itself is being...and all being is time...In essence, everything in the entire universe is intimately linked with each other as moments in time, continuous and separate.""I was hooked by that time, and for the time...being.I know that, thus far, I have only quoted great historical thinkers and writers, whose words are enfolded in this shimmering tapestry of a book. However, be assured that Ozeki's contemporary narrative will both exhilarate and touch you.""I am reaching through time to touch you,"" writes Nao with her purple gel pen.Ruth decides to hunker down with Nao's diary, a few pages at a time, each night reading to Oliver and herself. She learns early on that Nao is planning on killing herself after she writes down the life story of her great-grandmother Jiko, the Buddhist nun. As the diary unfolds, it is evident that Nao is also recording the story of her own life. Moreover, she shares the events, as she knows it, of her dead great-uncle, the WW II pilot who was also a philosopher and lover of French literature.The opening of the book is abstract, unformed, and philosophical, but that only lasts for a few pages. Once the chapters begin, the narrative alternates between Ruth and Nao. I admit to an early concern, that the novel may be a YA-adult crossover, due to the chipper tone of Nao and her indelibly teenage style. But, eventually, as the story penetrates and cross-cuts through characters, the storylines become a piercing symphony. I am confident that you will be moved by not just its warmth, but its luminous beauty.""In the interstices between sleeping and waking, she floated in a dark liminal state that was not quite a dream, but was perpetually on the edge of becoming one. There she hung, submerged and tumbling slowly, like a particle of flotsam just below the crest of a wave that was always just about to break.""Along the way, you will learn numerous Japanese words, which are footnoted, and Buddhist concepts, which are woven in seamlessly. I have had too many experiences of overweening narratives exerting Buddhist credo that discharge as shallow power point presentations or pedantic coffee table ideas. Ozeki doesn't disappoint. With a little magic realism (just a little!), a pinch of Murakami, and a lot of heart, she pulls the threads all together into a radiant tapestry.

Although this is only my second foray into For readers unfamiliar with Louise Penny's mystery series, this is #9 with Chief Inspector Armand Gamache. Although this is only my second foray into her Quebec crime series (my first being her last book, BEAUTIFUL MYSTERY), I was impressed with her ability to create multiple plots and weave them together. There's a fresh murder to solve in the town of Three Pines (where some of her series takes place), as well as an arc that started several books ago--the malfeasance of the Sûreté du Québec (police dept). additionally, Armand's close colleague and personal friend, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, is suffering from addiction problems.HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN takes us back to Three Pines, where I met several quirky/eccentric people for the first time, but am well aware that they are repeating characters, (or sometimes just former ones). Penny does a solid job of bringing new readers into this small village and allowing us to meet the inhabitants naturally and unaffectedly. She doesn't broadcast their histories with awkward exposition, but rather lets pieces of their past unfold with the present events. That takes subtlety and finesse, something that Penny astutely possesses. The truculent poet, Ruth, for example, may be on the periphery of a scene periodically, and then take center stage. Penny juxtaposes scenes and events that progress the various plots and develop the characters with riveting tension.The murder of septuagenarian, Constance Pineault, who had just recently visited Three Pines bookstore owner, Myrna, brings Gamache back to investigate. This is right before the Christmas holidays, where the deep snow and cold air tends to create gatherings at the warm village bistro. At the same time, Gamache is struggling to keep his decimated homicide department together. He has been undermined by Superintendent Sylvain Françoeur, who has effectively fouled Gamache's reputation and is honing in for the final blow. Armand's relationship with Jean-Guy has also been maimed, thanks to Françoeur and Jean-Guy's torment with his own personal demons.Penny also devotes ample space to suspenseful cyber hacking, and does it nimbly and accessible to even the low-tech reader. My nails were bitten to the quick! And she demonstrates the truth in human nature, as colleagues claw each other with raw vitriol, and yet show genuine compassion, too.Treachery; suspense; still voices; moving targets; exquisite plotting--the reader will be satisfied AND nonplussed in equal measure by the end of the book. I don't want to spoil this potent novel for anyone, but I will say that I am glad I read BEAUTIFUL MYSTERY first, because I was already involved before this book began, with a gestating inevitability that has been underpinning much of Gamache's current directives. I am speculating that this is Penny's most heightened and cataclysmic book to date.As an end note, Penny tells us that the title of this book is based on a Leonard Cohen song called Anthem.""Ring the bells that still can ringForget your perfect offering,There's a crack in everything,That's how the light gets in.""Besides those beautiful words germane to the substance of this book, the title itself is apropos to one of the definitions of anthem: a hymn sung alternately by different sections of a choir or congregation.An anthem it is. ...more",Notes are private!,0,80,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2013","Jul 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17167084-how-the-light-gets-in

In this, Maksik's second novel, I was bewitched once again by his delicate prose--his ability to spin words, connecting them like fine silver filaments, into whirls of poetic images. I like to linger on Maksik's beautiful passages, such as:""There were the patchwork farms and vineyards sloping gently to the white frothing coastline. There was the church, pink as bloodied water, and beyond that the cliff edge and the caldera below. She looked down over the town, the buildings like white teeth piled at the very edge of the cliff, at the very end of the island. White teeth and beads of glass.""The problem with the story is that it was manipulative and pandering. I am not insensitive to Charles Taylor's war crimes in Liberia. As a matter of fact, my in-laws were on assignment there in 1989, and my husband and I were frightened when there was no word from them when the civil war broke out. This was the days before smart phones and home computers, and communication was spotty. Fortunately, they got out just in time, and since then, I have done some research on Taylor and have read the excellent novel, DARLING, by Russell Banks, about Taylor's reign in Liberia.Maksik constructed a melodramatic soap opera, replete with a canned and histrionic climax that was so assuming and ham-handed that I closed the book in anger. Certainly Maksik was maneuvering for revulsion-cum-compassion, but mine was against the artifice of the narrative more than the graphic and harrowing events. Where was the nuance that had followed protagonist Jacqueline across the Greek island of Thera? Moreover, it seems that Maksik depended wholly on his theatrical ending in order to shock the reader and create applause. Shock, awe, and appalling war crimes are supposed to coerce the reader into lauding this book.I felt sermonized--as if it would be foul for me to criticize this novel. However, the ploys were clichéd and glaring, such as the voice of her mother, a machination that became tedious and saccharine. And Jacqueline's pregnant sister was installed in the story in order to use her to full graphic contrivance. I knew that Maksik would use the tip of his pen to plunge right through that one.On the upside, the narrative leading up to the denouement was lyrical and silken, but the story became static after 100 or so pages of teasing the reader about Jacqueline's past without ""revealing"" it. It was too coy, yet transparent. The present storyline was Jacqueline's starvation, which was a morsel he trotted out and protracted until I was weary and warily bloated with boredom. He was waiting to give us the sucker punch that would make us aghast. And wouldn't we be unfeeling monsters if we didn't embrace this book?I don't appreciate crude, conspicuous attempts to mold me into antipathy. For that, I can see a horror film. So despite his poetic prose, my rancor is for the author's attempts of manufactured rage. I intended to give it 3 stars for the language, but the more I think about Maksik's exploitation, the less fond I am of his poetry.

Richard Price and Karin Fossum are masters at this genre. Like VISITATION STREET, it often starts as a murder/police procedural as a trigger. Then, the narrative at hand observes the effect of the murder on a town, and its people. Often, the murder recedes somewhat as other forces--such as the psychology of the town's inhabitants and a rendering of the town itself as a character--begin to bloom. So far, so good, as VISITATION STREET promises to deliver a similar type of narrative.Red Hook, a sketchy area of Brooklyn, is a town of struggling blue-collar workers, modest bodega owners, and also various losers. Beneath the surface is a racial tension that is precariously kept at bay. One summer night, two white fifteen-year-old girls, Val and June, take a rubber raft out on the harbor to float under the moonlight. The next morning, Val is found with a head injury, but June has disappeared. This is the trigger that opens the story.The rest of the novel observes and explores a select number of inhabitants that all have a tenuous connection to Val, although none of them are friends or family (well, the family connections are rather superficial). June's disappearance is the vehicle for an exploration of Red Hook, as the town burgeons into a character, made up of many characters who are isolated from each other, but desperately trying to connect.""A chorus of new voices...They are rough and eroded. They sound like the ache of the wind in a charred forest, the rattle of a can rolling down an empty street, the whisper of dust in a gutted building--hollow, noises unaccustomed to an audience. They suggest a loneliness worse than pain.""The prose is quite lovely sometimes. However, the construction/architecture of the story itself tried too hard without really having much lift-off. There is certainly a lot of potential and ambition here, but the threads that the author uses to connect her characters and events are inorganic.The characterizations are insubstantial, except for the Lebanese bodega owner, who deserves his own novel. He was sharply drawn with fine nuances, and I was engaged with him as the community's epicenter of information. But much of the interaction and dialogue between characters are contrived. It is difficult to be specific without spoilers, but I will say that, rather than depicting authentic relationships, it reads as if chain-assembled. I felt that the author had a fixed idea of how she wanted this to play out, and forced her characters in place.Pochoda over-explains in order to cement the weak network of individuals to each other. Whenever a character does something morally ambiguous, she subsequently goes into a breathy explanation instead of trusting the reader to comprehend (a pitfall of some debut novelists). And any time a scene, event, or character steps into enigmatic territory, Pochoda sabotages the tension by giving the reader too much information directly afterwards.Another problem I had was with the tone, which derailed the intended atmospherics of the town itself. I wanted to be haunted by the ghost metaphors, but they were too underdeveloped and overstated. And, when the author took it one step further, and onerously dropped in the ghosts themselves, I wanted to slam the book down in disgust. However, Pochoda's graceful writing made it possible for me to finish. I hope that her next book will have the ebullience and believability that, like June, were missing in this one.

His subject matter and theme—essentially, the savage beast that resides inside the man, reminds me of siVann’s latest book is truly an ambitious one. His subject matter and theme—essentially, the savage beast that resides inside the man, reminds me of similar themes covered by Cormac McCarthy. I have read McCarthy’s entire oeuvre, and I suspect that Vann has, too. In this setting, the reader is taken to Northern California and a family of deer hunters who own this land, the eponymous Goat Mountain. The narrator, unnamed (like the Kid in Blood Meridian), tells the story of a shocking and disturbing event that occurred over thirty years ago, in 1978, when he was 11-years-old. Although the events are utterly rank and harrowing, I was not pulled along by the story and narration as Vann intended. The narrator’s tone/voice wasn’t consistent, and he sabotaged the sense of immediacy with too much presentation. Or, he would show us, and then rush to explain its poignancy, significance, or its allegorical parallels. McCarthy uses exposition at times, sometimes in the form of an oratory or within a character's thoughts, but Vann's use was too pointed and repetitive.Sometimes the boy was too coy or diffident, and at other times I felt he was trying to “educate” me at the end of a passage with pithy, heavy-handed truisms and maxims. He did this with declarative sentences that were meant to be stated as fact, but it pealed too blatantly. These trusims were often simplistic or vague, or even breaching the contract between the narrator and reader, as the authorial voice of Vann came encroaching to lay down pearls of wisdom that I didn’t buy into. Some of these truisms were just mundane, but Vann inserted a specious profundity into them. Unlike the writing of LEGENDS OF A SUICIDE, a veritable masterpiece, I didn’t feel that Vann trusted himself enough to come across clearly to the reader. So, instead, he over-explained, which made the narration either stilted or self-conscious. The style was also too indeterminate and contemporary. When you are reaching into the Old and New Testament symbolism, the reader needs a vernacular that is going to hang tough, like in McCarthy’s Blood Meridian. When he said things like “I was creeped out,” I half expected “Dude” to come out next. I was jettisoned right out of the story.Another example is Vann’s overuse of the word “atavistic,” (very McCarthy-ish word). Using it once, even twice, is effective. But Vann used that word so often that the strength of it began to fizzle. I got it the first time, but, again, I think Vann felt he needed to keep that word in our consciousness. I know that the author worked on this novel for years, and I wonder if it suffers from too much over-editing. I wanted to be lost in the story, but, instead, I was hyper-aware of the author penning the story rather than the narrator telling it. What Vann did was first show (which is good), but then he would weaken it in the telling, which wasn’t necessary, because he already showed us. It was as if Vann was dumbing down for a wider audience--certainly a wider audience than most of McCarthy's books.Why was this told in the first person by the boy? I don't feel I really gained any more insight into his state of mind (than I would have gotten, anyway). The character/narrator was too pale to carry the story, which was why Vann’s voice kept taking over.McCarthy often starts with a caricature, on purpose, but then an astonishing thing happens, and the characters become real. In the case of GOAT MOUNTAIN, the archetypal characters slipped into caricature, so that by the end, I inadvertently found myself laughing at how ludicrous things had become. There is actually a way to be nuanced and over-the-top simultaneously, as Cormac McCarthy has proven repeatedly. But, in this case, it just came across as silly and ham-handed.In a story such as this, there needs to be the understanding of what redemption would be, whether or not the author chooses to claim the redemption in the book, or not. If you are going to do a rape of the mind, then allow us to understand more than the theme of ""the beast inside the man,"" since we got that early on. It is understood that our savage natures can rear its ugly head and seize our souls. OK, but where is this taking us? I didn’t feel that I went any deeper than this one aim of the author's. Or, if he just wanted us to be entrenched in the savagery, then don't take time out for station identification, which happened frequently. There was too much instructing and constructing. Maybe the author didn't believe that the reader would tacitly comprehend. And, I wanted that void, that abyss, that space between the words for me to submerge. Vann didn't allow for the abyss; there was too much noise.It seemed that Vann was having a go at the shock and awe bit, and hoped that that would be sufficient to move the reader. Then, as if he was checking himself, he would seem to take the reader by the hand and whisper too deliberately in our ears. And I do believe that some readers will buy into it just because he dared to go further than most authors. Readers will gasp, gulp, gag, and heave, being thunderstruck by the evil nature of man morphing into his bestial counterpart.The aspect I did enjoy was the symbolic anthropomorphism of the mountains and the ""atavistic"" metaphors addressing the area of Goat Mountain (and Pan the goat symbolizing paganism contrasted with the biblical and religious references). Some of the setting really did come ""alive."" But it wasn't enough to make me like the book.I predicted the ending about halfway through the book, which doesn’t necessarily upend the effectiveness of the story. But, in this case, I did not feel any more enlightened or gripped; rather, I was shaking my head instead of looking into my soul.I would love to hear from other readers who have read McCarthy's oeuvre (not just THE ROAD!) and also GOAT MOUNTAIN. I cannot help making comparisons, because both authors cover similar terrain, and it is obvious that Vann was heavily influenced by McCarthy, (for another example, the absence of quotes in dialogue as a stylistic choice) and perhaps tried too much to emulate him while deliberately attempting to come up with his own style. There was no organic presence of the timeless and the archaic (vs just the references to it).

Whatever mental notes you take as the narrative builds, the ever-widening cast and real, random, red herring, or suspect clues keep you from perseverating too long on the questionable partnerships. Each untangled knot corkscrews around to create ropier more entangled ones.Mind games and magic, or mind games vs magic, is explored in a way that transports you to the most subterranean reaches of the human psyche. Pessl's penetrating use of symbolism, allegory, literary allusion, and metaphor saturates the story with a weighty unease and anxiety that reflect her incomparable understanding of the human condition--(not to mention a rarefied channeling of hallucinogenic experiences). In NIGHT FILM, mind over matter is a daring question with a dangerous reckoning.Pessl is obviously familiar with Hitchcock's work, as well as the films of David Lynch and Stanley Kubrik. Additionally, the iconic 40's noir films infuse NIGHT FILM with oblique shadows and moral ambiguity and imbue it with mixed media from the Internet age. Throw in a little Stephen King to the mix, too. However, Pessl's use of pastiche is brushed and buffed into her own variegated style, with a voice that is strikingly poetic. She winks at and pays homage more than she mimics.The gritty and shadowy streets, railway tracks, bridges, and warehouses of New York; the dark silhouette of the Adirondacks against a night sky; mansions sitting like a pit bull on a bluff; the mist obscuring the hand or a face or the gnarled limb of a tree--all Pessl's ethereal images suffuse the story with an almost sepulchral ambiance. There were times I jumped while reading, certain I heard a cup rattling on a shelf, or saw a light flickering behind a curtain. At other times, my heart melted, especially when Scott would successfully enlist his five-year-old daughter to help his investigation. She was uncannily guileless but aware and persuasive.The overriding theme can be found in the first lines of the book, a quote from Stanislav Cordova that begins the prologue:""Mortal fear is as crucial a thing to our lives as love. It cuts to the core of our being and shows us what we are. Will you step back and cover your eyes? Or will you have the strength to walk to the precipice and look out?""What happens when we break through our cocoon and walk to the edge and back? Are we blinding ourselves to our true nature, and to the nature of others, when we attempt to hold desperately onto those we love?""Life was a freight train barreling toward just one stop, our loved ones streaking past our windows in blurs of color and light. There was no holding on to any of it, and no slowing down.""This is at turns comical, disturbing, terrifying, tragic, tender, and spiritually poetic. The pace is breakneck and pitch-perfect electric, despite its florid and exuberant sentences, and the prose is evocative, aphoristic, savvy. It's relentless and addictive, no time to catch your breath before you are falling through another black hole.If you prefer a straight-up horror or crime-solving genre, this may not please you. Pessl breaks the rules and the mold, and the narrative is as much philosophy and metaphysics as it is mystery and mysticism. I was chasing shadows and rainbows in equal measure....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,"Jun 06, 2013","Jun 06, 2013",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10281556-night-film

After starting a blog on race, she becomes a notably popular blogger, receiving generous endorsements from advertisers (and sometimes mysterious donors), and earns enough money to buy a condo and live comfortably in America. The race issue was never emphatic until she moved to the US thirteen years ago. In Nigeria, class may be an issue but race is not. Her blackness didn't matter until she moved to her first American city, Philadelphia. There's even a distinction in racism between American Blacks (AB) and Non-American Blacks (NAB), which figure into her blog title.As Ifemelu is waited on at the hair salon in a sketchy part of Trenton, New Jersey, much of this story--which goes back and forth and weaves in like the braids in her hair--unfolds. She is getting her hair done for the last time in the States, before moving back to Lagos for reasons yet to be identified clearly.She mines race issues and conflicts deeper than almost any author (of fiction) I can think of without hammering us with a pedantic or authorial voice. Adichie equates the ordeal of a black woman's hair, with all its textural details, to the coils, snarls, spirals, twists, and tangles of race and racism, both metaphorically and concretely. The narrative illustrates the Caucasian indifference and ignorance to kinky Afro hair, and the expectation for a black person to make their hair behave like a white person's in order to be presentable. Surprisingly and credibly, it is acutely tied to the darker corners of racism in America. But, yet, the story does not pontificate or condescend with this knowledge. It impels the reader without patronizing or preaching.As an ardent fan of Adichie's past novels, HALF OF A YELLOW SUN (now being made into a movie) and PURPLE HIBISCUS, I was delighted to connect to her latest novel with the same ease. Although AMERICANAH is differently structured and plotted than the others (the previous novels took place during or surrounding the Nigerian civil war), there is that prevailing Adichie-ness, the fecund immediacy that keeps every sentence fresh, and the story succulent.Race, identity and the question of home are constant themes in her novels. And, as she has done before, Adichie writes a sweeping, star-crossed love story that is equally sweet and astringent, arch and blistering. The near-epic love between Ifelemu and Obinze, who she met as a teen in Lagos, suspends us to the very end of the book. Most of the time in the novel they are on different sides of the ocean and out of contact, but Adichie doesn't falter in keeping their distinct stories potent, and seducing the reader into a longing for both of them.The persistent questions and concerns that plague Ifemelu and Obinze, as they trot different parts of the globe, remain one of displaced Africanness in an Anglophone world, and identity in an African world (when the story moves to Lagos). Adichie activates our thirst for her story while quenching it intermittently and then activating it again. And again. It's a page-turner that doesn't depend on plot, yet there is a staying power of plot that eventually goes into high gear, and is thick with three-dimensional characterizations, and the ubiquitous matter of skin color.AMERICANAH addresses the diluted American colloquy of ""racial differences"" and the too often coy discourse of ""racial conflict,"" exposing the harsh realities (and nuances) of racism. What is revealed are the curious, ugly, twisted and varnished forms of racism, some even hidden behind liberal correctness and passive/aggressive ignorance. The blog posts are wiry and confrontational, but poised with a tremendous generosity of spirit and open-endedness.Before returning to Lagos years later, the reader is invited into the personal lives of the people who have touched Ifemelu's life, including her flinty Aunt Uju; ex-boyfriends; best girlfriends; her beloved cousin, Dike; business associates, and a capsulation of her parents in Lagos. The point of view is frequently either Ifemelu or Obinze, but the story is sprinkled with several of the secondary characters' first person perspectives, also.Her blog on (largely) race pops up throughout, but never takes over. The blog is an extension of Ifemelu, including her pride, shame, guilt, confidence, dignity, intelligence, and vulnerability. Never once, as some ers complain about, did I think that the blog was a distraction or a gimmick. I've read many disappointing novels where the main character is cast as a gonzo journalist or Pulitzer-winning author, however the narrative then speaks peripherally about the protagonist's talent and skills without incorporating it viscerally into the story. It gives the novel a false ring.In Adichie's new novel, however, the blog underpins and encapsulates Ifemelu. Despite her irresolute sense of home and identity, which increases or decreases at different points in the story, her blog becomes its own transcript and microcosm of her singularity and relation to others. Wherever she travels, the blog is her home, her mojo, herself. The blog and the narrative are inextricably entwined; they are each integral to creating a nuanced, consummate portrait of Ifemelu and the often unsettling world she inhabits. The 475 pages move swiftly, with Adichie's euphonious command of language, lucid characterizations, and gradually increasing tension keeping the reader satisfied and expectant....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"May 27, 2013","May 31, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15796700-americanah

British aviators John Alcock and Arthur (Teddy) Whitten Brown are up in the air in their WW 1 Vickers Vimy at the start of this tale, the pair who made the historical transatlantic journey from Newfoundland to Ireland in 1919. It could be said that the novel begins in media res, and the reader is installed in an already evolving story that takes place from 1845 to the present. It is told through a non-linear progress of evolving images, events, and generations of people.But, wait, I need to go back to the image in the prologue--to a house, and a woman listening to the sounds that define the house's character. By the time we make the symmetrical return to the house at the end of the book, its image has been altered and given much gravitas by the external events that precede it. The whole of the novel is most elegantly the sum of its parts. This isn't evident for a while, because the separate generations' stories are rendered with zoomed-in effect, and the camera gradually pulls out to connect the different stories together. Later, as the varying threads and initially unrelated perspectives go back and forth a few times, we see the integration of stories and generations into a panoramic whole. The factual characters and events heighten the poignancy of the fictional ones.The graceful symmetry of the novel's harmonious and measured structure is one of the elements of this genre-blurring fiction that McCann is so noted for. He seamlessly weaves biographical people and events with the ordinary characters that populate the story. As McCann re-examines and speculates on them, he creates adjoining tunnels into their lives, illuminating the predominant theme of the novel, which is beautifully distilled in this quote:""We return to the lives before us, a perplexing möbius strip until we come home, eventually, to ourselves.""That line, which deepens every time I read it, became the defining image for me, and tied the different threads and four generations of narrative voices together into a beautiful, astonishing, immaculate masterpiece. The mixture of biographical facts and speculative truth-- of Alcock and Brown transforming a bomber plane into a navigational vehicle to fly a landmark journey; freed slave and statesman Frederick Douglass' eye-opening visit to Ireland in 1845; Senator George Mitchell's historic flight to Ireland that led to the Belfast Peace Agreement on Good Friday 1998; the words of great leaders and journalists; and the transportation of ice all seamlessly weave into the fabric of the four generations of women.A letter written by the novel's journalist Emily Ehrlich, and given to aviator Brown, becomes the most enigmatic and recurring signifier of all, a dispatch that is both a symbol and a subtly dramatic connection between the generations.""We prefigure our futures by imagining our pasts. We go back and forth. Across the waters. The past, the present, the elusive future. A nation. Everything constantly shifted by the present. The taut elastic of time.""McCann's exquisite, transcendent use of language is a joy to read, peerless prose that is at once timeless and still--quiescent but vital, and fuses the past, the present, and the future into one of those adjoining tunnels that link and span the generations and themes. Language, as McCann describes it in the novel, is a tool to express ideas and also a challenge to conquer. It is the bridge, but sometimes the fence, between generations and nations.""...how very odd it is to be abandoned by language, how the future demands what should have been asked in the past, how words can escape us with such ease, and we are left, then, only with the pursuit.""This book braids Ireland's struggle with humanity's struggle to free itself from the chains of the past, while acknowledging that those chains annex our future. It is a sublime, extraordinary tale that gradually, very gradually becomes an intimate story about four individual, ordinary women framed by the historic figures that have contributed to big world changes. By the end, it was these four generations of women that moved me most of all. Their stories are seared into my heart. I don't need to tell you anything about them in my .

Land art was a “traceless art” created from leaving an almost invisible line in the road from surging speeds at over 110 mph. “Racing was drawing in time.” Literally and figuratively.This era generated a seminal movement in New York where artistic expression in the subversive sect was animate, inflamed, ephemeral, breathing -- a mix of temporal and performance art and the avant-garde/punk scene. This was also an age of conceptual art, which grew out of minimalism and stressed the artist’s concept rather than the object itself. Time was the concept of Reno’s art, something to be acted upon. “You have time. Meaning, don’t use it, but pass through time in patience, waiting for something to come. Prepare for its arrival. Don’t rush to meet it. Be a conduit…I felt this to be true. Some people might consider this passivity but I did not. I considered it living.”The novel, narrated by Reno, is all about her observation and experiences as she comes of age in a revolutionary time. She lives in a shabby, run-down hole in the wall in New York--“blank and empty as my new life, with its layers upon layers of white paint like a plaster death mask over the two rooms, giving them an ancient urban feeling.”As she gets caught up with the underground movement in the East Village, called Up Against the Wall, Motherfuckers, and later with the Red Brigades of Rome, Reno is herself a conduit for the people she meets and gets involved with, such as her older, rebellious boyfriend, Sandro Valera, son of the Fascist-friendly mogul of Valera motorbikes. Reno came to New York by way of Nevada, eager to demonstrate her art through photography and motorbikes. She’s “shopping for experience.” Sometime after a particularly moving one-night stand, and attempting to navigate her life and bridge her isolation and loneliness, she meets sculptor Sandro Valera and his friends, a group of radicals and artists who offer her exposure to working-class insurrection in this “mecca of individual points, longings, all merging into one great light-pulsing mesh, and you simply found your pulse, your place.” Reno was looking for a sense of identity, and she wanted enchantment.“Enchantment means to want something and also to know, somewhere inside yourself, not an obvious place, that you aren’t going to get it.” The bridge between life and art, and Reno’s invigorating speed of 148 mph on the Bonneville Salt Flats, (where she went with her new friends to make land art), demonstrates the crossover between gestures and reality, and a liberating energy that was “an acute case of the present tense. Nothing mattered but the milliseconds of life at that speed.” On the one hand, Reno seeks self-sovereignty, but on the other hand, she inhabits a male-dominated and often misogynistic landscape where men exploit women for artistic and political gain. When she visits Sandro’s family in Italy, she is subjected to derision by Sandro’s misanthropic brother and his sneering mother. In another scene, a male photographer asks women to punch themselves in the face until they are battered, and then pose for him. Reno narrates this with an unemotional but subtle raillery, noting the incongruity of women on a pretense of independence. She acutely observes that “certain acts, even as they are real, are also merely gestures.” And, in Rome, the question of feminine mystique versus male dominance is addressed by a Red Brigade revolutionary radio broadcaster, when he states to women that “Men connect you to the world, but not with your own self.” Are women “meant to speed past, just a blur” as Reno speculates? And the more I think about that line, the more paradox it evokes.Artists, dreamers, terrorists, comrades, iconoclasts, all populate this novel, replete with iconic images and fallen debris in a swirl of electrical momentum. New York and Rome aren't just scenic backdrops; they come alive as provocateurs-- firebrand cities with flame-throwing agitators.Kushner is a heavyweight writer, a dense, volatile and sensuous portraitist of the iconographic and the obscure. Arch and decisive moments throughout the novel heighten the ominous tension that rumbles below the surface, and the reader wholly inhabits the spaces of Reno’s consciousness, and those of the people she meets.“All you can do is involve yourself totally in your own life, your own moment…And when we feel pessimism crouching on our shoulder like a stinking vulture…we banish it, we smother it with optimism. We want, and our want kills doom. That is how we’ll take the future and occupy it like an empty warehouse. It’s an act of love, pure love. It isn’t prophecy. It’s hope.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,not set,Mar 2013,"Mar 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15803141-the-flamethrowers

It symbolizes the cyclic nature of the universeThe snake devouring its tail is an ancient symbol of wholeness, infinity, renewal, and eternal return. It symbolizes the cyclic nature of the universe, creation out of destruction, life after death. Likewise, the famous Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, advanced the concept of the Shadow self, the parts of your self that are hidden from society. The process of becoming whole, psychically, is to integrate the unconscious (Shadow) and conscious selves, through deep meditation, dreams, or long journeys that build awareness.If this seems too much of an academic introduction to the brilliantly epochal novel by Kate Atkinson, it is also a reference to the finely calibrated structure and themes of life...after life. Atkinson time travels her narrative back to Feb 11, 1910, repeatedly, so that her protagonist, Ursula Todd, can return again and again to rebirth and renewal. Right from the beginning, Ursula dies quickly after birth. Then she returns. Dies rather quickly again. In subsequent lives, she may take longer to die. But through each of these lives, we learn a lot more about Ursula. And, so does Ursula learn more about herself. For example, after a tragedy in one life, Ursula tends to feel a sense of something, or a chill, when the tragedy is coming close in the next life, and can often do something to prevent its reocurrence, even though she is not quite sure why she is doing it.Atkinson did it with such holographic clarity that I wondered how it had not been done a thousand times before in literature. If I searched for similarly structured movies, however, GROUNDHOG DAY and BUTTERFLY EFFECT would come to mind as cousins, perhaps.There is certainly a purpose to this structure, but it isn't mechanical or expeditious. You may be scratching your head, wondering as you read, but you will settle in before long. The novel is so dynamic, and initially winsome (and subtly tongue-in-cheek), that you feel in the bosom of it, not at arm's length or outside the story. Is it a gimmick? No, it is the anchor. It doesn't seem segmented or choppy; rather, it all integrates, like Jung's concept.Ursula's darkness penetrates to a metaphysical undertaking, and the reader is side by side with her odyssey. The author captures Ursula's moments of life-to-death-to-life enchantingly, yet poignantly, and the cycles nourish the theme of the story. Those in-between moments of life and death pique reader understanding, too. Her frequent returns don't feel repetitive, because Atkinson brings acuity and new observations for the reader to ponder.""...she could feel the shining, luminous world beyond calling, the place where all mysteries would be revealed. The darkness enveloped her, a velvet friend. Snow was in the air, as fine as talcum, as icy as the east wind on a baby's skin...""The author also weaves in penetrating allusions to the unconscious mind within the chaos, destruction and detritus of war. The settings(s) of the novel preside like a primary character, one in which repeated experience manifests deeper understanding. Like Ursula, I am inclined to return, time and again, and let the pages encircle me into the ""black bat of darkness"" and the snow blazing white of day.""Time isn't circular.

A very young, pregnant German woman is separated from her husband, who is stationed in North Africa during World War II. She is staying in Rome, in a guest room in a hospital for the elderly, run by German nuns in what seems to be the Prati neighborhood, between Vatican City and the historic center. Her obstetrician instructs her to ""walk, young lady, walk"" for the health of the child, soon to be born.Margaret looks forward to these daily constitutions to the Lutheran Gospel on Via Sicilia, and today she is on her way to hear a Bach concert. She considers her beginning and end points as two German islands ""in a sea of Rome,"" a bewildering city, for the most part, to an innocent, devout Protestant. Margaret is terrified to admit thoughts of her own that are not consecrated by the Bible and the Reich.Does Margaret's naiveté shield her from the uncertainty of war? Or does she wrap herself in the flag and confine her catechism to the Bible as a camouflage from doubt? As she walks through the ancient streets of Rome, memories of her past and questions about her future surface and trouble her. There are also divides between what she learned about Brotherly Love from her preacher father, and the message from Hitler's Germany.New ideas threaten to shift her current perspective--or at least question it, such as the German position on war, the attitude toward Jews and Italians, and whether her station and circumstances are propitious or unfortunate. Moreover, she worries whether she should explore other views or scrutinize the authority of the principles/morals/values she's been taught. Some ideas circle around, generating more powerful internal conflicts as they materialize, and threaten to shake her resolve. And throughout is her concern about her husband, Gert, whose letters she holds sacred.And Margaret walks, and crosses the Tiber via the Ponte Margherita, smiling at the name of the bridge. The obelisks on Piazza del Popolo and the sculptures with the lion fountains provoke more memories, as well as thoughts about the strength of the city--the Eternal City that has survived many wars--and is older than Christ himself. The Christian cross at the tip of the obelisks comforts her, in that ""the Christian symbol triumphed over the heathen one."" The circumlocution of her thoughts has its own logic, which includes her benevolence toward the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, because Martin Luther, the great Protestant, had once stayed there. And why were there so many eagles in Rome? They looked softer here, less stern than the German eagles.This is a story of contemplation, all told in one sentence. However, despite the Joycean title, this is written in a gentle, poetic, accessible style. The frequent paragraphs prevent weariness and provide white space, and the natural pauses are inherent and organic. Jamie Bulloch's translation from the German is superb. (I don't speak German, but can sense a clunky or awkward translation.) This is a seamless narrative of a stroll through the streets of Rome, as well as a sensitive, soulful sojourn of a mother as a young woman. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Feb 24, 2013","Feb 27, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7893693-portrait-of-the-mother-as-a-young-woman

In both books, there are common themes and figures that propel the action. The lawman has dents in his goodness, and the outlaw has goodness in his dents.

He’ll steal some stash for his boss, return to Coronado, and start a new life. Redemption. Hope. Desire. Be a good dad, forge a new future, and bury the tragedies of the past. But…It don’t come easy. You know it don’t come easy. That last job gets botched. Blood stands out on the dingy landscape. Bodies pile up; morals waver; hope is a four-letter word. ""The thought of death still circling him, as it always did, high up like a vulture on the wind.""The tragic death of Ray’s wife left a lot of living victims in its wake. His son, Billy, deaf and mute since the day his mother died in front of him. And Ray’s cousin, Tom Herrera, the ex-sheriff, who is equal parts hollow and shame since turning in his badge ten years ago. Ray’s father is now father to Ray’s boy. Things were quiet, until Ray decided to try and come home with ten years of blood on his hands.Urban Waite can set a mood and tone as shadowy and ethereal as Cormac McCarthy. However, where he didn’t succeed is in giving the reader fertile characters. Ray is especially uninteresting, unlike the main outlaw in TERROR OF LIVING. What you see is what you get—a pathetic scumbag with nothing to mitigate his loser qualities as a human being. He wants. He wants. And Tom, who you root for, doesn’t root for himself enough, and after a while you just want to pity him.If you like a blood bath—or two or three, you will get a tub’s worth. And a lot of other rank characters, as well as a brave and honest lady sheriff, a few geezers, some drunks, and other local color.

Kate carries memories of the two poignant years she spent here as a child while her father was dying at home in the states. Unresolved issues of loss and longing intertwine with her complicated new circumstances. Beguiled by the sharp, shrewd, imperious Lydia, Kate serves as her disciple, with an earnest enthusiasm to please. Lydia’s British husband, Clarence, is a gallant, fatherly history scholar, and puts Kate at ease immediately. As time passes, Kate gets glimpses of a canny and cunning dynamic in their spousal relationship. However, she feels culpable, too, as she had already begun a clandestine love affair with Olivier, their unbalanced and beautiful daughter’s (Portia) boyfriend. Naïve to where she stands in the frame of her new life, Kate aches to be in the social whirl of Lydia’s urbane list of celebrity friends--Umberto Eco, Salman Rushdie, Samuel Beckett, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, to name a few. The chic restaurants and rare wines, the bohemian ideas and erudite philosophies, the culture and cultivation of art, photography, and music—she is stimulated by all of it. At first, Kate feels like the sanctioning observer of the vanguard--or the dog walker and errand girl. But as she becomes more confident in her job, makes friends of her own, and reconnects with her cousin, Etienne, (who she hadn’t seen in a decade), she begins to mature and experiment, and life gets more convoluted—and, at times, precarious.As the psychological games between Lydia and Clarence intensify, Kate becomes mired in more than one triangulating web of deceit and treachery. She arrived in the city earnest and amorphous, eager to engage in contemporary Paris and its au courant sophistication. Dabbling in paint without a decisive style, she longed to achieve a sense of self, integral and contoured, with Lydia and Clarence as her mentors. Consequently, she learns that in order to live an authentic life, she needs to stand squarely in the center of her own design.Heyl’s narrative is poised and sharply observant, without the missteps so common with many debut novels. It’s written in a deceptively breezy style, accessible but substantial, expressive and informal. Along the way, you will be taken on an appetizing tour through the Parisian streets, cafes, museums and shops. The piquant aromas of local cuisine fluttered through the pages as it rhapsodized over chestnut croissants and savory crêpes. Whether you’ve ever been to Paris or plan to visit soon (like me), you will feel like a local flâneur as you stride with Kate in this spirited coming-of-age tale. You’ll reap lessons in French, and life, in any language....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,Feb 2013,"Feb 06, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15015015-lessons-in-french

If you would like to measure this book's worth based on a  from someone who has been before, then skip this one. However, I think there is something valid to be said for a Paris newbie trying to navigate unknown territory through a guidebook.I originally thought that first order of business was finding a hotel. However, I realized later, after learning more about Paris, that I wanted location to be my primary factor, as my husband and I are budget-minded, for time as well as money. Next order of business was determining what part of Paris I wanted to stay.After reading this guide, (and other literature, too), I winnowed it down to the Marais and The Latin Quarter. Finally, after reading more, I determined that The Latin Quarter was for us, and found a budget but high-rated hotel. I like the concise but well-considered detailed comments in every hotel description. For the hotel I chose, I read that there was a big difference between the renovated and non-renovated rooms. So, when I emailed them, I was able to be specific. I began every email with ""Bonjour"" and used a few French words sprinkled throughout, mostly the pleasantries that Fodor's recommends. The host country appreciates a few pleasantries in their language! Wouldn't we, too?A few choice words go a long way, Fodor's book states. Fodor's is all about etiquette and intelligent travel, a balance between culture engagement and seeing those tourist attractions you have always wanted to see.By the way, although this guidebook didn't specifically state, it is better to email or call the hotel directly. Don't make reservations through third parties such as Venere, Obitz, etc. I do look at Trip Advisor s, but I book with the hotel itself. For one thing, third party booking does not give you a better deal. They make you pay in advance, with no possibility of cancellation or change. And just try to call and talk to someone after you've booked third party--you will be on hold and listening to prompts ad nauseum. You can get just as good of a deal--and much better service!-- with the hotel itself for advance pay stays--most of them offer it. But, I was making reservations 6-9 months in advance, and wanted the option of changing my mind if another, better hotel revealed itself. Anyway, emailing the hotels directly made me feel much more in control of the outcome. Fodor's guide gives you the website and phone numbers of the hotels they recommend. They also place a star or write ""Best Bets"" for the highly recommended.Fodor's breaks down Paris, for the sake of doable tourism (and what is naturally present), into geographical areas within the 20 arrondisements. Any guide book for Paris is going to be detailed and dense, even overwhelming, because you know you can't possibly go everywhere unless you are going to live there for a vast amount of time. The pictures are lovely, the pages high quality, and it was easier than some of the other guidebooks to navigate. They also include some decent maps to help get you started. Moreover, the metro/RER info is in here, as well as some limited info on buses and high-speed trains (not as detailed as Rick Steve's guide, but you are informed about how to get schedules).I check-marked many of the Best Bets/starred attractions that compelled me, such as Île de la Cité, home of the beautiful stained glass church, La Saint-Chapelle (especially if you come at sunset or a bright sunny day), and the Notre Dame. Fodor's photos of these places are beautiful. Information on when it is open and closed, and whether a Museum Pass works, is always stated on church/museums descriptions.Other places that are a must for me are Père Lachaise Cemetery, the Catacombs, the Caranavalet Museum (Paris' History museum), the writers tour through the Latin Quarter--including Shakespeare and Co book store!--and a Marais stroll. And the cobbled streets of Montmartre. I want to turn into a flâneur for the Paris trip, and walk everywhere and combine spontaneity with itinerary. I may skip the expensive (stores) and crowded Champs-Élysées, other than to stroll to the Arc de Triomphe.The meat of this book is fantastic. All the recommended places are emboldened, and many have a page or two or three of their own, describing the place, or eatery, or museum, etc. You can cross reference with the index. Again, the book is separated into areas: The Islands, Around the Eiffel Tower, The Champs-Élysées, Louvre area (Rive Droite or Right Bank), Les Grandes Boulevards, Montemarte, The Marais, Eastern Paris, The Latin Quarter (Rive Gauche or Left Bank), Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Montparnasse, and Western Paris.Fodor's highly recommends getting a Museum Pass, if not to save money, then to avoid the long lines getting in. The Eiffel doesn't accept the pass, but you can actually make a reservation and avoid the wait. Dusk or early morning has fewer people, and early morning is actually recommended for many of the museums (or after 5, on the days they stay open late). The Louvre, as well as many other museums, is closed on Tuesday. If you want to take a day trip to Versailles, don't go on Tuesdays, as it is more crowded then. And don't go to Versailles on Mondays, as it is closed. Musée d'Orsay is also closed on Mondays. Speaking of--the d'Orsay isn't so humongous as the Louvre, and it is in a charming old converted train station. It is filled with Impressionist art. Fodor's also shows you where the Impressionist art is in the Louvre, if that is your thing.There is art everywhere you walk or drive. There's a taxi tour, if you'd like to get an overview, or the Batobus, where you get on and off the river bus on specific spots, and several 1-2 hour boat tours on the Seine, or the Canal St Martin. Fodor's lists walking, bus, river, and taxi tours, as well as bike tours, from the budget-minded to the fancy. There's quite a comprehensive list.As far as eateries, there are plenty in here. Fodor's does warn about the expensive and often mediocre food in the touristy areas of the Latin Quarter. Paris, although brimming with delicious food, is also spilling over with mediocre fare, too. Unlike Rome, where it is hard to get a bad meal, you have to be careful in Paris. Fodor's helps you through the maze. Something I read in Rick Steve's that stuck with me: If a restaurant has a menu posted in seven languages, avoid it! And it is expensive to eat in Paris. Ne way around it is to go to a boulangerie (for bread) and buy a bottle of wine at a grocer's or little shop, and sit at the park, like the lovely Luxembourg Gardens, and eat while you people-watch, and maybe grab a puppet-show there if you come on the right days.I definitely plan to cross the Pont Saint-Louis bridge to Île Saint-Louis, walk around the quays and maybe even watch the sunset there (a suggestion from a book I read by flâneur David Downie, called Paris, Paris, who said watching the sunset here is heaven). And, get an ice-cream cone at the delicious Berthillon.Fodor's gives price tags--$ to $$$$$, on hotels, eateries, shops, even transportation and phone calls, so this book is helpful whatever your budget.Besides the major chapters on sights, I was also impressed with the many details that are helpful to a tourist. For instance--and this is important--purchases. You are charged a VAT tax of about 19.5%, so if you buy a scarf for 100 euros, add 20%. However, if you spend roughly 185 euros in the same shop, you are eligible for a VAT refund. Fodor's goes into detailed explanation on how to do this. The important thing I learned is that, if possible, when buying souvenirs, try to find a shop that you can ring up that amount, if you are planning on spending several hundred, anyway. Tips like that are wonderful. You are also given numbers for emergency medical help, what to do if credit cards or passport is stolen (but always keep copies of your passport in each piece of luggage!)Want to know where the bathrooms are? Fodor's gives us the website of The Bathroom Diaries--well, actually, that is one of their errors. They gave the wrong website, but I was able to find the right one by googling ""Bathroom Diaries."" The other very small error I found was re Hotel des Bains in Montparnasse. Fodor's states there is no online booking, but there is, actually. It was one of the hotels I almost booked.This  is getting long, but I can't help it! There is so much I want to share already, just from reading this book. At times, I get what I call a giggle-shudder, when I feel transported to Paris, just from imagining the places that Fodor's talks about and frequently photographs. I am trying to reconcile myself to the fact that I can't see everything. I don't have time to spend two weeks or even two full days at the Louvre, not if I want to explore widely. So I am bookmarking some specific art pieces that Fodor's recommends. Truly, I don't even care about the Mona Lisa, where the crowds are apt to be insane. There is so much art there, I may just walk aimlessly and gaze and stand in front of these great pieces that are everywhere, including the Garden, located between the Louvre and the Place de la Concorde.So many beautiful gardens in Paris! Cafes; bars; patisseries; chocolate shops; windy, cobbled streets; momentous views; lavish opera houses; funky, offbeat museums; clothing stores, including vintage and resale. I plan to take this book with me, as a guide through the exhilarating but sometimes overwhelming City of Lights. I plan on making Paris a place we return to, again and again.Other books I recommend that I have been reading:ParisParis, Paris: Journey into the City of LightRick Steves' Paris 2013 or Rick Steves' Paris 2012...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Oct 2012,"Dec 06, 2012","Dec 06, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11300309-fodor-s-paris-2012

It gripMeg Wolitzer’s captivating new novel, set in the bustle and exuberance of New York, is a panoramic and epic drama, but a sleeper kind of epic. It gripped me by degrees, opening rather conventionally and then gradually seducing me with a fertile character development and realistic, original story. She penetrates the messiness of human lives with a spotless narrative that feels both familiar and singular. If you are drawn to human drama, you’ll soon be thoroughly hooked. This is surely the crown of Wolitzer’s writing career.Six teenagers meet at a co-ed arts camp in the Berkshires in 1974 and remain in touch through the years (up to the present). A few become close intimates, and all of them maintain a lifelong bond. They each have a creative talent that they endeavor to nurture--dance, animation, architecture, theater, music. Art/creativity is the altar at which most of them strive and sacrifice to achieve artistic grace and ingenuity. But some are more successful than others in translating a talent into a career, and in identifying the difference between desire and aptitude. Although THE INETRESTINGS is an ensemble piece, aspiring stage actress, Jules Jacobson, stands out as the moral touchstone of the novel. We wholly inhabit her head and heart. Although her life is the most recognizably routine, she resonates acutely in the narrative. Occasionally, she covets her friends’ successes, and she struggles at times to be charitable in her thoughts, but in spite of herself, Jules possesses an incorruptible archness and mettle. Artistically, she aims for a Lucille Ball comic timing, but her delivery promptly falls flat. Awkward and spontaneous, she has a tough and vulnerable elasticity that fuels the story. She’s injured, imperfect, but even at her most astray, there’s something of the shepherdess in her.Waifish Ash Wolf, the Yale-bound dramatic actress, is sister to Goodman, the robustly masculine but lugubrious, lazy, wannabe architect. They come from privileged roots, and their NY apartment and cultured parents become a meeting place for the six friends during off-camp season.Ethan Figman, homely and flat-nosed, is nevertheless the ambassador of the group, and the most obviously talented. His Fig Land animation/characters demonstrate the work of a genius. Jonah Bay is the son of a famous, Judi Collins-like folksinger. He has delicately attractive features, and is quiet and thoughtful, but troubled.Cathy Kiplinger--full-breasted and extroverted, and fearlessly sexy, came to the camp on scholarship, and dreams of a career in dance.A seventh main character emerges, an outsider who becomes an insider, and even eclipses some of the primary group of six, but I don’t want to give anything away by even naming him or her. However, it is from this person that a new perspective of the group and its bond are viewed. The book’s power is both its sweeping scope and the magnification of everyday life. It is best to read this novel without any preparation or peek inside.Distinctly drawn characters propel the action. You will forget that there is an author between you and the story, because rather than being “notified,” the reader sharply observes the coalescing of the characters' individual natures and the connection between the friends. There’s no skipping to contrived plot points, and the story never intrudes with an authorial voice. Both stout and potent, the narrative doesn’t rely on gimmicks or typical arcs and milestones. You engage through an accretion of details and everyday events, rather than through trumped-up epiphanies. However, one seismic event causes tremors and fissures that divide some characters and bring others together. We engage more and more as time passes and the characters grow. Ambition, desire, success, jealousy, and envy shape the mortal coils of friendship, love, and loyalty, and figure importantly in the story, as do coming to terms with strengths and limitations. Moreover, mental health issues are addressed with keen awareness and insight. Much of the novel is a fluent progression of days and moments, strung brilliantly together. As observers, we get a ground view, and occasionally a bird’s eye view of events, but we inhabit the narrative as if we are inside the story. The novel goes back and forth in time with a fluid and seamless momentum that kept me turning the pages well into the wee hours of the night. Consummately satisfying, interesting, and more.A+...more",Notes are private!,0,154,1,"Jan 23, 2013",not set,"Nov 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15815333-the-interestings

It is also the book's principal motif, surfacing periodically to describe Nora's various attributes as an uncharacteristically plain woman, a woman who doesn't rock any boats or shine like a supernova-- one who is always nice, mannerly, and unthreatening to others. Essentially, anonymous and invisible. Nora has previously accepted this about herself, living up to the part with emblematic virtuosity!Unfortunately, this Woman Upstairs quality also tends to create a two-dimensional figure to others, a woman easily dismissed and placed in a mold, or a bin--conventionally boring, predictable, and reliably bland. But, now, at 37, she is haunted by that Marianne Faithful song about Lucy Jordan,""`At the age of 37 she realized she would never ride through Paris in a sports car, with the warm wind in her hair...' "" (Remember that song from Thelma and Louisa? It does make me think of someone on the brink)Now is ""The time at which you have to acknowledge that your life has a horizon... that you will never be president, or a millionaire, and if you're a childless woman, you will quite possibly remain that way.""One day, Nora meets Reza Shahid, a student of mixed heritage. His Parisian artist mother, Sirena, is of Italian descent and his Lebanese father, Skandar, is an intellectual and Ethics Historian. They recently moved to the Boston area from Paris. Nora is immediately drawn into their world and attracted to them, as a family and as individuals. Nora is single and childless, and thinks of Reza as she would a son. He is shy and also quite stunning.So, Nora has finally met the contrast to her ordinariness, a worldly, charismatic family of three, which, enigmatically, turns Nora's quiet desperation to a barely controlled, boiling rage. We don't know where all this rage is coming from, at first. That is part and parcel of the immaculate pacing and architecture of this novel, a narrative so deftly chilling that I think my head stood up on my hairs!Throughout the book, Nora attempts to elucidate to the reader her deep love for all members of the Shahid family, and feels inadequate to do so without worrying that she falls into a clichéd description. She is often on the brink of expressing her profound feelings to Sirena and Skandar, which creates a marvelous reader tension as we bide our time, anticipating what Nora will convey, and how she will convey it. But the reader is constantly privy to her feelings:""Just because something is invisible doesn't mean it isn't there. At any given time, there are a host of invisibles floating among us...[W]ho sees the invisible emotions, the unrecorded events? Who is it that sees love, more evanescent than any ghost, let alone catch it?""Nora and Sirena rent a warehouse together as a space for working on their art. Sirena does installation art, with the names right out of fairy tales and myths. Her current project is Wonderland. To describe Sirena's art--well, you could write a book about it, it is so florid, philosophical, and full of gimmicks and tricks. For example, she would create a world that appeared to be of lush gardens with visions of paradise, a fantasy for us to interpret. But, up close, you would see it is made of garbage and mottled by filth. Her installations limn the line between fantasy and reality, and are vast, expansive. Sirena is on the precipice of artistic success.Nora's art, on the other hand, is miniature, and exacting, and insular. She uses historical facts and pictures to piece together dioramas representing the rooms of famous people like Virginia Woolf and Emily Dickinson, choosing ripe moments and themes from their lives--such as Woolf's rocks to commit suicide, and Dickinson's obsession with death. Only Edie Sedgwick's room would be designed out of the imagination, the only piece of her art that had a parallel to Sirena's imaginative art--exemplifying that line between fantasy and reality.There are numerous other motifs that resonate, such as Nora depicting life like a Fun House--at once zany and terrifying. Not really fun at all. We read excerpts of Nora revisiting her childhood, which will explain some of her covetousness, and reticence. At this time in her life, she hasn't had a real passion, not for anything or anyone. All was sacrificed or quashed, in favor of becoming...The Woman Upstairs.The prose is potent, humid, and allusional. And Messud makes it both provocative and claustrophobic, writing with an inflammatory formality that personifies Nora's rage burning within her meager existence. There's very little plot, but you will be on the edge of your seat, compelled.

His sister, Bec, the near-altruist scientist, does not want to forgive her father's assassin.Val Oatmen, a strident newspaper editor and Bec's ex-fiance, wants to punish people who are immoral or who have embarrassing mistakes in their past. His weapon of choice is exploitation and an amoral intimidation plan to achieve ""Gotcha!""Behaviorally, the action of the book (and characters) is tragically madcap and outrageously tender. The absurdity of a Kafka-esque social environment thrives in a tide of Weltschmerz. Most people in the story are blessed with formidable intelligence and/or shrewdness, but their world-weary knowingness and naivete clash. Jaded perceptions often underscore actions. Would you throw a family member under the bus to save your own hide from public shame and legal ramifications? Here are some characters with no backbone, some with no independent thought, mixed with ethical pioneers of progress, and peppered with visionaries who would willingly sacrifice others or themselves for the cause.Matthew is ruled by his servitude to Christ and his Uncle Harry worships the sovereignty of science. And, snap, those two can go at it, and we see the emotional implosions this causes. The novel reads like a psychological thriller--he who has the best morals wins! Maybe.The acerbic tone is mitigated by a few people who break through cynicism and actually love each other, and want to make a team of two and do their personal best not just for themselves, but for the world-at-large. An Aspergers-like young scientist and a donor for the malaria cause find their way to each other, meshing their dreams and smarts together. Meanwhile, what is a 40-something doing chasing a fifteen-year-old?Humanists and sociopaths alike people this novel. Meek isn't wimpy about featuring villains authentically and robustly or pushing the envelope to the edges of human purpose and motivation. The central theme is about morality, but Meek doesn't rub our noses in it to prove an authorial point. Whether you are a cautionary tale or a noble martyr, you are not exempt from the mortal coil of pain and loss, suffering and obstinacy, and the Hail Mary hope of earthly or spiritual salvation.The prose here is the first thing that reminded me of Franzen, a combination of frank and cheeky, with some winding, exuberantly long sentences just shy of purple, but controlled and fruit-bearing. He digresses with philosophical pathways, always bringing the reader back to the original point, or he shows us the paradox of judgment by way of demonstrating the error of statistics.""Suppose we find out that everyone in the city who wears a red hat has gone crazy and is sabotaging the city's water supply. So we find a way to go in and put all the red-hatted citizens to sleep, and the water supply's safe. But then we find out these red-hatted saboteurs, as well as vandalizing the pipes, were the ones who were delivering bread around the city. So we've saved the city from being poisoned, but now we have to stop it starving.""Meek looks at old and new ideas from all sides, provoking the reader to arrive at unexpected conclusions about the moral environment. There's a little melodrama thrown in, but it is folded in with finesse, keeping the believability on tap and fluidly organic. This ranks on my top ten of the year, an impeccably measured howl of shame, a shrieking inside a whisper, a wolf in sheep's clothing, coming to swallow you whole with a smile....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Sep 2012,"Oct 05, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/14757050-the-heart-broke-in

Although it is challenging to inhabit the surreal and anthropomorphic narrative, the best way to read this is to let go and allow the lyrical juxtapositions to open up your senses. The book's poetic but brutally beautiful passages are delicately spun and dream-like. Rodoreda's eerie brand of magical realism vanquishes the literal world while permeating it with resounding effect. Again, I can't stress enough that you must be willing to capitulate to Rodoreda and curb any tendency to gain dominion over the narrative.As you open to the first page, you are introduced to the fourteen-year-old narrator--who, by the way, is neither coy nor child-like, who becomes an adult at the end of Part Two (of Four). He's trying to reconcile his community's savagery with his limited and insulated worldview. The cloistered village of Maraldina he lives in is suspended perilously over craggy rocks that span over a river, whose current both cleanses and destroys. Annually, by lottery, a young man is chosen to swim the dark length of river under the village, which results in death or mutilation.Legend has it that this fable-like town was born out of desire, at the river where two shadows joined at the mouth. Now, the townspeople must root out ardent longing with ruthless, barbaric practices, the most inhumane customs imaginable. When you die, you are entombed in a tree. During your last breaths, your mouth is filled with cement to prevent your soul from flying out. There's a prisoner, forced to neigh like a horse, who is also a source of wisdom that the citizens both clamor to hear and yet defile. Pregnant women are blindfolded, so that their sons will look like their fathers. The liturgy of violence is relentless, the bleak mood underscored and yet transcended by Rodoreda's exquisite prose.Early on it is apparent that the novel is a metaphor for oppression. Comparisons to THE LOTTERY are the most obvious at first, but the style and focus and depth are completely different. Jackson's citizens pay blind obedience to tradition--the power of the crowd subverts the individual. Rodoreda's novel illustrates allegiance to a town's customs of ritualized violence, too, but the citizens possess an individual, smug moral certainty. Sanctioned violence is executed with self-righteous authority.Death and decay entwine with the natural bloom and symmetry of the environment, a pulchritude that twists around its tragedies. The winding wisteria is potently aromatic, and grows to wrench up houses; bees have a menacing consciousness; soap bubbles morph to glass.""I stopped by the edge of the river and covered my ears with my open hands so I would not hear the quiet. I crossed the river again, swimming underwater because the bee was following me: I would have killed it if I could. I wanted it to be lost and alone in the dog roses where spiders lay in wait for it. On the other side of the river, I left behind the odor of caterpillar-engorged leaves and encountered the fragrance of wisteria and the stench of manure. Death in spring.""What a terrifying, disorienting, horrible, elegant story of exile, hope, and despair. Rodoreda's story has its genesis in her own experience, living as a Catalonian under the Fascist rule of Franco and later as an exile in France. Other writers, such as Carolina de Robertis, Junot Diaz, and Milan Kundera, have drawn from their personal experiences as citizens under regimes of terror. However, Rodoerda is largely unrecognized in the English speaking community. Martha Tennent exquisitely translated this book into English in 2009. Unforgettable and utterly bewitching, DEATH IN SPRING is alive with devastating and furious beauty--a mad, inflamed, yet crushingly nuanced allegory of atrocity, told with astonishing humanity....more",Notes are private!,1,56,1,"Sep 26, 2012",Oct 2012,"Sep 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6405181-death-in-spring

Laurel Nicholson, a successful actress in her sixties, reflects back to her teen years in the 1960’s and a crime she witnessed her mother, Dorothy (now ninety and dying), commit outside their Greenacres farmhouse. The Blitz years’ sections belong to Dorothy, which Laurel pieces together from scraps of memorabilia that her mother possesses. It opens up to the reader as Dorothy’s story, primarily. As Laurel and her siblings gather for Dorothy’s last days, the reader follows the trail of clues revealed through memories, inquiry, and Laurel’s amateur sleuthing. As the pages turn, we get more involved and intrigued by the intertwined lives of Dorothy, a woman from Dorothy’s past named Vivien (and Vivien’s husband, Henry Jenkins), and Dorothy’s former beau, Jimmy.The most engaging aspect of this book is the smooth narrative and the intimate voices of the past and present. Morton creates characters that stand out, especially those from the WW II period. Dorothy is a complex woman trying to carve a future from the fear and impermanence that wartime creates. You can fairly hear the explosions in the background. Vivien is an enigmatic woman who never ceases to pique the reader’s interest, and her husband, Henry, the celebrated author, adds to the curiosity. Jimmy, the photographer and Dorothy’s love interest, is the moral center. What kind of relationship did Dorothy and Vivien have? Were they friends, or adversaries, or mere acquaintances? There’s a photo of them standing together, emanating defiance and daring. But the more the photo is brought to light, the more the women in the picture elude Laurel.Laurel is driven and defined by the answers she seeks more than her life as an actress, which is secondary to the story. Although there is a murder mystery, it reads as a family saga. She decides to engage her scientist brother, who was there when the tragedy happened, (in his mother’s arms—as a toddler) to help her solve the answer to their mother’s secret. But first, Laurel has to tell him how she witnessed the scene from her hiding place in the tree house, watching while her mother placed the heirloom knife next to the birthday cake, readying for a family celebration, while Laurel dreamed the dreams of a typical yet gifted sixteen-year-old, secluded from the main action of her family and the outsider who intruded.As a family and historical drama, it was often engrossing. However, Morton did not surprise me with the big disclosures, or catch me off guard, although she clearly intended to keep us guessing. It was less about my fortuitous abilities and more about Morton's transparency. I read a  of her first book that stated she tipped her hand too soon and too conspicuously, which is done here, also.

It will strike you as either timeless or time-worn. There are few surprises in the storyline; it is definitely the journey, not the destination, that matters, and the perennial themes of love, betrayal, and desire. Moreover, the significance of memory is the lodestar that makes this book shine, subtly so. Love triangles are common in novels; this one has a familiar Gatsby quality. The narrator is the odd man out, the even fourth--the outsider who is also an insider whose self-contained status is crumbling. Set in Southampton in contemporary times, its Gatsby shadow rifts through the pages. Dubow’s characters are molded from Fitzgerald’s, then nuanced for his own tale, and persist as realistic and dimensional. Their fates have an intimate, in-the-room proximity, and the reader is emotionally present, sensing the breath of the author’s words and seeing a vivid reflection of an ineluctable mercy.The narrator, Walter, is a well-heeled, monkish lawyer, and best friends to lovely couple Harry and Maddy Winslow, and godson to their young son, Johnny. Harry is an esteemed writer working on his third novel, having a few problems getting started. As Walter narrates the story, which includes yet another outsider, radiant young Claire, the plot is anticipated. However, a steady tension and suspense grow, despite the ordinary framework. The taut pacing and lean beauty of the narrative, as well as the inner dialogue and philosophical reflections, carry the reader forward. The prose is sleek, clean, and terse, the descriptions scintillating and vital.“Life is a series of remembered impressions. A smell, a touch, a sunset, carved angels in a cathedral, the death of a parent. We cannot take in everything we see, so we make sense of what we can, using these fragments to make up a whole. Patterns emerge, sometimes randomly; sometimes they mislead. Sometimes they reveal the truth.”The heat of the story is contained within those vibrant lines—individual and shared memories seen through the lens of Walter’s perceptions. Some events are creations out of the ashes, or of moments not witnessed. Walter is the eye and ear of others in the story, a subjective observer. At times, his memories are fragments, remote or fading, tugging at him, captured from the ether, shared with the willing reader.Dubow’s dialogue is his one weakness, often stilted and clichéd, but is more than compensated for in the whole of the text, the lyric and rhythm of the passages. It’s a sob and sigh story, sentimental at intervals but not treacly.

She is also harboring a dark past, which periodically clouds her sleep, emotional clarity, and her thoughts. Told in the first person, she states that her social skills are a bit off (but I don’t see that, only that she tells us), and that she struggles mightily with a challenging mental illness, which is revealed in gradual doses. Fi is currently investigating a case involving the heinous murder of a woman and her young daughter. The bodies were found in a dicey part of town, where they were living, but the mother possessed a credit card of a wealthy businessman who died in a plane crash. Thrown in the mix are prostitutes, a dirty cop, and other typical tropes from the world of crime/police procedurals. Fi is also grappling with reaching out to others, opening up to new friendships and romance.As a crime thriller, this didn’t keep me interested. The events were too expository, and only occurred through Fi’s second-hand communication, but I didn’t feel inside of the action, and, to be honest, the action that did happen was derivative of hundreds of other police thrillers. The events were banal, and had a shopworn feel to it. The pace also crawled. I never felt one compelling moment in the book. Moreover, Fi’s predilection for talking to the dead, rather than stir my interest, came off as rather flat.What did keep me reading was Fi’s voice, which was warm and intimate and sounded as if it were in the room with me. She enticed me at intervals to continue reading, if for no other reason than to learn more about her emotional history and breakdown. What I didn’t believe was how she got a job in the police department as a detective! Perhaps Wales is more lax than the US, where psychological testing is mandatory for all incoming officers to the police academy. This is the first book in a series that will feature Fi Griffiths as the main character.

ADA and GRAVAll my adult reading life, I waited for a young contemporary writer to transport me to the prose-rich playgrounds of Nabokov and Pynchon. ADA and GRAVITY'S RAINBOW were my torches, but they were, arguably, emotionally sterile. When I read INFINITE JEST ten years ago, I knew I had finally found an author who, besides giving words an elastic, carbonated buoyancy, was a vigorously palpable storyteller, altogether tragic and heartbreaking.I remember the exact moment when I heard that Wallace took his life (as I suspect did everyone who is reading this book, who read DFW before his death). It was like a brother or best friend had died. He was my rock star--my John Lennon, Peter Gabriel, and Bob Dylan all rolled up into literature. He wasn't yesterday's insurgent Kurt Cobain, he was today's voice--the insurrectionist of the insurrection, the anti-ironist and seeker of exigent summits.D.T. Max evinces respect, compassion, and objectivity toward this now lionized author he has never met, in his biography assembled from the contributions of friends, family, lovers, AA comrades, colleagues, fellow writers, and epistolary confidants.""Fiction is what it's like to be a fucking human being,"" Wallace said, and Max shows us the utter turbulence of this writer's life, a man who lived inveterately with the howling fantods (a phrase from his mother, the grammarian, used potently in INFINITE JEST).David was a depressed, addicted, chaotic genius, a man who felt that he never lived up to his lofty ambitions as a writer or a person. He was both fascinated and repulsed by the TV culture and how media hijacks and propagandizes public and private minds--his constant themes in his essays, short stories, and of course, IJ.As many know, he was hospitalized several times for breakdowns and overdoses, and struggled with pervasive suicidal ideation. Max does a virtuous job of giving the reader a candid view of the complex nature of DFW; the generously endowed writer was often a captious, violent, and tormented soul. He was also a passionate, outstanding teacher, and a patron to his companions in AA. Moreover, he was an enthusiastic dog lover, especially drawn to dogs with an abusive past.The parts of the book that describe Wallace's years writing INFINITE JEST were not just revealing, but like a fourth wall nakedly exposed. Max captures the line between author and material with authenticity and revelation. It is almost surreal, as Max brought me back to the narrative of IJ while manifesting Wallace's actual art and pain of writing it. I don't want to spoil it for readers by dropping tidbits of information--reading about it is thrilling and gripping, the most page-turning part of the book.The letters Wallace wrote to Franzen, DeLillo, Costello, and his editor, Michael Pietsch, at Little, Brown, and Company, (and many others), will prickle the skin of any DFW aficionado. He was self-conscious, and self-conscious about being self-conscious, and communicated that in his letters.""I go through a loop in which I notice all the ways I am...self-centered and careerist and not true to standards and values that transcend my own petty interests...but then I countenance the fact here at least here I am worrying about it; so then I feel better about myself...but this soon becomes a vehicle for feeling superior to imagined Others...I think I'm very honest and candid, but I'm also proud of how honest and candid I am--so where does that put me.""This book is a valuable companion to David Lipsky's journalistic book, ALTHOUGH OF COURSE YOU END UP BECOMING YOURSELF, a biography of Lipsky's five days spent with Wallace on his IJ book tour. It is hard to compare them, as Lipsky's is an echo and interpretation of his actual time with DFW, and this book is compiled from sources outside of the biographer. Both have poignant insight into the ephemeral but perennial figure of Wallace.I award four stars, rather than five, although the quality of writing and extensive research is first-rate (despite being almost devoid of familial testimony, and despite errors that I think are typesetting errors, not copy-editing, errors). It's personal. Something is missing, some essence that cannot be filled by a biographer, or hasn't yet-- the unnameable, soulful reflectiveness that I ache for. The closest way to that is through the Harry Ransom Center, which is fortunately only a few miles from my home, which houses David Foster Wallace's entire archive at hand. You can feel the pages while you read what he wrote, with just a slip of a glove separating you from his words.There is something about Wallace fans--it is as if we are all in the same karass, isn't it? But Wallace wanted to relate to us on a cosmic scale, not like an exclusive club, yet he appeals to only select (not elite, but select) readers. If you become a lover of Wallace's work, you feel almost mystically connected to all other lovers of his oeuvre, and however fantastical a presumption, we also feel connected to Wallace, the person. It is apparent that D.T. Max understands this, and that he is bonded to Wallace, also.

Attica Locke demonstrated this in her first crime book, BLACK WATER RISING, (nominated for an Orange Prize in 2009). Once again, she braids controversial social and historical issues with an intense and multi-stranded mystery. Locke artfully informs CUTTING SEASON with the dark corners of our nation’s past and the ongoing prejudices and failures to live up to the enlightened ideals of equality and justice. Her fiction tells the truth through an imaginative storyline, and she enfolds these issues and more in this lush historical novel of murder, racism, and family. The title of the book refers to the season of sugarcane cutting.Between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, a pre-civil war sugar cane plantation, Belle Vie, sits on eighteen acres of land, owned by the affluent Clancy family. The Clancys are descendants of William Tynan, who was hired by the federal government after the civil war to over see the plantation. Tynan did such an outstanding job, he was eventually deeded the land. Converted to a tourist attraction/historic preserve, with restored slave quarters and dramatic re-enactments of plantation life, Bell Vie is also a favorite setting for weddings and other festivities. Caren Gray, a single mother, manages everything at Bell Vie-- the grounds, events, and personnel. Caren also has ties to the early descendants of the plantation, a complex history that unfolds gradually and evocatively. She is the great-great-great granddaughter of a slave named Jason who disappeared under mysterious circumstances, and was never found.Abutting the land to the west sits 500 acres of actively farmed sugar cane, also owned by the Clancy family and run by the Groveland Corporation. Since Groveland started managing the land, the families that worked there for generations were pushed out and replaced by migrant workers.The book starts off with a bang, just like Locke’s earlier book did. On the border between Bell Vie and the sugarcane land, an employee stumbles on a murdered women, a migrant worker. When the local sheriff prematurely accuses a Bell Vie employee with a criminal past, Caren resolves to solve the crime herself. She subsequently learns that there have been sinister shenanigans involving Groveland, including support of the budding political interests of Raymond Clancy. The atmospherics and setting of this novel, as well as the increasing tension and artful story, keep the reader attentive. Locke is not just skillful, but fragrant in describing the landscape of this largely provincial community. Her prose is sensuous and plump, and the visuals are ripe and resonant. “…beneath its loamy topsoil…two centuries of breathtaking wealth and spectacle—a stark beauty both irrepressible and utterly incapable of even the smallest nod of contrition—lay a land both black and bitter, soft to the touch, and pressing in its power. She should have known that one day it would spit out what it no longer had use for, the secrets it would no longer keep.”Like Locke’s first book, the plot is multi-faceted, with subplots often taking center stage and progressively weaving into the main intrigue. The theme centers on the uneasy link between the past and present, and how they must be reconciled. Caren’s desire to protect her child and expose corruption across echoes of time struck a deep chord in me.The pacing is initially taut, although the characterizations gravitate toward standard. I was a bit disappointed in the relationship between Caren and her ex, Eric, because BLACK WATER RISING’s main character, Jay Porter was so arresting—tilted, ambiguous, and most of all, unpredictable. The action between Caren and Eric is stilted, and feels convenient to the arc of the story. However, Caren’s voice is sensitive, intimate, and tenderly portrayed, despite being easily anticipated.As the novel progressed toward the climax, Locke veered to formula. Perhaps she tried too hard to please readers of conventional genre. CUTTING SEASON lumbered as it neared the final moments, becoming too ungainly and stitched together. The past and present fall into place too readily, yet I appreciate what Locke was trying to do in the juxtaposition of time and circumstance. Her intent was poetic; she strove for equanimity, but it got too exorbitant and contrived.Despite these complaints, Locke’s talents are evident on every page. Locke’s sensual approach to language and narrative filters her flaws, mitigating them. The joy of reading comes from being absorbed in Bell Vie and the sumptuous layering of story. There’s a fine line between writing platitudes and conveying an awareness of racial issues and conflicts. Locke is generally nuanced, but she occasionally turned toward heavy-handedness, especially toward the finale. I read that Locke’s third book will be a return to attorney Jay Porter. I am thrilled, as I sensed that the ending left the door open for a continuation. If you like the author’s writing, I urge you to read her first book, a five-star powerhouse of a novel. Although THE CUTTING SEASON didn’t affect me like BLACK WATER RISING, I fully expect her next book to soar. Jay Porter is a fully realized character, more salty and dimensional than Caren Gray....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,Aug 2012,Aug 2012,"Aug 01, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13623785-the-cutting-season

The spirits of the liAfter finally dusting off this book from my shelf, which sat for eight years untouched, I devoured it like an irresistible drug. The spirits of the literature gods, dead and alive, have convened with Mitchell, and Mitchell has embraced the half-seen and the unseen, the lives and half-lives, and the mystical, boundless forces that turn a book into a world, a narrative into a universe. There's as much meaning outside the pages, and between words and passages, as there is in the explicit text--a potent cosmos of orbiting ideas. Mitchell has punched a hole in the sky with this book.That “everyone is connected” is not an original theme of literature. It has been done as prosaically as Coelho or as lofty as Nabokov. Mitchell’s book of six nested stories is a furious and radiant masterpiece of formal structure and polyphonic elasticity, with the universal theme of connection—between generations, geographies, and centuries; people of vastly different ethnicities, cultures, even fabricated clones! From the South Seas of the mid-19th century to the post-apocalyptic future on Hawaii’s islands, Mitchell explores the link between people as much as a thousand years apart in time and an incalculable amount of distance. Our undertakings, our destructions, our sorrow, our humanity, and our imperfections reach across the millennia. What communicates our exertions is our recording of things said and done. “Sunt lacrimae rerum,” writes the protagonist of the second story. The world is a world of tears, and the burdens of mortality touch the heart.The six novellas that comprise the novel are written in ascending and descending order. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. There are great tonal shifts between stories, yet the parts equal the whole. As the narrator of the second novella says about his composition, Cloud Atlas Sextet, for six overlapping soloists (piano, clarinet, cello, flute, violin, and cello), they are “each in its own language of key, scale, and color.” There is much to say about music and the structure of this novel.And, in each story is a character with a comet-shaped birthmark, inferring incarnations of the same soul. The first five titles end in “Half-Lives” (which makes sense because they are only half a story) and the narratives end in a cliffhanger, usually an interrupted sentence or moment. The descending order (or latter half of each novella) pick up the Half Lives where they left off in the ascending stories.Story #1 is written Melville style, about a notary, Adam Ewing, on a ship in the South Seas, who is facing an ugly truth about people and their predatory nature. In story #2, Belgium, 1931, a scheming, disinherited opportunist, Robert Frorbisher, procures a job as an amanuensis to an ailing, syphilitic composer. His narrative is told via letters to his lover, Rufus Sixsmith, Waugh-style. He finds the interrupted journals of Ewing at the composer's house. In the third tale, set in mid-70's California, Luisa Rey, a journalist investigating nefarious activity at a nuclear power plant, is after some sensitive information from physicist Rufus Sixsmith. Luisa also acquires some of the letters that Sixsmith received from Frobisher. Her story has a distinctly Grisham/Chandler style.Story 4 is about a British publisher, Timothy Cavendish, who has a manuscript of the Luisa Rey story, but ends up imprisoned in a nursing home, trying to escape. Very Amis-y in narrative and characters. In the fifth story, Mievillie-ish, set into Korea’s future, the country is ruled by a totalitarian government, or “Corpocracy;” they clone “fabricants” who function without human sentience. When one fabricant, somni 451, develops human consciousness, her life becomes endangered. This is an era where words like starbucks and disney aren’t proper nouns anymore. Somni is charmed by an archived disney from the 21st century called The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish. The central story, #6, is whole, and the hardest to read (linguistically), where Somni is revered as a kind of enigmatic god-spirit. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world far, far into the future, where humans have reversed to a primitive or Iron Age state. The language is a sort of Twain-esque Pidgin. It takes a while for the dialect and colloquy to make sense, but the effort is worth the reward. Six places, six times, six vocabularies--in one choate, mind-twisting tale. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma (as Churchill would say), and obscured by clouds (as Pink Floyd would sing). There's always treacherous forces coming to annihilate us, manmade and cowardly; there are also moral, stouthearted, everyday flawed heroes with fugitive wings and incorruptible souls. We endure, and we endure, and we endure. We touch one another.

However, when you start reading, you realize that you are in the hands of an evocative, acutely observant writer who may, in the not-too distant future, pen a novel that earns a spot on the Booker long-list. She can turn a phrase, spin raw into bold, scour us with prose.Ashworth writes searchingly, hauntingly, and meticulously about teenage restiveness and jealousy; growing up with a mentally unstable parent; how the media erects false monuments; predators and predatory nature; and the inner lives of people short-circuited by guilt and shame, shut down by life at a young age. Her narrators are unreliable, abject, contrary.Think indie film, back when indie films weren’t an industry of precious, quirky, star-making features, but rather ensemble pieces shown partly in grainy texture, in an atmosphere that is “shrieky and curious and raw.” This is somewhere in an economically depressed place in Lancashire, near the Ribble Valley. Laura, now twenty-four, lives in the council flats and works as a cleaner in the local shopping center. She’s pallid and dingy with limp hair and acne scars. Everything in her flat seems coated in a furry substance. Laura turns to the TV for a broadcast memorializing her best friend, Chloe, fourteen, who drowned ten years ago with Chloe’s much older boyfriend in an apparent suicide pact on Valentine’s Day, 1998. But no one says “suicide,” they say “tragedy.” The council is erecting a monument, essentially making Chloe a saint. There’s now a rose named for her, called Juliet, as in Romeo and Juliet.“She was special, when she was alive—but not in the picture-perfect way people think of her now. Being dead has turned her into a final draft.”This “concrete folly” being erected is “half a monument to love gone wrong and half a nice piece of publicity for the City’s urban renewal programme--… something for the teenagers to [smoke] their glue in. It’s morbid and sentimental, it ticks all the right boxes for community enterprise funding…”First on the scene with unexplained deaths and always bursting with bad news, newscaster Terry Best of television’s The City Today mugs up to the camera, as he has been for twenty years. As the cameras roll on the ribbon-cutting with the mayor, a piece of earth is dug with a spade, and another body is unearthed, temporarily taking the limelight off Chloe. Terry’s in his element, though, upstaging Chloe while floridly covering both events—sharp Terry, always ready for seamy, muddy twists, making a living on it, a daily fixture in their lives.The narrative alternates between the present and the past, a reconstruction of Chloe and Laura’s friendship, with a third wheel, Emma, who, ten years later, is demonstrably more mentally unbalanced than Laura. Emma lives on disability and volunteers at a pet shelter. Emma and Laura have a tenuous bond now, meet for coffee sometimes, and speak dartingly of Chloe. In the evening, Emma comes by Laura’s flat, after the newly discovered body is declared on the news, and Chloe and Emma share a box of wine and delve deeper into the past. Through these circumspect conversations and inner dialogue, the reader slowly, gradually begins to piece together an accurate picture of the past. We also learn about Laura's family life--her deprivations, her father’s illness, the constant and accumulating terrors of everyday life.Although the unreliable narrators are integral to the reconstruction of events, at times it feels protracted, and you just want the story to get on with itself. The casual pacing falters at intervals. From the first chapter, you realize that this is not a “detective novel,” per se; however, there is tension from unexplained events. Predators skulk the woods, a person goes missing, shadows lurk. But it is primarily about the accretion of psychological blows, the small bruises and bitter inflictions, and the skewed perceptions of the media, which glimmers on everything but the truth.“Every single time Emma came up with a fact, I provided one more and she ran out of things to say first, and at the end I was still holding Chloe’s secret in my mouth, like the time we put buttons under our tongues to make us sound posh when we made prank phone calls.”...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 14, 2012","Jul 16, 2012","Jul 14, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9833502-cold-light

After the front man/vocalist, Pat Mcreedy, left them and went solo, they tanked, dried up, and disbanded. Now Silver is a notch above broke, and his ex-wife, Denise is about to get married to the doctor who wants to perform life-saving surgery on him. But Silver is about the most passively suicidal guy you may meet in fiction.Silver lives on his royalty checks from the song, “Rest in Pieces,” or plays Bar Mitzvahs and weddings, when he can get a gig. Mcreedy’s career is epic and glitzy, and he sleeps with sexy celebrities. Silver hangs out with a group of losers in the tatty Versailles apartments, where they scope out young daisies in bikinis and nod off at the pool. In between, they make weekly deposits at the sperm bank to supplement their income. Tropper has a knack for combining flippant with rueful to achieve sharp and piercing. His leading men are Jewish, middle-aged, overweight, and emotionally adolescent. This book and the last one—This is Where I Leave You-- have titles that underscore absence, departing, and abandonment. There’s as much death cloud as sex haze in the atmosphere. But there’s at least one compelling reason to keep Silver onward through the fog. Or is there?The only person who seems to need Silver right now is his eighteen-year-old daughter, Casey. But only because she’s afraid of disappointing her mother with the news that she’s pregnant. So she tells her dad, whom she sometimes calls Dad, but often calls Silver. She’s a combination of spiky and vulnerable, and her presence makes you root for Silver to wake up from his numbed slumber and be the strong and able support that she needs. The scenes with Casey are often the most tender and fragile. “Mom and Rich got me a G35 for my graduation.”“That was nice of them.”“Mom’s still compensating for you. I milk it a little.”“I would. Can I ask you something?”“Sure.”“Why’d you come to me?”“Really?”“Yeah.”“I care less about letting you down.”This isn’t the side-splitting, laugh-out-loud humor of the last book, but is just as witty and cinematic. The movie rights have already been spoken for, which may bother some readers—that it has a filmic presence to it. (I think of Adam Sandler, and would be surprised if anyone else plays him in the movie.) However, the snappy dialogue and supple visuals are fresh and acute with its bent sense of humor. Silver keeps accidentally thinking out loud, which may be the most gimmicky aspect, although it is nuanced gimmick, if you will. There’s a hint of customized formula, but with an edge to it, and some loose ends that feel right. My husband and I have an eighteen-year-old daughter, and—don’t shudder--we found aspects of this book therapeutic and and highly relatable. It’s madcap at times, improbable, and sometimes too clever. And yet…and yet…it’s about ordinary people trying to redeem themselves, to make sense of their place in the world, confront their shame and cowardice, and to love their children without too much toxic spillover. Sometimes we need a mop and a bucket to clean up our messes--and a spark from a quick, funny, savage, messy, poignant yarn about a guy who thinks out loud.4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,"Jul 11, 2012","Jul 12, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13586743-one-last-thing-before-i-go

WHITE TEETH stands out as one of my favorite books of all time. While reading, I felt as if I were living with these characters--people who struggled with race, identity, assimilation, gender politics, the immigrant experience, and more. Smith's levity eases the weighty subjects without undermining them, and the sprawl of characters, subplots, and exotic locales saturated the novel with a bold and buoyant exuberance.The immigrant experience in a post-colonial world is also a central theme in her latest book, NW. Here, her style is more existentialistic. You feel as if you are eavesdropping on conversations, sometimes desultory, or streaming a character's thoughts. Each main character has his or her specific rhythm and patois, and soon I got into the groove. It seemed a bit more challenging to stay with than all her other novels, but I enjoyed the whole, actually, more than each individual part. I felt no less gripped by the end of the novel than I had in WHITE TEETH or ON BEAUTY, but the journey here was different, way more technique-oriented to arrange a pattern of sound or a flashing glimpse.Childhood friends Keisha Blake and Leah Hanwell grew up in the council estate housing area of Northwest London. Keisha, of Jamaican ancestry, becomes a lawyer, and marries up. Red-haired Irish (ancestry) Leah, who is also educated, marries a Nigerian hairdresser and has too much goodwill guilt to leave the council flats or seek a more lucrative employment. Nevertheless, she harbors some envy toward Keisha's yuppie lifestyle.It wasn't until near the last third of the novel that I knew I was on track with the characters. Many of them stroll, or walk, a lot, and the reader is challenged to go with the flow and not try to think too much about analyzing. For much of the book, it felt like I was trying to hold a cool, airy substance in the palm of my hand. Eventually, it comes together, becomes solid, and the frame holds a picture filled with color, light, and emotional clarity. In the meantime, every short, titled section gives a clue to a character's sensibilities, such as:""It's really an epidemic. That is, they were always there, in the same numbers as they are now, but now it is called an epidemic. A recent headline in The Standard, NORTHWEST FOX EPIDEMIC, and a photograph of a man kneeling in a garden surrounded by corpses he's shot. Dozens and dozens and dozens of them. Dozens and dozens! says Leah, and that's how we live now, defending our own little patch, it didn't used to be like that, but everything's changed, hasn't it, that's what they say, everything's changed.""...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,Sep 2012,"Jul 10, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13537891-nw

ATONEMENT proved that McEwan pens female characters with finesse--even complex, conflicted girls like thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis. In SWEET TOOTH, he kicks the femme character up a notch by writing in the first-person perspective of a low-ranking spy in the early 1970s.Serena Frome—rhymes with plume-- is an arresting woman in her 20’s, a graduate of Cambridge in maths, and a speed-reading lover of novels, especially character-driven ones. If I hadn’t known better, I would have believed that the author of SWEET TOOTH was a woman. He also provided, once again, an effective and scintillating finale, as did ATONEMENT and his satirical SOLAR. However, his narrative tone is unique here from the former two novels.Serena, the daughter of an Anglican bishop, grew up in an insulated and well-tended atmosphere. Her mother wanted her to achieve success, and persuaded her to study maths at Cambridge, rather than her first love, literature. She was an average student in maths, while continuing to voraciously read novels, often skipping over descriptive paragraphs in order to get to the “character.”“I didn’t bother much with themes or felicitous phrases and skipped fine descriptions of weather, landscapes, and interiors. I wanted characters I could believe in…I preferred people to be falling in and out of love, but I didn’t mind so much if they tried their hand at something else.”And love was firmly in Serena’s mind, as events in the book will reflect. Serena was also solidly anti-communist; her nuanced political views were shaped, in part, by an older, scholarly boyfriend, Tony Canning. It was through Tony that she was led to a job at the M15 (British Intelligence Agency). It is better for readers to find out for themselves how this happens.This is a delightful narrative, with a warm, cheeky, animated, but intimate voice—the prose seems so effortless, is so sleek and smooth, that the words funneled instantly into my ear, as if I were hearing them as my own thoughts. There isn’t one false note in this book. After I finished the story, I continued to eavesdrop on Serena (in my imagination), and can conjure her up now, a week later. On the one hand, this is a spy story, and there are enough clandestine, stealthy zigs and zags and twists and turns to remind me of John Banville and John le Carré, two novelists whose spy stories are as much about the internal pressures and conflicts of being undercover as they are about the action-oriented details. SWEET TOOTH isn’t about the plot, although it is a superbly satisfying story. It is a bildungsroman about Serena, seeking her own path, looking for love and shedding her naïveté.Many renowned authors write novels that include a character of their own name, (often as fictionalized memoirs) such as Coetzee, Philip Roth, and a multitude of others. McEwan didn’t write in his name, but I intuit that he gave a wink and a nod to his (auto)biographical past. I sensed that from the intense workout he gave to the act and art of writing, and critique, and of the ego of writers, blending it with story. He did what is otherwise known as metafiction. According to Wikipedia, metafiction is defined this way:“also known as Romantic irony in the context of Romantic works of literature, is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction, exposing the fictional illusion.”How sublime for McEwan to do this—exposing the fictional illusion in a novel ostensibly about spy work--which certainly incorporates illusion and identity, or the illusion of identity (or the identity of illusion?).Where did the title come from? Well, I am not at liberty to tell, or I might have to erase you first! Just open and indulge your gourmet sweet tooth. There are no empty calories here, though, just a supremely satisfying and mouth-watering feast of fiction.

Such is the orientation of the 21st century. Well, prepareWhen I first heard the title to Barbara Kingsolver’s seventh novel, I thought of airplanes. Such is the orientation of the 21st century. Well, prepare to step into the rural, economically depressed farming and sheepherding town of Feathertown, Tennessee, where the shepherds flock on Sundays to commune with Pastor Bobby Ogle, their beloved and kind preacher and spiritual leader. This is the kind of repressed, technologically challenged community who believes that weather is determined by God, not by science, and that the past year’s flooding was decreed by the heavens and can only be reversed by prayer. In this story, the survival techniques of the Monarch butterfly, those bright orange, delicate but hardy creatures, and that of a diminutive, flame-haired young woman are inextricably intertwined and analogous. The Monarchs have had an atypical flight behavior this year. Floods and landslides led to felled trees everywhere in their usual roosting place in Mexico. Subsequently, they migrated to Feathertown to overwinter. Why Feathertown? That’s the big question that one team of scientists comes to examine. However, they are challenged by the residents, who are skeptical of science-based answers to climate-based questions. In the meantime, residents of Feathertown need to fill their coffers.Dellarobia Turnbow, 27, has her own kind of flight behaviors, spurred on by too much domestic confinement too soon, and now she is primed to flee, restive—flying from pillar to post, as her mother always said. Unlike the rest of the townspeople, she wasn’t as inspired by religion.“She was a…911 Christian: in the event of an emergency, call the Lord…Jesus was a more reliable backer, less likely to drink himself unconscious or get liver cancer. No wonder people chose Him as their number one friend. But if the chemistry wasn’t there, what could you do?”Married in a shotgun wedding ten years ago, she lost a preemie before having two more children. Her husband, Cub, is a large, docile and complacent man, controlled and essentially managed by his mirthless parents. Dellarobia knows that to live in this town is to be under a microscope; she was the untamed child once, and that wildness is rearing its head again, her dormancy coming to an end. The first chapter, “The Measure of a Man,” is the catalyst for both Dellarobia’s evolution and the arc of the story. (If you want to experience it fresh and unspoiled, avoid reading the jacket blurb.) Kingsolver’s time-honored talent for yoking the struggle and turmoil of man with the flux and beauty of nature is vividly drawn. She builds the final, dramatic scene of the chapter to a man/nature composition that is at once distilled and dynamic, serene and dramatic. Abundant, also, are Biblical allusions that reflect the community’s ethos. Kingsolver is an agent of social change. She established the Bellwether prize in literature in order to award writers who effect change for the good of humanity. She is also a scholar with postgrad degrees in biology and environmental science. You are going to encounter a stout measure of activism in her writing, covering such issues as the degradation of the planet and its natural resources and the contentious class system of society. If her political evocations have bothered you in the past, they are likely to bother you here, too.Nevertheless, the author weaves in her social issues with finesse, for the most part, and her vivid portrait of Feathertown is sympathetic and informed. Initially, she seems to lampoon the pious, science-fearing populace, but she gradually tenders the reader to an understanding of the religious community. She slowly develops dialogue between urban, rural, and academic minds and concerns. The biblical allusions are also ripe and fitting, relevant to the inhabitants of Feathertown and the way they see the “miracle” of nature. Dellarobia represents a connection between both worlds. This is the second book I have read that highlights the migratory patterns and survival modes of the Monarch butterfly, and braids in the journey of self-actualization and coming to terms with loss. Sanctuary Line, by Jane Urquhart, is also socially and environmentally conscious, and is an apt companion piece to this book. The clash of family, science, religion, media, politics, and environment takes Dellarobia on a quest beyond the emotional and intellectual borders she has known all her life, on a journey of discovery and transformation. Like a butterfly out of the chrysalis, she must follow the path of her future.4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Jul 19, 2012","Jul 24, 2012","Jul 10, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13438524-flight-behavior

The three main women characters--Kat, June, and Isabel--suffering from broken hearts or stifled dreams, turn their lives around with astounding speed and success.While gathered in Boothbay, Maine, to care for the sick and beloved Lolly, they meet men as sexy as Clint Eastwood and Pierce Brosnan. Rock-hard abs, crinkly, sexy eyes, and tall, dark, handsome--wow--all three women are courted by flawless men! Even the dying Lolly is swept off her feet.I chose this book because I am a hardcore Meryl Streep fan, but I am not a devotee of chick-lit, unless it transcends to higher ground, poignant novels such as Bird in Hand, Thorn Birds, and Gone with the Wind, (which can also be enjoyed by men). There's only so much feel-good I can swallow, like candy too sweet for the palate. One story line was left marginally ""open,"" but the novel overall was cloying and telegraphed, with a cookie-cutter wrap-up. All these remarkably wonderful things happened one September to three women, (and a fourth woman, a secondary character). At the center is Lolly, beloved aunt and mother, who is dying of cancer.Lolly runs an historic inn in Boothbay, Maine, with help from daughter, Kat, who is a superb baker. Fifteen years ago, Kat's father and Lolly's sister and her sister's husband died on New Year's Eve from a drunk driver, when Kat was ten. There's a lot of guilt that Lolly hangs onto regarding that night. Isabel, who was a sixteen-year-old wild child at the time of her parents' death, is also stricken because of her ongoing battles with her mother prior to the car accident. Isabel's sister June was thirteen, known as the ""good girl."" They moved into the inn with their Aunt Lolly when they were orphaned, and stayed until they went to college.June got pregnant at 21, after a whirlwind two-day romance with a tall, dark, handsome stranger, right before her senior year at Columbia, and then dropped out. She has been unable to find her now seven-year-old son's father, partly due to his common name, John Smith. She's been working at a bookstore in Portland, owned by--you guessed it--the tall, dark, and handsome Henry, who has always loved her, and is practically a saint with the patience of Job. Henry is closing the Portland bookstore but offers her a managerial position in Boothbay, where she is headed to help care for the inn and her aunt. Henry patiently stands by while June searches for John Smith. It was obvious to me where John Smith was, and the outcome predictable.Isabel just caught her husband in an affair, and is facing divorce. Things had been going downhill with him since she broke their ""pact"" and wanted to have a baby. They had met when he helped her in grief counseling after her parents died. Edward also was orphaned from tragedy at a young age, and their bond brought them closer together. However, it was a shock for Isabel to discover that his affair was with a woman who has children. However, while in Boothbay, she meets the man of her dreams--talk, dark, handsome Griffin.Kat has never left the city of Boothbay, and is on the verge of engagement to her childhood friend, Oliver, who was her rock and touchstone after her father died. They grew up next door to each other, and were best friends since the age of five. Their platonic relationship changed to romance more recently, and Oliver is eager to marry Kat and help her get Kat's Confections, her dream business, off the ground. Oliver is tall, sandy-haired, and handsome. However, the tall, dark, hot, handsome resident at the hospital offers more than a helping hand to Kat.The novel's center is Lolly, who gathers the three young women back together to the inn while she is undergoing chemotherapy. The three, who weren't very close growing up, forge a strong union and loving tenderness toward each other pretty swiftly. Their mutual support, after all these years and guilt trips, is almost too good to be true, like every plot turn in this book.The best parts are the Friday Movie Nights, where Lolly and the girls choose a different Meryl Streep movie to watch, analyze, and then parallel to their own lives. Too many coincidences there, how the flicks relate to their own dilemmas, but I did enjoy when they debated and discussed the conflicts and themes of the individual films.This is unabashed chick-lit, life varnished with a thick coating of beautiful, smart women and bright, Adonis men. Not my cuppa--more a bubble bath read than a beach read.

Claire grows to understand the land, and to subsequently love the farm, to feel sewn and hewn to it, especially after the death of their son, Josh. Their daughters, Gwen and Lucy, take different paths, and try to talk their mother into selling the land after the harrowing events that changed their lives forever.The first part of the book didn't thoroughly draw me in. The tragedy/history was told in a stilted voice that removed me from the emotions and drama of the story at hand. However, once Claire hires an enigmatic and beautiful caregiver, Minna, a Caribbean woman who tells them that she is the great granddaughter of novelist Jean Rhys, both the prose and the plot develop with a stunning complexity, taking on a deeper patina, with a sinister and menacing tug at its center, as well as a profound and intricate force of beautiful narrative expression.After the prosaic and somewhat sterile first half, the second half demonstrates that Soli's plotting and voice was a stylistic choice--deliberate, measured, finely tuned. The latter 200 pages were exceptionally imaginative, with resinous scenes and psychologically brilliant portrayals and insights. By the end of the story, I was gasping, and my heart was both engorged and impaled by the events, and Soli's writing. By the time I was in section III (out of IV), I knew I was in the hands of a masterful, labyrinthine writer, who combined aspects of gothic, folk, and historical writing into a dramatic and sometimes surreal saga.How synchronous that I would read two books in a row about the passion and vicissitudes of farming an extensive orchard, the first being THE ORCHARDIST, by Amanda Coplin. Both novels explore themes of reverence and fealty to the land, and both have a middle-aged protagonist who invites an unknowable stranger(s) into his/her life, and grow to love them like daughters, and suffer great torment from the darkness of haunting pasts.Lyrical and hypnotic, Soli's writing will keep you fastened to the story and characters. The relationship between Minna and Claire is unique and moving--as unforgettable as the ""forgetting"" lemon tree that is the touchstone of the orchard and the leitmotif of the novel's core paradoxical theme.""...an unheard of thing happened in the orchard...the leaves on the citrus turned a burnt yellow...clung on for over a month, fresh and pliable and yellowed, then overnight every single one fell to the ground.

Although it is #8, it is my first—but not my last! Fortunately, each novel stands alone, although it is evident within the pages that there is strong character development that was started and has evolved from the previous seven books. The “beautiful mystery” is both a coiled and divine unraveling, and readers will be delighted by riddles and twists up to the very end. There are demons to unlock, both in the monastery and with the investigating officers. Penny brilliantly executes a keen thematic parallel to both.The returning characters are Chief Inspector and his deputy and friend, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, of the Sûreté du Québec, (police department) and Gamache’s daughter Annie (small role here) as well as Gamache’s wife, who is only referred to in this book. Lastly, there is the man that Gamache despises, his superior in rank, Superintendent Sylvain Françoeur. In this closed room murder mystery, Gamache and Beauvoir are investigating the murder of the prior and choirmaster of an obscurely located monastery in Northern Quebec, Saint-Gilbert-Entre-les-Loups, where the abbot, Dom Phillipe, handpicks the monks for their composite talents. The crucial and coveted skill is their gift for Gregorian chanting, or plainchant. Now, Frère Mathieu, who is the spire of this talent, was found in the abbot’s garden, curled in a fetal position, his head smashed in.The murder is likely an inside job, but the clues are minimal and the motivations are unclear. The abbot allows the brothers to break from their vow of silence (which is less a vow in this case than an agreement) in order to speak to the police. Gamache and Beauvoir have no choice but to stay at the monastery while they are investigating, a place that no outsider has ever been invited or allowed into before. As the investigation progresses, a discord is revealed, which has created a divide in the harmony of the brothers. That is all you need to know, as one of the delights of reading this mystery is for it to remain one, until you crack the case with the police.For a while, this was a 4-star read. My own detective skills allowed me to figure out the answer to some key clues before they were revealed. Also, Penny took a large gamble by including a separate storyline, which annexes from an earlier book. At first, this bothered me, because I wanted to get on with this case. There are twenty-four monks, including the dead choirmaster. Twenty-three potential suspects kept me sufficiently engaged. And each brother had his own separate and enigmatic personality. But, gradually, an eloquent symmetry is exposed as the unresolved troubles of Beauvoir and Gamache gain poignancy. And the raw succession of Buavoir's torment is refreshingly authentic, rather than tied up with a bow. The book gets more exceptional as it advances.Penny’s prose is rich with metaphor and filled with light, shadows, and darkness. Her aesthetic eye for detail contours the story with an elegant texture, and her knack for plunging the reader into the wilderness setting of the monastery is both dazzling and dignified. “The corridor was filled with rainbows. Giddy prisms. Bouncing off the hard stone walls. Pooling on the slate floors. They shifted and merged and separated as though alive.”I look forward to reading more from this author, and going back to her earlier books. I read on her site that the themes in her book were inspired by two lines in an Auden poem, in his elegy to Melville. “Goodness existed, that was the new knowledge/his terror had to blow itself quite out to let him see it.” Quite inspired.4.5...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jun 30, 2012","Jul 05, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13513646-the-beautiful-mystery

Not for Godot, but for King Abdullah, in the King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC), which is a developing Red Sea port in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He is a 54-year-old failed American businessman in serious debt, evading his creditors and anguishing over how he will pay for his daughter's next year in college. He also has an angry ex-wife and a worrying lump on his neck. This is his last hurrah, a chance to turn his life from sad and broke to flush and secure, if he and his young team from Reliant can pitch this hologram presentation to the King and win an IT contract.Alan is a bit of a sad sack, arriving at his failures largely due to the outsourcing of American business manufacturing. He was once a confident, prosperous sales executive with Schwinn, until he made some bad decisions, such as trying to convert a Soviet-era factory in Budapest to a capitalistic model. Sometime after that catastrophe, he followed the trend of globalization, and was instrumental in shipping Schwinn's labor to China. That was the end of Schwinn's American prosperity.""How did your suppliers become your competitors? That was a rhetorical question...Teach a man to fish. Now the Chinese know how to fish, and ninety-nine percent of all bicycles are being made there in one province.""Moreover, his father, now retired, had been a committed union man with Stride Rite, and treated Alan with contempt for his past misdeeds and his new job with Reliant.""They're making actual things over there, and we're making websites and holograms...while sitting in chairs made in China, working on computers made in China, driving over bridges made in China. Does this sound sustainable to you, Alan?""As Alan recalls various high points and assaults on his career and personal life--his tense years wedded to the high-strung Ruby; a sentimental trip to Cape Canaveral with his daughter, Kit, to watch the last shuttle; the affluent years with Schwin--he continues to wait, either in his lonely hotel with no alcohol, or set up with his team of three in a tent with anemic wi-fi and no air conditioning, in 110-degree heat.Fortunately, Alan has forged a connection with a local, a young, enigmatic, chubby driver named Yousef, who is constantly looking under the hood of his car/taxi for explosives that may have been set by the husband of an ex-fiancé. Yousef is usually the comical straight man to the blundering Alan. As Alan shares his dreams and visions of selling his ideas to the King, Yousef tamps it down with some biting realities. Apparently, the King hasn't even been back to Jeddah in about 18 months.Yousef gives Alan a tour of this unrepentant desert region, a vast place tremendous with possibilities, but appears to be in a stage of arrested development. A billboard advertises the development, and there's a road that cuts through nothing, then a pair of stone arches, and a dome hovering over all of it. He imagines the city rising from its ashes. Presently, it looks like anywhere and nowhere--it could be Los Angeles, or Orlando, as there is nothing to give it distinction, except for its looming neutrality and the few towering or squat, square buildings.Alan attempts to make contact with the liaison, Karim al-Ahmad, at the building they call the ""Black Box,"" and is given the royal runaround. Back to the stifling tent, he reminisces and deliberates some more. Is the lump on his neck malignant? Are they going to be served food? Is the King going to come soon? Days turn into weeks, and Alan has some interactive adventures. He meets a Danish beauty with an office in the Black Box and a secret stash of moonshine. He makes an appointment to have his lump evaluated and meets a serenely beautiful doctor. He even has an opportunity to prove himself an able marksman.Eggars has pared down his prose since the exuberant narrative style in A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. Here it is streamlined--lean, economic, slyly impassive. I enjoyed what was unsaid as much as what was said--the spaces between sentences, the pregnant pauses to ponder, the measured rhythm, the quivering tension, the elegy of a man feeling his impending absence more than his indefinite presence.There's a risk of the story being an agit-prop against the creeping ambush of globalization, a pithy cry about America's decline. Certainly that point is made, but not forcefully. Readers are already aware of the economic struggles, the backlash of end-stage capitalism and the pros and con arguments of outsourcing. Eggars is more interested in shaping a character we will identify and empathize with, and laugh at occasionally.Clay is a maladjusted baby boomer from the age of entitlement, losing his footing in the new privileges and prohibitions of global finance. His wounds, both physical and emotional, are palpable. Alan Clay is a suffering everyman, in the throes of unsustainability. There are wisps of Willy Loman, Herzog, and other memorable literary figures, aging tragic-comic men who suffered from obsolescence.It reads partly like a fabled allegory, but achingly real and plausible. Can the imminent foreclosure of a man's life be reversed? Will the King show up? I was touched, and considerably moved, by the story, characters, and themes. Don't expect a neatly wrapped up resolve.

Susan works for T., the protagonist of book one, the man who is missing in Belize, and presumed dead. You don't have to read the first book to engage with the second, but it adds more background and material on several of the characters (especially T.), and some more dimension and history on the story as a whole.The only writer I can think of that reminds me of Millet is Paul Auster, with his postmodern, darkly comic and surreal novels of characters earnestly struggling, and yet with an absurd haplessness, too, to comprehend their lives. They suffer from disorienting delusions, so that their self-directed journeys are fevered with mortifications. Millet is somewhat quirkier, even, and without the assembled, careful structure of Auster. She is less antiseptic than Auster, with an undertone of gallows humor.After Hal comes to the conclusion that Susan is having an affair with her preppy office paralegal, he decides to play the potential hero, offering to travel to Belize to find T.

First, he feels like he is responsible for forcing Susan to suppress her bohemian, free-love spirit that she possessed when they first met in the 60's (it is now 1994, dated by the death of Kurt Cobain).Secondly, and more importantly, he is emotionally choked with guilt and pain about his daughter, Casey, who had an accident when she was 17 and is now a twenty-six-year-old paraplegic. Apparently, she once had an intimate affair with T., (if you read the first book, you get the full story), but she isn't sharing the details. T. was responsible for her new and improved outlook--her shedding of cynicism, self-enmity, and former scorn for all of existence. Now that Casey is engaged with life, she has taken on an acrimonious, mocking ex-cop paraplegic boyfriend, and an appalling telephone job that Hal found out about inadvertently.Hal's feelings of profound loss over Casey, and his frequent interior dialogues about her ""before"" and ""after"" state, as well as the shock of his wife's infidelity, crushes him with an awareness of his own obsolescence. This keeps with the themes of extinction started in the first book. Although it is animal extinction that was How the Dead Dream's concern, there has always been a subtext of human dissolution and annihilation.""...suddenly he was older and part of the architecture, its tangibility and the impulse behind it, its failings and strengths. The heavy installation had lost their majesty and seemed temporary, even shoddy, with a propensity for decline.""""He was a surplus human, a product of a swollen civilization. He was a widget among men.""Hal's adventures in Belize include breakfast:""Eggs arrived, with a slice of papaya to remind him of his location. Lest he mistake them for Hackensack eggs or eggs in Topeka, the papaya cam along to announce they were tropical eggs, to remind him that congratulations!-he was on a tropical vacation.""Hal meets a German couple named Hans and Gretel (seriously!), (with twin blonde young ""cornboys"" obsessed with table tennis and video games), who are resolutely cheerful and beautiful to look at, and radiate a glowing bliss. ""Such Germans were irritating. On the one hand they were an unpleasant reminder of Vikings and Nazis, on the other hand you envied them.""Hans, an avionics genius and specialist in something called tactical sensor networks, is well-connected to the military, and after hearing Hal's reason for coming to this island, organizes a search for T., with the U.S. armed forces, the Belize Defence Force Cadets, and NATO on board. Hal joins Hans and the muscle bound military men, and has his own Heart of Darkness trip through the jungle, as T. did in the first book.This next quote, although not plot progressing, is an example of Millet's sly, dark wit as channeled by Hal's interior thoughts:""Armed forces personnel were not as bad as cops, when it came to the aggregate probability of antisocial personality disorder...They were not homicidal so much as Freudian; they liked to feel the presence of a constant father. And their fringe benefits included fit and muscular bodies.""Millet's charismatic wit blends with her piercing, philosophical insights and compassion to portray a man on the brink of an existential crisis. What is especially endearing about Hal Lindley is his humanity as a parent, ripe and heartfelt with touching contradictions. The ending is surreal and mystifying, with a touch of the bizarre, a soul-searing finale that makes me impatient for book three.

The second novel, GHOST LIGHTS, was released last year. The third, MAFNIFICENCE, is still pending (scheduled for Nov release). The protagonists in the second and third books are minor characters from the first book. Millet's advocacy with endangered species and her graduate degrees in environmental policy and economics inform this novel without clamminess or preachy rhetoric. Her deft, precise language is lyrically noir and philosophical, and is plaited with satire and pathos, nuance and caricature. The dream-like narrative is ripe with imagery from the animal world. The motifs of absence, destruction and obsolescence reflect the moral decay that inhabits a capitalistic society in all its latent anxieties. It is also a rich story about the vicissitudes of the human condition.Since childhood, T. has been a mercenary disciple of authority and financial institutions. His idols were the statesmen and presidents of legal tender. This led to a cunning acquisitiveness, scamming neighbors out of their money with his phony charities and by hemorrhaging money from bullied classmates in return for protecting them. In college, he learns the key to success, while remaining emotionally apart from others. He is the frat brother always handy with sage advice, and renders aid when they get in serious trouble. His vices are almost nonexistent, but he gladly provides rides for his drinking buddies. Everything T. does is calculated toward success. As an adult, he becomes a wealthy real estate developer, acquiring some of his clients from his former friends grateful for his past support. Money is T.'s religion.""Currency infused all things, from the small to the monolithic. And to be a statesman the first thing needed was not morals, public service, or the power of rhetoric; the first thing needed was money. Because finally there was only a single answer. As there was only one intelligence residing in a self, as trees grew upward toward the sun, as women lived outward and men walked in insulation to the end of their lives: when all was said and done, from place to place and country to country, forget the subtleties of right and wrong, the struggle toward affinity. In the lurch and flux, in all the variation and the same, it was only money that could set a person free.""OK, you get the drift. T. worshipped money.A few unfortunate events out of T.'s control happen. His father leaves his mother to embrace his same sex love openly, and his mother gradually declines from that end point. Furthermore, he accidentally hits and kills a coyote on the desert highway in Nevada, which plagues him periodically and is the genesis of a sea change within him.""He saw the coyote's face, ...eyes half-closed, the long humble lines of her mouth. Any animal could be gentle while it was busy dying...That was hardly a mark of distinction. But the sorrow persisted, as though he were worrying an open cut."" Eventually, he is compelled to get a dog, one that he forms a bond with over time.Then, T. falls in love, which aids in refining his disposition from aloof and isolated to engaged and attached.""This was how he lost his autonomy--he had moved along at a steady pace and then he was flung.""But the experience is truncated by a chilling event, and T. subsequently becomes obsessed with endangered species, particularly from learning that the paving of one of his subdivisions had displaced an almost extinct species of kangaroo rats. He becomes preoccupied by the repercussions of real estate development on animals, the expansion of cities and the utopias of convenience and consumption:""Under their foundations the crust of the earth seemed to be shifting and loosening, the falling away and curving under itself.""T. laments the biological blight caused by economic growth, mourns the progress of civilization. Tormented, he bemoans the extinction of animals, dying in sweeps and categories. After learning locksmith trade secrets, he starts breaking into zoos at night. T. doesn't free them from their cages; he merely wants to watch them. The force of a spiritual crisis arrests him with the same possessive absorption that money used to do.The last section of the novel concerns T.'s journey to Belize, where he owns some property he's developing into a resort. It reads with an ephemeral, ethereal quality, like a mystical epitaph, with Heart of Darkness tendrils infused throughout, and the reminder of the cyclical nature of man's imperialism.""When a thing became very scarce, that was when it was finally seen to be sublime and lovely.""Encompassing, imaginative, and meditative, this is a must-read for literature lovers....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Jun 15, 2012","Jun 16, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/815859.How_the_Dead_Dream

I was persuaded to read it now because the follow-up book, THE ABSENT ONE, is set for release in a few months. What a sleeper of a nightmare of a dream of a book! I started it one day and finished it the next. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough, and haven't had this much skin-prickling enjoyment/engagement with a police procedural/suspense thriller since Tana French's books. You don't have to typically like this ""genre"" because it defies genre, and is more a story about humanity than anything else.Carl Mørck, a brash, politically incorrect, and supremely confident homicide detective in the Copenhagen police department, was humbled and traumatized by his last investigation. When he and his partner, Hardy, and another officer, turned up at a homicide, a perp was hiding in the shadows, who shot the third officer dead and paralyzed his partner, while Mørck was left defenseless under Hardy's fallen body. The story opens here. Now, back on the job several weeks later, Mørck is less than enthusiastic, and some more politically ambitious members of the police department would love to see him gone for good, or at least invisible.Mørck is ""handled"" by his superiors by being bumped upstairs, only it is downstairs. They receive a nice bundle of money from the government to re-open cold cases. Mørck is just cynical enough to accept the assignment, preferring to chain smoke and throw darts in his new basement office, as head of Department Q. After he finds out from one of his sources that his boss is cheating him out of the details of the funding (and giving him the bare minimum), he negotiates his own vehicle and assistant out of the deal. What he gets is a sweet Peugeot, and an Arabic factotum named Assad who has a few secrets, an open smile, and a keen mind, as well as a knack for digging up gold fragments and impressive corollaries from deep, dead holes and dormant clues.Assad pulls Mørck out of his self-pity and depression after he opens the first file and chips away at and questions some facts and details. (He also brews a super leaded cup of coffee and steams a fine cup of tea, and drives like a maniac.) Five years ago, in 2002, the disappearance of a beautiful, young, upstart politician name Merete Lynggaard occurred on a passenger boat to Berlin, where she was traveling on holiday with her beloved and handicapped brother, Uffe. For six months, it was a huge media sensation. However, the case, never solved, was reduced to a cough and ruled a probable drowning suicide.The reader knows just a bit of what happened, as the story goes back in forth in time and characters to unfold the truth of what transpired and resulted from this event. The clues that Assad and Mørck uncover are revealed to the reader gradually and thrillingly, by poking at the past and present alternately. It is a tight, taut method of narrative that keeps the reader in grueling suspense. The story is so brisk and piercing it could pulverize bone.There isn't a lot of gore; the author doesn't use gratuitous methods to hook us. He knows his way around other psychological and physical forms of torture. It is also a peek into Danish politics, without hammering us with it. Subplots weave in and rear up, and some are left open to continue in the next book of the series. This stark, riveting novel is original and fierce, laced with sardonic wit and blended with a grim and haunting atmosphere. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 26, 2012","May 28, 2012","May 26, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10822858-the-keeper-of-lost-causes

But Carter, with an almost mesmerizing touch, weaves more than a ""what if"" story here. What most engaged me is the way that Carter liberated himself from any stilted, biased or passive political ranting of his own. Instead of telegraphing his views into the characters, he allowed history to inform us, while never forgetting to hook us with an invented story within the framework of an intense and complex time in history.In 1867, the war has been over for two years. Andrew Johnson, not Abe Lincoln, was shot and killed by Booth. And Secretary of State William Seward has been so wounded that he doesn't leave his house anymore. And the president's wife has died a year ago from a mysterious accident. This is the alternate history that Carter has meticulously woven together. Lincoln faces an impeachment trial from Congress on four counts due to his policies (or lack thereof) and intercessions (or lack thereof) during Reconstruction: 1) suspension of habeas corpus, 2) seizing of telegrams and shuttering a handful of newspapers 3) not sufficiently protecting the freedmen in the southern states 4) conspiring with the military officers to overthrow the constitutional forms of government.This finely nuanced and well-paced novel is packed with fully realized characters and situations. Of course, with a cast this extensive, and numerous plots within plots, some characters are there to lend background and color, or to promote a larger connection. There are plots and subplots, romance, adventure, conspiracies, and even murder. How Carter tightly brings it all together in this capacious novel is superbly tight, with room for ambiguity, and he always remains a step ahead of the reader. Half of the fun was trying to catch up and tease out the disclosures before he did!Abigail Canner is a twenty-one-year-old black graduate from Oberlin who lives with her aunt, a freed slave named Nanny Pork, in Washington City. She aspires to become a lawyer, and shrewdly procures a job as a clerk in the law office that represents Lincoln. It is a win-win, too, because the personnel know it looks good to practice what they preach. All too often, it is known that ""like so many people of liberal persuasion, they value their own progressive opinions more than they value the people they hold those opinions about.""Abigail is the polestar of this book, and Carter has drawn her with an able and agile hand. Whatever a reader might fear could occur with a character like Abigail--such as too much PC, or implausibly heroic--those fears will be allayed by the subtle sharpness of Miss Canner. Yes, there's romance in the air, and it doesn't take the reader long to foresee its possibility, but Carter wins you over with his credible storyline and keen restraint. And, not all is as doubtless (or doubtful!) as it may initially seem.The book was like a web, or a circle with vectors projecting in every direction. As the author demonstrates, there are no easy answers, and often, both sides imbibe elements of hypocrisy and criminal behaviors, as well as righteousness and nobility. At this time, during the impeachment proceedings, Lincoln states that he would be ready to step down, but doesn't feel that his work is finished until he brings the Union together. The radical Republicans--who are men of his own party who could be seen, on the one hand, as fanatical, or on the other, as dedicated and true--want to oust him now.I was concerned that the story would be clumsy, with a ham-handed Lincoln and a heavy-handed story. It has to be difficult to portray an icon known as ""Honest Abe,"" two years beyond his actual survival time, a president most known for freeing the slaves. But this isn't just the Lincoln we learned about in our history textbooks in high school. Here we have a troubled, complicated man, always at the ready with an amusing anecdote, a sometimes dour but witty and enigmatic presence. And a flawed human being who nevertheless understands the times he is facing.There is nothing black and white in this racially charged novel of American history. Besides the conflict of race, there are the businessmen with greedy propositions about tariffs; egos; political ambitions; social issues of women and class; and more.""The cost of war,"" says Lincoln in 1867, "" is impossible to estimate in advance...wars continue long after one side surrenders. Every conflict plagues the peace that follows it.""""There is a tradition,"" says retired Union General Dan Sickles, one of Lincoln's staunchest supporters, ""that once a great war has been won, the leader must at once be deposed. The Romans used to do it. The British, too.""In the Author's Note, a must-read at the end of the book, Carter provides important information regarding his source material, and a fascinating peek at how he braided fact and fiction together. Like his first novel, THE EMPEROR OF OCEAN PARK, he slyly evinces the skullduggery in the chess games of politics, as well as the toll of personal loss to the cause and commitment of justice. Moreover, he doesn't forget that his story is, principally, to entertain, and seduce his readers into believers. He makes the most of his characters and their individual and shared passions, and renders a deeply felt and plausible history, back to the future. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"Jun 06, 2012","May 25, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12953517-the-impeachment-of-abraham-lincoln

The possibilities intrA Pulitzer prize-winning journalist writes a first novel about a murder of three elderly men in the West Virginia hill country. The possibilities intrigued me from the first few pages, and I expected a well-written piece of work--no fluff, no sloppiness, clean editing, and mature, solid plot and theme structure. A good journalist is experienced in the weight of a word, the sharpness of a sentence. Unfortunately, this debut novel turned out to be derivative and prosaic, with minimal tension and a telegraphed plot. It should also be billed as a YA/crossover, due to the immoderately frisky voice, heavy-handed platitudes, and transparent story. In a rural mountain coffee shop, the Salty Dawg, in the small town of Acker's Gap, a door opens, a man aims a gun, and three men are shot in cold blood. One of the witnesses is Carla, the sixteen-year-old troubled daughter of the Raythune county prosecutor, thirty-eight-year-old Belfa ""Bell Elkins. She recognizes the killer from a party she was at once, but doesn't want to tell her mother because she is afraid she will be grounded ""for life"" if she admits to being at this party, which was actually some time ago.Really? That's too much to swallow, considering the horror of seeing three people killed in front of you at such a tender age. Worried about being grounded if you help your mother catch the killer? She's already been in trouble in the past for those petty teenage crimes with pot and cigarettes. It isn't news to Bell that her daughter has experimented, and considering how intelligent Carla is made to be, how could she be this recklessly stupid? It doesn't add up, but it was a lazy contrivance for the plot and theme.Bell and Nick Fogelsong, the sheriff, go way back to when Bell was traumatized by a violent crime that landed her sister Shirley in jail, when Shirley was sixteen and Bell just ten. Bell became a ward of the state and lived unhappily in a series of foster homes. Shirley remains in jail and refuses to see Bell. Nick is one of her closest confidants, the only one that knows most of the story (along with her ex). The facts bluntly unfold, and it feels like a rehash of older, done before stories. The earnestly quirky characters tend to feel borrowed from clichéd novels.Belfa was ambitious, and married an equally ambitious young man, Sam; they were sweethearts since before law school. Sam is now a topflight lawyer for a lobbyist firm in D.C. They are divorced now, as Sam was a bit of an egotist and skirt chaser, but they remain in regular contact. Bell wants to be here in Acker's Gap where she grew up; she is determined to infiltrate the cabals of illegal prescription drug dealers that have invaded her county and hometown. She wants Carla to stay here, but Carla wants to live with her dad, out of guilt and a desire to escape from telling her mother the truth.The other plot thread concerns an adult male, Albie Sheets, with the IQ of a small child that is accused of murdering his six-year-old friend, Tyler Bevins, a boy he plays with daily. Bell is the prosecuting attorney, and she has concerns about this man's ability to understand the crime, and to comprehend right from wrong. The answers to this crime were telegraphed too clumsily and visibly, and has remnants of older stories covered in numerous past novels.The author evidently did not feel the need to have the pathologist determine the cause of death of this little boy. Either Acker's Gap or the author dropped the ball. Apparently, they look at a crime scene and decide cause of death on sight and sound? On witness testimony exclusively? This made no sense to me. It wasn't stated that the medical examiner didn't conduct an official autopsy, but he couldn't have, based on information that was revealed. The author jettisoned the law, creating an implausible narrative with unwieldy gaps.Supposedly, Bell is an outstanding prosecuting attorney, but I only know that because the author declares but doesn't show us. I see little evidence of intrepid crime-solving and questioning of witnesses--the little I do see was stock-in-trade. Moreover, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I thought a Pulitzer winner was going to write a fresh, bold story. Instead, the graceless muddling left no room for tension, while melodrama, high emotions and boiler plate banality took its place. And as we near the denouement, the pace of the story is handicapped by the hamstrung events.Keller has potential, I see it, and I keep rooting for it to unearth itself. She periodically dazzles the reader with gemlike prose, which supports the theme--where violence and beauty live in a fraught and fragile frisson, but it gets buried by a workmanlike narrative and plot.""She loved these mountains, loved their raw beauty, but it was a wary, cautious love, the kind of love you might have for a large animal with a vicious streak. You could love it all you liked, but you couldn't ever turn your back on it. You had to respect the fact of its wildness. It was a wildness that would outlast your love.""Nice, but not enough.I suspect that the author left the door open for future installments.

He’s also a Texas resident, which I certainly relate to, and a satirist, which there’s always room for in warmongering America. His debut novel pointedly skewers the way the Iraq war was bought and sold to the American public and brings me back to that first day in March, 2003, where the high-def, high-tech pre-emptive strike was waged and unabashedly played out in every TV across the nation.The year is not stated, but it’s the Bush administration—probably the first one, circa 2004 or so. Billy Lynn is a 19-year-old reluctant soldier, who joined the Army for the same reason a number of young men joined—to escape criminal prosecution in the civilian world (for defending his sister from her crazy ex). He and his fellow soldiers in what is now known by the media as the Bravo Squad fought some Iraqi insurgents in a deadly firefight, and they are now home for the two-week Victory Tour before the next deployment. The shootout was caught by Fox news on tape and shown over and over and over again to the American public as a way to galvanize support for the war. Like “Nina Levin.”The Tour culminates at a Thanksgiving Dallas Cowboys football game at the Dallas Stadium, where the fans will be all agog for Bravo’s walk across the stadium during halftime—the pageantry fit for the gregariously complacent. And they will get to share the stage with the hot and sexy Destiny’s Child all-female band. Fountain’s use of absurdity to demonstrate the patronizing and safe-distance reverence for these soldiers is worthy of Orwellian and Huxleyesque appreciation for the culture of commercial cheese, sexual promiscuity, and the confined, narrow nature of a certain sector of Americans. Fountain lampoons the shallow spectacle of flag-waving patriotism and sheeple-speak, and the amped-up gusto of modern warfare and its supporters.Much of the novel takes place in Billy’s interior landscape of the mind, as he struggles to reconcile the American media’s manipulation of war and heroism, and the questions he asks himself daily about life and death are reflected in the events of the day at the game. As all these corporate giants and media moguls and everyday people are cheering him on, he is naggingly aware, on some level, of the ghastly exploitation occurring on their behalf. They are joined by a movie producer trying to make a Hollywood movie of their shootout at al-Ansakar Canal, but it is evident that the heroes are just chattel to be traded for money and power—regardless of whether the Bravo Squad is enriched and personally rewarded. There’s even talk of Hilary Swank playing a major role in the movie, as one of the men. The producer is itching to get big celebrities on board, even if it suffocates the true meaning and truth of Bravo’s soldiers. The hypocrisy is flowing like the beer, and the press and corporate giants don’t even flinch when the soldiers are asked so cavalierly about private, painful moments. Their combat experience is hideously twisted by the set up pageantry.The characters, for the most part, are mouthpieces for the author, which can get heavy-handed. However, the Cowboy’s owner, Norm Oglesby, is worth ten of the others, as he is a stellar, flawless, hilarious send-up of Jerry Jones. The red hair, the over-plasticized plastic surgery, and the despotic arrogance are impeccable. But the second part of the novel, rather than contour the story, is mostly rhetoric. The thin plotlines and resolution could have been easily squeezed into a short story or novella. However, the prose is sterling, full of muscle and fiber and energy, with dazzling narrative riffs that had me gobsmacked at intervals.“…and he wonders by what process virtually any discussion about the war seems to profane these ultimate matters of life and death. As if to talk of such things properly we need a mode of speech near the equal of prayer, otherwise just shut, shut your yap and sit on it, silence being truer to the experience than the star-spangled spasm, the bittersweet sob, the redeeming hug, or whatever this fucking closure is that everyone’s talking about.”Another er called this novel quintessentially American.

Actually, both noveMullen's third novel, a dystopian time-travel, was drowned out in the literary world by Stephen King's time travel epic, 11/22/63. Actually, both novels are ideal as bookends; in King's book, the protagonist goes back in time to try and alter history, whereas Mullen's protagonist, Zed, is an agent from the future employed to preserve history exactly as it is and prevent disruption or changes. If you add Orwell's 1984 (constant surveillance) and Farenheit 451 (destruction of historical documents), you have a riff of Mullen's themes. However, he created his own artistic, original, and literary novel that asks disturbing questions from all sides and parallels many of the contemporary concerns of our post 9/11 world.Date unknown, but we have survived the ""Great Conflagration,"" a period of warfare and global destruction that started in Washington, D.C. during the 21st century and led to the now ""Perfect Present."" The Perfect Present is canny once you understand that this semi-utopian existence is a mixed bag. Yes, there is world peace, no hunger, and no religious wars (and no religion), and race is essentially a non-issue, as everyone is mixed.But, at what cost this Perfect Present? For one thing, all history is sacred, yet exiled from citizens' knowledge. The past is considered dangerous, because it is psychologically and socially harmful to dwell on the events that caused wars and disasters. The government forbids historical knowledge to circulate; moreover, when a loved one dies, all traces of them are erased in a haunting and treacherous manner.Zed, a government-employed time-traveler, is known as a Protector, another sly term used to denote the active preservation of history, a euphemism for protecting atrocities such as the Holocaust, 9/11, and World Wars--necessary in order to ensure that the Perfect Present now exists. Zed is cybernetically enhanced with the power of GPS and superhuman surveillance skills. His ""contemp"" (21st century) name is Troy Jones.Certain rebels or ""hags"" are anti-government agitators who believe that people deserve to know their history, and part of their job is finding ways to access hidden and confidential historical documents. The hags travel back to the past and attempt to prevent specific horrors from occurring. These time travels provoke cat-and-mouse chases between the Protectors and the hags. Zed's job is to eliminate the hags and protect the Perfect Present.This is as much a novel of ideas as it is a spy thriller. Characters wrestle with themes of protection vs power, of morality vs truth, and also grapple with identity, memory, and loss. In addition, the question of life's narrative is ubiquitous in the story--continuity, progression, recall, and interpretation. Moreover, how do you preserve history, when you are standing in it? What happens if you get involved with a person from the past? Supposedly, some people count more than others, and minor changes with insignificant members of the population don't necessarily affect the future. But Zed is standing close to the precipice, facing a steep chasm of people and history, flirting with fissures.Tasha is a young corporate lawyer in D.C. grieving for her soldier brother's death in Iraq, and troubled by the information she was given. She doesn't believe the government's story about what happened, which leads her to a mission of her own, and a potentially perilous breach of ethics. She meets Zed at a demonstration. He is breaking the rules by consorting with ""contemps,"" but figures that there will be no butterfly effect from his interactions with her.Leo is a former CIA spy now working for a morally ambiguous security company. He is asked to tail some anti-government/anti-war activists in the D.C. area. While grocery shopping, he meets a beautiful Indonesian nanny, Sari, who works for a Korean diplomat and his wife. Her inscrutable air fails to conceal some ugly facial bruises, but she isn't talking.The twists and turns are about two steps ahead of the reader, but with a casual pace that burns slowly and effectively, allowing time for character building and depth, and for ideas to flesh out. And, no matter how refined the technology, everyone is damaged and, to some extent, working with crude tools. And, as in life, not all questions can be resolved. But there's love, and a knock at the door.

Likewise, I applaud this debut author's unspoken but sublime irony and chutzpah in her choice to revitalize but change the original version of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, a novel written by the celebrated, anti-Semitic author, Edith Wharton, that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1921! (Wharton, Scott Fitzgerald, and Henry James were all privileged people of their times) Segal gets the last laugh by writing this tidy, classy novel about manners and family, and security versus passionate spontaneity. THE INNOCENTS takes place in contemporary times.Twenty-eight-year-olds Adam Newman (cf. Newland Archer in AOI) and Rachel Gilbert (May Welland) have been together for a dozen years, engaged to be married, and comfortable and secure in their tight knot of overlapping and extended family and friends. Rachel has never been with any other man but Adam, and Adam’s experience is limited (by today’s standards). He is smug in his knowledge of Adam and Rachel, Rachel and Adam. Although his father died when he was very young, leaving an unresolved grief in his heart, Rachel’s father, Lawrence, has embraced him like a son, even hired him to work as an attorney in his firm. They are as close as in-laws could be. The marriage in a year will seal the deal, and bring the families even closer.“There was no life event—marriage, birth, parenthood, or loss—through which one need ever walk alone. Twenty-five people were always poised to help. The other side of interference was support.”In walks the prodigal cousin, returned from New York, Ellie Schneider (Ellen Olenska in AOI), a twenty-two-year old statuesque, bottle-blonde beauty. She was kicked out of the MFA creative writing program at Columbia for making a skin flick that surfaced, and is mantled with controversy for her ongoing affair with a famous married art dealer in NY, a scandal that is about to hit the media, and started when she was only sixteen. She dresses provocatively, which doesn’t go down well with the relatives at synagogue, especially on a High Holy holiday such as Yom Kippur, where this novel opens. Adam is transfixed and ignited by the sight of her even as he is repelled and intimidated by her cavalier independence from the strictures and reproaches of their insular community. He cannily aspires to accidentally on purpose run into Ellie, bringing himself closer and closer into dangerous territory, like in AGE OF INNOCENCE. They develop a muted, cryptic, but inwardly tender kinship, circling around each other, chastely, also similar in spirit to Wharton’s book. Meanwhile, Rachel’s wedding plans are irritating him, because he wants to be married “quickly” and without fanfare, to be wed and put stray longings to rest. Segal paints a vivid portrait of this clannish society’s mores, although most of the secondary characters are set pieces to further the story. There’s Ziva, the 88-year-old grandmother, (Rachel’s), an erudite immigrant who survived the Holocaust; Adam’s mother, still a grieving widow after all these years, and other people that serve as color and background or to advance the plot. The middle section moves gradually, perhaps stiffly at times, and includes a few hard-to-swallow events. For example, Lawrence put Adam on as Ellie's private attorney, to help clean up her scandals, if possible, and do damage control to her public persona. No matter how much Lawrence trusts Adam, I can't imagine any man placing his almost son-in-law in the position of private confidante to the provocative Ellie. Lawrence is quite socially conservative and protective of his own family. Even if he can trust Adam, why throw him to the lions? There's support and then there's just not thinking. In the author's defense, Archer helped Ellie in AOI, but, here, it feels inorganic.You don’t have to be Jewish to like this theme-driven novel. The characters, actually, are universal, as are the conflicts that this book explores, mainly certainty in traditional values versus uncertainty in following your passion, the fallout of lingering grief, and the impact that your decisions have on others. Segal also included a subplot that reflects the economic casualties of our times, but if felt a bit forced, a plot-driven convenience.This is a solid, four-star first novel, and it doesn’t distract by being an updated version of a classic. Rather, the presence of the older novel serves to illuminate that some things, at its heart, haven’t changed, even if the décor is renovated and a century has passed. Segal has admirable control of her narrative, and her prose is clean and smooth. I look forward to her next novel.Thank you to Shelf Awareness for this copy from the publisher....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"May 13, 2012","May 13, 2012","May 13, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12190308-the-innocents

The characters aJane Urquhart has demonstrated in A MAP OF GLASS and THE UNDERPAINTER how a person can be transformed by the power of art and memory. The characters are sometimes made whole, or shattered, or both. In this fifth novel, her eccentric, parochial characters emerge from the harsh, often punishing 19th-century landscape of a pioneer community in Southwest Ontario and stretch to a modern monument of the 20th century. Her characters tend to be repressed, isolated, and sexually chaste, or go through a long period of continence after a brief, signifying affair in their youth.Father Gstir was sent by the voice of God and King Ludwig from the pastoral landscape of Bavaria to the outback of Ontario, to minister to German-Catholic communities. He lands in the valley of Shoneval, a farming and mill town of hard working people who haven't had the time or inclination to attend church, and lures them to Mass by arranging a Corus Christi procession that invites community participation and planning. We are introduced to Jospeh Becker, a farmer and wood-carver with a rare talent, who befriends Father Gstir and creates beautiful sculptures for the new church. The only thing missing for the priest is a bell. He is obsessed with acquiring one, as he was in Bavaria--and ignored by the King. His obsession is one of several character's fanatical desires in this book.The story progresses non-linearly, but with active forward movement. The structure allows for the background of each character to evolve in gentle installments, but with seamless clarity. Joseph desires to pass on his artisan skills to his son, Dieter, but it is Dieter's daughter, Klara, who blossoms quietly as a carver, and also learns to master tailoring from her grandmother. Her brother, Tilman, named for the great sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider, is too restive to stay and make figures-in-the-round from limewood; he is a wanderlust, and leaves the family when he is twelve after his parents chain him to the barn for roaming too frequently and too far from home.""I went for a walk...I followed the road.""As he wandered, he embraced the spines of hills and the language of water; he related to a bridge and compared it to home:""He loved that bridge with a child's love, the way a boy will love a tree house...But he loved it too in a way peculiar to his own nature, because it gave him shelter without closing him in. There were no impenetrable walls, no doors that might contain locks.""Tilman becomes a hobo, and learns a lesson about love from unusual events. He meets another tramp, Refuto, on his travels, who enfolds him into his big, Italian, warm-hearted family. Tilman works in stoveworks for a while with Refuto's son, Girogio, trying to tame his meandering spirit, but then takes off to join as a soldier in WW 1. The prodigal son's return is fraught with meaning and a courageous stride into the future.Klara Becker, an attractive seamstress, has worked on a wood carving of a medieval abess for over twenty years, and finally abandons it to the barn with her grief intact. Her sorrow and subsequent repression stems from a tragic relationship with a young man, Eamon O'Sullivan, when she was twenty. Eamon was seduced by aeroplanes into WW 1, and departs to follow a burning dream of becoming a pilot. She devotes herself to the church and to her seamstress activities, and embraces her spinster self. The sculpture is consigned to loss.""All her faith was gone and with it the desire for carving, for making something spiritual out of wood. With Eamon lost, she felt connected to no one.""The themes of the story come together in the third part of the novel, near Arras, France, where sculptor Walter Allward is commissioned to create a monument to the Canadian soldiers who died at Vimy Ridge during WW1. Urquhart synthesizes the real life Allward into her novel to herald a compelling story of loss cumulating into redemption, obsession into letting go, repression into passion, and the prevailing, ubiquitous power of memory and the salvation of art.At first, I had difficulty adjusting to the last part of the novel, which removed me from the charming village of Shovenal. However, Urquhart convinced me, ultimately, by carrying her motifs and themes to this climactic achievement in history, a monument of memory, arranged by the obsessive Allward but animated by his artisans. Even the change from wood-carving to marble is symbolic, as the dead stone is brought to life in significant, poignant ways. There is so much to discuss about the final chapters, but it is difficult to do without adding spoilers.Allward: ""Carve it with your heart then...Let it go out of your heart and into the stone."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"May 10, 2012","May 12, 2012","May 10, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/116491.The_Stone_Carvers

Born in in Rochester, NY, around the turn of the twentieth century, his fertile experiences took place in New York, Ontario, and a tiny island called Silver Islet on Lake Superior in Canada.He was influenced by two eminent artists with diametrically opposed views; Rockwell Kent, who believed that art and life were exuberant mirrors of each other, and Robert Henri, who had the most austere philosophy toward art--isolate, don't share your vision or your heart, keep it all for your art. Fraser's turmoil has roots in his internal struggle to choose which artist to emulate philosophically.The novel, written from Fraser's point of view, resonates with a haunting, glacial regret and deep sorrow, a Munch scream in the gloaming of his life. The layers of the novel are stunning, astonishing, and cohere and accrete in an evocative inversion to the artist's style of painting. Urquhart's writing commands this novel so eloquently, so exquisitely, I felt Fraser's old bones nearly shatter on the icy, boreal frontiers of his life.Each character is finely, lucidly drawn, nuanced men and women that pierce the landscape with immeasurable poignancy and stoic hearts. They are so well-developed that they live in my heart like imperishable ghosts. Sarah Pengelly was Fraser's model for fifteen years, a steadfast miner's daughter living in obscurity in an outpost island. Fraser stole from her while never giving of himself-- her flesh, the muscular sinew of her calf, the soft vulnerability of her wrist, her mouth, her color, her shadow.He met George Kearns in Ontario, a painter of china who managed his father's china shop. Fraser held George in mild contempt, accusing him of not being a ""real"" artist. Fraser barely scratched the surface of his dearest friend, so busy was he being an arrogant artist and self-made enigmatic recluse. He never knew the carnage that Kearns witnessed in WW1, but George's friend, Augusta Moffet, knew. Kearns shares a deep, melancholic suffering with this war nurse that underscores the story with a lethal glow that, ironically, haunts the reader with its almost imperceptible defiance of the narrator.Jane Urquhart is the daughter of a prospector/mining engineer, which explains the mining motif and landscape she uses so fluently in several of her books.""Art is a kind of mining...The artist a variety of prospector searching for the sparkling silver of meaning in the earth.""And Urquhart uses a keen blend of environment and social observance to render her landscape.""There is always a moment of wholeness, recollected when the world is torn, raw-edged, broken apart, a moment when the tidiness, the innocence of landscape--sometimes of the society that created the landscape--allows you to predict with accuracy the discord to come.""This is a complex, gradually disclosing story of epic loss, and also a terrifying confession of a man who, over the course of the novel, discloses himself intimately, all his ugly, disturbing truths, so that you know him, hate him, pity him, in all his superciliousness-- and you will be moved, possibly, to forgive him....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,May 2012,"May 04, 2012","May 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/116486.The_Underpainter

Her CV includes (but not limited Sixty-five-year-old Karen Hollander is an attorney with Type I diabetes, a heavyweight résumé and a Wikipedia entry. Her CV includes (but not limited to) author of four best-selling books, dean of a law school, a corporate lawyer in a powerful law firm, and U.S. Justice Department official. She’s divorced, with accomplished, brilliant children, and she’s devoted to her granddaughter, Waverly, a seventeen-year-old on her way to becoming a likeness of the achieving Karen (with some cute malapropisms that Karen corrects). The book is told from Hollander’s narrative perspective, as a memoir, to gradually divulge a dangerous secret surrounding her activist activities in 1967, an undisclosed event that caused her to turn down a nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. This secret, she feels, has emotionally crippled her (and likely the former friends involved). Andersen’s rugged skill and talent is displayed here, as he gradually develops a taut, thriller-type story that will keep you turning the pages, and echoes a past that surely is more passionate than its future.If you enjoy stories about the 1960’s hippie/activist days, you will revel in the revolutionary spirit of the counterculture era--protests, sit-ins, intellectual debates--together with thought-provoking ideas that pad the story, but add to the theme and successfully loop into the narrative. Additionally, Karen’s 007-role-playing missions with her best friends, Alex and Chuck, define her pre-college years and add colorful background to the story. Their friendship was cemented during these risky and adventurous events that began in Wilmette, near Chicago, and peaked as Harvard freshmen. She now lives in LA.Because of Andersen’s tight pacing and architecture, I was engaged in the story. But I was unconvinced with the incongruous voice of Karen. Hollander's résumé and leanings have all the makings of a Hillary Clinton (inside a size-6 body resembling a 45-ish Julie Christie). At Hollander's age and achievements, one would expect her memoir's tone to be serious, mature, and intellectually sober, and to reflect the weight of the story. Instead, her narrative voice/tone is an octave too high and young and much too coy and chipper for her judicial years and leadership, not to mention the import of subject matter and this burdensome secret. Of all the voices for Andersen to imbue in Hollander, this contradictory one undermines the gravity of the story and the magnitude of her character. Try to imagine Clinton personifying a college freshman on a sleepover, terrified of spilling the awful travesty of Spring Break. No way! Yes, way! And Hollander periodically speaks in colloquialisms like ""grok.""“Living here [in LA] makes me feel as if I’m always getting away with something. What I now clearly see—note to book clubs” [italicized]—“is a major theme of my life.”The seminal incident of her life happened when Karen was 18, but she is telling it as a fully mature and accomplished woman. It is gnawing to hear her narrate a memoir in a teenaged tone, bright with a cavalier spirit that alternates with calculated contrition. Moreover, there’s too much authorial intrusion as apology—we are coaxed to acknowledge her self-blame, but her role as a martyr is too canny and deliberate. Hollander’s past is part of the suspension of disbelief, but you are seduced to go along with it by an affecting, historic chronicle of heady 60’s activism. However, Hollander’s supernova status renders the rest of the characters pale and straw in comparison, as if they were set up primarily to prop up Karen’s immeasurable gifts. She hooks up with an ex-boyfriend, who she hasn’t actually seen in a decade, because he has the highest form of secret government clearance, “my friend the senior national security and intelligence-community apparatchik,” as she needs his acquisitive talents to provide secret documents to her. It was too fantastic to accept that he would so easily defy his coda to help her. The author of the ripe and historical HEYDAY, a resonant novel of the 19th century with a credible female protagonist, is not as successful in drawing out a lead woman character in this second novel. It’s hard to be a true believer, but the tight plot and vivid walk down memory lane convinced me of its earnest desire, if not its plausibility. The wobbly credibility was eased by moments of sensitive introspection about a time that is now too often remembered with bumper sticker slogans and vintage fashion. The heart of the story—of a woman who dares to tell the truth in 2013, an era of avatars and fabrications, Facebook and Twitter--and risk her spotless professional legacy--managed to almost balance the false notes with an exuberant belief in itself.

After his father died in the silver mines of the Oregon Territory when Talmadge was nine, he came to this fertile valley at the foothills of the Cascade Mountains (Washington State) in 1857 with his mother and sister. Within the next eight years, he suffered from smallpox, his mother died of illness, and his sister later disappeared in the forest, never to return. This is Talmadge's story, and the saga of his chosen family, borne from the blood of loss and abuse.Two young pregnant teenagers, Della and Jane, enter Talmadge’s life in his middle-aged years. They steal fruit from him at market, where he sells the apricots, apples, and plums from his sweeping acreage of crops. A bit of a touch and go, cat and mouse game ensues, as they follow him home, hide, and emerge when they are hungry, only to scamper and scatter away again, staying close to the edges of his property. Talmadge gradually gains, if not Della and Jane’s trust (they have a harrowing history of ritual abuse), then a tentative acceptance, and they become inhabitants of the orchard, living alongside Talmadge. He becomes their loyal benefactor.If I give any more of the plot progression, it will proceed into spoiler territory. The story bears its fruit gradually, almost meditatively, during the first two sections (135 or so pages). There are eight sections in all, but some are long and pensive, and some short, at times just a few pages. The middle sections compress the years into thumbnail sketches without losing its stirring effect on the reader. The story is told in a quiet and nearly oblique manner, yet without being detached. The overall effect is powerful, and it rumbles fiercely, and menacingly, at intervals, without open sentimentality. The characters evolve delicately, with contemplative subtlety.“Through glances she had caught various features—his nose, the set of his shoulders, the striking color of his eyes. But he had one of those complicated faces that one had to consider at length to understand how emotion lay on it, to understand it at all. It was like a landscape: that wide and complicated, many-layered expanse.”The land is essential to the story—the planting of seeds, the cultivation, and the harvest. The orchard is Talmadge’s lifeblood, and a ripe motif for the burgeoning love he has for the family that has germinated from the edges of his vast plantation. Nature and nurture merge, and the repository of grief yokes to the deep basin of humanity and from there, the kernels of love grow and reproduce.At times, as I reflect on the ending, I am troubled by the author’s choices, but so goes the cycle of life in its order and perplexity....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2012","Apr 19, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13540215-the-orchardist

Here’s the authThis blazing, colossal creation was originally self-published by a vanity press in 2008, and left to hang in obscurity for four years. Here’s the author’s bio:“Sergio De La Pava is a writer who does not live in Brooklyn.” Consider that Brooklyn is the writer’s writers’ colony of Pulitzer and other award-stamped writers, the borough of billboard blockbusters and earnest publicity favorites scratching out their lines between the lines of the backlit white box. And, all this time, La Pava was under the radar, his brain a sapient submarine with the torqued turbines whirring, writing the most spectacular linguistic blitzkrieg of a novel that I have encountered in the past decade (or more). Too bad publicity counts for so much, because the only introduction he needs is this phenomenal, audacious, achingly humane book to speak for itself.It reads like defiance with a deep, scalding, tender, moral center. As in David Foster Wallace’s INFINITE JEST, it is full of subversive philosophical digressions and anarchic linguistic feats, while invoking the acute probity that penetrated and pervaded Wallace’s seminal work of postmodern fiction. But he does not mimic DFW. De La Pava has his own style that also pays homage to Wallace, as well as others such as Pynchon and Gaddis, but other than recognizing that he is the literary stepson or nephew or cousin to this group of writers, you observe that he is the master of his own insurgent narrative.How refreshing that the back cover of the novel doesn’t spell out the plot and spoil the adventure of discovery. My intention is to just give a whiff, provoke you to read this book. If you like unconventional, genre-bending, linguistic acrobatics, you’ll delight in this novel. De La Pava combines a bracing book of ideas with a thrilling crime caper, which is at the root of the novel’s digressions. So if you also want a driven, page-turning, heated suspense, you will be blissed out with the white-knuckle, fist-clenching plot at the center of the story.You follow twenty-four-year-old Casi (no last name given) in every scene, a brilliant public defender in the Manhattan criminal justice system, circa 2002 (but it never states that). There’s lots of dialogue—it actually begins with a typical day at work for Casi, with dialogue as the main narrative thrust, and the injustices of the justice system a scorching context that is so absurd as to be authentic. Wait—actually, it is so authentic as to be absurd. Anyway, it is ripe and thoroughly engaging with easy access right from the pages to the courthouse. If you like THE WIRE, you will like this breezy but blistering exchange of voices. Casi’s negotiations with drug-addled, impoverished criminals and nefarious judges illuminate just how inverted and perverted morality and justice can be. It’s an unfiltered colloquy that self-critiques with its nakedness, and reads unplugged like the basement tapes of the New York justice system.Don’t forget it has a sinewy, chewy center. You won’t be able to breathe as you get nearer and nearer and then immerse in the wily, implausible, but believable and mad, madcap, tense, intense, heart-racing, unstoppable mischievous pole vault of tomfoolery at its core. Oh, and the beauty, the unutterable beauty of the novel as a whole.De La Pava’s novel radiates a rogue nobility and optimism through all the muck--humanity eclipsing the corruption and toxicity of bureaucracy and entertainment, Television with a capital T, justice with a capital punishment. It hits the upper and lower registers of the heart and soul with a moving potency. De La Pava can talk about anything and make it interesting. I am now well-informed about middleweight boxing, a sport I had no interest in before, but the author blends it in like allegory. Casi is flawed, as are all these true-to-life and larger-than-life characters, but graced with a clemency and charm that is displayed when he is with his family, mostly Colombian immigrants with a rich vernacular and sumptuous recipe for empanadas. Casi’s interactions with family serve as a luminous contrast to his work life, adding a dimension of emotional vulnerability to Casi’s character that also kindles and reflects his conscience.Imagine what this encyclopedic novel can encompass and it is probably there. Philosophy, media, crime, entertainment, love, intelligence, The Honeymooners, boxing, psychology, physics and more. The author navigates the 21st century without including cell phones, computers (and emails), and no mention of 9/11! Yay!This book is a recipe for singular pleasure, enjoyable whether naked or clothed. Remarkable, towering, darkly comical, heartbreaking.

Tall and straight and healthy due to daily, rigorous swimming (in youth, he swam competitively), he yet feels obsolete, inconsequential to the world at large. The death of his wife and the closing of his forty-three year career as a teacher torment him and create a hollow loneliness in his soul, and he has become quite eccentric. He was the best kind of devoted teacher, the one you wish for your children, and perhaps witnessed once in all your studies: the instructor who cared passionately about his students, and would go to vast creative lengths to turn his students onto poetry and theater, like Chaucer and Shakespeare, even if he had to use contemporary music and pop culture to bring the bygone near to the students and close the academic gap.Still plucky after all these years, he places a newspaper ad, seeking “adoption” (room, board, meals) in exchange for tutoring. After some strange and perturbing offers, he accepts the best of them, to tutor the sixteen-year-old son of a very wealthy couple in Vancouver, a good kid who is nevertheless distracted with soccer and a recurring role in an LA TV series, one that is gearing up to giving him a more vital part in the show. This requires Thorstad to spend time in la-la land with the lad, Travis, and compete for time to prepare him for exams with a high-strung producer who wants Travis to prepare exclusively for his expanding role. Academics be damned!This is a coming of twilight/golden age, a second chance for Alex, blended with the subordinate (yet, at times, symbiotic) storyline of Travis’ coming-of age story. There’s the push-pull of exasperation emanating from both young and old, and all the while Alex is coming to terms with his own past. Son of a Hollywood 1930’s stuntman who died in a fall before Alex was born, he always wanted to know more about his father. He is a movie aficionado, also sweet on memories of his first love, a (now elderly) actress who is somewhere in LA. Inundated with memories, Alex continues to have private “conversations” with his dead wife, Elena, who is both tart and lively as a ghost of a voice.This is just a small portion of what this novel contains as far as adventure. The homeless population plays a crucial role on Estevan Island, and in Vancouver, where Travis volunteers at a homeless shelter to prepare for his role as a civic, outspoken homeless teen on TV. Then there are the drug traffickers and real-estate developers juxtaposed or intertwined with the homeless scenes, all providing background scaffolding for social edification. Best of all is the protagonist, bursting with moxie and an undying love for teaching. At times, the social messages in the book are too pronounced or transparent, and the relationship between Travis and Axel didn’t resonate as convincingly as I would have liked. There were a few convenient turns in the plot and a few feigned surprises that strained to fit in a too-tidy ending. I would highly recommend this for a light but astute insight into what it means to be elderly or young, and on a bewildered search for belonging, relevance, and eternal happy endings for all ages....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 18, 2012","Apr 26, 2012","Apr 13, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7881736-the-master-of-happy-endings

LITTLE BEE was a poweReviewers who have read LITTLE BEE will feel compelled to compare the two books, not in subject matter, but in caliber or merit. LITTLE BEE was a powerful, keen, fresh, and original story that remains one of my most esteemed of 2009. GOLD has a similar architectural structure and captive writing style (but is in third person rather than first). The breaks within chapters headed in bold font are familiar, the soaring, poetic, exquisite metaphors and fluent writing resonates, and a young girl engrossed in Star Wars in order to cope (vs a young boy immersed in Batman in LITTLE BEE). However, GOLD's story, while thematically ripe, is prosaic, as well as so implausible at its heart that I lamented at the reductive and ultimately predictable turns of events.Kate and Zoe have been best friends for 15 years--they met when they were 19, as Olympic contenders in cycling, and now they are 32, both going for the Gold again, although Zoe has several from previous Olympics in Athens and Beijing, as well as National victories. Kate is married to Jack, same age, same historical introduction (all three met simultaneously), another Gold champ, and they have a daughter, Sophie, who is 8, and has leukemia. She was first diagnosed four years ago, but after the first treatment, had been in remission until now.****WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER(S) ALERT.***** This is my first  that requires a spoiler alert, but it felt necessary. So, here goes. For those who have already read the book, or don't plan to, here are the reasons I can't believe the thrust of the narrative:Cleave attempts to tacitly portray Zoe with PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) due to the sudden, accidental death of her brother, Adam, when they were bicycling as kids. She feels responsible, and has buried her emotions. All her disturbing character traits are supposed to stem from there. She has betrayed Kate and Jack numerous times over the years, including an attempt to win Jack over when they first met, only because she knew Kate wanted him. She sabotaged Kate in a race by sending a text to herself from Jack's phone, and she slept with Jack (before Kate and Jack were married, but still...), and other invidious acts. Cleave inadvertently portrayed her with Borderline Personality Disorder--she fits a textbook case (I am also a psychiatric nurse)--a dangerous person to be involved with. She also has some Narcissistic Personality Disorder Traits.So, when Zoe gets pregnant from her one time sex with Jack (groan right there), she decides to go through with the pregnancy, at the advice of her coach, Tom, the almost-straw character inserted as much to telegraph platitudes as to coach the women. And then gives up the baby to Jack and Kate. Kate becomes the legal mother. However, Zoe is unstable and disturbed. In this case, Kate should have felt threatened from day one. Moreover, Zoe, in her present psychic state and track record--the behaviors she regularly displays, and the competition and envy she has over Jack and Kate's lives--would have played all sorts of mind games with Kate and Jack through the years regarding Sophie. What a fierce weapon for an unbalanced woman who tends to play dirty.So, Kate and Jack take the baby--oh, and the press believes that Zoe had a stillborn, and that somehow Kate and Jack gave birth. So, Kate and Zoe continue their ""friendship,"" no tension there about Sophie? The only tension seems to be when they race each other. Cleave, in what I consider a mistake, chose to save this fact about Zoe being Sophie's bio mother until near the end, in the penultimate chapters. That handicapped the narrative from any conversation that would steer toward this fact, all throughout the book, with all three of them. (But, ironically, this supposed secret from the reader was painfully obvious early on.) Yet, Zoe is present to support Sophie and the parents through these trying times with Sophie's leukemia. It feels false, renders the story as disingenuous. This doesn't affect Zoe emotionally, we are told, as Cleave gave her an out, which is Adam's death.Zoe has nothing to live for, so to speak, except her triumphs at the velodromes. Yet, the narrative starts being an apologist for Zoe, as the pages turn, softening her at convenient times. In 2012, as the two women cycle for the chance at a spot in London's Olympics, and Kate's last chance to finally win the Gold, Kate falls from her bike at the deciding race, and yet Zoe slowed down to let her catch up! And then Kate wins by 1/1000th of a second! So, now Zoe gets bitter and vengeful and decides she is going to battle for custody of Sophie and tell Sophie she is her real mother, while Sophie is hanging on for dear life at hospital? The only thing that stops her is she passes out when she sees how sick Sophie is.All of this--and, yet, not only does everyone live happily ever after, but Zoe, Kate, and Jack remain dear friends. Zoe is cured by dealing with her brother's death, and years later (2015), when Sophie is 11, Zoe is coaching the healthy Sophie at the velodrome to be a competitive cyclist. This is too velodramatic to believe.*****END OF SPOILER ALERT ******************************************Due to the contrivances and conveniences of character and story, the incredulous twists and turns that are telegraphed and predictable, it was largely unsuccessful to me as a story. Yet, I read every page! Cleave is a lovely writer of prose (although the dialogue was self-conscious and seemed aimed at the cinema), and his metaphors about time undulate elegantly throughout. His themes of success, loss, and the sacrifices we make for love are poignant, and at times emerge radiantly from the melodramatic soap opera. His writing (style) is as assured as ever, and his heart is in the right place. ...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,not set,"Apr 29, 2012","Apr 13, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12968662-gold

I do not want to cull its deep meaning, or relate its heartfelt epiphanies (that are often the pat formula of Hollywood movies about pilgrimages), or take the act of reading this radiant memoir and subordinate it to some communal bonding experience or spiritual raison d'être. Nor do I want to press it into any subjective and universal poignancy. Well, okay, ancient roads beckon a young man.The title of the book is the best place to start, and to be--as in, physical navigation from one fixed point to the next. It also addresses the form of the text; the title is both meditative and concrete. From the first impudent page of the book, I want to be with Gideon--temporally, actively, while it moves from here to there. At times, I wanted to whisper softly in his ear, howl, snort, and tell him that I savored every luminous passage, and adore the David Foster Wallace quote.The one unifying experience that the pilgrim has with everyone else on a pilgrimage is movement and forwardness to the next point (and often, blisters and other bodily pains). The author's talent of shaping his odysseys into a coherent and thematic story beguiled and compelled me from start to finish.Whatever higher ground and questions you start out with on a 790 km pilgrimage will bump up against physical exertions, discomfort, and pain that tethers you to real time as you are moving in a geographical direction. You are grounded in the present. The crises of the past and the crossroads of the future are not as urgent as putting one foot in front of the other. There are riveting moments that peel Gideon down to doubt. Lewis-Kraus avoids sweeping clichés about destiny and keeps it real. Getting a grasp of ""why"" he is doing this creates some arch ruminations about his journey. Part of the purpose of the sojourn is to heal the wounds with his father and move on.Gideon's terse wit and vigorous pace steer the reader into the story, which unfolds more like a novel than a memoir. That's another reason it worked so well for me (I usually prefer fiction). I was taken by the crisp velocity of a storyline structure, and relieved by the bustling absence of earnest messages. The book opens to Gideon's disaffected years in the Berlin bars and art scene, the hearty glimpses into his profligate stagnation. He describes living in the city as ""an infinitely long weekend with your parents out of town ... The old crimes licensed you to ignore the claims of the past; the low cost of living licensed you to ignore the demands of the present; and the future was something that would happen when we moved back to New York, where many of us would once more live in uncomfortable proximity to our actual parents.""His drunk decision to embark on the Camino jump-starts his triumph over inertia. Once you start reading, I can't imagine anywhere you'd rather be than on the itinerant heels of Gideon's brio and in the footfalls of his ambivalence. He has a candid, lyrical way of honoring language and worldview as partners in the fungible context of life and also of provoking you like an impish pied piper. It's a disobedient mix of irreverence and gravitas which will appeal to iconoclasts and offspring and dads of all ages.I won this book in a lottery giveaway on Shelf Awareness.

As memories of Leo float through the narrative, old resentments and new secrets float to the top like crude oil in a jar of hearts. Henkin didn’t break any new contextual ground here. He was going for the familiar themes of loss, perseverance, understanding, love despite all, forgiveness, and redemption within a garden-variety package tied up with some stock twine. You’ve seen this family before in domestic dramas: the 21st century elite, pedigreed, liberal, secular family with a few black sheep conservatives. Just about all the Ivy League or first tier colleges are represented, and those who didn’t obtain their PhDs or MDs are smarter than the ones who did. One of the three beautiful daughters, Noelle, seems overtly fabricated. Henkin is trying to convince the reader that Noelle was once a sex-obsessed alley cat who moved to Israel and, par to the characteristic flip side of the personal coin, became an Orthodox Jew, with the support of her American husband, also turned Orthodox Jewish. A portrayal of two extremes in one person is not an unusual profile, and in fact is a prevalent human composition.However, I was not convinced that first-incarnation Noelle was anything but a free spirit--refreshing and curious, independent and phase-healthy. Her morphing into a compulsive Orthodox, adhering so rigidly that they even bring their own Kosher food from Israel to this weekend, rejecting the Kosher food offered by her parents, was patently unbelievable. Henkin was attempting to show a woman who, at different times, embraced opposite ends of the same continuum. But, I never felt he authenticated second-incarnation Noelle with the antecedent, obsessive traits required to appropriate her inflexible, almost morbid religiosity.Leo’s parents, Marilyn and David, age 69, plan to announce their impending divorce to the clan. The author was demonstrating the statistically frequent rate of divorce that occurs between couples that have lost a child. But, Leo was not a child—he had a wife and child of his own. And, the elders’ breakup seemed contrived; it wasn’t convincingly organic, but rather a limply constructed story device.There were other scenes and events that felt hatched rather than natural. It had the mainstream moue of a nighttime series, a repackaged but prosaic, recycled SISTERS BROTHERS-type entertainment. MINOR SPOILER PARAGRAPH. The biggest stretch was to accept Thisbe’s (the widow) Calvinistic-type altruism in the face of a gift of two-hundred thousand dollars from the obscenely rich matriarch, 94-yr-old Gretchen, mother of David. Gretchen gave this check to Thisbe some time after Leo died, with no overt strings attached. Sure, with Gretchen, there were always Machievellian manipulations. But at 94? How menacing could she really be?? Again, another contrivance that I didn’t believe. And, the struggling grad student Thisbe, raising her and Leo’s son, refusing to cash the check out of issues of guilt, because she had fallen in love again at age thirty-two? She was barely getting by in Berkeley with her new partner. I find it difficult to swallow Thisbe’s altruism, her rationale for refusing help for her and Leo’s son, at least!Henkin has a way with words--the figurative and aphoristic turn of phrase. These delightful nuggets peppered the story throughout, and provided a prose-rich sum of parts. However, the story itself remained rather bland and predictable. The memorial service, which was the intended highlight of the gathering, was anti-climactic, buttressed largely by the individual tributes. The sentiments weren’t enough to depict the event, except sketchily, and gave the special day a static representation.The novel, while eloquent at intervals, did not consummately satisfy. Instead, the conventional arc was held together with chiefly reductive portraits and some pithy dialogue. A bit banal, with reflective moments. 3.25Thank you to Net Galley for providing me an e-copy....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Apr 11, 2012","Apr 12, 2012","Apr 11, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13151579-the-world-without-you

He loathes Nazi Germany, but has orders to serve and protect the Reich, and feels like an imposter, a blur of who he was before the crimes that he was commanded to execute in Belorussia. Nazi newspapers trumpet their clarion call that “the Jews are our misfortune,” while Germany struggles to maintain their strength against the advancing Russian army. Berlin is barely recognizable, with everything in short supply-- watery coffee; minted chalk for toothpaste; powdered milk like sawdust; tiny shards of soap—“even the prettiest girl smelled like a stevedore”--and worst of all, brackish, sour, ersatz beer. You couldn’t even get drunk to escape the pain. Moreover, the streets have eyes and the walls have ears; incautious words and ambiguous acts could get you in serious trouble, or dead.Bernie Gunther is called up to Prague to serve as bodyguard to Reinhard Heydrich, Reichsprotector and head of the SS. He despises and fears him, but there is no choice but to abide. He is in the middle of investigating the death of a foreign railway worker in Berlin when he leaves. He is also falling for a beautiful woman, Arianne, whose life he saved from a perp who may be connected to the railway worker’s death. She is as inscrutable as Gunther, and thereby irresistible. He invites her to go to Prague with him, and he discreetly plants her at a hotel suite. At Heydrich’s country house, he is surrounded by the Reich’s most abhorrent officials, including four of Heydrich’s adjutants. A cocktail party serves up more than expected, and compels Bernie into a dicey assignment (no spoilers, so I am being circumspect). This is where the hardboiled style and wit are curtailed. Gunther has been given carte blanche to interrogate the lives and ask no-holes-barred questions of these top officials. A surfeit of details in Gunther’s investigation at the country house occasionally reads like the filling in of dossiers, and becomes too self-aware and telegraphic. The limited movement of the country house setting adds to the officiousness of it all. The noir-like atmosphere dissipates as the narrative style changes; the pace becomes uneven, sluggish at times, and loses its edge. The most enigmatic character, Arianne, shrinks from a spicy, intriguing character into a stock set piece for two-thirds of the novel. However, Kerr delivers up a cogent denouement, harking back to the hardboiled style once again and provoking a possible storyline for the next novel. I had begun to slouch in my chair, until the climax put me right back on the edge.This is my first Kerr novel, but I am interested in pursuing more of the Bernie Gunther series, especially the first three books, which were well received. Apparently, the Gunther series is not written in chronological order, as the last book, FIELD GRAY, took place in the 1950’s. 3.75...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Mar 2012,"Apr 09, 2012",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/11448085-prague-fatale

I treasure cold-weather settings in literature with abundant ice and snow, and this Alaskan frontier farm locale engages with a spartan but stirring ambiance. Set in 1920, the central characters are Mabel and Jack, a childless couple in their late forties whose only shot at parenthood ended in a stillborn child ten years ago.The couple are stoic and resigned; a melancholy impassiveness distinguishes their relationship and colors their days. They moved from the Allegheny River Valley to this outpost in order to solidify their emotional solitude into a physical one. However, Mabel is even more depressed, and Jack is like a bridge of sighs. Until...One day, Jack and Mabel have a playful moment in the midst of a snowstorm. They throw snowballs at each other and build a snowgirl. Overnight, the snowstorm obscures the snow child, concealing the details, and a live girl has darted out of the dark spruce woods wearing the mittens and scarf that adorned their creation. Is she real? A figment of their imagination? Did they create her out of desire and grief, and make her genuine?On the cusp of the little girl's appearance, George and Esther Benson and their three boisterous boys enter Mabel and Jack's quiet, lonely orbit. Esther takes an immediate liking to Mabel, and inveigles her out of her reticent shell, while George's help on the farm encourages Jack. Their lives open up, and Esther's frank, guileless composure inspires Mabel's confidence. The novel's elegiac tone is laced with an enchanting buoyancy and clemency. On the periphery, still, lurks the little snow child, whose impact will be magical and palpable.The prose is flawless and natural, suffused with the remote beauty and polar clarity of the region. Ivey's ability to layer the ice and snow with exquisite, somber symmetry will give you a warm chill as you hear the fire crackling on a frosty winter's night. The white dusting of flakes fall with a hush through the bitter cold, and subsides to a thicket of green during the spring melt. Lynx, fox, wolverines, moose, rabbits, and more, scurry through the hinterland, dotting the landscape with fur and wildness. The glacial, glistening allure of Alaska and the graceful alacrity of the snow child will thaw even hard and icy hearts....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Apr 06, 2012","Apr 11, 2012","Apr 06, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11250053-the-snow-child

And so begins the expedition of Ellis Hock, to the southernmost part of a southern province, home of the Sena people, in a land of few clothes and elaborate dance rituals. He is White Man and Mwamuna wa Njoka—Snake Man; Ellis was known during his Peace Corps years for his deft handling and collection of black mambas, green mambas, puff adders, spitting cobras, the swimming sun snake, the egg-eating wolf-snake, the boomslang mbobo, and the nsato, or rock python. Hock had a knack and a confidence to govern these scaly reptiles. Ellis was also recognized for building a school, and initiating plans for a medical clinic and paved roads. He regarded himself as a savior of sorts, the benefactor of a poverty stricken village. But did he know himself then, and the people he lived with and taught. He is confident that he will be received with open arms on his return, that his goodwill and proprietary feelings about the region, about Africa, would be recognized and embraced.The novel of Ellis’ return to Malobo is full of surprises. Be prepared for an unorthodox narrative, unvarnished and bold, stripped of the political correct approach of progressives and alms-givers, including the well-meaning philanthropists who patronize the less fortunate, who are ignorant of their own contribution to apathy and greed—unenlightened (because of their phlegmatic sense of charity) that these uneducated, indigent people are not much different from you or me at the core. You will peer inside the militaristic supply depots necessitated by do-gooder celebrities who spread their money and smiles and food drops without having a clue about the complex nature of the regional customs and hierarchies.Other works that have influenced this book have been mentioned in many s, such as Conrad’s HEART OF DARKNESS and Graham Green’s THE HEART OF THE MATTER. Theroux’s chronicled travelogue through Africa, DARK STAR SAFARI, reflects many of the themes in this story—of return, and a desire to redeem lost youth. There is also a vivid allusion to William Golding’s LORD OF THE FLIES, a ripe and menacing glimpse into primitive culture. It reminded me of a few select lines in the movie APOCALPYSE NOW, from General Corman:“Because there's a conflict in every human heart, between the rational and the irrational, between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.”Hock’s trek to his idealized paradise is an unforgettable life lesson, written with intelligence and raw clarity. Theroux can be a bit long-winded at times; he isn’t into economy of words. However, his technique serves the story well, with the subtle and nuanced delivery of a ruthless civilization, one that is all too ferociously human....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Apr 03, 2012","Apr 04, 2012",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13023201-the-lower-river

Patience is definitely an asset, and the payoff is exceptionally rewarding. The surreal, unique conceit takes the Holocaust as background and purpose and weaves a persuasive tale. Frank's oblique narrative approach is strange, and myth-like, so that the reader is initially at arm's length, bemused at what appears to be an inconceivable plot. However, it all comes together in a compelling, tender, plausible, and richly woven testament to humanity, hope, and love. Moreover, the themes are powerful and wholly relevant today.In northern Germany, in the thick of the woods and ten meters below the ground, is a mineshaft converted into a Compound. Sixty people who were headed for the death camps in Nazi Germany were spared because of their multilingual talents. Instead of deportation, they are ordered to the Compound to answer letters written by people in the camps, even though the senders and receivers are likely dead.Himmler and Hitler were obsessed with the occult and the astral plane. Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, has reasons for going along with it. Propaganda is crucial at this time when Germany is creating an atmosphere of denial, especially after their failure at Stalingrad. They want the letters for a twofold reason--to conceal the truth of the Final Solution via bogus documentation of life at the camps, and to pacify the dead. The Reich's preoccupation with orphic beliefs opens channels for this novel to make credible sense, as odd as that may seem, and for profound metaphors about the unearthly, concealed, hidden, and recondite to take form. What presents as fantastical myth transcends into sound verisimilitude.Elie Schacten, a Polish blonde beauty, is the central character in the book, and the Scribe that tethers the Compound to the world-at-large. She exchanges flirtations with SS officers in return for supplies and food for the Scribes, and when possible, assists refugees to escape from death. Her lover, Lodenstein, the Oberst of the Compound, is torn between concern for her safety aboveground and jealousy at her contrived flirtations with Nazis.Dieter Stumpf is the only member not a Scribe, because he doesn't know any foreign languages. He's a pitiful but dangerous buffoon who was demoted from Oberst to patrol guard, and who is outwitted by the Scribes at every turn. Stumpf dreams of decorated heroism and recognition by the Reich.The sense of place is riveting, from the Compound below the earth to the vast and midnight sky at night. I saw billions of stars and the changing phases of the moon, heard the footfalls in the snow, the crunch of crackling ice, and felt the dense wood of trees in the dark and haunting Black Forest.""It's a strange world...But we can never fall out of it because we live in it all the time.""""...what it felt like to fall out of a world made safe by human meaning. A fragile world...poised to fall apart.""This is not a history lesson, although the Holocaust is the catalyst for everything that happens. It is also an elegiac love story, a suspense thriller, a philosophical inquiry, a brush with the Cabala and a timeless, thought-provoking meditation on how the dead are remembered. It is darkly enchanting, intellectually stimulating and emotionally spellbinding.

BergstI get a kick out of women's shoes--the protrusions and spikes, the high fashion toes like ship's prows and the platforms like personal podiums. Bergstein's debut book on how shoes define women offers the reader a celebrity-infused history of our relationship to footwear. The diversity of shoes reflects something more than function and personal style; our choices are inextricably laced with desire and identified with social currency.Bergstein begins with Farragamo's humble beginnings in a small Italian village in 1907 and ends with the contemporary fascination with celebrities and the desire to emulate their expensive branding styles, specifically Sarah Jessica-Parker (aka Carrie Bradshaw) from the popular show, Sex and the City. The hit show put Manolo Blahnik on the map (Minolos), a high end designer whose eponymous shoes were referred to by Carrie Bradshaw as ""Hello, lover"" in one episode.A hefty section is devoted to the illustrious ruby slippers, including anecdotes on Judy Garland's career and her difficulty fitting in with the Hollywood definition of beauty, as well as the relatable themes of The Wizard of Oz during the Great Depression. Much of the history portrayed on the ruby slippers is common knowledge or easily accessible on Wikipedia. There isn't much that Bergstein wrote about this topic that I didn't already know.""It Girls"" like Marilyn Munroe, Audrey Hepburn, and Lana Turner, to the Olsen twins, Jessica-Parker and Naomi Campbell (and more) suffuse the pages with their soles. Peruvian painter, Alberto Vargas and his famous pin-up girls, or ""Varga girls,"" also had a huge influence on the shoes women desired during the mid-twentieth century.The ascendency of Jane Fonda's 1980's workout put trainers on the map, like Reebok, and later, Nike. Chuck Taylors and iconic Doc Martens are covered in some detail, also. Shoes commandeered by rock stars and grunge musicians; fashion models; movie stars; and even Wonder Woman illustrate the social agency of the wannabe culture that imitates. Boots, ballet shoes, sandals, stilettos, pumps, sling-backs, platforms, clogs, crocs--and even the World War II flat, practical shoe style adorn the pages.Bergstein writes in an affable style, creating an accessible narrative out of a chronological history. However, I thought this was going to have more of an anthropological context than it ultimately offered. Of course, celebrities love their Louboutins, the glossy red-soled status symbol of the new woman, and consumers have a rabid attraction to every shoe selected by Carrie Bradshaw. But, after a while, I tired of reading about celebrities.Although Bergstein, to her credit, talked about everything from Betty Friedan's Feminine Mystique to the disco culture and women's lib, some of these anecdotes strained to fit in with her central narrative. Sometimes she would veer off, i.e. talking about Judy Garland's weight problem or John Travolta's swagger, The Wizard of Oz appealing to a humble platitude of home and family, tidbits that are already well known or digressing from the premise.

She writes evocatively about solitary adults afflicted by damaged childhoods. Her novels go beyond the murder cases and weave layered tales about memories, the search for identity, the healing of broken families, and the social and economic issues of contemporary Ireland. Broken Harbor will satisfy old enthusiasts and hook new ones alike with its complex characters, detailed plot, moving themes and fresh, taut dialogue. The narrator is Detective Mick “Scorcher” Kennedy, a tough, flinty cop introduced in French’s third novel, Faithful Place. Here he is fleshed out as a media-savvy and taciturn (and surprisingly sensitive) crackerjack detective with a reputation to fix. He is assigned to a murder that occurred in the affluent but half-abandoned suburb of Brianstown, which used to be called Broken Harbor. This is sure to be a high profile case: the fatal stabbing of a family man, Patrick Spain, and the suffocation of his two young children. His wife, Jenny, a victim of multiple knife wounds, is in critical condition at the hospital’s intensive care unit.Kennedy has a resonant family history with BH, reaching back to childhood summer vacations with his mother (who died years ago) and two sisters. One sister, Dina, is emotionally unstable, volatile and flammable, and pops in unannounced at inconvenient times. Kennedy is protective of Dina, but her labile moods and confrontational behaviors are particularly vexing to him during this investigation. Each day that he works on the case has him scratching at the past, exposing his dark torments to the light, as he gets closer to the private lives of the Spain family.Kennedy chooses a rookie cop, Richie Curran, to help him solve the murder in an upscale housing development, one of many communities that have suffered from Dublin's economic recession. Patrick, they learn from Jenny's sister, Fiona, had been laid off from his job months ago, and the historically happy couple were challenged by recession-era fates. Does this factor into the murder? And why are there so many irregular holes in the walls?The story unfolds gradually, with dense and convoluted character descriptions buoyed by an unhurried pace. It begins with a fact-finding mission, as all her books do, and expands its focus to a poignant examination of family, as well as the socio-economic milieu of Dublin that affects the quality of everyday lives. From the quotidian to the uncommon, French’s story encompasses loss, love, and redemption, and wraps around the reader in an elaborate maze.All the books are loosely connected by a non-narrating character from one novel showing up as the narrator in the next. In this way, nobody suffers from too much exposure (which leads to a tendency to flatten out over time). Instead, the author continues to expand on her vivid portrait of Ireland’s working classes with her socially observant eye and sumptuous, moving prose. Her talent for mining subconscious fears and desires borders on the spectral, with a finesse that keeps it real but laces it with gothic menace. For devotees longing for Rob and Cassie to return, you may be initially disappointed at their absence. However, you’ll let it go once you engage in this spellbinding tale.The prose-rich Tana French will be music to your ears. Here is how Scorcher sees the fragile, sonorous beauty of Broken Harbor:""I looked out over the water, into the night that was coming in on the tide...The beach looked like something I had seen in an old film, once upon a time; that hotheaded boy felt like a character from some book I had read and given away in childhood. Only, somewhere far inside my spine and deep in the palms of my hands, something hummed; like a sound too low to hear, like a warning, like a cello string when a tuning fork strikes the perfect tone to call it awake.""...more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,not set,"May 24, 2012","Apr 03, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13123877-broken-harbor

It is a most felicitous cover that captures the mood and time that this novel begins, in 1962. A parochial innkeeper, Pasquali Tursi, lives in a rocky coastline village called Porto Vergogna (Port of Shame), a place the size of a thumb between two mountains, and referred to as ""the whore's crack.""One day, Pasquali is stunned by the vision of a young, striking, blonde American actress, Dee Moray, from the movie set, and baffled why she is staying at his inn. He learns that she is sick, and waiting for the famous publicity agent, Michael Deane, to take her to Switzerland for treatment. She stays at the ramshackle inn for a few days. Walter depicts their friendship with exquisite wistfulness and beauty. Her Italian and his English are as rocky as the cliffs surrounding the village, but a meeting of the souls eclipses language. On an outing together, they climb the cliffs high above the Ligurian Sea so that Pasquali can show Dee five frescoes painted on the wall inside a machine-gun pillbox bunker left over from World War II. At this scene, I almost wept. These frescoes become the most poignant visual metaphor of the book.Alvis Bender, an American writer with writer's block, traumatized from his experience in the war, stays at the inn annually, and has left his one devastating chapter in the drawer in Dee's room. It is an astonishing chapter, one of the highlights of the novel. It is a treat to witness the variety of stories that make up Walter's one larger story.The novel alternates non-linearly from 1962 to contemporary time in Hollywood, Calfornia, where Claire Silver, a scholar of film archives, works for the now legendary film producer Michael Deane. Claire is on the cusp of quitting her job and leaving her boyfriend, and is suffering from several regrets. She is braced for another insipid film pitch when she receives a surprising visitor.In this pensive, reflective, aesthetically pleasing, and geographically stunning story, we meet a disparate cast of characters that are ultimately linked. There's also a washed-up rock musician, a frustrated screenwriter, and a cameo appearance by a certain alcoholic son of a Welsh coal miner--a brief but rollicking insertion of a true-to-life legend that is so spectacular and credible, it almost outshines the rest of the book. But the rest of the novel is exquisite, so that the scenes in repose combine with eye-popping chapters, and give the book a sublime balance.The story has an undulating, timeless presence. Patience is rewarded, as it ascends toward its peak with a languid pace. The outcome may be a little too neat for some readers, but it is a minor flaw that is incidental to the mature and subtle elegance rendered on every page.

Flynn, in this hybrid crime and psychological suspense thriller, creates an electrifying, macabre tale primarily out of the dissection of a marriage, the real goo and gore that can tear us apart. It thrusts the reader into intoxicating madness and exposes the most private, shameful secrets of a relationship. Written in chapters alternating in the convincing voices of Nick and Amy, the story is packed with a jet-fueled, wickedly dark plot without sacrifice of character. Did you hear the rumble and see the flames? That was me turning the pages as they lit my fingers on fire.Amy and Nick both lost jobs as magazine writers in New York, a diminishing returns profession due to the rise and expansion of the Internet. Amy is a trust fund baby, the daughter of psychologists and writers of a once famous children’s book series named after her. Nick’s childhood was pretty grim. They reluctantly move back to Nick’s decaying hometown in northeastern Missouri, (near Mark Twain’s hometown of Hannibal), to care for Nick’s ill mother and oversee the care of Nick’s father, who suffers from Alzheimer’s and lives in a nursing home. Nick buys a bar with his twin sister, Margo (Go), and Amy stays at home, still jobless. On the afternoon of their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy has gone missing after an apparently violent struggle. As the police investigate the kidnapping of Amy, the story soon goes viral. Contained pandemonium ensues.The author ably injects the inflammatory bottom-feeders of mainstream media and the voices of the Internet—the new vanguard of crime-watchers-- to demonstrate that in the 21st century, everyone’s an expert and everybody has an opinion. Adamant, boisterous, and scouring cries predominate--where conjecture rules and the crowd buzzes on blogs, vlogs, tweets, and Facebook. The less you know about the details of this book, the more you benefit from the harrowing twists and turns. Flynn has a phenomenal grasp of character. She never takes the easy way out, nor does she use clichés or stockroom phrasing. Her characters--primary, secondary, even tertiary-- are authentic, and she has done her homework on the unstable ones. As a psychiatric nurse, I often suffer from occupational hazard in the reading room. I’ve read too many inaccurate profiles of unbalanced characters that seem borrowed and hackneyed. Flynn avoids stereotypes. Her characters are organically portrayed, heads and hearts projecting like rockets from the pages. The plot sizzles with a sense of immediacy, led by the people who populate it. I love this book. I don’t typically wax on about a crime thriller, not since Tana French’s IN THE WOODS and THE LIKENESS. GONE GIRL is smart, disturbing, witty, arresting, wily, and unruly. Flynn’s provocative approach is bald but cultivated, naked but well groomed. It is hip and edgy without calling attention to itself, reminding me a bit of Christopher Bollen’s lugubrious style in LIGHTNING PEOPLE. Quotable passages blend with a brisk, billion-watt plot. She never lets up or gets cozy; a crown of thorns with extra spikes awaits you.

Spanning 250 years, (non-linearly), the story takes place largely in the xeric and sparsely populated Mojave Desert, at the high-energy Pinnacles, or three-fingered rock formations. The people who populate this novel tend to be restive fringe dwellers, a colorful cast of alien, isolated, and even immortal characters. A Franciscan priest, an anthropologist, hippies, drug addicts, a yuppie couple with an autistic child, a UFO cult, a fading rock star, the mythical Coyote.The book opens with a short postcard sketch of the trickster Coyote doing bad, bad things. Coyote, interestingly, has many meanings other than wild dog—a clown, a sorcerer, a despicable person, a divine spirit, a romantic twilight voice on the wind, pirated works. All these meanings are relevant, either figuratively or metaphorically, to this story. The disparate characters from different years venture out or end up at the Pinnacles, where they feel an eerie, powerful force of energy, a transformative and potent, highly charged attraction.

His wife and daughter matter more than his ties to the CIA. His former boss, Alan Drummond, is inconsolable and guilt-stricken. The few Tourists (a liberal euphemism for “trained assassin”) that remain alive are scattered around the globe, and one in particular, Leticia Jones, has enigmatic resources and reasons for contacting colleagues. Xin Zhu, a Chinese bureaucrat responsible for the mind-numbing and vengeful execution of the thirty-three Tourists, is in the hot seat with the Chinese government, and Drummond’s new target. On this feverish note, the story opens.Steinhauer refreshes followers of his first two books (I needed it—it’s been almost two year since THE NEAREST EXIT, and three since THE TOURIST), and he also capsulizes past events to bring new readers up-to-date. So it isn’t imperative to read the first two books in order to engage with this one. However, I don’t recommend starting with AN AMERICAN SPY. Story progression is critical, and the subtext could be lost in the abbreviated summary. Although some of his characters are prosaic, Milo is the most complex of all, and he deserves to be met at the beginning. Moreover, this is not the strongest of the three books (that would be THE TOURIST), and having the other two under your belt will deepen your appreciation of Steinhauer’s latest do-or-die thriller.As usual, events take the reader all over the globe, with some juicy digressions into obscure countries adding to the overall enjoyment of background and atmosphere. The novel opens in 2008, after a short prologue in Germany, with the obese and intellectual Xin Zhu, and Milo doesn’t even make an appearance for 90 or so pages. The plot/story is set up with sufficient tension, and the different Chinese players are rendered with fine strokes and nuanced appeal. The well-timed segue to Milo in part two commences in his New York brownstone. At that point, the reader is firmly engaged and piqued.As in the previous two novels, this is a provocative page-turner that keeps you guessing. The only problem here is that I wasn’t fooled; Steinhauer didn’t stay one step ahead of me. A half-step, maybe. Also, at about the two-thirds mark, the sense of immediacy is sacrificed by the author’s choice to telegraph events in arid sequence. It therefore unfolds as a dry chronicle, a ceremonial undertaking that squeezes the charm and extracts the heat from the story. It was the first time I yawned in a Steinhauer novel! Still, the reader has already been hooked, and you won’t go anywhere until you find out how this unravels.Fortunately, the author puts the sizzle back in the stake, and the denouement, although not original or perplexing, does provide ample twists and entertainment. Spy aficionados will likely fill in the blanks with deadly aim before it is over. It’s Milo’s charm and morality in an amoral world that keeps the buzz on and the ringers off.

An unconventional ""upside down"" blueprint creates space from a house, rather than creating a house from space. Von Abt considers himself a poet of form, space, and light. These revolutionary ideas usurp the notion of ornamentation. Gables, pillars, columns, turrets, and whatnot are oppressively rooted in the past, and invoke churches and museums. The Landauer House will transcend the new optimism of Central Europe with its straight lines and understatement.The Glass Room is the nadir of the Laundauer House. Transparency and light prevail, bouncing on walls and chrome pillars, and even reflecting on the garden dew. The house and the garden, as the architect designed, flow as one, without discontinuous separations. Von Abt installs a stunning onyx wall in the Glass Room, a glossy slab with veins of amber and honey. The stone captures and radiates the light; when the sun sets over the house and shimmers and sparkles on the stone, it glows a fiery red. People transform into transparent selves--they are guileless, liberated, ungoverned. In this expansive, unrestrained sphere, they make love--to each other and to life, in this room of substantive dialogue and naked emotions. Moreover, the house is a citadel of exuberant faith, an anchor of hope for future generations.The main character is the Landauer House, specifically the Glass Room, which is also the leitmotif of the book and symbol of order and progress in otherwise irrational times. As WW II obtrudes, a Nazi invasion is imminent. Viktor and Liesel and their two children are forced to leave and live as refugees. Accompanying them are Katalin, the winsome, alluring nanny, and her young daughter. By that time, life has become complicated and their marriage corrupted with deceit. As they depart for Switzerland, Liesel begs her best friend, Hana, to keep a close eye on their house, and ""der Glasraum.""The Landauer House, which stood for the indomitable future and the erasure of the past, becomes its own history of hope through struggle and war. During the unstable, treacherous German onslaught, the house becomes a scientific laboratory whose ultimate aim is to promote ethnic cleansing. Later, the Landauer's sinister chauffeur becomes the keeper, then a hostage, and finally a champion of the Soviet invasion. The Glass Room stands as a bastion of optimism amid menacing threats and perilous challenges to freedom and humanity.Written in eloquent, luminous prose, the novel soars from beginning to end, engulfing the reader into a world that is part-dream, part-imagination, and frightfully real. The latter part of the novel has a few encumbrances--it feels hurried and hamstrung, fitting too many events, people, and perfunctory dramas into a condensed frame. And yet, it doesn't deform this shattering, beautiful story. A bird with a broken wing trills its eternal song. Hope, freedom, history, and love prevail in an upside down house, in a glass room.The fictional Landauer House is based on architect Mies van der Rohe's Villa Tugendhat in Brno.

Galen, who is twenty-two, has the emotional maturity of a twelve-year-old (if that). He aspires to be a mystic, with his starvation diet, meditation, asceticism, and focus on ridding himself of attachments. He lives with his mother, who has plenty of emotional issues; the walnut doesn’t fall too far from the tree. His grandmother has mid-stage dementia and lives in a nursing home. He is sexually obsessed with his seventeen-year-old cousin, Jennifer. There’s no dad in the picture. From an outward appearance, they look like backward hicks.DIRT is the story of Galen’s quest for transcendence, and the consummately insane journey to get there. The family (including grandma) takes their annual trip to an old cabin in the Sierras, where conflicts over sex, money, rejection, and betrayal consummate in grave consequences. Dirt is Galen’s symbol of purification and release from suffering, or samsara, and the vital ingredient to his enlightenment. The road to hell is unpaved with inverse intentions and twisted desires. Vann is a first-class prose writer and a unique storyteller. His book, LEGEND OF A SUICIDE: STORIES is a masterpiece, and made the list of my favorite books of all time. Also, I am a lettuce-loving, TM-practicing yogi who doesn’t take myself too seriously, so I was primed to love this irreverent, sardonic story of New Age extremism. Without a doubt, it disturbed and fascinated me in equal measure. However, I couldn’t fully connect with the characters. There’s no need for me to like them—I tend to connect and even sympathize with unlikable characters. But they were so lethally noxious and relentlessly callous that I lost interest in their fate; it became a little toilsome. This may be my own shortcoming, though.

Years later, there is still an unaccounted for number—over 30,000—of “los desaparecidos,” (The Disappeared) the people that were abducted and tortured, or thrown from airplanes into the ocean. PERLA is the story that takes place after the war, of one young woman in Buenos Aires whose father was a Navy officer, and her mother a native Uruguayan from a prominent family. Perla is an intelligent, beautiful young college student, acutely aware that her father supported the deposed military dictatorship. However, her love for her Papa is so strong, and abundant with fond childhood memories, that Perla doesn’t want to face the possibility that her father was a monster.Perla falls in love with a compassionate, leftwing journalist, who entreats her to look deeper into her family, and investigate her father’s crimes. Conflicted, Perla breaks it off with him and secludes herself, only to be surprised by an astonishing visitor. Conveying the story through magical realism and passionate, undulating prose, De Robertis tells a coming-of-age story of an impassioned young woman standing at the chasm of truth. The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights organization seeking to find out the fate of los desaparecidos, campaign publicly and daily, also provoking clashing thoughts and fears in Perla’s heart and mind.This redemption story is intense, powerful, and concentrated.

I have never reNeil Cross, sole writer of the BBC TV series, Luther, wrote this psychological crime drama prequel, subsequent to writing the TV show. I have never read a book based on a screenplay that was any good, until now. Not just good, but unputdownable. Was it as riveting as the series? Absolutely. I wasn’t distracted by segueing from film to print, or going back in time, or the sizzling reminders of Idris Elba, who consummately personifies DCI John Luther.“Luther is a big man with a big walk,” is Cross’s understated way of describing this very complex and conflicted London detective of the Serious Crime Unit. He was once a post-grad English literature major, who met his wife, Zoe, when they took a comparative religion course together about twenty years ago. She is now a human rights attorney, and Luther fights crime on the London streets.John loves his wife, frequently despises his job, but compromises his marriage for the dedication and long hours that keep him away from home, physically and emotionally. He’s hypomanic, which is, euphemistically, bipolar-lite. His mood is elevated and sleep is elusive. He doesn’t drink. Now, there’s an original and refreshing trait. Too many crime novels portray the alcoholic genius detective. Luther is a genius, but a sober one.Luther has a temper. Violent criminals, especially psychopaths who harm children, provoke his rage. He periodically goes rogue in his tactics, creating hair-raising moments with his boss, Rose Teller. His partner and best friend, Ian Reed, is on the same page, but other colleagues frown when he disregards policy. They officially complain, complicating the plot and putting the squeeze on Luther’s advantage against the clock.Graphic violence is central to the plot, so beware the beast. However, it is not gratuitous. Cross is brilliant at combining Tarantino and Rumi. Luther is the thinking man's combatant, a scholar/warrior, a David Bowie enthusiast and moral strategist, with a hint of the mystical. Instead of a patched-elbow tweedy elite, which he could have been, he is fighting crime. Luther is a conundrum. On the one hand, he is deeply virtuous and applies his principles or morality to outwitting the criminal. On the other hand, his tempestuous means to an end approach often violates departmental ethics, creating considerable problems for himself, his colleagues, and his superiors.With a poetic economy of words, Cross keeps a sublime vise grip on the reader. Oh, those pages will fly and burn your fingers in the process. The pace is crucial to the mood and plot, and Cross maintains a fierce but restrained tempo, as incomparable as the series. You will be installed in the story by the first page; it is so exquisitely brazen, you will screech and howl before it is over.

The author uses this framework to enlarge on these capsulized lives of several 1989 graduates, and constructs an ensemble comedy/drama that entertains as it engages, moves while it thrills. The central story focuses on four women who graduated together—Addison, Clover, Mia, and Jane. Secondary and tertiary characters include spouses, lovers, friends, children, and other graduates that fill in the spaces and paint a portrait of a once close-knit community that has diverged over the past two decades. As the twenty-year reunion in Cambridge approaches, certain lives are headed toward catastrophe, some are on a precipice, and many are headed into serious change. Addison is stuck in a static marriage with a thoughtless, selfish man who barely helped raise their kids. Clover struggles with fertility issues and an employment problem. Her banking career went belly-up with the 2008 economic collapse, and her husband refuses to squirt in a specimen cup. Mia is happily married to a prominent, much older Hollywood director, has two teenagers and a new baby, but is blind to the truth of their assets. Jane, a widow and successful journalist, lived in Paris with her daughter and boyfriend until he betrayed her trust while she was in Boston caring for her terminally ill mother. Jane knew grief at a tender age—she was a Vietnamese child orphan, a casualty of war, then adopted by Americans. She is about to discover some harsh realities about her late husband and some shocking revelations about her (adoptive) mother as she meets up with old classmates and attempts to close a house full of memories—and secrets. In lesser hands, this could be a stale, derivative soap opera with candy-coated characters. But Kogan breathes oxygen into this big Chill-Fire-Breakfast forty-something tale of overlapping lives, gathering friends (and adversaries), and familiar themes of loss, love, and redemption. There are a few expedient twists, but they are authentic to the story and cast. Some readers will complain that the pace is pokey, but I thoroughly enjoyed the languid clip; it inevitably picks up at just the right moments. The book’s strength rests on the author’s style and narrative arrangement. She cross-pollinates her characters and their individual stories, creating fresh knots of tension and torsion. Resentments acquired during college re-emerge when characters clash on common ground; old love affairs have new influence; buried feelings are exposed; confessions lead to transformation. As the reader, you alternate from active participation in the story’s events, to being a beady-eyed observer, to inhabiting the characters emotionally. Kogan commands us with an almost imperceptible subtlety—you don’t recognize the mental shifts until later, when you realize that the story’s power pivots on its structure. The philosophical digressions loop back, the long sentences undulate in the chambers of its heart. The author stands back, with her verbal camera, mastering the narrative aperture. The light slants through her prose, or demurs to darkness falling on the page. “Narrative is much less about the facts of the tale itself—who did what where when, and why…than it is about how the narrator frames the story, what she feels about the story, when she chooses to tell it, where and why she tells it…”...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Feb 19, 2012","Feb 27, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12874448-the-red-book

Van Gogh shoots himself in a wheat field, and then walks a mile to seek medical attention. Why try to commit suicide and then ask for help? That is a mystery, one of several in this bawdy revisionist history of the French Masters. It’s an artful madcap romp and roll of fin de siècle France. Sacré bleu refers to an ultramarine color adorned by the Blessed virgin, but it’s also French profanity and blasphemy.

Well, he certainly perceived my taste fittingly, and I am forever indebted to him for persuading me to read this beautiful, evocative, deeply resonating story of a soldier-scholar living through WW I.This is not like any other war novel I have read, and I've read a number of them. Although you are taken inside the reality of war--in the muddy trenches, in the grasp of grenades, marching with battalions, and tramping through the punishing terrain and climactic extremes, the focus isn't limited to the strategies/hierarchies/bureaucracies of war games, although they are present and compelling. This is a story of an Italian aesthetic, Alessandro Giuliani, who is devoted to life, humanity, and art, and whose love for one woman is inexhaustible. He is as passionate about the song of a bird, the luminosity of a star, the tufts of clouds, and the play of light and color on a painting, as he is of surviving the war.The jacket art on my edition is a partial view of La Tempesta, by Giorgione, a Renaissance painting that plays a pivotal role in the story. The eloquence of Helprin's tribute to this work of art, through Alessandro's sensitivity and regard to its poignancy, left me breathless. I have never been so exquisitely moved by a painting through a novel, and I vow to visit the Accademia in Venice someday and stand in front of its powerful beauty.This is a novel to keep handy on a shelf once you have finished reading it, just to have access to its potent passages. You can open to any page and find poetry in prose. It elevates my thoughts to embody Alessandro and his five senses. Here is an example of the book's uncommon beauty that shines everywhere on these pages:""It seemed unbelievable that the sky, twisting and boiling like burning phosphorous, was silent, for its light and thunder suggested thunder, explosions, and the sound of the sea. The stars were busy and intent, as if before the moon came up they had to unburden themselves of all they had seen during the daylight hours, when they could not speak. Now they ran riot, and their light made the snowfields breathlessly dim.""This is one of the most exalting contemporary novels I have ever read. It demands patience, as it is not only hefty, but dense as well, with long chapters and copious forays into detailed and metaphorical description. This is a book for an ardent reader who desires a sensory experience with exuberant narrative scope.

That's the first two lines of the book.Beyond the vast ocean of Saskatchewanian wheat fields, burrowed with the detritus of past lives and half-lives, a fifteen-year-old boy is marooned on a forgotten prairie land with fugitives and transients, like a scrap of driftwood or a windblown, bone-cracked bottle. His surname is a mystery for twelve chapters; it's released, finally, like a swift, soft teardrop.Ford's great American/Canadian novel is a coming-of-age adventure tale about realizing one's own identity through narrative, memories, and self-examination. Moreover, it's about crossing, dissolving, and abnegating boundaries, physically as well as psychically, and generating rapport between our internal selves and the external world. At the heart of this story are the borders we cross and the crosses we bear. Symbolic, too, is that Saskatchewan is the only Canadian province with no geographic physical properties to denote boundaries. The abandoned young Montanan hero redefines divisions and indivisible spaces with deep reflection.""If anything, the similarity to America made its foreignness profound...""This half of a twin, living as if he were an orphan, tells us his story with tender wit and optimism amidst the garbage heap of objects and dwellings inhabited by outlaws and goose hunters. He was taught to ""always know something that I could relinquish."" And he was able to see the world as its opposite, and draw strength from that.The view of melting pot America ultimately merges with the cultural mosaic of Canada, and becomes a theme. In lesser hands, many aspects of this book could have seemed repetitive, tautological, but Ford amplifies the meaning of every revolving concept by mining it to its irreducible essence. Nothing is diminished in this masterpiece. The themes are potent, and not diluted with hollow slogans.The story's hero narrates dramatic, life-changing events that happened to him and his twin sister, Berner, after their parents robbed a North Dakota bank in 1960. The twins' father, Beverly Parsons, was an Air Force bombardier from Alabama, a smiling, talkative, self-serving handsome six-footer who returned from the war ultimately misunderstanding the world he came home to, and unsuited to the woman he fell in love with. But he embraced all that America stood for.Mother, Neeva, was a bespectacled intellectual from Tacoma, the daughter of educated Jewish immigrants, a woman who didn't want to assimilate with the people and land of Montana. The mismatch of parents created a terrible, unresolved tension that was chronicled in Neeva's journal and left as part of a legacy of loneliness for the children to untangle or inherit.This nerve-shattering story is filled with vivid incidents and characters alike, propelled by charm and clarity, provocative as it is diverting. Short, fluent chapters maintain a lyrical, vibrating rhythm. It is accessible, engaging, eloquently woven and plotted, not one word out of place, not one event unnecessary. The prose is unprepossessing and yet noble, austere but lush, stark yet playful, elegiac but bright, polished with all the messiness of life.It moves with the alacrity of a gazelle, spins together with effortless grace. As radiant and moving as a cinnamon sun and as sublime as a silver moon. This is a sensuous departure from the Frank Bascombe novels. The understated narrator's voice is flawlessly vulnerable, wry, and lightly brushed with a mournful surrender.As an addendum, I read that Ford is planning to write more novels set in Canada. According to Harper Collins, ""We are thrilled to be publishing the first of Ford's novels to be set in this country"" (north of the 49th parallel). ...more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"Feb 07, 2012","Feb 13, 2012","Feb 07, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12872236-canada

The Appalachian landscapes in his novels are vivid, rugged. Colors, smells, and sounds take on a sentient quality, and there's a brutal, timeless delicacy to his terrains. Moment to moment, you move from the crest of creation to the threat of destruction. His stories convey themselves through the power of domain. His latest is a testament to the most fertile aspects of his craft, which shimmer through an otherwise flawed and listless story.A short, mysterious prologue introduces us to a forbidding, rural North Carolina cove in 1957, and is followed by the main story, which takes place toward the end of WW I on the same rough and haunted turf. Laurel Shelton, an ostracized young woman, believed to be a hexed witch that causes harm and doom to others, lives with her brother, Hank, a disabled soldier recently returned from battle. Hank is engaged to marry a woman whose father needs to be convinced that Hank isn't also possessed. Into their solitary existence comes a mute flautist, Walter, who changes the course of their lives.The alchemic beauty of the story is largely communed through Rash's formidable powers of description. The cove area, where Laurel and Hank Shelton live, has a supernatural aura. It is evident that the cove's mystical power will impel events along a trenchant course of turmoil and danger. The tension mounts early, with subtle and bold implications of the cove's spectral qualities and the Shelton's cursed history, which are woven inextricably together.However, there are structural and character-related problems that make this story fall short of the author's intentions. It is difficult to relate them all without giving spoilers, so I will confine them to a few examples. First, the characters are static stereotypes that don't developed beyond what you see on introduction. They are either good and heroic or bad and polluted, and you know on contact. A few, like Walter, have hidden natures that are revealed gradually, but they don't truly evolve.Secondary characters--Hank's friends, for instance, are stock set pieces. Slidell (Hank's closest friend) and his moonshine distilling behaviors are derivative and prosaic. If you want to be captivated by moonshine madness, read Finn, which places you vividly into the depths of this culture. I got tired of scenes of sittin' on the porch drinking moonshine, or laying about drinking moonshine, or recovering from the effects of moonshine. It added nothing to the significance of story, and seemed more like filler. Moreover, Slidell had minimal dimension beyond the buddy sidekick.The villain, recruitment officer Chancey Feith, was a thin membrane of a figure. His presence was a platform for Rash to telegraph the theme of ignorant discrimination and flag-waving patriotism. He was a formula jingoist character that we knew to despise, who had no depth beyond pettiness and nationalism (with an obvious wink to today's imperialism). He was a flat, predictable entity designed to manipulate the story in a deterministic direction.The plot is simple, and for all the meandering that Rash precipitated, it could have been reduced to a short story format. The structure was wobbly; for instance, he built up an imaginary dream world for Laurel to imbibe, where she insisted on knowing and recreating a historical place (that was central to the plot), leading the reader on a launched journey that demanded some kind of realization or corollary. However, Rash just dumped it with a reductive denouement.As a matter of fact, several mobilized events and ideas were bluntly dispatched in this manner. He rushed the important events, especially as the climax drew nearer. Directions drifted and dropped and the story was sidetracked with spurious shifts, as Rash let the grains of some incipient ideas vanish with an inchoate shrug. It appeared as if he was trying to write two stories, and then eliminated one without properly trimming and removing surplus. Some of the context just shuffled into discarded notions. The myth of the cove was ultimately a tepid trickle, as its meaning wasn't revelatory or fulfilling.At the end of the day, this is a mixed bag. The book is worth reading simply for the sense of place and time, providing an intimate feeling of color and history through geography and atmosphere. Rash is an author with a subtle and transcendent gift for transporting the reader to the Appalachian wilderness.

Lysander travels to Vienna in 1913 to undergo psychoanalysis, which is becoming the rage now that Freud has pioneered the ""talking cure."" While there, he engages in a sordid love affair with a seductive, gamine sculptor. The consequences propel him toward the most intrepid performance of his life--a persona game of guile and espionage, a dangerous role that he must inhabit and ""perform"" for the British government.Telling too much about the plot risks spoiling the reader's discovery. The story is largely interpretive, and the inferences are shaped by an individual's own experiences, knowledge and beliefs regarding psychology, mythology, art, and the different states of consciousness. What is readily apparent, and what is under the surface, like the Danube's ever-flowing water, teases the reader long after the last page is read. The cover of the book before me shows a photograph of Vienna, the photo being a representation of reality. What is real, and what may be projection, imagination, manipulation, creation, or representation, is left for the reader to discern.The story unfolds during the transformation of an era, as WW I looms on the horizon. Late modernity is taking root, ""flickers,"" or film advances as a medium for actors, art is moving toward Expressionism, and Freud and Jung have split over their views of sex and the unconscious. This is a perfect book for structure fans, for its form is a frame for all that transpires. Boyd seamlessly braids, through alternating points of view and short, terse chapters, what is known and what is obscured. Often, what is hidden reveals what is present, and what is present exposes what is veiled. Moreover, he peppers the pages with a constant play of light on things concrete, like buildings and objects, and things abstract, like dreams and ideas.At first sight, the narrative moves linearly at a clipped pace, almost blithely, artlessly straightforward. Like a kaleidoscope, however, the perspective turns a fraction with each short chapter and with the three points of view Boyd incorporates throughout. The reader may eventually perceive that it is more opaque than clear, more dissembling than disclosing, and yet, it ultimately coalesces and connects, like night and day, wakefulness and sleep, dreams and reality, truth and lies, identity and deception, betrayal and faithfulness, shadows and light.Boyd's genius is that the story succeeds and commands on any of its contingent trajectories. Any inferred fissures, breaches, and cracks, no matter which way you spin the narrative wheel, intersect with the threshold regions where this book resides. The novel inhabits liminal spaces and periods, taking place in the interstitial zones of time and place, between the conscious and unconscious; knowing and unknowing; twilight and dawn.""The more we know the less we know,"" says Lysander. That applies, also, to the relationship between the reader and the narrative. The story is full of paradoxes, ambiguities, coded keys, and psychosexual connotations. As you navigate through the pages, you may sometimes wonder which way the compass is pointing.""My life seems to be running on a track I have nothing to do with--I'm a passenger on a train but I have no idea of the route it's taking or its final destination.""Whether you are a poet, a dreamer, an actor, a soldier, or neither, a lot happens while you are wending your way through this darkly wry novel, waiting for sunrise....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2012","Jan 19, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12345981-waiting-for-sunrise

Victims of the economic recession, Art and Marion Fowler are unemployed professionals with a quarter-million-dollar debt and a three-decade balance sheet of reproaches, recriminations, and regrets.As a last gasp venture, Art takes Marion on a Valentine Special Getaway to the Canadian Falls and liquidates their life savings to try and beat the odds at the casino roulette wheel. Art has practiced a mathematical method to this madness and is convinced that they will profit from their return. With a mixture of Art's indomitable hope and hopelessly romantic longing and Marion's brittle skepticism and ephemeral desire, they step, like destiny, into the imminent future to recapture the eternal past.""The scene had the strange familiarity of a dream or fairytale, as if the place had waited thirty years for them to return to learn their fate, the time in between a blink in the face of eternity.""The slender thread between Art and Marion is achingly evoked by O'Nan's interior, intimate narrative and lingers fluently in his constrained prose. In more cynical writers, this sad couple would crumble or flatten out in a single, oppressive note. However, O'Nan's characters murmur with a disobedient warmth that repudiates their chilly restraints. Back and forth, the sublime choreography of Art and Marion's swan song weekend reveals a muffled ardor beneath the unsettling discomforts and inertia of their lives. Naked compassion juxtaposes cringe moments, and an almost imperceptible heartbeat flutters with melancholy desire. Like a fluid dance, the couple's emotions shift organically through the author's prose in effortless concatenation.In this subdued but surprisingly epic domestic drama, a lot happens within the quiet but bracing pages. Two people are exposed and recognizable to any couple that has gone through stress or torment in a long relationship. And O'Nan's compassion for his characters echoes a humanity that will be recognizable to everyone. Each short chapter begins with a playful statistic, such as ""Odds of a married couple reaching their 25th anniversary: 1 in 6"" or ""Odds of surviving going over the Falls in a barrel: 1 in 3"" and ""Odds of a couple taking a second honeymoon to the same destination: 1 in 9."" Moreover, the author's use of Niagara Falls as extended metaphor and symbol of natural (the Falls themselves) and artificial (the colored lights, the casino, the consumer attractions) plays out against the Fowler's marriage.Occasionally, reader weariness sets in due to the inability to release or escape from Art and Marion. And the sudden ending is not as strong as expected by this O'Nan fan.Thank you to netgalley for providing this book to me on my Kindle. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jan 11, 2012","Jan 19, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11797352-the-odds

He's turned pleasure into an art, and made an art of pleasure. In 1907, he leaves behind his austere beginnings in South Holland for the splendor of the rich and modern, via employment in a powerful family in Amsterdam. Although raised in lower-middle-class surroundings, his Parisienne mother imparted gentility and musical refinement to Piet before her premature death. His sensuous lips, striking physique, keen blue eyes and cultivated, easy charm ignites passion in others, and he is as resourceful as he is alluring.With confidence and authority, Piet secures a position in the Vermeulen-Sickerts' household as ten-year-old Egbert's private tutor. Egbert's agoraphobia presents a challenge for Piet, who is paid well to teach and to hopefully ""cure"" him. From the moment he steps foot in their grand house, class distinctions are noted and deftly exploited by the agile and ambitious new tutor.This promise of the title delivers, and the sex is candid. If you are turned off by explicit sexuality, you may want to reconsider this book. However, Mason writes with a poised pen and a light, poetic touch in this romp of rumps. It's ripe, but not vulgar, and he has a knack for regulating the sexual exuberance. In lesser hands, it would be meretricious and puerile, but he harnesses the narrative's carnal energy with a droll and nutty bite. The bi-curious Piet jettisons the limited definition of heterosexuality. He is a card-carrying lover of women, but he has a sensuous appreciation for the subtle bonds of carefree, liberated men.This savvy novel of class and manners displays Piet's acumen for blurring divides and situating himself as a ""guest"" of the house. Barol quickly intuits the vulnerabilities of the domicile, including the servants, and makes an enterprise and métier out of his talent for soothing egos, from the bottom to the top. However, he is not without a nemesis. Daughter Louisa, a strong and independent woman who assesses him as a canny and insouciant opportunist, mistrusts his motives, although her sister Constance is mildly afflicted with his charms.Maarten's anguish over his son blindly binds him to a severe and persecutory God. His religiosity is so extreme that it has become anathema to intimacy with his wife. There is more at stake here then just a pleasure seeker's desires. The sins of the father have infected the child. The author's understanding of Egbert's illness and its roots in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (although the term isn't named in the book) were penetratingly accurate. What is even more profound is Mason's ability to illustrate a theory that I have always held: that fervent religiosity is also linked to OCD. He shows without telling.Word has it that Mason intends to continue the adventures of Piet Barol in at least two subsequent books. Knowledge of that mitigates the appearance of a pat and abrupt ending here as the ship sails into South Africa. There is much potential for past liaison's to threaten Piet's future, and for his usual composure to careen as he walks a tightrope--which is an extended metaphor and a prime subtext of the narrative. The novel ends with a promise that pedigree, passion, and ambition will continue to quiver and clash in Piet Barol's pursuit and parlay of pleasure....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jan 2012,"Jan 03, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10859115-history-of-a-pleasure-seeker

It's the ripest prose I've read this side of China Mieville, but Marcus's story drags on with an all-encompassing dread and relentless anguish. Numerous and grotesque images, made of organic, gelatinous substances, squirm and squall through the narrative like a howling of the soul. There is no doubt that this author has an uncommon talent and imagination. He was so effective in engulfing me in his gnomish, visceral landscape that I felt swallowed and forced into an intestinal vacuum.In this futuristic story, the sounds of children's voices make adults ill. Etiology unknown, but it is blamed on the Jews, at least initially. I don't have the aptitude to distill this story into its many-faceted parts/themes/concepts. However, it is apparent that Marcus's esoteric reach goes back to ancient Jewish mysticism. Even some of the words he often uses--shard, shatter, fracture, etc. brings to mind the breaking of the vessels and other Kabbalistic teachings.How far, deep, and wide does he take it? That is for the reader to determine. One theory that I have is that the reader's religious or secular beliefs take part in individual interpretation of the text, so that there is not just one meaning to ascribe to the deeper context of the story, (although knowledge of the Kabbalah would definitely be helpful). In other words, the story addresses the question of one's faith.The title of the story refers to the 22-letter Hebrew alphabet, its unfurlment, and its nature. As in the novel, ""The Hebrew letter is a form of nature."" For example, the lamed (pronounced lah-med) letter's appearance is a flame being reflected right back into your eyes. Lamed means ""into me"" and is the flame of consciousness; it is the letter of learning. (This is knowledge outside of the book's source, but relevant to the narrative.) Reading this story will increase your knowledge of the mightiness and personification of the Hebrew alphabet and its affinity to the concepts of creation and destruction, of diaspora and absorption, and more.The book reminded me of a David Lynch movie. If this actually were a movie, and not a book, I would watch it several times in order to get closer to the meaning's core. But in its current written form, I would have to commit to multiple readings. I am unwilling to submit to the time and effort required. Alas, the failure may be mine. There are other densely philosophical books, such as Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle, by Nabokov, that I am willing to re-read, that engage me fully.

If you can get past a few contrived plot points (this is where readers will divide), and engage with the narrator, whose reliability or unreliability is a puzzle to piece together, you will be satisfied with this warm yet dark story of a community and family unhinged by a violent crime. The author is a former DA who is skilled at informing the reader about the law and procedure without telegraphing it. The narrative is even, polished, and intelligently observant of a community in shock, a family shattered.I have relatives in Newton, Massachusetts, where this thriller takes place. It is an upscale community of educated professionals, whose children graduate from tony high schools and go on to Ivy League colleges. A fourteen-year-old boy stabbed to death in the park is incomprehensible to this insulated and well-heeled population. As prosperous as it is, there is also a provincial air to it, as like-minded families have always experienced security and safety here, and there is an expectation and history of benevolence. Violence is rare.Jacob, the fourteen-year-old son of First District Attorney Andy Barber, is accused of murdering his classmate, Ben Rifkin. In Massachusetts, fourteen-year-olds charged with first-degree murder are tried as adults. Barber narrates the story with depth and dread, exposing some family secrets along the way, which could impact the case, and creates increasing internal trauma for his wife, Laurie. Their marriage has always been an ongoing love story; they met as freshmen in college and have loved each other unfailingly through the years. This event mires them in vulnerability and heavy exposure to the media, placing them under a public microscope. Do they really know their son? How much can parents really get inside the soul of their children? And, no matter how strong a marriage seems, a blow like this can undermine what is truly a fragile trust.Landay has a talent for metaphor and imagery, rendered beautifully in the elegiac narrative. Woven through the story, in the old-school typed transcript of a court reporter, is yet another narrative, of Barber as a witness before the grand jury. How this fits into the rest of the story is gradually disclosed, and its presence is both suspenseful and revealing. Landay's dialogue is crisply cinematic but organic to the characters. His flair for teen-speak is spot-on.Jacob, who is largely inscrutable, is developed through the eyes of other characters--and at a slight remove, which adds to the suspense. Is he a cipher? A typical teenager? The unknown X factor of Jacob draws out the detective spirit of the reader. The character that really blossoms on the pages is Andy, who reveals, through his agony, more than his contained self-assessment. He is a tormented man trying to protect his family, but his tenacity and inexorable faith in his son may have dire consequences.I read this book in two long sittings, and savored every page. Critically, it is probably a four-star (for its flaws), but personally, I greedily devoured every passage, removing my critical cap and capitulating to the subtle narrative. ...more",Notes are private!,3,170,1,not set,"Dec 22, 2011","Dec 28, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11367726-defending-jacob

Like Pynchon and Kafka, he was ahead of his time. His meta-fiction wasn't just for show and self-indulgence; the wink-wink and digressing were salient to the themes, and showcased the sophistry of righteous absolutes (and its contradictions). It was an intellectual frolic into the act of writing itself, with a tender touch of comic genius.His latest and slim novel is also a linguistic romp, and resurrects some familiar subjects/settings, such as a love triangle, prostate troubles, and his beloved Eastern Shore of Maryland, specifically Stratford. Retired professor G.I. Newitt experiences some strange catastrophic flukes associated with a series of visions. He is subsequently inspired to chronicle these seasonal occurrences and phenomena, such as a ""post-equinoctial vision"" and a ""solstitial illumination."" The latest casualties include a tornado that wiped out the retirement community that he lived in with his wife (and muse), Amanda, and a fall on his 77th birthday in another Stratford--the one particular to the Bard. Newitt's efforts to pen his memoir is the central event, and he shares every daily outburst of desultory thought with Amanda.I am surprised that this is the same author who wrote The Floating Opera. There was nothing here to tantalize beyond some lexical stretching. The narrative was self-conscious and obvious, like the protagonist's name. (G.I. Newitt is as blunt and prosaic as Seymour Butts.) The events, and the telling of them, were repetitive and dull, the narrative style antiquated and stilted. The most inspired was the title's allusion to Prospero's lines in The Tempest.It read like Barth just showed up for practice, much like the gasbag Newitt, and was compelled to cough up all the topical issues of the day--the war, the Bush administration, the government's failure during natural disasters. But it was arid and lusterless; notions stuck to the page like Teflon, a reiteration of the mundane. It managed to be both capricious and monotonous.

She interweaves a traditional pagan mysticism with Catholic catechism, the animate with the anthropomorphic. The central figure, Father Damien Modeste, is a Catholic missionary priest who, since coming to the Little No Horse reservation in 1912, has fluidly blended the customs of the Ojibwe people with the Holy Trinity. Through his eighty years there on the reservation (he is at least 100 years old now), he has integrated the spiritual faiths into a potent hybrid, a mystic fusion that also informs the book's imagery, without a shred of proselytizing. Father Damien takes great pleasure in forgiveness, in absolving all of people's sins at confession.Many of Erdrich's characters develop over time in her Argus novels, with intricate histories and relationships. Father Damien was a peripheral character in past books, such as Love Medicine,The Beet Queen and Tracks. Erdrich's use of the multi-narrative voice and nonlinear storyline brings specific characters in and out of focus at different times and in different books. In LAST REPORT, I could sense the full lives of characters such as Nanapush, Damien's closest friend, who came with a full history by the time he was introduced in this book. It is difficult to  this novel without mentioning some surprises about Father Damien's identity, which is shared in the first several pages. However, I leave that to the reader to discover, and will give very little plot point information.Father Damien is now at the end of his life. He has been writing letters to the Vatican asking for spiritual guidance for half a century, awaiting a reply, persevering in this quest. When Father Jude shows up, it is not for the reasons Damien is hoping for. Rather, Father Jude has come to interview the cleric and others because the Vatican is considering Little No Horse's deceased Sister Leopolda (the Puyat) for sainthood. The Sister is inexplicably bound up with some reported miracles on the reservation. However, she was also a treacherous woman responsible for the tragic fate of several people. During the investigation of Sister Leopolda, Father Damien's extraordinary life unfolds.Erdrich's prose is so dense and dynamic that you can extract any line and see multiple images expanding. Her sentences are not merely strung together to get to the next one. Like beautiful poetry, the journey of a single phrase can make you pause and shudder. Her sense of character is not limited to the sentient and her depiction of place contains a blend of what is now and what is ancient. I am still revisiting passages just for its supple beauty. Erdrich is an alpha-female writer; the robust writing/story doesn't depend on sentiment or emotional manipulation, but rather on singularity and strength. Flinty, brutal, feral, mystical, and inflammatory, this book is a postmodern world of the supernatural and earthly, intoxicated with great passion and love, deep sorrow and regret. And occasionally, it is hilarious.I observed immediately that Erdrich's narrative keeps the reader at a certain distance, but it's the same way that the moon is at a distance when we gaze upon it. Too close and we would lose perspective. Within the chapters are subheadings that could rightly be their own vignettes and character studies. The structure reflects Erdrich's fealty to oral storytelling --the Native American tradition of language and the land, of birth and death, of revenant spirits, and the eternal cycles of nature. Father Damien's letters to the Vatican and his interview with Father Jude weaves the disparate narratives together, and shows the reader his candor beyond the cloak of secrecy.I can see a higher power inhabiting the nun's fingers that channel Chopin; in the heart that beats in its cage; brittle old bones buried in the earth; the broken bits of sun flashing through the trembling leaves; a cold fat moon of an early frost; the long shadow of a life....more",Notes are private!,0,90,1,"Dec 14, 2011","Dec 16, 2011","Dec 14, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2339477.The_Last_Report_on_the_Miracles_at_Little_No_Horse

He rents office space in a building that has period architecture accented by gargoyles and cherubs that appear more sepulchral as the professor's state of mind becomes more questionable. Although he intends to study the scholarly writings of Aeschylus, he spends his days and nights alone, ruminating on his self-worth and taking long walks through the city, recalling his long-ago suicide attempt and his forays into psychotherapy. The flimsy walls of the individual offices allow sound to penetrate, and he overhears a German-born psychiatrist and one of her female patients in the adjoining office; the doctor turns off the white-noise machine at the patient's request.What follows is kismet, in this professor's compulsive mind. The patient is an adopted woman who feels an emptiness and sense of disconnection from the world-at-large. She believes that finding her birth parents will extricate her from the engulfing misery and dismal relationship with her adoptive parents, cold and secretive people who failed her in just about every way. The eavesdropping professor had always admired a childhood adopted best friend, Paul, for his distance and singularity from his adoptive family. The narrator thus imagines his own release from heredity, as his parents were mentally and morally weak, and his father an alcoholic.By accommodating the stories of his best friend and the patient next door as a fundamental desire of and for identity, the professor envisions a way that he could extract himself from the clammy hand of ancestry. He envied Paul and this patient the significance of their adoptive circumstances, and over-identified with their aspirations. If Paul and the unnamed patient could free themselves from their parents, why couldn't he learn the art of being parentless, of self-creation? Absolve himself through the patient's quest.""Born unhappy. Built in. Original, like sin...The patient and I were kin, I suddenly knew, spawn of the same cursed line: the tribe of the inherently unhappy.""The book gets off to a stellar start with its enigmatic air of mystery surrounding all the characters in this book. The professor, our narrator, eavesdrops at each session on this woman's story, which is revealed gradually by the patient as her search continues. Murky background information of a Catholic adoptive organization and a German displaced-persons camp during WW II heightens the tension. The narrator professor finds a way to intrude invisibly and ""help"" the patient, which raises the stakes. Meanwhile, the psychiatrist begins to feel guilty for her own ancestry, as she learns more information on the patient's background.The asset AND the problem with this book is the structure. Initially, the narrator is beguiling, and the reader is just as eager to understand the details of the professor's story as the patient's story. Much is implicated from the start that there is psychological overlap between the professor and the adopted woman, and the short chapters alternating between the concerns of the professor and those of the patient have a Venn diagram valence to it, especially enhanced by the art cover of the book.However, as the story progresses, the professor's relevance to the patient becomes strained and periodically forced. His own story is limited and, as the pages turn, static, so that there is a taste of filler posing as a teased unfolding. As a matter of fact, instead of receding naturally or nearing organically to the concerns of the patient, the narrator becomes an unnecessary obstruction to the story's progress, even as his mind unravels, stifling instead of alluring. His presence becomes extraneous, then spurious, but the author hamstrung him because, it seems, she didn't know what to do with his character after using him to amplify a complex tale of lineage and origin. The pace thrums at the opening, and with the events that uncover the patient's history and expose her raw emotions. However, it crawls with uneven and desultory madness when the professor continues to alternately share the spotlight.The patient's duress is intriguing, drawing all the empathy of the reader to her biographical history and emotional state. Her ethnic identity troubles her, and is tied in with her self-esteem as a daughter. She yearns to be loved by a parent, to be known, belonged, and connected, which is at the heart of the theme. The professor's anxiety and obsessive behaviors as well as the guilt of the psychiatrist had potential, but feel unfinished and occasionally tacked on. The author, throughout, displays a talent for historical fiction, and, despite the flaws, exhibits a ripe talent for transference and counter-transference issues of psychotherapy, and identity issues that transcend blood and biology....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Dec 2011,"Dec 14, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12510833-by-blood

Akira Korosawa's film Rashomon is about a crime that is witnessed by several individuals who all have credible but polarized viewpoints of the event. SEVEN TYPES OF AMBIGUITY is an intellectual Rashomonian potboiler, a colossal coil of colliding and deviating entanglements. However, we KNOW how the crime occurred. But do we really know who is guilty, beyond the obvious defendant?It is a world of contrasts and overlaps, of paradoxes and semblances, of poetry and corporate shenanigans, gambling and grumbling, prostitution and restitution, love and lust, betrayal and fidelity, infidelity and incorruptibility, obsession and distraction, and perhaps the kitchen sink.This book is a courtroom thriller, a love story, a social inquiry, and a study of manners. It is structured with seven narrators whose lives intersect in surprising and stunning twists and twisted knots. The opulent story is situated in Australia, in the state of ambiguity. It is bold, with brazen characters and a show-stopping plot.Seven narrators share the story, and each has only one section of narrative. Some narrators have twice as many pages as others, but all have a tremendous impact on the reader. You see it one way, and then the next narrator's perspective shifts the kaleidoscope a notch or two, substantiating the ambiguity evident in the previous viewpoint while cross-examining each character's version of clarity.It opens with a middle-aged psychiatrist, Alex Klima, a transgressive therapist whose lack of boundaries violates every code of therapeutic ethics imaginable, and yet whose voice and unfathomable empathy is as humane as his breach is abominable. He is the central protagonist's psychiatrist and friend, (although it is really more of an ensemble, the central protagonist, Simon, is the one on trial) the one who visits Simon daily in jail and remains his closest confidante up and through the trial.Simon has been arrested for kidnapping the son of his ex-girlfriend, a woman he hasn't even spoken to in ten years, but he is in psychic bondage, because his love for her won't stop. He is a schoolteacher who was laid off during the downsizing of mercenary Australia that stemmed from all the economic disasters that ensued after the collapse and entropy of global corruptions and end-stage capitalism. He is a poet and intellectual, whose dog Empson was named for the author of the book that the title of this book is poached from. Simon lives by the ideology of Empson's 1930 literary analysis of language; the principles of Empson are Simon's articles of faith.According to Empson, there is such depth of meaning in words that there are complex and confounding interpretations of poetry/linguistics, that each verbal thrust contains highly interpretive subtleties. This concept wraps itself around the story, also, both generally and specifically, in a myriad of ways that are best left to the reader to discover.The other five characters fuel this marathon of a book with such driven force and depth that I was literally sweating and weeping by the denouement. The final, short section's narrator is a dramatic surprise that does more than weld together the characters and story; it transforms it. Everyone in the book is on trial, and so is the whole human race. We are all guilty of ambiguity. And this book gave me hope--that we all testify to humanity....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Dec 07, 2011","Dec 14, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/153612.Seven_Types_of_Ambiguity

The former is useless and excessive self-absorption, and the latter, when seminal and relevant, offers deep introspection that leads to understanding, a meaningful engagement with the reader, and a possibility of redemption.Shriver's incendiary 2003 novel about a family torn apart in 1999 when Eva and Franklin's sixteen-year-old son, Kevin, massacres seven students, one teacher, and one cafeteria worker at his school falls squarely into the latter category. Eva examines--actually, deconstructs--her consciousness, and that of her family's, as well as the common tropes that regulate communities, all in the quest of trying to understand her son. She also explores the minefield of conventional American perspective, such as the overabundance of optimism, which is essential to Franklin's creed and Eva's antagonism. Moreover, she probes the insidious media umbrella of propaganda and hypocrisy.This story is told in epistolary form; Kevin's mother, Eva, writes a series of long, intimate letters to her estranged husband, blending observations on her current squalid life with her analysis of the life they once had together. She talks about her visits to their implacable, belligerent son in juvenile lock-up, and her fears of the future. The relationship between Eva and Kevin, inflamed with rancor, rivalry, and contempt, unnerved me, angered me, and finally, challenged me. The deviated course of their alliance is the mind-blowing heart of the book.Even with all the minute analysis, the story unfolds organically and fluidly. It unveils with tragic grace and suspense, like an opera--you could hear and feel the dramatic arias gathering its storm of emotions and dramatic events, gradually. Suspense builds tightly, acidly, with a terrifying crescendo-- a disturbing pain that whirs into an anguished, heartbreaking redemption. Along the way, the reader is apt to be shocked with certain events that took place even before the heinous slaughter. Shriver balances cerebral introspection with the most naked rendering of emotions.There's nothing gratuitous or canned about this searing tragedy. Shriver's talent is to illuminate without moralizing; platitudes, homilies, and easy answers aren't found here. She doesn't shy away from uncomfortable, caustic truths. This isn't a map or textbook to socio-pathology, although it is edifying and well researched. What is so especially brilliant is her ability to give Kevin humanity--not as a misguided figure who lost his way, or simply an anomalous genetic monster. The author didn't serve up a recipe of ""disaffected youth"" as an explanation, but rather as a piece of a fractured puzzle.The portrait of Kevin as human is way more harrowing than if Shriver had painted him as a hackneyed Charles Manson. Kevin may be a bad seed, but he is also a son and a brother, and, as the author has subtly suggested, a complex conduit to an insoluble puzzle. Nature? Nurture? What is at either end? Remorselessness and redemption have never been so inescapably allied. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2011","Dec 01, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80660.We_Need_to_Talk_About_Kevin

This is aMark Twain once said, in so many words, that the difference between fiction and non-fiction is that fiction has to be absolutely believable. This is an apt maxim for Duffy's novelistic biography of three celebrated philosophers of the early twentieth-century--Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, and G.E. Moore, three men whose variances in the study of logic created both mutual admiration and adversarial polarity.When Duffy wrote this novel in 1987, there had yet to be a biography of Wittgenstein's life (now there are two). But Duffy was drawn to Wittgenstein's persistent aim to comprehend how facts (and pictures of facts) and words refer to actual ""things"" in the world, and puzzled by how statements of fact don't relate to reality. It is these indeterminacies that lead to distortions of communication (I find that these concerns, however invisible or unknown, are the fundamentals of many misapprehensions between people). Logistic and linguistic conundrums plagued Wittgenstein his whole life; he dwelled in his logic problems to the point of despondency.Russell: ""He himself had worked WITH logic, but until Wittgenstein, he had never had the sense of someone locked INSIDE logic, struggling to escape like Houdini shackled inside a trunk. For Wittgenstein, logic was not merely a problem, it was the problem OF HIS LIFE.""Moore and Russell could distinguish their scholarly aims from their personal lives, at least enough to pursue other goals and distractions.Duffy brings these three distinct personalities to life with an almost impressionistic brio, yet as credible portraits based on his research. Sure, he changed some facts and dates, and invented and imagined and created others. But, factual accuracy and putative recreations of concrete events aren't what is relevant or brilliant about this book. I did read Ray Monk's bio, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, but Duffy's book gave me an even deeper understanding of Wittgenstein's melancholia--as well as Russell's egotism, and Moore's passivity--and their relationship to the world as they lived it.This book is evidence that novels can often convey more truth than non-fiction can. And how much of Monk's bios of Russell and Wittgenstein are ""truth?"" Information still had to be culled, predicated, and assumed from secondary sources. Plus, if you wrote a biography of your own life, how much would be accurate? It is amazing what the fallibility of memory and subjectivity can activate, deactivate, and twist. Memories are intangible, and chronicles derived from memories are often unreliable. More importantly, fact and truth are two different concepts.If you are looking for facts, read dry testimonies. Duffy made tangible the world that these men lived in through the elegant dialectics of language, and by running recondite wires through luminous emotional sockets. He assimilates and entwines fact and fiction, and takes part in shaping ideas. Ideas shape history. These three philosophers comprehended a solitary truth, that we tend to view life from the inside, ""peering out through crabstalk eyes.""Of the three men, it was Russell who achieved the most fame. Duffy penetrates the hollow halls of hallowed erudition, however, to illuminate the vanity and speciousness of celebrity. For example, Russell's best work was behind him by the time he got famous. He was resting largely on his laurels, or cynically penning slogans out of his treatises that were churned out daily in the newspapers. He craved popularity and was instrumental in politicizing his ideas. His Nobel Prize was more of a lifetime achievement award, and Russell knew it. Russell was jealous of Wittgenstein's superior talents, for his lofty morals, for his intractable nature, and scorned Moore's ""lack of vanity.""The World War I combat scenes with Wittgenstein were expressed so vividly and psychologically brutal that I could hear the reports of weapons and smell the carnage. And the hand-to-hand combat scenes were so palpable and gritty, so thoroughly scorching, that I felt and heard bones crushing next to my body. Duffy's images are seared into you; it is more like inhabiting Wittgenstein than reading about him. But even more searing than the Austrian battlefield was the battlefield at home, and his relationship with a tyrannical father. The deathbed scenes between Wittgenstein and his father are blistering, harrowing, unrivaled by any other literary account of mortal curtains.This is my ideal book, one that falls in the category of ""Desert Island"" reads. The narrative inseminates space, knocks down walls, opens windows to the world. It induced a chemical reaction in me, reminiscent of the verbal, labyrinthine stretches of tripping on hallucinogens. This book is manna and mojo for my deepest reader demands and desires. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"Oct 17, 2011","Oct 20, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8566391-the-world-as-i-found-it

Sadly, this is one of two books I’ve read (to completion) in the past five years(that was hailed and cooed by the titans of publishing)that I thought was good on social justice but poor on story/writing. This unimpressive debut generated out-of-the-gate praise because of politics, a pretense of social importance. As stereotypical as it is, it is surprisingly anointed. I have to wonder who is praising? Caucasians? The voice of the “wide-eyed” narrator is twee and over-precious, self-conscious to a point where it distracts, and beseeches the audience to sympathize. I kept hearing, “Don’t you just want to hug me? Look at how casually I present the facts!” There is little nuance to the text; the narrator abrades with ongoing exposition, telegraphing characteristics, disallowing the reader to form any conclusions through the spaces between words, the place where readers reside. As pin thin as the characters are, Torres uses an insistency to grind in the message, “Look at this poverty. Look how these kids persist despite their circumstances. How utterly they play.”The prose, paradoxically, is workshopped to death, overbaked, yet undercooked, flat and borrowed. Every phrase, sentence, passage is filled with clichés and shopworn images. The prose, like the characters and voice, is derivative, a copy-and-paste fulfillment that cloyingly coated my tongue with artificial grime. This comes across as a YA book, but rated R. The graphic parts are sure to elicit oohs and ahs, but are gratuitous, attempting the pretense of natural. The text was dull, and droned like a metronome, without the peaks and valleys that subtle prose provides. A weak story is not strengthened by exaggeration and melodrama. It is difficult to specifically point out these problems and yet circumnavigate spoilers. But, Torres fabricated medical law as a story contrivance. I know the law and procedures, and the laws at the time of this story. (The fact that VCRs were around, even in poverty-stricken sectors, allows a rough time estimate.) He presented it as if it were the Draconian laws of the 50’s. That was irresponsible. I hope Torres refines his writing skills. Each chapter, or vignette, was repetitive. I learned nothing new between page 29 and page 99, other than graphic, shock-value facts, told without subtlety. (The denouement was simply UN-shocking and flaccid). It felt like he was saying, “I’m edgy and unconventional, and that makes it literature.” He was coy and gimmicky, leaving out facts (like dates and ages) without purpose. His disjointed integration was to synthetically sway, rather than convey, another artifice that undermined the work. The finale read as if someone in the bookbinding department accidentally left out some pages, and then the editors embraced its “edginess.” Reductive, pointless, not even emotionally evocative, because he didn’t create any atmosphere, tone, or texture that moved me....more",Notes are private!,4,104,1,not set,"Oct 13, 2011","Oct 14, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10306358-we-the-animals

The title, which refers to the protective Santería god; the red and white beads of fire and logic; and the spectator shoes popular in the “Swing-era” days, has a syncopated rhythm all its own, a snazzy, jazzy, bebop, off-riff beat that invites the reader to shake a leg and put some sashay in your stroll.The jazzy structure of the novel is offbeat, also, and will appeal if you don’t expect convention. It has a sense of the improvisational within a complex frame of revolution and racial tension, corrupt Albany politics, and a chunk of Fidel, Batista, and Hemingway. All that, and fiery dialogue that is as sexy as a saxophone. Ace reporter Daniel Quinn, grandson of the first Daniel Quinn of Civil War reportage in Kennedy’s earlier Quinn’s Book, is just a boy in 1936, when he looks down from the second floor of his house where his father, George, is entertaining some singers crooning together, including Bing Crosby singing “Shine” with a black piano player. Quinn is seduced by jazz and the company downstairs.In 1957, in a Havana bar, Quinn meets his soul mate, Renata Suarez Otero, a voluptuously sexy Cuban revolutionary, a supremely brave and lustrous beauty from a long line of beauties and strong women. Daniel and Renata share a separate legacy-- Daniel’s father and Renata’s mother are prize-winning dancers. Cha-cha-cha. Renata is so self-assured and graceful that she can step in the shoes of a moll or a blonde-wigged patron of the demi-monde. Daniel can’t take his eyes off his Renata, and their bodies glide in rhythm to each other. Their conversations throughout the novel are full of heat and spice, a touch of the axiomatic.“I am never the same, even when I am not somebody else,” she says.On the same night Quinn meets Renata, he meets Ernest Hemingway, who punches a tourist from Baltimore for his bad singing. Quinn's agency to Papa is established; later, Renata helps Quinn get an interview with Fidel.The second half of the book takes place in Albany, on the tragic night in 1968 when RFK is assassinated, and the subsequent days waiting for daily updates. At this time, George Quinn is sliding into senility. As he walks the streets of Albany in a moderate confusion, the reader is taken on a trip down the city’s memory lane, all in the clamor of a civil rights riot from racial tensions breaking out on the streets. In the midst of this, a black jazz pianist is making his last stand at a club, and all the major characters are part of history-making days and nights.Feel the ground beat and the half steps, the boogie-woogie and the Hard Bop, the cross-rhythms and codas and the chromatic chords.

Kim Jong Il's force-fed propaganda controls the people so consummately that their identities are squeezed from their minds and replaced with a state-sponsored life and perspective. The life of a North Korean is not the pursuit of happiness or self-actualization. It is solely to survive, like an insect or a rodent. To live, you must become a shell, an unquestionably loyal nationalist.What Johnson realizes so well in his debut novel are the conflicts, confrontations, and abysses between the self that has been annihilated and the social structure that replaces the self. Every word you utter is weighed, and could be twisted as subversive. You are subjected to daily propaganda reports through loudspeakers connected to your house.

From his high seas and espionage adventures on a fishing vessel, where he develops his first chosen father-son emotional relationship, to the deprivations and torture of the prison mines, to the corrupt corridors of power, where his skill of impersonation becomes his sword and precarious shield, Jun Do's life literally morphs into a fabled one. He learns to act alone, and yet to connect with the hearts of others.""Today, tomorrow...A day is nothing.

The historical context is authentic, complex, layered, and detailed. Chapters alternate between Jun Do and a nameless interrogator, which progress to an operatic denouement.

Nature and humanity form a synergistic elixir that permeates the pores of the story.David Lamb is a disturbed fifty-something man whose private aches are both diminishing and conquering him. His life collides with Tommie, who is only eleven-years-old, when she approaches him on a dare in a parking lot. Soon after that, he has abducted her through his calculated and unctuous intrusions, but she believes in her prepubescent mind that she has consensually agreed to his proposals. He offers to show her the true beauty of nature, and they abscond on a road trip from Chicago to the Rockies without Tommie informing her mother. He promises to return her in a specific amount of time.What follows is an account, from an unknown narrator, of their trip. The intimacy of the narrator, and the almost oblique and quiet ferocity of narration, brings the reader to a suspenseful, uncomfortable place that is both familiar and alien. It is appalling and suggestive at intervals; the question of personal boundaries lurks on every dangerous, winding road.The rack and pinion relationship between Tommie and Lamb is both complex and ineluctable. Tommie is not even developed yet, but matures biologically day by day; David Lamb regresses, and his sickness reduces him to predictable behaviors as an outgrowth of his need and desires. He uses reverse psychology and mimics a state of innocence and wonder through his delusion and grandiosity.""How powerful she was as long as she asserted no will of her own"" is the theme of this book, a dynamic conundrum that blends nature, the human need for connection, the question of will, and the paradoxical power of relationships. Nature and people are like that sometimes; leaving us and Mother Earth alone allows a ripe bloom, aggressive intervention can wither us. However, ignoring our personal and physical landscapes can lead to decay. There is a balance and a tipping point. Nazdam's awareness of the environment's impact on nature and humanity (and vice versa) is psychologically and scientifically acute.Suspenseful drama and murky territory keeps the reader edgy and off-balance, but there were some pages that stagnated and recycled the drama a bit. Fortunately Nazdam usually aimed in a steady and ultimately propelling course. Even when the human drama occasionally crawled, nature's way continued to pivot and flourish from the narrative.The narrator is an enigma, and it is left to the reader to decide who is telling the story. However, the voice was also vague, with an ambiguity that was equivocal and unintended. In lesser hands, it would have undermined the story itself. But the author kept us gripped to the characters and events of the story's time period, enough to give less weight of importance on the storyteller.Similarities to Lolita are shallow and inadequate, easily a first observation but dispensed with as this story is more deeply analyzed. The names of many characters are provocatively utilized, also, in all their androgyny.

He allowed questions to be more meaningful than answers. Although the five blonde virgin girls were archetypal, he bent the very signifier of archetype with great irony and paradox.MIDDLESEX, a Pulitzer winner in 2003, brought intersex issues to the forefront. Rose Tremain (among others) had tackled this previously, but the acclaim and mainstream success of Eugenides’ novel was unprecedented. The context of a Greek immigrant family’s history (Eugenides is also Greek) and the polarized male/female dyad was praised for its social commentary, penetrating prose, and androgynous style of narration.THE MARRIAGE PLOT is not groundbreaking or unpredictable. Eugenides makes familiar, even prosaic pit stops in this largely phallocentric, chick lit love triangle (but a loose triangle) set in 1982 on the cusp of graduation at Brown University, an academic institution which embraces postmodernism. Over-familiar themes get a boost because of the textual discussion of semiotics and Eugenides’ renegade, rogue prose style and levity, making the scholarly concerns accessible and thought provoking. The best parts of the book were the academic digressions.The story explores the thesis of deconstruction, attainment, and illusion, pursuing (that overwrought theme of) romantic love and individuation while coming-of-age within a specific social construct—in this book, the 80’s and on the continuum of feminism. Derrida and Barthes et al flood the pages and add the most exuberant boosts to a long-winded, sometimes stagnant storyline of Cupidity. The narrative and plot reduce romance to the banal, and to Jodi Picoult territory, but from a misogynistic window (however shrewdly disguised).Eugenides taunts the slings and arrows of hearts and broken hearts with such lyrical, fetching effusion that the journey is deceptively captivating, even while it ambushes you to a pre-ordained destination. He also explores the conundrum his female protagonist, Madeleine, faces in trying to reconcile feminism with her taste for Victorian love and literature, and her dependent tethering to a man-- her object of desire, Leonard. I was disappointed in the lack of new insight here, even though it was gussied up to parallel a formal construct of the title’s origin--18th and 19th century novels by Austen, Eliot, Henry James, and the Brontë sisters.Madeleine Hanna, an intelligent and exceptionally beautiful protagonist, is an archetype that doesn’t really stray from the time-honored territory, so as the story progresses, she is more watered down and reduced to making stock choices. Leonard, her lover, is bipolar, an often treatable disease, with complications-- the illness seduces its hostage into grandiose self-doctoring. However, Leonard’s narcissism, a personality disorder, wasn’t addressed philosophically or otherwise. His mood disorder was hammered relentlessly, though, and left nothing for the reader to imagine, which made it difficult to comprehend his charm, or relate to his illness, which eventually became stale. If the author purposely propelled us toward exhaustion with the illness (in order to illustrate its effect on others), he did a bang-up job. But, Eugenides, at the end of the day, condescends to the feminine mystique. This was one of Madeleine’s epiphanies (she is talking about Leonard’s male anatomy):“…almost a third presence in the bed. She found herself sometimes judiciously weighing it in her hand. Did it all come down to the physical, in the end? Is that what love was? Life was so unfair. Madeleine felt sorry for all the men who weren't Leonard."" She also referred to Leonard's endowment as ""Mr. Gumby.""A shopworn and not terribly gifted “aha” moment, considering Eugenides' talent. Eugenides overindulges in the shock and awe, blow by blow plight of Leonard’s illness, considering the 500 or so pages of text, so that Leonard drifts into caricature. Madeleine’s insights, far from dawning, felt rehearsed by the author, even fusty. Moreover, Leonard’s bandana-wearing, manic, tobacco-chewing, intellectually doddering self appears to be a smarmy take on David Foster Wallace, but not very convincing, outside the superficial attributes.Mitchell Grammaticus, the seeker, journeys to Europe and India to find some answers to his Gnosticism and inculcate the mysticism he desires; his unrequited love to Madeleine is supplanted by his ability to mine and discover the self independently, something Madeleine’s character doesn’t evoke for herself. Still, there is little that Mitchell says or thinks that hasn’t been carved out before, although Eugenides does it with panache, as he is a first-class prose artist. There are also tendrils of his peer, Jonathan Franzen, in his style.Just about every choice Madeleine makes is in response to men, not guided by anything individual. That may be realistic, in this story, and in Eugenides’ eyes, but when I think of outstanding literature, Kafka’s statement comes to mind. Eugenides’ latest has been so preliminarily lauded and celebrated that it is already a sacred cow, and risky to criticize. FSG rented a billboard in Times Square, something stationary and ingrained for motorists and pedestrians to pass every day. Hailed as iconic, as well as iconoclastic, Eugenides' achievements precede this book. For this reader, he was skating on slick and thin ice, without cutting or boring through, but with an urgent velocity that leaves you breathless and warm on the one hand, constricted and cold on the other. 3.5...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Sep 29, 2011",Oct 2011,"Sep 29, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10964693-the-marriage-plot

It has no physical properties, but it fills a room, a life, many lives, and creates pain. It's bigger than a boulder, but is amorphous. You can't domesticate or quarantine grief, but it can isolate, alienate, afflict. The sun rises and sets, our shadows shorten and lengthen, but grief reaches into darkness and obscures the light. Its stride is long and its span is spacious, but it has no measure. Grief is timeless, but time heals, according to the maxim.This novel is about a family whose grief is palpable in every room, in every sigh, but they aren't discussing their shared mourning. Its presence is living proof, and it is kindling the death of love and connection. Paradoxically, this loss of connection is so perceptible that they are all hung together in an imperceptible noose, connected in sorrow. Hope is a tenuous flame fluttering in a precarious wind.The Ryries of upper state NY each have a story that funnels into the larger story of their family life. John entertained the gypsy life of theatric design, and when his wife, Ricky, the financial engineer, put her foot down, he got a steady job at a local community college. Ricky earns a corporate paycheck, but is resentful of John's more laid back and essentially fun job. Truly, the resentments build both ways, and when tragedy strikes, they fail to lean on each other in a healing manner. Damaging secrets come out later, and lead to sequestered grieving. On top of all that, a visitor comes--a blast from the past, someone who is part of the presence of everything.John and Ricky's daughter, Biscuit (Elizabeth), is a sixth-grader, hoarding a book from the library on the ritual burying and funereal practices of worldwide cultures. Her brother, Paul, is thirteen and in a very awkward phase, subject to relentless school bullying. Enter Gordie and his dog, Ebie, who meet Biscuit down by the river. Biscuit is doing who-knows-what with ashes and bone and an egg, and gets pushed in the water by Ebie. The drying off process leads to Gordie and Ebie meeting the whole Ryrie family and their visitor. The multivalent chorus of the theme and story whorls around all these characters, and their private anguishes and public displays of untidy and unresolved grief keep the reader engaged until the suspenseful resolve.Cohen has a knack for the ""mot juste,"" Flaubert's term for the exact right word. She is a magician with words, metaphors, and imagery. The sentences and passages are delicate and edgy, muscular and creamy. Every felicitous line is meaningful and enchanting. Moreover, her tone and mood is suggestive and tender without sentimentality; you feel with the characters and move with the story.The drawback is within the primary thread of the set-up. Ricky makes a decision, setting up the initial complexity of her tragedy, that is impossibly difficult to swallow, and it becomes a thorn in the story's authenticity. Although the author braids it into a beautiful circle, and creates a provocative sense of discovery of human nature--a discovery that is genuine and believable--the logistics of penning this structure in order to lead to this enlightenment requires a quantum leap of disbelief suspension.However, this is a book I would recommend to literature lovers who enjoy ripe, eloquent domestic dramas. Cohen's impressive curvature of prose and fluent, credible understanding of grief and all its counterintuitive responses and follicular journey, carry the reader into places beyond the bend.

Award-winning author Michael Ondaatje is certainly one of the most commanding, gifted, and original authors alive today, a poetic and lyrical writer who constructs stories with piquant, vivid imagery and interleaving, nonlinear storylines, and presents subtle motifs throughout his stories that bring you closer and closer to the emotional core of his characters. This novel has a circular feel, a sense of descending into deeper cavities and ascending from them, too. Although not a character-driven or plot-driven story, the cast is richly exotic, with a Dickensian resonance, and each character is indelibly painted and imprinted on the reader's eye and ear. As you move closer to the close of the novel, you will feel it mounting and ripening; danger, tension, and internal struggles burst like sunset over a ruthless day.As the cover suggests, much of THE CAT'S TABLE takes place on a ship, a journey in the 1950's where the protagonist moves from his home in Ceylon (Sri Lanka since 1972) to England. At only 11, he is immersed in childhood, and his perspective of adults, especially when reflected upon decades later, is shrouded in doubt, dreams, fantasy, longing, and desire. Ondaatje limns the thin line between contrasts, such as childhood/adulthood, freedom/captivity, memory/history, fact/fiction. This is a highly interpretive novel, with few concrete answers, a richly open-ended journey that, like much distinguished and superlative literature, invites the reader to weave his/her own personal experiences with the narrative at hand.The text is like resin in the hands'turning the pages of the book, I sensed the underground botanical garden in the bowels of the ship, the smell of the burning hemp from one passenger's cabin, the seawater splashing on the deck.

Rather, they define human responsibility and imperative, and the fundamental freedom to choose (versus the determinist ideology of fate). Essence comes after existence, not before. Human beings encounter themselves, surge up in this world, and have the burden of choice. We are not blobs of fate and destiny powered by an outside, ontological force. We are that force; there is no karmic essence--the world, as such, is a disinterested place, and we ascribe meaning to life and thrust ourselves into it. Existentialism 101.At the International High School of France, in Paris, American teacher William Silver is the conferred noblesse oblige--a school celebrity, hero, icon. It is the eve of America's invasion of Iraq, a time of protest and passionate politics. He is the teacher (most) everyone adores, wants to be near, or wants to be. Self-contained, attractive, charismatic, eloquent, inflammatory--he's the thinking-person's pinup of appeal and intellect. Students here are privileged, wealthy, and well traveled. They worship him, one despises him with jealous contempt, and another, who isn't in any of his classes, adores him with limpid gazes and lust.A crude, angry Dubliner, Colin, gradually finds his voice in Will's classroom, as do others who engage with new eyes with the world-at-large. Will teaches English Literature, particularly existential heavyweights, and invites an atmosphere of egalitarian challenge. Warning--a philosophy scholar may be peeved that whole passages are airlifted from Camus and Sartre. But Maksis does it with such élan that it is forgivable. It's an existential story within the context and milieu of existential academia.This swift, compelling novel is told in alternating chapters by three characters. There's student Gilad, who despairs his life at home--a cycle of abuse his mother endures and refuses to relinquish. He seeks a father figure and a hero, and Will is the Silver lining on his cloudy days. Gilad and Will witness a transforming, violent moment at the commuter train station, while waiting for the train for school, which sanctifies Will's status in Gilad's eyes.Marie is a French student at the ISF, but not in Will's class. She met him at a party the summer before senior year, and flirted heavily with him when they were drunk. Her derisive mother continually admonishes her, makes her feel diminished, and Marie is hungry for adult approval. Marie's best friend, Ariel, who she actually despises, is a superficial tart--beautiful but vapid, a control freak who wants everyone to notice her. Marie confides in Ariel, which is perplexing on a rational level, but understood within the angst of labile teen behavior.Then there's Will, the locus of the story. Will struggles with being an example of what he teaches; he is standing on the precipice of his life as the cracks begin to appear. He faces moral junctures that could be ruinous, and his image is colliding with his actions.The novel starts off whimsically witty, with a light touch--and initially threatens to be aimed at younger readers. The bedrock of the story is a boilerplate campus drama--a triangle, or several that overlap, and forbidden temptations. As the story progresses, the reader becomes cognizant of an informed story of provocative turmoil and a crisis of ethos. With an effortlessly lyrical cadence, quotable passages that melt in your mouth like warm custard, and human aches that lodge in your heart like stones, this luminous debut brims with pathos and spills with questions--how do we live, how do we choose, and what price freedom?

Character and language are sacrificed for plot and standard themes, and the admirable hero/ine (or noble anti-hero/ine) saves the world. Gosh, with the hundreds of thrillers published each year (month?), the human race is lucky to be alive.Enter the intelligence and nuance of South African novelist, Deon Meyer, whose arresting thrillers open and close with crackle and character. The plot doesn't proceed without the evanescence and development of his mosaic cast. Each primary protagonist of the three distinct stories in TRACKERS has an enigmatic personality, a moral imperative, and palpable inner conflicts--and Meyer winds the three plots into a robust and ropy overlap. Plot and story move in tandem with character, and discovery is united with exposure.Characters are the key to open every dark path and locked password. The veld shimmers; you'll be Wiki-ing the Great Karoo and the black rhino. You won't want it to end. That's assured--you will be breathless for more--for the next page, the subsequent chapter, the following installment. Meyer created a hybrid of stand-alone and series--a few characters from former novels, and at least one that isn't done yet. One track in each.TRACKERS is Meyer's most complex, tightly controlled, and literary novel to date, with an ending so exhilarating yet sublime that you will be pondering it for days. I have been an ardent fan for the past four books, but Meyer has not only eclipsed himself, he has outshone the towering abundance of other thrillers on the market.His biting social commentary doesn't feel like a mouthpiece manipulation--it is woven in to the sharp observations of the various characters, such as Mat Joubert, the PI of the third story, a former member of SAPS gone corporate-private, and wrestling with middle-age ennui. Also, his passionate love for his wife is delightful.Meyer's mastery of language and poetic expression is channeled through the character of Milla Strachan, the would-be writer and lover of words, a forty-year-old survivor of spousal abuse whose grown son takes her for granted. Meyer inhabits Milla with sinewy ease; his ability to express his primary female character is haunting, and Milla's choices feel organic (like the rest of the cast).And then there is troubled Lemmer, who fans will remember from Blood Safari; Becker, an opaque swashbuckler; and Flea, his darkest of all female characters, a cipher. There's an offstage man, Danie, a cryptic, integral fellow who is revealed through other characters, such as his wife, his boss, and his employees--but who is he? Moreover, references to a primary protagonist from Thirteen Hours is intriguing to those of us who read it, because it engages us with a sense of continuity. And there are some secondary, beguiling characters who you're sure you'll see again.There's no reason to tell you the plot here. Just a few nods to Meyer's intrepid storytelling--he creates three different stories that keep you riveted, and you gradually stop wondering how, why, where, or when this all combines. You trust him, and after the first fifty pages or so, you stop worrying about remembering the plethora of names (it does settle down).Also, there's a wonderful glossary in the back, an education in itself. I wish I had known about it before I started reading. Laura Seegers translates from the original Afrikans with seamless authority. There are eleven official languages of South Africa, and her choice inclusions of slang, acronyms, and phraseology create an indelible atmosphere.Words like asseblief--it means ""please,"" or bergie, which is a homeless person living on the side of Table Mountain. And oom, a form of respectful address, like ""uncle."" Spoor means ""track,"" the mark a wild animal leaves in the bush. (All this and more in the glossary.) Also, heading the chapters of Lemmer's story are short sentences from Louis Liebenberg's THE ART OF TRACKING. After all, this book is about tracking--animal tracking, surveillance, and detective tracking. Okay, now you have it.Of all Meyer's books, this has the most global of contexts, ultimately. It is surely the most exciting. The fat lady doesn't sing, either--she whispers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Sep 19, 2011","Sep 21, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9552271-trackers

The veld shimmers; you'll be Wiki-ing the Great Karoo and the black rhino. You won't want it to end. That's assured--you will be breathless for more--for the next page, the subsequent chapter, the following installment. Meyer created a hybrid of stand-alone and series--a few characters from former novels, and at least one that isn't done yet. One track in each.TRACKERS is Meyer's most complex, tightly controlled, and literary novel to date, with an ending so exhilarating yet sublime that you will be pondering it for days. I have been an ardent fan for the past four books, but Meyer has not only eclipsed himself, he has outshone the towering abundance of other thrillers on the market.His biting social commentary doesn't feel like a mouthpiece manipulation--it is woven in to the sharp observations of the various characters, such as Mat Joubert, the PI of the third story, a former member of SAPS gone corporate-private, and wrestling with middle-age ennui. Also, his passionate love for his wife is delightful.Meyer's mastery of language and poetic expression is channeled through the character of Milla Strachan, the would-be writer and lover of words, a forty-year-old survivor of spousal abuse whose grown son takes her for granted. Meyer inhabits Milla with sinewy ease; his ability to express his primary female character is haunting, and Milla's choices feel organic (like the rest of the cast).And then there is troubled Lemmer, who fans will remember from Blood Safari; Becker, an opaque swashbuckler; and Flea, his darkest of all female characters, a cipher. There's an offstage man, Danie, a cryptic, integral fellow who is revealed through other characters, such as his wife, his boss, and his employees--but who is he? Moreover, references to a primary protagonist from Thirteen Hours is intriguing to those of us who read it, because it engages us with a sense of continuity. And there are some secondary, beguiling characters who you're sure you'll see again.There's no reason to tell you the plot here. Just a few nods to Meyer's intrepid storytelling--he creates three different stories that keep you riveted, and you gradually stop wondering how, why, where, or when this all combines. You trust him, and after the first fifty pages or so, you stop worrying about remembering the plethora of names (it does settle down).Also, there's a wonderful glossary in the back, an education in itself. I wish I had known about it before I started reading. Laura Seegers translates from the original Afrikans with seamless authority. There are eleven official languages of South Africa, and her choice inclusions of slang, acronyms, and phraseology create an indelible atmosphere.Words like asseblief--it means ""please,"" or bergie, which is a homeless person living on the side of Table Mountain. And oom, a form of respectful address, like ""uncle."" Spoor means ""track,"" the mark a wild animal leaves in the bush. (All this and more in the glossary.) Also, heading the chapters of Lemmer's story are short sentences from Louis Liebenberg's THE ART OF TRACKING. After all, this book is about tracking--animal tracking, surveillance, and detective tracking. Okay, now you have it.Of all Meyer's books, this has the most global of contexts, ultimately. It is surely the most exciting. The fat lady doesn't sing, either--she whispers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Sep 13, 2011","Sep 19, 2011","Sep 13, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10478581-trackers

In THE ACCIDENTAL, an uninvited woman shows up at a residence and turns the family upside down. In her latest novel, Miles Garth, a dinner party guest in Greenwich, leaves the dinner table, exits upstairs, locks himself in the spare room, and declines to leave. Miles is the nominal central figure of the novel, yet it is his “absent presence” and other paradoxes of human nature that are pivotal. His silence is the roar that emanates alienation.The main characters of the four chapters, entitled There, But, For and The respectively, experience a pressing solitude (one character describes the Internet as “a whole new way of feeling lonely”). Three have met Miles at some point in their lives, but none of them know him intimately. Anna, who is also known as Anna K (as in Kafka’s THE TRIAL; or anarchy; or “Anna Key in the UK,” a Sex Pistols cover), knew Miles briefly as a teenager when they both won an academic competition to travel to various European cities. She remembers him as confident, spirited, and arch. Anna’s former job at the Center for Temporary Permanence is reminiscent of Jonas’s in HOW TO READ THE AIR. As senior liaison, she condensed the trauma stories of individuals so that their narratives fit onto one page of a document. “You have exactly the right kind of absent presence,” her former boss tells her, referring to her forced remoteness from her clients. Temporary permanence and absent presence amplify the tragic isolation of contemporary society. Now in her 40’s, Anna is experiencing an existential crisis of identity and alienation.Mark met Miles at a local theater production of A WINTER’S TALE, and initially tried to pick him up. They began a friendship over their opposite responses to a cell phone going off during the play, and Mark subsequently brought Miles to the dinner party hosted by Gen and Eric (Gen-Eric, a pun). Mark has been plagued for decades by his dead mother’s voice whispering into his ear in rhyming couplets. Her absence is a constant presence in his life.A dying, elderly woman’s connection to Miles is not apparent at first. She is in the hospital, gradually losing her grip on reality, and determined not to be sent to a nursing home. Her status as sick and old illustrates the tacit ageism of society, as others regard her as invisible while they manage and condescend to her.The true central character is Brooke, the almost ten-year-old child of one of the dinner party couples. Brooke is too remarkably precious and inauthentic-- a provocative child prodigy who thinks, talks, and usually writes like a post-grad student. She is familiar with the text and nuances of HAMLET, as well as other references to lofty literature and obscure esoterica. Can’t children just be children in literature anymore? It borders on gimmicky. Brook’s dialogue and interior monologues, however, are weighted with the gravitas of the novel. She is loaded with punny ideas, references to Mean Greenwich Time, and her attraction to the Greenwich foot tunnel invokes the infinite coil of memory and history. Her behavior toward others is unimpeachable, yet drenched in irony. Unfortunately, Brooke feels less like a real character than a bridge between the text and Smith’s ideas.Smith is a high-wire artist of the nonlinear storyline, and a conjurer of experimental, hyperkinetic prose. The elastic and slanted wordplay revolve around isolation and identity. But Smith overtaxes the narrative with voguish stream-of-consciousness during the latter part of the story. It exaggerates and escalates to the point of burlesque, and removes the reader from the narrative tension into the staginess of its performance. The manic flow of prose floods the reader with its self-awareness.Some of its parts are exquisite and heartbreaking, but the sum of its parts is less than some of its parts. The combination of typecast characters and pc heavy-handedness is stultifying. The middle-class white people are boorish philistines. The gay and ethnic characters, as well as the precocious Brooke, are paragons of temperance and sensitivity.The themes prevail, but the lush linguistics and hurricane of words crushes the characters underfoot, and the clichéd stereotypes are laden with the very middle-class pieties that Smith aims to send up, allocated to types. Moreover, the visceral opening of the novel diminishes in her cerebral profusion of the last fourth of the book and threatens to vanish with Miles behind the closed door.A must-read for fans of the author, it may also appeal to readers seeking experimental prose and unconventional narrative structure.

In Saramago's recreation of the old testament, god is snide, foppish, vicious, capricious, puerile, contemptuous, crabby, and a slouch at multi-tasking (and no iconic capital letters for this merry band of pranksters). This short but adventure-packed novella presents a new twist on the story of cain, the fratricidal brother. Weed out all the boring parts of Genesis, feature all the greatest hits, and place cain as the ubiquitous character. Actually, cain even shows up at events that god is too distracted to attend (and his angels are stuck in traffic?).In addition to being an erudite little gem, this story is full of slicing irony mixed with slapstick humor and dry, bone-dry, desert-dry wit. He's too subtle to just rant on the lord. Saramago seems to be peeking out of the corners of the pages, winking at the reader, offering a sly smile. As an arch example, Eve calls herself the First Lady of Paradise.Saramago, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1998, was an ardent atheist, who said that the Bible is a handbook of bad morals. He also impugns a ""cruel, jealous, and inhumane God (who) exists only in our heads."" In 1992, a scandal erupted after The Gospel According to Jesus Christ was published, whose characterization of God didn't conform to certain pieties, so Saramago happily moved to the Spanish Canary Islands, where he lived until his death in 2010. He didn't think CAIN would offend Catholics, though, ""because they don't read the Bible.""This is his final contribution to the world of literature.

She offers an intimate glimpse of the spouses and children left behind to cope when the men in the infantry battalion of 1-7 Cav are deployed to Iraq.We've seen media pictures proffering the stalwart strength and Mona Lisa smiles of army wives, but we haven't been host to their private trials--of farewells, homecomings, and transitions. Fallon captures their mixed emotions and fears with a gritty realism, and reveals critical, vital moments in their insular and marginal lives. She glances sharply into the tearful deployment, the lonely absence, and the stirring homecoming. How the wives cope with these changes is a recurring theme.This is fiction, but Fallon writes with authority: her husband, a major, was deployed in Iraq for two tours of duty while she lived in Fort Hood. She knows the depth of the cookie-cutter, thin-walled houses--they are occupied by courageous and terrified women with thick skins, empty beds, and tentative thoughts.The wives in this book form a proxy family together, the FRG (Family Readiness group), where, for better or worse, they convene and connect. They bond in this dry and desolate patch of Central Texas, support each other, and wait for news of the front. Mingling with civilians off base is distressing. It's painful to watch a dad knock around a ball with his son, or a couple dining out and dancing cheek to cheek. Some of these wives have babies who haven't yet met their daddies. How they endure the complex emotions of separation drives the narrative and compels the reader.As Fallon shows us, the time in limbo is often marked with dread and confusion. It can be a powerful change agent, mushroom their fear, or injure self-esteem, to name a few effects. It can dash a formerly positive body image, especially if anxiety and loneliness create eye bags and a gaunt complexion. The women in her stories often have sleep disturbances and eat erratically. One woman quells her insomnia by listening to her neighbor's routines through the permeable walls.In the first story, Meg goes to the Commissary, eyes a raw slab of steak--the rivulets of fat, the sanguinary juices, the protruding bone--and imagines a mortal battle wound. The women wake up every morning and scan the Internet news for reports of ambushes and roadside bombs, wondering if their husbands are safe in their quarters or unrecognizably shattered in numberless pieces. Meanwhile, they have individual, separate concerns. Fallon kicks it up a notch with her story about a wife in remission from breast cancer, waiting to see the latest reports of her medical tests. In the meantime, her kids did not show up for school, and she has to deal with the embarrassment of soldiers on base assisting, investigating, and scrutinizing her actions that day.And, what is it like to communicate with your loved one only through technology, to feel the unbearable absence of touch? To wait, and wait, time folding in on itself, or rolling out, while you cleave, living on emails, snail mail, and the rare skype. And, even when they return, the complex dynamics of adjustment and role reversal are stunning; the wives have been independent for so long that sharing a life again can be raw and awkward. Instead of joyful and warm, it may be glacial and fraught with erosion. All that alone time carves out multiple reflections and haunting desires. At least one wife has some lacerating news for her returning and wounded husband.And, what is it like for the men, the soldiers and officers who have bravely committed this time to the safety and well being of their fellow infantrymen? They didn't sign up to divide their loyalties, to betray their families, but the quixotic beast of war invades the frontier of domestic life, too. Some of them sneak cell phones into their camp. One of the soldiers becomes enchanted with a comely foreign interpreter while on a mission to search for IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices). Another soldier isn't sure if he is just paranoid or failed to perceive his wife's change of heart, and acts frantically on his fears. And some of them don't make it home. For those wives, it is the pain of the unknown, the moment of death that is now gone, that took their husband away. That image, the memories, and the disfigurement of grief remain.Imagine, all alone, with a flashlight, tiptoeing in the dark inside a squat, yellow, dusty rectangular building, suddenly bumping up against a life. You emit a startled gasp. That's what these stories are like. Fallon's prose is stark and incandescent. There are no frills or filler necessary to embellish these candid characters and situations, and I have only hinted at a few. The passages are powerful and lean, the nuances chilling and urgent, and the dénouements radiate with ambiguity. These are bracing mini-portraits with mega-wattage. When you hear Fort Hood mentioned in the news again, it will palpate with familiarity. You'll feel a jolt. It will never again be just that abstract military post in Texas. You'll know when the men are gone.This  is based on an advanced reading copy I received from the publisher in a lottery giveaway. I was not asked to write a  or praise this book.

Or watching the slanting orange sunlight during the waning days of autumn, the cool blue rays on the periphery just outside your reach. It's a field of fertile thought, a radiant garden; the pollinating, winged creatures absorb the nectar of its flowers, their fecundity extending the garden from the earth to the air, visibly and ethereally. Murakami's surreal prose invites the reader into a wonderland of quirky motifs and recurring themes; the iteration of symbols--sheep, landscape, and isolation, to name a few-- and the concentration on the minutiae of the protagonist's life--smoking, drinking a beer, listening to music, eating and cooking--ushers the reader into labyrinthine connections with the story.We open with the narrator, a joint owner of a translation and advert business in Tokyo, an imperturbable young man who appears almost anhedonic, but perhaps he is embracing a devotion to mediocrity, a concept explored with some regard. He clearly embraces his girlfriend, who isn't beautiful, but has a sixth sense about the future and exceptional ears that foment his carnal desires. At intervals, he ruminates on his failed past marriage with a gestalt acceptance.A strange man in a black suit sends the narrator on a wild goose chase--actually, a portentous wild sheep chase, to locate a single and singular sheep with a star on its back. (The paperback edition has an apt picture of the titular sheep.) It is an offer the young man can't refuse, as it is consigned to a dire but obscure ultimatum. He accepts the challenge, liberates himself from employment, colleagues, and material matters, and leaves with his girlfriend, headed to the punishing, mountainous landscape of Hokkaido.This is the first Murakami novel (1982) translated into English, and it helps to know that it is the third novel in his TRILOGY OF THE RAT; when the Rat character is introduced in the story, the reader senses a historical connection, a pull to the past--not just the protagonist's, but the story's. In Asian culture, the rat is a vehicle of the Hindu god Ganesh, unlike the unfavorable associations in Western culture. Moreover, sheep symbolism is linked to pastoral and idyllic imagery, as well as being sacrificial animals in many religions.Although not as fully realized as Murakami's later The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Kafka on the Shore, it shares the elastic nature of time, the cultural implications of Japanese imperialist expansion, and the encroachment of Westernization. His postmodern expression of war crimes and corruption are both artfully enigmatic and representational, i.e. he fuses the corporeal with myth and fantasy, so that the reader experiences a rarefied adventure laden with figurative images--images that seem initially obtuse, but as the narrative progresses, unfold into the heart of humanity.The purity and beauty of the writing engages the willing reader into the thematic core of emptiness, loneliness, and alienation. Optimism? Cynicism? Pessimism? Yes, and it is left to the reader to interpret the many philosophical threads. Just lay back and let the words wend through you, and the story will inevitably penetrate the many layers of your consciousness. At the end, my mind and even my body felt like a conduit of Murakami's prose.Many kudos to Alfred Birnbaum, whose translation into English is exemplary....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Sep 03, 2011",not set,"Sep 03, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11298.A_Wild_Sheep_Chase

Henry prize for this novella of the old American West in 2003. It originally appeared in the Paris Review but is now reissued and bound in hardback with an apt cover art—a painting by Regionalist Thomas Hart Benton called “The Race.” If you contemplate the painting for a while, you may feel the ghost of the book’s protagonist, Robert Grainier, as he, too, felt the ghosts and spirits of the dead.Robert Grainier is a man without a known beginning—at least, he didn’t know his parents, and neither did he know where he was from originally. Some cousin suspected Canada, and said that he spoke only French when he was left off in Fry, Idaho, circa 1893, arriving there on the Great Northern Railroad as a young lad. His aunt and uncle were his parents, and he grew up in the panhandle by the Kootenai River with the loggers, the Indians, the Chinese, and the trains.As the book opens in the summer of 1917, Grainier is helping his railroad crew of the Spokane International Railway (in the Idaho panhandle) hold a struggling Chinese laborer accused of stealing. They meant to throw him from the trestle, sixty feet above the rapids at the gorge, but the man, cursing and speaking in tongues, broke free and went hand-over-hand from beam to beam, until he disappeared.“The Chinaman, he was sure, had cursed them powerfully…and any bad thing might come of it.”And that was the signal incident that curses, spirits, and demons would inhabit the landscape of Grainier’s dreams. Often, in the background, is heard the melancholic whistle of the trains.Johnson’s story is a portrait of early 20th-century America as witnessed through the itinerant Grainier, a scrupulous, dignified man whose wife and infant daughter were consumed in a fire in their cabin while he was miles away working on the railroad or in the forest as a logger. Grainier’s long life is seen through snapshots juxtaposed in a deliberately disjointed style, submerging our thoughts deep into the great Northwest, as forests are cleared and the trains tracks are laid that connect one land to the next.“He was standing on a cliff…into a kind of arena enclosing…Spruce Lake…and now he looked down on it hundreds of feet below him, its flat surface as still and black as obsidian, engulfed in the shadow of surrounding cliffs, ringed with a double ring of evergreens and reflected evergreens.”Grainier came back and rebuilt on the burnt lot, the grief of his loss now a thing in his soul, a muted or massive thing, depending on his memories or his dreams. The dead spirit of his daughter appears in abstract or animal form to haunt him, and the wolves enter his soul.“…when Grainier heard the wolves at dusk, he laid his head back and howled for all he was worth…It flushed out something heavy that tended to collect in his heart…”Love, loss, death, and lust are wound into this short but powerful story, a story of a time that is receding from the collective American memories. Denis Johnson’s ode is an evocative and sublime remembrance of things past—of railroads built, of people buried, and of souls lost and wandering. Johnson awakens them, and puts them to rest.My oroginal  posted at MostlyFiction.com Here is the link:http://book.mostlyfiction.com/2......more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Aug 18, 2011","Aug 24, 2011",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/12328307-train-dreams

The myth and mania of New York is felt instantly, like a Springsteen song--channeling the diamond-hard look of a cobra into every nuance. Granted, it is hard to be a saint in the city; and between the saints and sinners lies the urban maw, swallowing the serrated and sequestered denizens of the boroughs into its viscera. There's a fugitive heart at the center of this story, electrifying and transformative. This book likely appeals to the under forty contemporary dreamers or the boomers who have witnessed stunning synchronous moments and transcendent, altered states. You have to relinquish control of the tiller, enjoy the ride, eyes to the wide, not fixed straight ahead. The story explores fate and coincidence, intersecting the lives of various individuals trying to legitimize their lives in the post 9/11 years, before the economic collapse of 2007. They are searching for intimacy and sanctuary and trying to reconcile past and present toward a redemptive future. LIGHTNING PEOPLE is best experienced with minimal disclosure; this  aims to pique your interest, not give you spoilers. It has tendrils of Colum McCann's Let the Great World Spin, as well as the Oscar-winning movie, Crash, but it's its own restless animal. Frequently edgy and grim, it is also romantic and adventurous. Bollen's style is often macabre, dosed with nostalgic love. Conspiracy theories and shadow governments tunnel into suspicious, neurotic minds, or are they actually the agency of fractured lives? Del is a fetching, educated woman from Greece, frustrated with her low-paying job handling snakes at the Bronx Zoo, pining for her green card. Her husband, Joseph, a well-paid TV commercial actor, agonizes over a bleak legacy that he keeps to himself. William, his fair-weather friend, is an out of work actor envious of Joseph. Del's ex-boyfriend, Raj, is a brilliant but hermetic photographer; his sister, Madi, is a successful entrepreneur, and Del's best friend. Madi is the dynamic glue that keeps Del and Raj connected. These five people form a network or grid around a radiant locus of nature and destiny and severe weather. Karma and morality get a beating and is eclipsed by coincidence, inverse twists, and dumb luck. Bollen stays one step ahead of the reader, but he isn't coy. He takes the reader to shocking, aberrant, and murky places of the human condition, testing the edge of each character's endurance and self-loathing. He will also make you queasy and appalled about the law, free will, and fate. It's a portrait of doom and beauty dancing on the head of a pin, with an undercurrent of vulnerability and valor that compels the reader forward. Bollen is audacious, a sense of mania blazing through the story, almost purple with his drama at times. You're either with him or you turn away in disgust as he smashes the coded rules, but he does it with such high voltage brio that I was seduced by his dangerous moves. This story sure talked gritty, but then it inexplicably made me cry. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jul 25, 2011","Aug 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11325698-lightning-people

Edmund De Waal is a world-renowned ceramicist from an illustrious family that was peer to the Rothschilds. In this memoir, he shares his family’s legacy of art, history, and the rise and fall of wealth over five generations. His Russian ancestors were grain merchants turned bankers from the extraordinarily wealthy and secular Jewish Ephrussi clan. They settled in Paris and rose to the top of European society, collecting priceless art and living glittering, enigmatic lives. Of all the pieces that he inherited (and that were saved), DeWaal is especially fond of the Japanese hand-carved netsuke, miniature sculptures that represent all matter of Japanese folklore and life.The family eventually falls victim to the National Socialist fanatical regime. Chapters 24-26 are the most shimmering and compelling of the memoir, describing in suspenseful detail how the netsuke were saved from the Nazi Anschluss. For those who are intrigued by cultural history at end-of-century Europe or the impact of fascism, this will be a rewarding and edifying read. I was captivated by the warmth, humor and elegance of the prose and the rich and tragic story of the Ephrussi clan....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 25, 2011","Aug 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9714223-the-hare-with-amber-eyes

Tectonic shifts in social dynamics and behavior will dThe sleepy town of Milledgeville, Georgia, circa 1960, is about to get a colossal wake-up call. Tectonic shifts in social dynamics and behavior will disrupt the civil order of its typically complacent peace. The high-pitched yowls heard at the center of town were previously the exclusive domain of author Flannery O'Connor's peacocks, housed on a 544-acre farm in Andalusia, four miles northwest of the central rural sprawl. Now the muted laments of malcontents and smug inhabitants will create vast cracks in the town's foundation and eclipse the peacock's cries.The story opens with the shrill, plangent brays of the peacocks intruding on the serenity of Cookie Himmel and her fiancé, Melvin Whiteson, the night before their wedding. Cookie, who is Milledgeville's southern belle beauty and community organizer, met the wealthy Melvin in New York, and brought him back home to start their married life. Cookie and Flannery have a murky past that is revealed in measured increments, furnishing the story with a past that threatens to ambush the future.The laconic O'Connor, disabled by lupus, manages to fluster Cookie at every opportunity. Complicating matters is the friendly relationship between Melvin and Flannery, commenced at the wedding and growing, despite Cookie's entreaties to her husband to stop seeing the author, her nemesis.Lona, the compliant wife of policeman and politically aspiring Bill Waters, is a restive soul who sews curtains for the people of Milledgeville, and has recently been hired by Cookie to decorate the windows of the Whiteson mansion. Lona's friendship with the town gossip, Miss Mary, is strengthened by all the years that Mary took care of Lona's daughter, Gigi. Now Miss Mary needs a return favor--for Lona to hire Mary's son, Joe, a quietly troubled but likable high school senior. The plan is for Lona to inveigle Joe to confide his torments to her, in an effort to cure what ails him psychologically.The first one hundred or so pages are about as bland as the town itself. In retrospect, this is obviously deliberate on Napolitano's part. There is an old-fashioned dowdiness to the language, even a few clichés--yet smartly transacted, despite her prosaicness, to lull the reader into Milledgeville's collective vanilla life. The inclusion of Flannery O'Connor was risky, of course, as an historical individual can be a distracting, dubious force in a fictional story. In this case, however, Flannery's presence is both vital and pivotal.The stoic purr of Milledgeville cruises along, a little messiness beginning to darken the sky, and the wild grasses of the landscape, almost succumbing to ennui, start to rustle. Abruptly, the sanguinity is blind-sided, and the reader, in a crucial, irreversible moment, is hit by a two-ton truck. And then hurled through the windshield (metaphorically speaking, of course). We are seized from passive observance to pressing pain and tragic immediacy.What is impressive about Napolitano's craftsmanship is her ability to find the domain between melodrama and verisimilitude, to captivate the reader through phenomenal events that are grounded in authenticity. She does it through the seemingly serviceable prose, her musculature residing in her story. Napolitano, in the final assessment, is a consummate storyteller. She doesn't lose control of her keenly drawn characters once they are covered with the shattered glass of events, stranded on the highway of a broken life. She continues to develop and reveal, develop and reveal, and carries the reader effectively to a genuine conclusion.There is one crushed relationship that, towards the end, evolves in a way that may be difficult for some readers to accept. Can the shards of tragedy manifest into triumph? Napolitano succeeds in making it plausible, by committing the characters to acute self-examination and opening a valve to redemption. Take a good hard look at sleepy Milledgeville, Georgia, and find a moving, merciful salvation through catastrophic pain and suffering. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 31, 2011","Aug 17, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9949524-a-good-hard-look

Henry prize for this novella of the old American West in 2003. It originally appeared in the Paris Review but is now reissued Denis Johnson won an O. Henry prize for this novella of the old American West in 2003. It originally appeared in the Paris Review but is now reissued and bound in hardback with an apt cover art—a painting by Regionalist Thomas Hart Benton called “The Race.” If you contemplate the painting for a while, you may feel the ghost of the book’s protagonist, Robert Grainier, as he, too, felt the ghosts and spirits of the dead.Robert Grainier is a man without a known beginning—at least, he didn’t know his parents, and neither did he know where he was from originally. Some cousin suspected Canada, and said that he spoke only French when he was left off in Fry, Idaho, circa 1893, arriving there on the Great Northern Railroad as a young lad. His aunt and uncle were his parents, and he grew up in the panhandle by the Kootenai River with the loggers, the Indians, the Chinese, and the trains.As the book opens in the summer of 1917, Grainier is helping his railroad crew of the Spokane International Railway (in the Idaho panhandle) hold a struggling Chinese laborer accused of stealing. They meant to throw him from the trestle, sixty feet above the rapids at the gorge, but the man, cursing and speaking in tongues, broke free and went hand-over-hand from beam to beam, until he disappeared.“The Chinaman, he was sure, had cursed them powerfully…and any bad thing might come of it.”And that was the signal incident that curses, spirits, and demons would inhabit the landscape of Grainier’s dreams. Often, in the background, is heard the melancholic whistle of the trains.Johnson’s story is a portrait of early 20th-century America as witnessed through the itinerant Grainier, a scrupulous, dignified man whose wife and infant daughter were consumed in a fire in their cabin while he was miles away working on the railroad or in the forest as a logger. Grainier’s long life is seen through snapshots juxtaposed in a deliberately disjointed style, submerging our thoughts deep into the great Northwest, as forests are cleared and the trains tracks are laid that connect one land to the next.“He was standing on a cliff…into a kind of arena enclosing…Spruce Lake…and now he looked down on it hundreds of feet below him, its flat surface as still and black as obsidian, engulfed in the shadow of surrounding cliffs, ringed with a double ring of evergreens and reflected evergreens.”Grainier came back and rebuilt on the burnt lot, the grief of his loss now a thing in his soul, a muted or massive thing, depending on his memories or his dreams. The dead spirit of his daughter appears in abstract or animal form to haunt him, and the wolves enter his soul.“…when Grainier heard the wolves at dusk, he laid his head back and howled for all he was worth…It flushed out something heavy that tended to collect in his heart…”Love, loss, death, and lust are wound into this short but powerful story, a story of a time that is receding from the collective American memories. Denis Johnson’s ode is an evocative and sublime remembrance of things past—of railroads built, of people buried, and of souls lost and wandering. Johnson awakens them, and puts them to rest.My  is originally posted at MostlyFiction.com Here is the link:http://book.mostlyfiction.com/2......more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 18, 2011","Aug 10, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1821187.Train_Dreams

She was born unnamed to British parents in Lagos, Nigeria, during the end Evie Steppman's mammoth ears are a repository of history, memory, and time. She was born unnamed to British parents in Lagos, Nigeria, during the end of British colonial rule (1946), and, now in her fifties, she is chronicling her story and the stories of various individuals from a collection of documents, letters, diaries, pamphlets, photographs, and assorted, emotionally powerful objects, or ""unica"" (one-of-a-kind objects).Evie suffers from severe tinnitus (which resembles Ménière's disease), and, isolated in an attic in Eastern Scotland, is anxious to record these memories before she is engulfed by the din in her head. Her gifted and telepathic sense of hearing is analogous to Saleem's prophetic olfactory organ in Rushdie's Midnight's Children.Lagos is an allegory to Evie's birth, a place that had grown out of the water. This duality of land and water euphemized Evie's ability to inhabit more than one ""world,"" through her towering perspicacity of audition.""My ears were extraordinary. Crimson, membranous, graced with heavy lobes, they whorled their way into the hollow where ciliary movement stirred, absorbing the sounds...All my talent had gone into the development of my ears.""Like Rushdie, Williams uses polyphonic diversity of voice and magical realism to tell a story of ordinary people living during extraordinary times. But whereas Saleem is born precisely at the stroke of midnight during the birth of a nation, Evie's birth is a tragic affair. Clinging to her mother's womb, she coveted her life inside the amniotic chamber, where her acute sense of hearing began. Evie delayed her own birth by two months, subsequently ending her mother's life.""...the vicious spitting of feral cats, rugbeaters thwacking, fat goats being led to market...women pounding manioc. I heard the punishing of boy thieves...My hearing was demotic and unprincipled.""Evie's audition is also temporally transcendent--she hears through time and space, as if her hearing materialized from the primordial steam that saturated her with timeless tutoring of the past and present. As well as binding her to history, her ears have yoked her to ancient myths and fables.The story is a non-linear journey, but is cohesively braided through the channels of Evie's aural migrations -- through empire, war, genocide, independence, and a glam rock tour through the US, David Bowie-style. A key event underground with the nightsoil workers is a literary triumph of compassion and imagination, a vivid, hallucinatory examination of humanity through those forgotten and marginalized souls. Williams seamlessly controls the disclosure of multiple events, with the penultimate, harrowing scene singularly expressed through a letter.THE ECHO CHAMBER is both a subtle and outrageous novel that echoes other novels-- a pastiche and synthesis of luminaries, such as Isaac Babel, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bruno Schulz, Georges Perec, and others who are interwoven to buttress the story. There are a staggering number of motifs, metaphors, and allegories, which begs a second reading, just as complex music demands repeated immersion.The novel's strength of character is matched by its astonishing assortment of objects that tell their own stories, such as an alleged ancient map, the mappa mundi, and its mythical ""monstrous races,"" one of the most piquant images of the story. The picture on the map of a pelican is so evocative and shattering in its nuance that it will likely be embedded in the reader's mind eternally.This  would not be complete without mentioning that the diary of Evie's lover, Damaris, is penned by Luke Williams' friend, Natasha Soobramanien. These two chapters are electrifying and immediately felt, removing a bit of the 19th-century fustiness that sometimes injects the narrative and gracing it with impetuous vigor. Moreover, the gap that the reader feels at times with Evie is closed, the distance removed.Enter this splendid realm of objects and stories, this auricular theater of sound, the emptiness of silence, the chamber of echoes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 07, 2011","Aug 09, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10061270-the-echo-chamber

Her skin has been “melachromed” by the State for her crime of abortion, and for not naming the abortionist and not identifying the father, the celebrated pastor and TV (“vid”) evangelist, Aidan Dale, who is now the nation's ""Secretary of Faith."" Her sentence is thirty days confinement, and then sixteen years in the community as a Red, where she will be constantly ostracized and persecuted.Other criminals of the same or different color (depending on the crime) are wandering through the prison of life, beyond the walls of crowded cells (this is the State’s answer for overcrowding), and many don’t survive--the Blue child molesters have especially low survival rates. Hannah is deeply in love with the married Aiden, and refuses to upbraid him or the doctor who was kind and tender to her. She is also a product of her religious upbringing, and when she wakes up Red, she believes that she deserves this punishment.Many dystopian novels are noir and bleak—you can just hear Mahler’s symphonies in your imagination—the lost world of childhood, the yearning of fulfillment, life’s despair and discord. Therefore, Jordan’s more insistent, high-strung tone in reimagining a liberal interpretation of THE SCARLET LETTER, Hawthorne’s gothic melodrama, was unexpected. Her exuberance is like a lit match that never goes out. It has a pumping action, much like Dennis Lehane’s in his Kenzie and Gennaro series. It also conforms to the margins of conventional genre more than the open-endedness of literature; Hannah is portrayed as a solid, misunderstood hero, and the demarcation of villain/hero-martyr is obvious and continuous with the secondary characters as well, except for a surprising and complex French radical named Simone, the most intriguing character in this tale. Much of the time, Hannah is on the lam with her newfound Red friend, Kayla, and heartily braves and overcomes dangerous hurdles at a page-turning glee.In this near-future world, Roe v Wade has been overturned, and most of the fifty states have outlawed abortion. The government métier is fundamental New Testament, and is ruthless and unforgiving in its Kingdom-minded law. From reading this book, it appears that abortion is the primary preoccupation of the militant State, and that Aidan Dale is the only celebrity on the vid. Much of the novel takes place in the North Dallas area, where Jordan partly grew up. She knows the ingrained and forceful pieties of the area (the actual geographical area of Roe v Wade), and seems to draw on them. She started this book even before MUDBOUND, and it is left to wonder if she was shaking loose some demons from the Texas Red Oaks.This is a commercial novel, unlike MUDBOUND, with a knowing arc and slender, reductive characters. She has a gift for thrumming action, even if it tends toward didacticism and a tidy outcome. This isn’t a novel that provokes thinking, as Jordan does much of the thinking for the reader, but it does provide action and visceral thrills and some poetic lyricism amidst the many indictments against religious zealots. There is an exquisitely transcendent scene about two-thirds through, where a quietness and stillness pervades for a few pages, and Hannah reaches a key turning point in her life, and expresses it in a way that I hope others won’t fail to appreciate. It may seem lurid at face value, or even gratuitous, but it is anything but—rather, it is sublime in its implication. This was the high point of refinement in this not typically nuanced novel.Twists and turns are relentless and exciting, although it is obvious, in this world of morally challenged monkeys running the State, who will finally prevail. Ambiguity is not a paramount trait in this heavy-handed story with potboiler themes. It is comfort food—like popcorn with a little too much butter, and addictive. The author will keep you fastened till the end, because Jordan’s thrall with her characters and exultance with her story is contagious and highly spirited....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,"Jul 22, 2011","Jul 23, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11045709-when-she-woke

However, I urge you to read THE PASSAGE first, because the epic as a whole is a finely calibrated accretion of history, plot and character. The Twelve refers to the twelve ""parent"" or original virals, the death-row-inmate subjects-turned-virals from ""Project Noah,"" who must be liquidated in order to save the world. The thrust of this book is the hunt of the twelve by Amy, Alicia, Peter, and company.""All eyes."" Two words commonly spoken by the First Colony Watchers, starting in Book one--survivors of the end of the world as we know it. I shiver when I read it now, this sober siren call of fellowship to signal strength and vision, to defeat the virals. It carries an additional, deep and tacit message now--that I honor you, comrade (lover, brother, father, mother, friend, sister, soldier)--go bravely and stay safe. And keep your eyes forward, against the last remaining light of the day.Cronin's weighty trilogy, a hybrid of mainstream and literary fiction, isn't just a story about these photophobic vampire virals, identified variously as dracs, smokes, flyers, jumps, and glowsticks. Rather, it is a portrait of humanity in extremis. Virals, caused by a military experiment gone awry, are a malignant, violent force of annihilation. But what reserves of strength keep us fighting? How do people live in a post-apocalyptic world? Is another end coming? Or a beginning? Is the world even worth saving? THE TWELVE, like THE PASSAGE, has as much anthropology, eschatology, psychology, and philosophy, as it does gore, battle and horror.Cronin's tilted, unconventional structure has an elegant, understated, and circular pull and propulsion, muted at times, roaring at others. He periodically pauses in the progress of the plot for his intense and luminous miniatures--mystical, sensory flights of prose and backstory elaboration, (although briefer in THE TWELVE), which deepen the intricate plot strands as well as create a vivid landscape, emotionally and physically. Gradually, he braids it all together.THE TWELVE isn't linear, but it is, ultimately, progressive. It starts back at year zero (the viral outbreak), providing new characters and expanding on previous ones, as it steadily brings us back to the present, approximately 97 A.V. (After Virus), five years after the end of THE PASSAGE. Peppered here and there are the terse, abstract texts dated 1003 A.V. And, yes, the cliffhanger ending of the first book, as well as all strands, are eventually returned to and understood. The author is in control of his sublime, colossal narrative.Cronin traveled every mile in the book for his research, and it shows. His sense of place is so atmospheric and sensuous, alive and turbulent, that geography is a character in itself. From the benevolent but arch company of assembled defense forces in Kerrville, Texas; to a terrifying, totalitarian-ruled, labor camp in Iowa; and to a handful of scrappy iconoclasts that roam from place to place, the author's conception of a fractured world flashes and flickers with billion-kilowatt energy in every setting.Cronin's complex character development equals any realistic literary novel. Amy, Alicia and Peter (and others) continue to evolve, although Peter, admittedly, was more of a placeholder in THE TWELVE, notwithstanding a few valorous confrontations with virals. There's no doubt in my mind that he will figure largely in the final book, now that Amy's character has expanded in surprising, startling, and inevitable ways. He and Amy are bound, as was determined in THE PASSAGE. However, as Amy is more revealed, Alicia becomes more eerie and enigmatic, and discovers an unpredictable and, well, animate love. You also unexpectedly learn more about her descendants.But wait until you meet Guilder, and reconnect with Lila (Wolgast's ex-wife); the pages nearly howl with the portrayal of these two characters. From their skin and viscera to their organs and bowels, I have rarely encountered anyone comparable to Lila and Guilder in a horror or dystopian novel. And there are numerous and brilliant secondary characters, such as Carter, the twelfth original viral, that are graphic and memorable. Greer, from the first book, is now a military prisoner and seer. Grey, a sweeper from the first book, finds an opportunity to amend for his past sins, but it doesn't quite work out the way he planned. Also three-dimensional are the virals, a ripe and sentient life force of consummate destruction. And, there are some new developments in store regarding viral species transformation.The final book, THE CITY OF MIRRORS, is due for release in 2014. The title is a terrific tease, but I believe I possess the prescience to interpret its significance. It gives me a soulful, excited feeling. I know what it means, where this is headed, and that makes it triply electrifying. Addendum: Cronin is my homeboy, if you’ll pardon my colloquialism. He hails from my hometown (Boston), and lives where I have lived (Bellaire, Texas). He based the First Colony (THE PASSAGE) geography on Idyllwild, California, a place I once knew intimately. It was a superb sequestered setting for an isolated survivor community.

In Diana Spiotta's new novel, STONE ARABIA, eccentric narcissist, obsessive archivist and iconoclastic musician Nik Kranis mines that fleeting fissure of light and warns his sister, Denise, ""Self-curate or disappear.""This nostalgic and affecting story of siblings (and family) is a philosophical meditation on memory and the driven desire for autobiography--to document and render a consequential life, and to assemble disparate experiences into coherent narratives. ""And even then,"" says Denise, ""the backward glance is distorted by the lens of the present...It is not just that emotions distort memory. It is that memory distorts memory.""At the vortex of this novel is fifty-year-old Nik Kranis, aka his alter ego, Nik Worth, a pre-punk, no-hit wonder, LA musician, whose band The Fakes almost made it twenty years ago. ""Nik had the sensibility down. And Nik had the look down. He was born to look pasty and skinny and angular.""But a combination of self-sabotage and solipsism undermined commercial success, and Nik alternately constructed a legendary career in music via his manufactured narrative, ""The Chronicles."" Stretching back from1973-2004, ""The Chronicles"" is a thirty-volume reinvention of a life, a daily scrapbook and fictionalized biography of Nik Worth, platinum rock star. It is a career arc so detailed and spectacular that it would rival Dylan's.Included in The Chronicles is every band Nik was ever in, every record he ever made, and his solo career, recorded via his twenty-volume ""Ontology of Worth."" We also get liner notes, s (sometimes highly critical and damning, all created from Nik's imagination), obits of former band members, and detailed artwork for every cover. Nik is what we would call a legend in his own mind.We depend on Denise's shifting narrative modes to trace the authentic Nik, a hermetic, aging, chain-smoking, alcoholic mooch who is blasé about his present decay and his future prospects. ""He pursued a lifetime of abuse that could only come from a warped relationship with the future."" But even Denise is hooked on Nik's worth as a musician.The story is narrated largely through Denise's point-of-view, which shifts back and forth from first to third person, and is conveyed like the 80's eclectic music scene, mash-up style, that fans of Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad would appreciate. She's the younger sister and caretaker of the family, and Nik's biggest fan. However, Denise is concerned with exact recall, and is writing ""The ""Counterchronicles"" as counterpoint to Nik's mythical biography, to earnestly document an accurate record of recent events.Besides Nik, Denise's life orbits around her daughter, Ada, a documentary filmmaker who wants Nik as her next subject; a tepid relationship with boyfriend, Jay, who she sees every two weeks for sex and old movies; and a mother who is suffering from early dementia. Denise is frightened of her own memory loss, convinced that it is imminent and inevitable.Trebly and anxious, Denise panics vicariously through sordid and tragic news events. External though they are, they penetrate her personal boundaries, leak inside and cause ongoing existential crises. SARS, Abu Ghraib, and a celebrity murder-suicide are but a few of the terrors that invade Denise's psyche. Moreover, Denise and Nik are enmeshed to a degree that ""My sister doesn't count as my audience because she feels like an extension of me. She's, well, an alternative version of me.""Spiotta's creamy prose is abundant with quotable lines and arch aphorisms. It is also warm, arresting, emotionally accessible. There isn't much of a plot, but the story is powerful and vibrant, laced with mordant, electric riffs and visceral, melancholy chords.

Harbach sets the robust tone and pacing here, with a droll wit and a steady, fluid tempo. He coaxes us to treasure his characters as much as he clearly enjoyed writing them. Occasionally, it feels self-conscious, that he is maneuvering us to like them.During the Peoria game, farmboy shortstop Henry Skrimshander impresses college sophomore and student coach Mike Schwartz, enough for Mike to recruit South Dakotan Henry to Westish College in Wisconsin. Mike takes Henry under his wing and they form an intense, interdependent bond. Henry is a runty guy lacking season but is a wonder boy with his glove named Zero. The more garrulous Mike is brawny, brash, and a superb team supporter, but no record-breaking player.The title, The Art of Fielding, comes from the (fictional) and well-read baseball bible that is Henry's inspiration and encouragement, a kind of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance guide for baseball players. Athlete and philosopher-writer of the book, retired player Aparicio Rodriguez, holds a shortstop record for number of games with no errors. Henry aspires to meet him and match his record. Along the way, he must confront a crisis of confidence and a mound of angst and anxiety.Henry's roommate, Owen, is scholarly, sartorial, and secure in his own skin. He's a brotherly friend to Henry, and the only player who gets away with reading books on the bench. He starts out dimensional, but unfortunately dwindles to not much more than a set piece later on, more of a vehicle for the story's progression.College president Guert Affenlight is a hale, hearty, and handsome intellect with cultured charm, who looks younger than his sixty-ish years. He's been estranged from his only daughter, Pella, since she skipped out years ago and married an older architect.Now the prodigal daughter returns, solo, and Guert and Pella make a go of repairing their fractured bond as well as establishing other new relationships. Guert's conduct in all affairs wasn't wholly convincing, and the author engineered a facile plot turn towards the climax, a tactic that a veteran author might have avoided.As the story unfolds and the bases get loaded, the reader is taken on a journey of second chances and last chances, where a phoenix can rise out of the Astroturf, and a curve ball can cut loose and fly. It's a big-hearted, warm-hearted story of friendship, love, and loyalty. There's also a wink and a nod to a scene in John Irving's A Prayer for Owen Meany.Debut author Harbach is an ace storyteller, terrifically engaging, who nevertheless went a half inning or so too long in the end, and presented a few implausible events along the way. The exuberance of his writing is his best defense against his overindulgence.

Consider his first novel, MEZZANINE, where a man is on a lunch hour hunt for shoelaces. All the odds and ends, the digressions and pop-up thoughts that can enter a desultory mind, are playfully and artfully presented in a readable and engaging manner. In VOX, a phone call between a lonely man and woman hook up on the phone. They are able to talk about everyday matters and lure the reader into their idle chatter, so that the sexual banter is fluid instead of gratuitous. In his last novel, THE ANTHOLOGIST, Baker uses stream-of-consciousness to wax poetic and edify the reader on verse. His non-fiction HUMAN SMOKE, my personal favorite, is an exquisite tome that shifts the kaleidoscope on history’s sacred cows.Baker chose a small concept idea for his latest, HOUSE OF HOLES, a cheeky plunge into lust and vulgarity so steep and rank, so exhaustive and consummate, that it is recommended to be read in small doses. That’s easy, as each surreal chapter is its own short carnal experience. Although some characters appear in several chapters, they are not immersed into a tight, ongoing storyline, except for Shandee, who finds a male arm, which is detached from its owner (Dave), and seeks to find the rest of his body. The eponymous HOH is the main character, and everyone else is a fornicating subject. People come to the House of Holes to make their prurient dreams come true.Somewhere or anywhere/everywhere are circles that are potential portals—the end of a straw, the putting tee of the seventh green, the fourth dryer from the left at the laundromat at the corner of 18th Street and Grover Avenue--that will suck up (or down) and send the willing concupiscent to the House of Holes. There are no limits to what you can do with your anatomy at HOH, and Baker will provide infinite LMAO and OMG moments as you read. I don’t think any author has come up with so many creative terms for the most sexual parts of our body: meatstick, truncheon, peeny wanger, musclemeat, length of badness, bulldog, cockpoles, hamsteak, thundertube, peckerdickcock, beast, frilly doilies of labial flesh, slobbering kitty, bungee hole, purple cometwat, slippery salope—well, you get the point.Highbrow and lowbrow blend together, and it is evident that Baker is a scholar with a wanton repertoire of ideas. Some chapters are more “fulfilling” than others, also. For example, a woman nose-dives into a portal and ends up inside her friend’s penis. Getting out was quite the liberating experience for both of them. In another chapter, a woman, Zilka, gets her clitoris stolen at an airport security check, by someone known as the Purloiner.“…we’ve determined that your clitoris is not a carry-on item…It’s swollen and oversized and over the weight limit, and I’m going to have to remove it now.”Zilka sees it going into a clear plastic baggie with a numbered label on it. She seeks help from the HOH to get it back, as the Purloiner is known to loiter there.Crotchal transfers, temporary scrotal removal, sex with headless men, Penis Washes, Hall of the Armless Men Who Still Want to Fuck Twat—this is just a fraction of the dizzying booty in this book, just an ampule of the sex blasts of comic and twisted derangement provided between these sticky pages. Rather than read it solo, this would make a humorously lewd parlor game between trusted friends at a dinner party (make that AFTER dinner). You could truth or dare it—read a chapter on a dare—but I wouldn’t advise trying any of these tricks yourself, or with each other!Take a ride on the “Pornsucker” ship or gaze at the 12-screen Porndecahedron of licentious delights. This  comes with a warning, however, something that Erica Jong once said:“My reaction to porno films is as follows; After the first ten minutes, I want to go home and screw, after the first twenty minutes, I never want to screw again as long as I live.”...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2011","Jul 08, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10108469-house-of-holes

The Kid is recently out of jail and on ten-year probation in fictional Calusa County, and is required to wear a GPS after soliciting sex from an underage girl. Ironically, he is still a virgin. The Kid cannot leave the county, but he also cannot reside within 2,500 feet from any place children would congregate. That leaves three options—the swamplands, the airport area, or the Causeway. He chooses the Causeway and meets other sex offenders, a seriously motley crew, who consciously isolate from each other. He befriends one old man, the Rabbit, but sticks to his tent, his bicycle, and his alligator-size pet iguana, Iggy. Later, he procures a Bible.These disenfranchised convicts are enough to make readers squirm. Moreover, in the back of the reader’s mind is the question of whether authorial intrusion will be employed in an attempt to manipulate the reader into sympathizing with these outcasts. It takes a master storyteller, one who can circumnavigate the ick factor, or, rather, subsume it into a morally complex and irresistible reading experience, to lure the wary, veteran reader. Banks’ artful narrative eases us in slowly and deftly breaks down resistance, piercing the wall of repugnance. It infiltrates bias, reinforced by social bias, and allows you to eclipse antipathy and enter the sphere of the damned. A willing reader ultimately discovers a captivating story, and reaches a crest of understanding for one young man without needing to accept him. An illegal police raid on the Causeway, provoked by hatred and politics, disrupts the Kid’s relatively peaceful life early on, and now he has nowhere to turn. Subsequently, a hurricane wipes out the makeshift homes of the inhabitants. The kid becomes a migrant, shuffling within the legal radius of permitted locales. At about this time, he meets the Professor, who the Kid calls “Haystack,” an obese sociologist at the local university who is the size and intellect of a mountain, an enigmatic man with a past of shady government work and espionage. He is conducting a study of homelessness and particularly the homeless, convicted sex offender population. The Professor offers the Kid financial and practical assistance in exchange for a series of taped interviews. He aims to help the Kid gain control and understanding over his life, to empower him to move beyond his pedophilia. They form a partnership of sorts, but the Kid remains leery of the Professor and his agenda. The Professor’s opaque past, his admitted secrets and lies, marks him as an unreliable narrator. Or does it? Later, perilous developments radically alter their relationship, a fitting move on the author’s part that provides sharp contrasts and deeper characterization. Sex offenders are the criminal group most collectivized into one category of “monsters.” Banks takes a monster and probes below the surface of reflexive response. There is no attempt to defend the Kid’s crime or apologize for it. We see a lot of the events through his eyes, and decide whether he is reliable or not. He acquires an undernourished, skulking yellow dog and a crusty old grey parrot with clipped wings and a salty tongue. His relationship with these animals is rendered without a lick of sentimentality, but it bestows the most resonant and powerful feelings in the reader compared to anywhere else in the book. The care and feeding of dependents bring out the Kid’s protective instincts and help keep him focused.The book is divided into five parts. Along the way, Banks dips into rhetorical digressions on sex, pornography, geography, and human nature, slowing down the momentum and disengaging the tension. These intervals are formal and stiff, although they are eventually braided into the story at large. However, despite these static flourishes, the story progresses with confidence and strength.Most characters, whether stand-up citizens or sex offenders, have a moniker, which deliberately mechanizes them, but between the author and reader, humanization occurs between the pages. There’s Shyster, the pedophilic, disbarred lawyer and ex-Senator; Otis, the Rabbit, an elderly, disabled member of the tribe; and a Hemingway-esque character, the Writer, who incidentally resembles Banks himself; and others who personify their names.Overall, the languid pace of the novel requires steadfast patience, but commitment to it has a fine payoff. Readers are rewarded with a thrilling denouement and a pensive but provocative ending. It inspires contemplation and dynamic discussion, and makes you think utterly outside the box.Read my full  on http://book.mostlyfiction.com/2...

Amor Towles's sophisticated retro-era novel of manners captures If a novel could win an award for best cinematography, this would take home the gold. Amor Towles's sophisticated retro-era novel of manners captures Manhattan 1938 with immaculate lucidity and a silvery focus on the gin and the jazz, the nightclubs and the streets, the pursuit of sensuality, and the arc of the self-made woman.The novel's preface opens in 1966, with a happily married couple attending a Walker Evans photography exhibition. An unlikely chance encounter stuns the woman, Katey--a picture of a man staring across a canyon of three decades, a photograph of an old friend. Thus begins the flashback story of Katey's roaring twenties in the glittering 30's.Katey Kontent (Katya) is the moral center of the story, an unapologetic working girl--more a bluestocking than a blue blood-- born in Brighton Beach of Russian immigrant parents. She's an ambitious and determined statuesque beauty à la Tierney or Bacall who seeks success in the publishing industry. She works as hard by day as she plays at night. Her best friend, Eve (Evelyn) Ross, is a Midwest-born Ginger Rogers /Garbo character mix, with jazz cat spirit and a fearless, cryptic glamor. She refuses daddy's money and embraces her free spirit:""I'm willing to be under anything...as long as it isn't somebody's thumb.""Katey and Eve flirt with shameless savoir-faire, and are quick with the clever repartees. They will kiss a man once that they'll never kiss twice, and glide with effortless élan among all the social classes of New York. Moreover, they can make a few dollars stretch through many a martini, charming gratis drinks from fashionable men. With their nerve and gaiety, the two would be equally savvy at Vanity Fair or the Algonquin Round Table, or in a seedy bar on the Lower East Side.Eve and Katey meet the sphinx-like Tinker Grey on New Year's Eve, 1937, at the Hotspot, a jazz bar in Greenwich Village. Tinker's métier is Gatsby-esque--an inscrutable, ruggedly handsome man in cashmere, a mysterious lone figure with an enigmatic mystique. The three become fast friends, but as with many triangulating relationships, a hairline rivalry sets in. Then a cataclysmic tragedy shatters the cool grace of their bond, and their solidarity is ruptured.Towles is spectacular at description and atmosphere, keeping a keen camera's eye on the city with a polished pedigree of writing that is rare in a debut novel. A smoky haze envelopes the streets and clubs and buildings, which the reader can't help surveying in all the rich colors of vintage black and white. The writing is dense, yet fluid and ambient, rich as a contralto, and cool as a saxophone. Tendrils of Edith Wharton flow through, as well as Fitzgerald, and echoes of Capote's Holly Golightly.At times, the lush descriptions threaten to eclipse the story, and the characters recede. This is a book of manners, so the action resides in the conflict between individual ambitions and desires and the acceptable social codes of behavior between classes. However, the middle section stagnates, as one character hugs most of the narrative in repetitive days and nights, the psychological complexities dimming. It loses some steam as the taut thrill of the first half wanes, but an understated closure recharges it again.Overall, the beauty of the novel endures, and the sensuality of the prose lingers. The reader is also edified on the origin of the title, and the author folds it in neatly to the story. The characters are crisp and contoured, delightful and satisfying, even if one left the stage a bit too soon. This is one male writer who finesses his female characters with impressive agility and assurance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,171,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2011","Jul 08, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10054335-rules-of-civility

Ironically, the elevation and climate of this suburban McMansion is really desert, so when the Torres-Thomspon household is forced to lay off Pepe due to personal financial problems, and Guadalupe, their underpaid Mexicana nanny, Scott Torres and Maureen Thomson are helpless with their tropical or semi-tropical garden, and it begins to curl up, dry out, and die.The nanny duties without extra pay now fall on the housekeeper and cook, Araceli, their remaining employee, an undocumented Mexicana who was once an art student in Mexico City until economic problems forced her to seek solace in the US. The three offspring of the Torres-Thompsons are, in Maureen's opinion, the real homegrown exotic orchids that need to be nurtured and nourished with expensive toys, outstanding birthday parties, and private schools, as well as a limit to the gaming devices coveted by Scott Torres, a once big-time game software developer now working in a managerial capacity and watching his funds slip from his ever loosening grasp.Maureen is a housewife in charge of their two inquisitive sons and a toddler, with a wallet full of overextended credit cards that she intends to use to ecologically balance her garden and fill it with ginormous cacti and succulents. Maureen defends this intervention (by a professional service) after her dying tropical or semi-tropical garden was ridiculed at her son's birthday party. She decides to correct that by planting ""natural"" flora, at an obscene $10,000.There are many contrasts and literary allusions immediately felt by the reader that express dramatic and comedic irony, and a deep well of extended metaphors in this novel of identity, class, home, politics, greed, media agenda, ethnic bigotry, and hypocrisy in Southern California.On the first page, Scott Torres, who Maureen once called ""King of the 21st Century,"" is attempting to master the lawnmower that Pepe handled with such facility. This is analogous to Sherman McCoy in Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities, attempting to subjugate and leash a dachshund. McCoy's life as ""Master of the Universe"" has yet to be destroyed, but his inability to easily conquer a dog foreshadows with terrific nuance. In Tobar's story, Torres is already financially defeated as the novel opens, and his delayed triumph over the lawnmower is superbly demonstrated, especially as Araceli is secretly watching his bumbling attempts with grim satisfaction.In just a few well-drawn sentences, native Guatemalan Tobar has hooked the reader with character definition and dimension. His repeated, sardonic use of ""Torres-Thompson household"" alone is sufficient to subtly inform the reader of the irony of contrasts and conspicuous class conceit. They are the textbook prosperous family--earnestly politically correct, yet as protective as monarchs, trying to straddle the fence between their adopted idealism of cultural ""equality"" and their actual lifestyles. The ambitious scope of this novel--to take the reader further and further into a culturally Hispanic LA in order to accent the Torres-Thompson duplicity, spotlight the city's phony pietism and sanctimony, and render redemption, is where it fails.What happened? Tobar's authorial intrusion came on strong and early; his inconsistent style often drifted to telegraphing and expository writing, doing the thinking for the reader. Nuance was eclipsed by affected and heavy-handed manipulation, so that it stalled out by the middle of the book.Despite Tobar's own native culture, which I expected to aid in providing the reader with an authentic reading experience, I was distanced early on. He lacked the vernacular and idiomatic honesty of The Bonfire of the Vanities, and Junot Diaz's The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. He gave us an ""invasive species"" metaphor, like Diaz's mongoose, to play with, he gave us a dissembling family, and then he stole that novel away from us and started intruding with stereotypes and telecasts. There is a gritty, epic story in here, but Tobar invaded his narrative with forced entry, and trumpeted his themes too obtrusively. A few more drafts and adept authorial removal could restore this story to its opening brilliance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Aug 16, 2011","Jul 08, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10898140-the-barbarian-nurseries

If these terms appear to be incompatible pairings, the reader will grasp the seeming polarity as axiomatic soon after feasting on Edie Meidav’s complex narrative style. A carnal vapor infuses every provocative page of this unorthodox psychological crime thriller. Contrary to the suggestive cover, title, and product description, this will not appeal to fans of chick lit or genre suspense thrillers. This is more in tune with Martin Amis or Salman Rushdie, with a peppering of TC Boyle and Dan Chaon. Muscular, sweat-producing, and erudite, the satisfaction of reading these pages rests on the reader’s consent to capitulate control of predetermined ideas and conceptions and enter into a contract with the author, giving Meidav permission and authority to rule the aesthetic jurisdiction, and to accede to the flow, command, and demand of its prose.The eponymous title refers to Lana Mahler and her best friend, Rose, who meet as teenagers and form a bond that graduates from symbiotic to alpha/supplicant (Lana as alpha). They call themselves Lola One and Lola Two. Lana’s parents are both esteemed academics; her father, Vic, is a neuroscientist cum philosopher of the counterculture variety, and has his own willing supplicants known as “shaggies.” Lana’s mother is an ethnologist/feminist who has garnered popular fame. As noted, the novel takes place primarily in California, with an emphasis on the analysis of California lifestyles and attitudes, particularly the free-thinking Berkeley. Lana and Rose parted ways many years ago, but the psychodynamics of their early relationship continues to haunt both of them.The book opens in 2008 in a California penitentiary. Vic Mahler is on death row, with an execution date less than two weeks away. The author takes us into Mahler’s mind, which gravitates from hearty to hallucinogenic. We learn that he hasn’t seen his daughter in twenty years, but that Rose has been writing him letters and offering her assistance as an attorney. Juxtaposed with the prison opening, the story takes us to Lana, who is on her way to a desert spa with her latest boyfriend and her twin boys, a place right out of Boyle’s ROAD TO WELLVILLE. Rosa is on the verge of tracing Lana down after a twenty-year separation.The disclosure of Vic’s crime and fate, as well as the unveiling of the Mahler family and Rose, is gradually revealed by positioning each character in alternating chapters. They examine their lives, past and present, and dissect each other, so that the reader is shown each character through various lenses that eventually coalesce into a prism of overlapping and juxtaposed realities. Like Chaon’s AWAIT YOUR REPLY, the narrative unfolds with an intricate opacity toward transparency. Meidav has a knack for shocking the reader at intervals, like the best thrillers do. Just as the Lolas once worked as strip-tease dancers together, the author unveils surprises in increments like a strip-tease act for the reader. Lana and Rose are the locus of the novel, and the narrative forms a mosaic or tapestry of several dialogues and narratives between them and their relationship with the external world, much like Rushdie’s MIDNIGHT’S CHILDREN is a tapestry of texts and collage of languages that form a unity of what is virtual and what is real. There is a constant flux between the Lolas, and a tension between what is true and what is illusive, what is implied and what is extant.It took me about one hundred pages to relax into Meidav’s style, the wrap-around sentences and esoterica of neuroscience and philosophy, the limbic arousal and dourness of Martin Amis.“…people’s faces work to hold up new veils by the minute: the all-time favorite is dignity, as is the visage of sex-transcending enlightenment, a new kind of spiritual chastity armature.”Meidav's bare-bones plot--a crime, a perpetrator, and a fate--are less important than the characters that inhabit this dystopia of false and renegade idols. Nature, the pliable state of consciousness, and the desire to reclaim the credo of youth and supple confidence, is the plaintive hope and recursive doctrine here.

This isn't your childhood circus--rather, this is more in tune with Lewis Carroll or M.C. Escher--a surreal and hypnotic place of the imagination and spirit.Le Cirque des Rêves is a dazzling venue of magical intensity and Tarot images, a story of dreams and desires. It is an invention that reflects the Jungian collective unconscious and personifies the archetypes of opposing forces--night/day, good/evil, life/death, safety/danger, among other symbols and experiences that have repeated themselves since ancient times. The manipulations of these images and forces speak to the core of the story.At the end of the nineteenth century in London, two self-regarding necromancers arrange a duel, part of an ongoing contest reaching back through their long history. Prospero the Magician and ""the man in the grey suit"" agree to provide a worthy opponent each for this contest of illusion, a competition that is only partly visible to the reader's eye. Prospero trains his daughter, Celia; the grey-suited man selects a fitting boy, Marco, from an orphanage. Sealed with a ring in a familiar ritual, the turf war proceeds.When Marco and Celia become adults, the duel commences within the venue of the atmospheric, aromatic circus, which is open only at night, in colors black and white (and shades of silver). The duel and its setting is showcased in its artistry of conception, the beauty of its containment, and the mystery of its migration. Le Cirque des Rêves travels silently, invisibly, from country to country, unannounced. There's a tent of stars, a room of sculpted ice, a pool of tears. The fireplace burns eternally with a white-hot blaze. The landscape of the duel's setting is a phantasmagorical tour de force.The cast is inseparable from Le Cirque des Rêves. Among others, they include the tattooed contortionist, Tsukiko, the twins, Poppet and Widget, (born on the dawn of the circus' opening night,) and the Tarot reader, Isobel. Marco is a chameleon-like magician and Celia is the Isis of alchemy. They mirror the archetypes of Jung's collective unconscious--the shadow; the animus/anima; the hero; the mother; sacrifice/rebirth; the Self, and the wise old man. The tarot readings, like the story's progression, are dynamic components of character transformation, digging down to the layers of repressed memories and sublime intuition.Within this process of transformation, the individual characters of this story must journey through uncharted terrain like portals in the soul, proceeding toward a cosmic relationship with humanity. How to separate reality from illusion and arrive at the totality of the Self? What obstacles and pathologies must be overcome to achieve a kindred consciousness? Likewise, the duelists become lovers, complicating the stakes of the game--if you win, you lose.A magnificent, spectral clock is commissioned from a renowned German clockmaker, a clock that is mystical and harlequin, dreamlike and figurative. It stands like an emissary at the gates of the circus, a timepiece of magical stratification, an emblem of temporal shifts. No patrons can enter until dusk, and all must be gone by dawn.In Erin Morganstern's enchanting first novel, illusion and reality are two sides of the same coin. Inspiration and imagination become tangible territory, a dream circus of the wakened mind, a magical mystery tour of the unconscious. This is a Fool's (Hero's) journey, an adventure for the immortal child and enduring lovers, to a star-filled tunnel and a silver sky. Step from bare grass to painted ground, eye the towering tents of black and white stripes.

In fact, he is a paradigm of vice, with a penchant for lustful young women. His marriage is on the rocks George Baxter Henry is no paragon of virtue. In fact, he is a paradigm of vice, with a penchant for lustful young women. His marriage is on the rocks and his fractured family is falling apart. Connor Bowman's novella after The Last Estate takes us back to the South of France--this time Nice, but with an American protagonist. In this sinfully laugh out loud story about a wounded family trying to stitch itself back together, Bowman manages to make the reader care about these cross and querulous individuals who are headed on a grease skid to oblivion.George is a fifty-one-year-old trial-phobic attorney in Boston. His vitriolic ninety-one-year-old mother-in-law, Muriel, hired a snoop, who captured George in a Kodak moment in flagrante delicto, and now Muriel is trying to convince George's wife, Pearl, to divorce him. Seventeen-year-old rock musician, Billy, needs dad's consent to a big record deal offer from Carnivore records, but George won't do it until Billy's urine is clean for a month; he snorts cocaine like kids eat Cheerios. Fourteen-year-old daughter, Iska, is researching apples for a book she wants to write, and is on the brink of new discoveries.George sequesters the family away to a rented chateau in bucolic Nice, hoping to save his marriage, his son, and his finances from ruin. Pearl is open to reconciliation, but Muriel, his nemesis, is determined to interfere. A former screen star of the twenties and thirties, Muriel Hale née Meek is an italicized battle-axe who George derides as ""about as meek as a Panzer division."" She never lets anyone forget her averred fame and one-time Oscar nom, flashing celebrity names like rhinestones on an Elvis cape.George executes his own private rehab for Billy--he locks him in his room, while trying to repair the fault lines in his marriage, which has had a half-decade sexual drought. Every step of repair between Pearl and George is a lure for sabotage by Muriel. ""If you'd listened to me all those years ago, you'd have married somebody suitable instead of scraping the barrel for an engagement ring and a time-share in George's pecker.""George starts playing boules with some locals he encounters during daily solitary walks, and also meets an Elvis-obsessed French pastry chef with a hot oven, big cupcakes, and porn-star moves. Salvation is laced with cream pie.George's perspective on life volleys between mockery and scorn, with a generous dose of self-effacement to lend a measure of vulnerability to his cynicism.""Children are the single greatest drain on the world's finances after global warming and oil slick clean-up costs...As far as they're [children] concerned, it's win, win, win. They didn't ask to be born, so you pay for that. You want the best for them, so you pay for that, and best of all, they hate you and you want them to love you, so you pay for that, too. Stick a dunce hat on me and call me Chase Manhattan!""The avaricious tension between Muriel and George keeps the zingers fresh and lively.""To get a clear picture of my precious mother-in-law in your head, think Godzilla meets Margaret Thatcher and they have a child.""As the narrative glides like a combat missile, the reader is installed in George's personal battle of a lifetime--a self-propelled mission to redeem himself and his family.

(Guess who is coming-of-age? Answer: not so evident.)Lucy isn't entirely sure that she's a reliable narrator--part of our reading pleasure is to figure that out. She tells us in the enigmatic prologue ""I'm not the hero of this story."" Is she the villain? And, if she is not the hero, who is? The answers turn out to be thoughtfully complex and yet exquisitely simple for those of us--and only for those of us--whose love of reading is almost religious (upside down pun there).Lucy has been sneaking laudable books to Ian, whose evangelical, anorexic mother, Janet, will only allow him to read books ""with the breath of God in them."" No books with content matter related to magic, witchcraft, wizardry, the occult, weaponry, adult content matter, evolution, or Halloween. No authors/books that question authority and explore complicated issues, or that have morally ambiguous themes. Oh, or contain a ""sensitive"" male character.Janet has enrolled her son in the Glad Heart Ministries youth group with Pastor Bob, in order to de-gayify her son for his proto-gay behaviors. Pastor Bob is a ""former"" homosexual married to a ""cured"" once-upon-a-time lesbian, who believes that ""sexuality is a choice, not an identity."" His goal is to ""speak to our children before the secular media has reached them with its political agenda."" It makes your hair stand up and splits your ends.One morning, when Lucy opens the library, she discovers that Ian has been camped out there all night. This sets the stage for the fugitive scene--adult and child on the lam, playing spontaneous road trip games and mimicking passages of children's books. (OK, the reader needs to suspend a little judgment here on how Ian maneuvers this, but this is fiction, so waive a little realism for a little magic, capisce?).Lucy, as it turns out, has some, ahem... issues. A Chicago-raised Mount Holyoke graduate with a Russian émigré father and Jewish-American mother, she has a predilection for flight and self-flagellation. Her dad was a revolutionary, and his shady business dealings and questionable money sources have been a cause of discomfort all of Lucy's life. It seems she also has a knack for prevaricating. And indolence. Her adult decisions have, up to this time, been aimed at not taking action in her life, other than putting distance between her and her parents. She's ""a would-be revolutionary stuck at a desk.""As Lucy and Ian cross state line after state line, she has moments of doubt and dread about her hapless journey with a juvenile. Although she tries to remind herself that Ian maneuvered this odyssey, she acknowledges her complicity. Lucy wants to save Ian from the clutches of religiosity. She impugns Janet Drake for wanting to censor a highly intelligent boy's mettle. But is she trying to censor the censor? She has doubts. But the voice of her insurrectionist father vexes her.There are flaws, admittedly. Yet, they are easy to ignore when trumped by the nimble narrative and crack characterizations. Librarians beware--Lucy doesn't have her Masters of Library Science. And, as mentioned above, the inadvertent ""kidnapping"" scene raises a few eyebrows of believability.But this beguiling story captivates, nonetheless. Ian and Lucy have a tart, biting relationship rather than a sentimental, precious one. Additionally, Makkai deftly weaves in children's literary lore, including THE WIZARD OF OZ, MADELINE, CHARLOTTE'S WEB, and many others, bolstering the narrative. Moreover, Lucy's subversive deeds in the name of social liberty are ripe and riveting. Makkai pushes the envelope, and the reader may wonder if the story will wax pedantic, but the author doesn't disappoint with easy answers; she doesn't manipulate Lucy's rant into her personal crusade.THE BORROWER appeals, inevitably, to the ardent reader whose love of books starts with the mind but voyages to the soul.

Annie Oakley was a sharpshooter with an epic aim, living by her wits. Siddhartha traveled on a spiritual quest to find himself, and defined the river by its timelessness--always changing, always the same. Now, in Bonnie Jo Campbell's adventure story, we are introduced to sixteen-year-old Margo Crane, a gutsy, feisty survivor who manifests a flawed blend of all three heroes, who lives once and inexorably upon a river.Raised on the Stark River by throwback hicks (some who are rich) in rural Murrayville, Michigan, Margo can shoot and skin a buck, fish like Papa Hemingway, and fire a bullet clean through a rabbit's eye. She's a free spirit, a river sprite, a dog lover, an oarswoman and a woodcutter. Her heroine is Annie Oakley, a renowned figure that she hopes to embody.A series of incidents in Margo's young life cause her to run away. Her beloved grandfather dies, and her mother--who never adapted to the river life--abandons the family. At fifteen, Margo is raped by her Uncle Cal, but is more perplexed than traumatized when it happens.""Rape sounded like a quick and violent act, like making a person empty her wallet at the point of a knife, like shooting someone or stealing a TV. What Cal had done was gentler, more personal, like passing a virus.""It takes a year for Margo to comprehend that she was violated; circumstances eventually culminate in a baroque twist on a Mexican standoff--with one dead body, one tip-shot pecker, and one pissed off family. She quits school, grabs her Marlin .22, boards her rowboat, and heads up river with her mother's address found under her father's bed. She is determined to reunite with her mother and forge a new life.Margo likes to hear the water rustle against the rocks; sleep under a canopy of stars; watch the pink dawn of the sky; listen to whip-poor-wills call from the trees; and count blue herons as they wade in the river. But her journey is tangled by an undertow of complications, a ripple effect of the sand and silt and muddiness she brought with her from Murrayville and continues to accumulate. Margo has a ripe sexuality, a flood of pheromones and hormones coursing through the channels of her body like a tidal wave. As she paddles upstream, she bounces from one man to the next, (lying about her age), leaving a wake of misadventures at each stop, with minimal contemplation between disasters. With each imbroglio, she unwittingly tugs at the past, pulling it into the present and future, like floating debris that follows along.The reader is enticed to root for Margo, but I was turned off by her attraction to losers and drunks and skeptical of extremes in her nature. The commando girl power was redundant--she was a superwoman of courage and resolve, and when it was favorable, she would vulnerably depend on the kindness of strangers, who appeared at convenient times. She also inflicts some irreparable damage to a menacing one-eye-blind man from the recent past--his brute strength was reminiscent of the Cyclops in the Odyssey--and then wipes her hands of it with too much nonchalance.The adventures lack variety or surprise--Margo's marvel trick shots often gild the lily, and whatever a grown man can do, she can do better. Her noble relationship with Smoke, an elderly, smelly, chain-smoking, wheelchair-bound hermit with emphysema, is supposed to be the pinnacle of the story, but it reeked of authorial manipulation. Margos' beneficence is obviously meant to offset her other transgressions, which only calls attention to the incredulity of this relationship. When she climbs in bed (platonically) and sleeps with Smoke as an act of virtuous love, it came off as orchestrated. Smoke ultimately became a plot/story device, rewarding Margo with the right things at the right time.Despite the obvious flaws, Campbell's story is a page-turner. Her prose is warm, rollicking, and natural. She conveys a spiritual power to the river and surrounding environs, massaging the narrative with the raw power of nature. Margo is earthy, plucky, and engaging, a passionate heroine with a physical, sensual nature and double-barrel gaze. The loose ends in this story imply that a series is in the works, or a follow-up novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jun 20, 2011","Jun 24, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9658159-once-upon-a-river

It exemplifies the antithesis of the slogan ""Practice random acts of kindness and senseless beauty."" The novel asserts that all of us are subject to random acts. Period. Of senselessness, violence, beauty, cruelty, and yes, also kindness. Beginning at the end is a way for the author to clarify the theme that we are not subject to fate or karma-- life is pointless, meaningless, without intrinsic value. The value we place on life, therefore, is an artificial construction.Cynical? Well, it certainly is discomfiting, and a despairing standard to live by. On the other hand, it illustrates that there is no ""one way"" of being, of perching a personal or social doctrine. Abbott prefaced the book with a quote by Nietzsche, prince of nihilism, and an equally philosophical quote by E.E. Cummings, leaving no doubt about the outlook of this story.Henry Cage is grieving over his young grandson's gruesome death as the story opens. Part I is more like a prologue, which ends with a shattering private moment. The story than segues to several years back, encompassing mostly grim and arbitrary events, including the merciless ramifications of the choices that Henry has made in his life. He was a successful businessman in his prime, but he is being winnowed out in the new millennium, as the youth and vigor of new times and changes replace the time-honored traditions.Henry is divorced and lonely, a creature of habit who frequents coffee shops and hides behind the false front of a book. The story eventually reveals the emotional wounds and pride that prevented reconciliation with his wife. Over the course of the novel, Henry's life is complicated by a menacing stalker. Furthermore, painful events begin to open him up, release him from his implacable resolve. But, as Abbott clearly shows, a new resolve doesn't necessarily pave the way for peace and contentment.Abbott's prose is spare, cultivated and subtle, with a mood and tone that complement its overarching theme. It is a hard story to shake off, laden with a terse contempt for belief systems. If you are uncomfortable with nihilistic themes, this is not a story you will relish. It is painful and bleak, engulfing, like watching a car accident at the side of the highway.

The reader is instantly spellbound with the story, where survival and danger coalesce in a taut, tense thriller that examines contrasts in exile: spirituality within human suffering, inner peace outside of war, and prosperity beyond pestilence.Backtrack to 2005, and the events that shaped the current peril of the Scanlons. Peter, forced to expel his troubled daughter from proximity to her meth addict mother, removes her from the U.S. to start a new life. At his persuasion, Alex pitches a dart at an atlas to select a new home, which lands on Kathmandu, a deep valley surrounded by colossal mountains, and a politically sensitive and turbulent place marred by outlaws, massacres and instability. Peter gets a job at a volunteer health clinic, where diseases he has never seen and cries he has never heard permeate the city and pierce his cynical American heart.Warring Maoists pervade the mountainside and threaten the life of citizens, and the lawless and nihilistic underworld controls the corrupt police and politicians. Moreover, the clinic's acquisition of life-saving drugs depends a lot on the negotiation with these syndicate bosses of the city, specifically a savage man who runs a huge sex trafficking ring of young females, many who are sick with STD's. Peter's desire to save these girls threatens his MD's license and his personal safety, and his frustration to cure the sick is challenged by the powerful epidemics that are resistant to antibiotics.Peter and Alex live in relative comfort compared to the natives, but without heat and in extreme temperatures. Peter's boss at the clinic has arranged for a housekeeper/cook, Sangita, a Tibetan woman whose daughter, Devi, is Alex's age. Alex and Devi bond instantly, and Santiga's maternal instincts are a welcome energy to the household. Mina, the nurse at the clinic who functions more like an agitating partner, vexes Peter, as well as beguiles him.Ailments, treachery, and poverty permeate the city like the thick, grey fog and charcoal sky that hovers over the inhabitants. A feeling of dread snakes through the narrative, yet a soulful backbone of human stout-heartedness and endurance surprises the reader at each descent of gravity. Groner's exuberant prose imbues the story with keen paradoxes and nimble dialogue that flow with sharp, pointed wit. The pace is quick, thrilling and cinematic; you will probably finish this novel in a few sturdy sittings.The disadvantage of this hybrid genre of fiction is the tendency to inject the main characters with staggering puissance. They wear their courage a little too easily, including the teenagers. There are also several convenient and predictable plot turns that are too facile, giving the narrative a rushed simplicity at times. Also, although Peter is out of his element, he steadily challenges pernicious criminals with a force and conniving that periodically flouts credibility.Mina, who enters as an intriguing individual, flattens out as her contentious nature is mitigated. Sangita turns out to be a straw character, as are several other players in this drama. Buddhist practices lend a warm glow to the story, but tips into precious territory at intervals, and is watered down, giving it a pre-packaged and shrink-to-fit platform of platitudes.However, this is a potent story that, despite some inorganic elements, never fails to fill the reader with wonder. The magic arises from the immaculate prose and imagery, as well as luminous, cosmic turns of phrase, and the ties that bind humanity. This is a novel ripe with quotable passages, with a landscape of flourishing detail. As a story of exile, it lures and invites the reader within its foreign enclosures to a map that contours the human heart. 3.5""Fatherhood held at its heart a sweet, paradoxical masochism, the self-abnegation of one willing to die for another.

In this, her first novel, she creates a ballad-like story of contrasts--truth and deception, love and rejection, light and dark, faith and betrayal.Two sisters, living with their widowed father, are a study of opposites. Seventeen-year-old Lucinda is lovely, tall, titian-haired, pliable, hard-working, dutiful, and light; nine-year-old Norma Joyce is small, dark, complicated, rebellious, passionate, odd-looking, and sullenly intelligent.""She [Norma Joyce] was foliage in the wrong place, a jumble of weeds growing out of someone's back.""Beginning on a farm in the Prairie Dust Bowl of 1930's Canada, the story spans thirty years and takes the reader on a looping journey to Saskatchewan, Ottawa, and New York. The farm that Ernest Hardy lives on with his two daughters in Saskatchewan is the oasis in the drought, ""a spot of dew in a dry field, a small hill that attracted rain and snow when nothing fell anywhere else.""The Hardy farm is single magnet for moisture in this bone-dry, punishing, skin-splitting, dust-laden community.""...dust blew the paint off cars, settled on food while you ate, landed in your mouth while you slept, choked cattle in the fields, and muffled the calls of lost children. So much dust blown so far that it landed on ships in the middle of the Atlantic.""A handsome stranger would arrest the girls' hearts, driving one of them to obsession. Stepping out of a blizzard and into their lives is the handsome, prepossessing Maurice Dove, an Ottawa student studying weather and botany. He lodges with the Hardys on three separate occasions in one year, enchanting Lucinda, bewitching and educating Norma Joyce with his comprehensive knowledge of nature.Lucinda's maternal nature blossomed in Maurice's presence. She cooked and cleaned with an almost Gertrudian fervor, tucking away dreams like the corners of sheets.""By the time Maurice was ready to leave, Lucinda would be interested. This was her pattern: tugging carefully at every knot, pressing the wrapping paper flat, saving everything for future use, including her own anticipation.""But Norma Joyce has already reached out to touch his cheek and claim him immediately, believing that boldness counts for more than beauty. She's the shadow girl, the dark side of the moon. She thinks that stealthy intrusions will draw him closer. Maurice indulges in Lucinda's beauty and moist sponge cakes, while he instructs Norma Joyce in climate and history, acknowledging that she is a natural, gifted student.Hay's metaphorical raveling of landscape and psyche is nothing short of phenomenal. The narrative winds its way through the inner and outer wilderness of the Hardy's lives as the story deepens into the musk and mead of their quiddity.""Maybe Lucinda's beauty captivated the rain. Or--this thought occurred to him later--maybe the dark, unpredictable sister was the source of all the weather.""There are layers to peel and subtextual strata to mine. Sexual undertones and overtones impregnate the story, a sensuous pollen permeating the prose.""The leaf's lower part is a split sheath wrapped tightly around the stem so it won't tear in the wind...The underside of the leaves have very few pores; in dry weather they roll up like waterproof tubes to hold in every precious drop of water vapour. As beautifully engineered, he says with a wink, as Claudette Colbert's nifty legs. Slender-tipped, smooth, loose and open, lax at flowering time, puberulent.""The story builds with intensity and eroticism, invoking shattering acts of betrayal and avid, tormented love. There are grains of The Thorn Birds and Gone with the Wind, but the erudition and subtlety far eclipses either novel. Also, Hay avoids the pitfalls of melodrama and ripens the story with nuanced authenticity. She is a master of detail, describing a word or a concept with filmic transcendence, turning every seed into a flower. There are also vestiges of Possession, another book of painful, incinerating love, and botany.This is a also companion piece to her latest novel, Alone in the Classroom. The author has recurring themes and motifs that deepen the reading experience when both books are read. The suggestion that we carry the past forward undulates through both novels, as do early childhood tragedies. The relationship between student and teacher, parent and child, and the value of education--including the study of the natural world--is explored in both tales. I won't give detailed specifics away, as the joy of discovery heightens the pleasure.Every passage is sui generis; every page is brimming with beauty and contrast. This is an extraordinary coming of age story, a novel of survival and redemption, a tale of two sisters and three cities, an unforgettable, incomparable story of deep forbearance and clemency. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jun 13, 2011","Jun 14, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/507086.A_Student_of_Weather

Peter gets a job at a volunteer health clinic, where diseases he has never seen and cries he has never heard permeate the city and pierce his cynical American heart.Warring Maoists pervade the mountainside and threaten the life of citizens, and the lawless and nihilistic underworld controls the corrupt police and politicians. Moreover, the clinic's acquisition of life-saving drugs depends a lot on the negotiation with these syndicate bosses of the city, specifically a savage man who runs a huge sex trafficking ring of young females, many who are sick with STD's. Peter's desire to save these girls threatens his MD's license and his personal safety, and his frustration to cure the sick is challenged by the powerful epidemics that are resistant to antibiotics.Peter and Alex live in relative comfort compared to the natives, but without heat and in extreme temperatures. Peter's boss at the clinic has arranged for a housekeeper/cook, Sangita, a Tibetan woman whose daughter, Devi, is Alex's age. Alex and Devi bond instantly, and Santiga's maternal instincts are a welcome energy to the household. Mina, the nurse at the clinic who functions more like an agitating partner, vexes Peter, as well as beguiles him.Ailments, treachery, and poverty permeate the city like the thick, grey fog and charcoal sky that hovers over the inhabitants. A feeling of dread snakes through the narrative, yet a soulful backbone of human stout-heartedness and endurance surprises the reader at each descent of gravity. Groner's exuberant prose imbues the story with keen paradoxes and nimble dialogue that flow with sharp, pointed wit. The pace is quick, thrilling and cinematic; you will probably finish this novel in a few sturdy sittings.The disadvantage of this hybrid genre of fiction is the tendency to inject the main characters with staggering puissance. They wear their courage a little too easily, including the teenagers. There are also several convenient and predictable plot turns that are too facile, giving the narrative a rushed simplicity at times. Also, although Peter is out of his element, he steadily challenges pernicious criminals with a force and conniving that periodically flouts credibility.Mina, who enters as an intriguing individual, flattens out as her contentious nature is mitigated. Sangita turns out to be a straw character, as are several other players in this drama. Buddhist practices lend a warm and exalted glow to the story, but almost tips into precious territory at intervals.However, this is a potent story that, despite some inorganic elements, never fails to fill the reader with wonder. The magic arises from the immaculate prose and imagery, as well as luminous, cosmic turns of phrase, and the ties that bind humanity. This is a novel ripe with quotable passages, with a landscape of flourishing detail. As a story of exile, it lures and invites the reader within its foreign enclosures to a map that contours the human heart.""Fatherhood held at its heart a sweet, paradoxical masochism, the self-abnegation of one willing to die for another. Why else would he have come to this place?"" ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 12, 2011","Jun 14, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11081445-exiles

This is a follow-up to the Arno and Learner families, twelve years after a hit-and-run tragedy that shredded two families to fractious pieces. At the time of the incident, Dwight and Ruth Arno (the centerpiece family) were already divorced, and this just annihilated any redemptive force from taking shape between them. Their son, Sam, was only nine, and already packing some rage from the tragedy. The  is circumspect so as not to give spoilers on either novel. In this case, it is highly recommended that Reservation Road be read first, to have a more thorough understanding of the situation and characters. As in Reservation Road, Schwartz writes with a powerful poetic and impressionistic style. Whereas some authors' stylistic devices get in the way and distract the reader, Schwartz's form of narrative deepens the experience, gives a potent and intoxicating weight to the characters and their circumstances. This novel is more breathtaking than its predecessor. Schwartz delivers with brief (sometimes less than a page) chapters headed by character names, and only Dwight's is written in the first person perspective. Most final sentences (of the chapters) are gorgeously, painfully beautiful, a smooth stone of a line that lodges in the reader's throat, down to the intestines, and sometimes to the groin. He is elliptical without being pretentiously showy. Sam is now 21, a baseball star at UConn, and feels lousy after the last game of the season. His rage and self-hatred has slid to danger zones, and he is headed toward phenomenal adult problems at the start of the story. He gets on a bus to see his father after courting trouble. He hasn't seen Dwight in twelve years, but he isn't even sure of his motives. Dwight is trying to pick up the pieces of his shattered life near Santa Barbara, and Ruth is coming apart at the seams in her casually comfortable Connecticut home. The Learner family is already on robotic mode, especially Grace, the mother, and the dad, who is primarily off stage. Emma, who is close to Sam's age, is home from Yale for the summer and on a precipice, headed either toward a fog or crucial clarity. Schwartz's prose sets off emotional landmines without melodramatic or over-dramatic story progression. He keeps it simple, yet rarefied. And you don't have to like baseball to embrace the imagery, so subtle is he in weaving baseball concepts and terms into base-stealing metaphors and aphorisms. You don't even have to understand the game, so fertile is Schwartz's imagination and visual concepts. He doesn't press it, either. His imagery is expansive, and includes the elegance of nature--flora, fauna, and the deep green grass and brown earth and endless sky. Each page offers a nugget or morsel of ferocious insight or incisiveness. Your emotions will slide around and feel messy, and click into nooks and crannies that are frequently uncomfortable. Schwartz illuminates shame with fierce precision, and he portrays love with electrified pathos. He'll go a step beyond what you would expect. He's the canary in the coalmine that delivers. He is a sexy writer, a sharp, clear-eyed poet. It is a quick read but a slow burn. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 03, 2011","May 19, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10297826-northwest-corner

This pertains to the barbaric fable of this mind-bending, postmodern narrative.The real convict Gould wrote a sketchbook of fishes--now recognized as a document of world significance by UNESCO--which are reproduced here and folded into the novel, replete with different color inks and a fish sketch for each chapter. The inks are made of whatever Gould can obtain (use your imagination, as he does) on the island, since paints are declined to him.Gould is imprisoned below the sea line, in a special cell consisting of a floating dead man and a water line that threatens to rise with the tides. It is here that his confession is told, one that, between the layers of verbosity, a compassionate story of humanity is told.Recognized as an artist of some worth upon arriving on the island, Gould was ordered to paint fish for the insane Dr. Lempiere, the island's British surgeon, a whale pig of a man who speaks loudly, in BLOCK LETTERS. Lempiere was obsessed with taxonomy. He hoped that breaking the world down into all its classifiable elements would help him get into the Royal Academy of Science. This classification also symbolizes the British colonialist approach to the prisoners, and the aboriginal people in general, who are classified as the lowest form of life.""I was to paint fish, you see, all manner of sea life: sharks, crabs, octopuses, squid & penguins. But when I finished this work of my life, I stood back & to my horror saw all those images merge together into the outline of my face.""The pseudo-science of phrenology was also on the rise then, the belief that character traits could be analyzed by the configurations of the skull. Says Lempiere:""...NEW SCIENCE--NEW SOCIETY--NEW AGE--PHRENOLOGY, PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO VANQUISHED AND INFERIOR RACES...""Flanagan's imaginary autobiography gives voice to the heinous treatment and torture of prisoners on Sarah Island. The writing here is reminiscent of Pynchon, approaching sociopolitical subjects such as imperialism and racism through linguistic hijinx. Flanagan can seamlessly juxtapose a tender scene of love with a harrowing scene of abuse. Within the digressions and verbosity that is the hallmark style bestowed to Gould's narration lie the most potent, unspeakable truths of life and death in the penal colony.""Death was in that heightened smell of raddled bodies & chancre-encrusted souls. Death arose in a miasma from gangrenous limbs and bloody rags of consumptive lungs. Death hid in the rancorous odor of beatings...with the insidious damp that invaded everything, was seeping out of sphincters rotting from repeated rapes. Death was in the overripe smell of mud fermenting...so many fetid exhalations of unheard screams, murders, mixed with the brine of a certain wordless horror...""Gould, with his many colored inks, speaks to the reader of these wordless horrors. It will leave you mute and screaming; it will enfold you with its deafening cries.

He simply forgot all thoughts of return.""The novel opens as the US troops are pulling out of Vietnam in 1975, and photojournalist Helen Adams is walking the streets of Saigon, feeling familiar and close to the city. She's been here over a decade, and is conflicted about leaving this now refugee town to go back to the states.She walks to the apartment she shares with her lover and also photographer, Linh, a Vietnamese who has been injured. She is anxious to get him on the helicopter out of there, with the intention of joining him after she goes on one final shoot. However, she is eternally compelled by that one great shot, the photo that will secure her name in the history of war photographers. Her mentor and previous lover, Sam Darrow, had already done that, but, like Helen, was hooked to the place, the job, the dynamic of war photography.Following the memorable scene after the Fall of Saigon, one that is canonized in the iconic image of South Vietnamese civilians desperately trying to secure a seat on one of the last American helicopters shuttling between Saigon rooftops and US navy ships off the coast of Vietnam (ahead of the arrival of the communist North-Vietnamese troops), the story starts at the beginning of Helen's life here, back in 1965. We follow her from the her complete innocence as a new photographer and survivor in a war-torn country; through the grisly action of capturing combat scenes on film; and in the inflamed and tender scenes of romance.If I ever were to recommend one novel on the Vietnam War, this would be it. Unless you only want battle action and an all male cast--such as MATTERHORN--I endorse this book as a poised and exquisite balance between love and war, and a love for the adrenaline-fueled action of war. As photographers, Helen, Sam, and Linh strive for the pictures that, in their individual quests, are a sort of anti-war document, an up close and personal edification of the fallout and consequences of what the US called a ""skirmish."" The inner conflicts of getting that award-winning shot subsumes the guilt and shame of potential exploitation and the desire to keep on following the next knell or knoll of death. What of their photography? Are they interpreters of violence? Are they, as Sam Darrow feared, making war ""palatable""?As Helen thought, ""No getting around the ghoulishness of pouncing on tragedy with hungry eyes, snatching it away, glorying in its taking even among the most sympathetic `I got an incredible shot of a dead soldier/woman/child. A real tearjerker.' Afterward, film shot, they sat on the returning plane with a kind of postcoital shame, turning away from each other.""As a personal story, Soli beautifully braided, twisted, and integrated the photojournalists' addiction to war and their desperate kinds of love or lust, the difficult choices and bonds that form, bonds that may never work anywhere else but in the midst of battle scarred endurance. This is one of my favorite contemporary novels of all time. By the end of this visceral, emotionally electrifying novel, I forgot all thoughts of return to the real world.

Although I am not attracted to SciFi, I was intrigued by a novel about ""Language."" I knew that Mieville would scatter EMBASSYTOWN with fascinating neologisms, and create a world that is absurd, baroque, yet inevitably believable, due to his attention to detail and his wicked, hipster, and yet sensitive, intelligent treatment to all the tropes he uses. EMBASSYTOWN is, to me, a living metaphor. The book, if surfacely sci-fi, reads like a post-modern story of language. It makes you consider language in its deepest, most philosophical sense.The story starts in media res, in the thick of things, and proceeds non-linearly, with different sections titled to keep us focused. A ship has arrived to Embassytown, bringing Hosts and Anbassadors. Avice Benner Cho, the books's protagonist, is a female human who was raised in the ghetto of Embassytown, a colonized planet of the Ariekei people. The Arekei are ""insect horse coral fan things"" with hooves and two wings--one that can fly and one that can manipulate, and they have two mouths that speak in unison.The Arekei people are called Hosts. The Hosts are OF language, but cannot speak language. Words are not signifiers, they are not abstractions of thought; they are objective truth. They are like thought, born. Hosts chitter with their two mouths and their noise is not translatable to most. And they cannot lie. They communicate through Ambassadors, who are clone-twins who can speak to people individually, but speak together to the Areikei.Mieville does fling those new words and concepts like miab, corvid, exot, and a hundred other terms early on, when you have no anchor for it--yet. But--and this is his genius--if you pay attention, it gradually forms a living, breathing, world that you understand. Introducing these neologisms early serves to implant these ideas and concepts in the reader. He isn't dumping bizarre words just for grins; he is a master of language with a refreshing blast of ideas, requiring the reader to pay attention. Lexically, the words have some familiarity to them, so that it pieces together naturally and buttresses the story.Humans have left earth in the ""human diaspora"" many years ago--time is registered in ""kilohours"" here. Avice is locally famous for traveling in the Immer, a place of deep space and time that not everyone can handle. She is also a living simile. The Arekei made her a figure of speech, a part of their language, ""the girl who ate what was given her."" The Arekei need similes and metaphors in lieu of lies. However, as Mieville will show us, creatures are attracted to lies. The Arekei planet will get an intoxicating dose of the misuse of language, a paradox otherwise known as a ""false lie"" through a new, genetically engineered Ambassador, which whirls this story into an apocalyptic opera.The virtuosity of Mieville is how he sets this book up on a metaphor, or AS a metaphor, carries it through immaculately, and gives the reader a vision of humanity. Rich with ideas and moral backbone, it even appeals to readers like me with little background in sci-fi. Mieville is part of the group of writers called ""New Weird,"" and I prefer that term, because it removes Mieville from being thrown in with the predictable, often shopworn forms of science fiction about ""good vs evil"" and starred with laser guns and scripted wars. Instead, we arrive at a nuanced, absurd, but comprehensible world of language....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 15, 2012","May 18, 2012","May 19, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9265453-embassytown

Not a lot has changed in the past fifty years or so, other than changing the name to Myanmar. They remain under military rule and they are one of the least developed nations in the world. Karen Connelly has not only written a striking and engaging tour de force about this area, but she has brought a country's atrocities into focus that needs attention badly, and help from developed nations. However, she hasn't forgotten the novelist's rule of thumb to entertain. It doesn't read like a diatribe or soapbox, it reads like an exquisite, dramatic story of friendship, endurance, compassion, love, and faith in the human condition.Teza is a young man of (approximately) thirty who is revered by freedom fighters in Burma (Myanmar) for his political songs that expose the corrupt government, and give hope and spiritual fuel to the people. He is in solitary confinement in his seventh year of a twenty-year sentence for this ""crime."" The conditions in this prison are something beyond harsh and cruel--absolutely appalling, savage--with lice, scurvy, rickets, bed bugs, and other illnesses invading the prison population. Also, the jailers frequently abuse the prisoners physically.Teza has become adept at his Buddhist meditation practices and has a strange but beautiful relationship with the lizards, spiders, and ants that share his cell. The most desired item for prisoners, besides food--as he is practically starved by the warden and guards--is pen and paper. If caught with it, it adds another several years to your sentence. Teza is therefore in isolation with nothing but the creatures, a dirty mat, stinking water, inedible food, and his mind. He lives by the power of his heart and mind. Teza knows how to be free in this cage, and his subtle power over the jailers, a different kind of power, is fascinating to comprehend.Little Brother is a twelve-year-old orphan whose father worked for the prison until he died. This young boy, who doesn't read or write, knows nothing outside the prison, and has no desire to leave. He is afraid of the outside world. He spends his days running errands for the guards or helping the top-tier prisoners--the ones with lots of pull and power--get extras of food. He is beloved by the few that have half a heart, but generally treated as sewerage by those in power.The story moves in graceful, gradual, lyrical strokes, bringing the world of the inmates and the jailers to a taut climax. The building relationship between Teza and Little Brother is the most weighty of all. It works brick by brick, like the building of a cell, layer upon layer, surging into an intense, suspenseful, atypical thriller. There are hints of Papillon,(although that story was non-fiction), but this is not a jailbreak thriller. But, like PAPILLON, it has much to do with the life inside the mind, and the cultivation of formidable inner strength, and the bonds between people who are seemingly so vastly different, and yet connected.If you only read a handful of books this year, do read this one. Besides its presence as a quietly exciting, non-formulaic suspense thriller, it will invite and heighten interest in this culture and this country. You will thoroughly inhabit these characters and story, page by page; the quintessence of fine literature is actualized in the characters of Teza and Little Brother.

Spanning the years 1927-2007, it opens up with the brutal murder of young schoolgirl Ethel Wier in 1937 Argyle (in Saskatchewan), a silver pail of chokecherries spilled near her bruised and battered body. This tragedy unfolds not in isolation, but connects gradually to a confluence of other markers in the history of the Flood family, and culminates in an unbearably beautiful graveyard scene that encompasses various strands and prongs of multi-generational lives.""You touch a place and thousands of miles away another place quivers.

This also signals the incipient events of Connie's family commingling with Anne's. At the library, Anne stumbles across some facets of history that have fallen into the crevices of time.""...a child discovers something the parent has neglected to tell her and brings it into view again, naming it and locating it and establishing its importance."" And this is the thematic thrust of the novel.Sentient life is thickly threaded with the landscape, from the fertile marshland to the ripe vegetation, the narrow dirt roads and woody smells of childhood, the wide flat rocks and wildflowers, the dry and liquid movement of the seasons.""Here is the country not in its Sunday best, but in its old clothes, unpaved, unfenced, full of character, ungroomed, unvisited, barely penetrable.""Connie is the centerpiece for much of the novel, along with the two men that affected her deeply, but in different ways. ""Parley"" Ian Burns, the principal and schoolteacher that she worked with in 1929 when she was just eighteen, both repulsed and attracted her.""All around her was the curdled essence of this clever man, who found ways to bind you to him, to get you into his pot, where you simmered.""Burns was an inscrutable, fastidious Francophile who was thwarted by his own failed achievements as an actor and playwright, and used his authority and wolfish charm to terrorize the students and magnetize the teachers. Connie sympathized with him at intervals, when he revealed himself in ways that brought out pity and sorrow in her heart. She gave him the benefit of the doubt for a while, until a tragic incident with a schoolgirl brought about a summary exit of characters from this county.""The town doesn't exist anymore. It rose overnight from whole grass into wooden sidewalks, railway station, grain elevators, houses, stores, churches, school. Then life rubbed the other way and the pattern disappeared.""Parley had staged a theatrical version of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles, with the willowy thirteen-year-old Susan Graves as the lead. He was a brazen, ruthless director, able to bring out the animal, erotic facets of the story, and ripen Susan into a purposeful actress, a ""sunned cat"" of a Tess--the physical transformation of a young girl. However, he maintained his hold on her after the play, with a staggering crescendo.Michael Graves--Susan's brother--was a dyslexic student before dyslexia was even recognized, and his broody, outdoor intelligence and artistic sense earned Connie's respect and compassion. He was one year older than Susan but three grades behind, and his self-esteem was nil until Connie helped bolster his enthusiasm for learning and participating.""A child lies like a grey pebble on the shore until a certain teacher picks him up and dips him in water, and suddenly you see all the colours and patterns in the dull stone...""As events move along, the intersections of time and tragedies, students and teachers, historians and artists, past and present, and memories and absences fall into place. Anne becomes a more active character in the story as well as the historian. This is a slow, gradual cohesion, not a narrative meant for anticipation or epiphanies, not a story centered on plot. Characters, and especially themes glue the story together.

It is a meditative, seeping novel, an exquisite story of the narrowness and infinity of humanity and family, of obsession and passion, of things unseen but powerfully registered.

He is a brokenhearted gardeMattias, the narrator and protagonist of this melancomic, bittersweet story, is a Norwegian on the cusp of thirty in 1999. He is a brokenhearted gardener and music lover whose prospects are looking dim. Mattias has always wanted to be as anonymous as possible for as long as possible. A cog in a wheel. His hero is Buzz Aldrin, the astronaut who was the more experienced pilot but whose fame paled in the shadow of Neil Armstrong. His backup hero is Steve Martin--especially the sad sack roles that Martin embraced so well back in the day.Much of the story takes place on the Faroe Islands, which is a group of eighteen islands between the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, a land of harsh winds and heavy rainfall. In fact, the winds are so strong, so prevalent, that nary a tree will survive there. It is rocky and volcanic looking, not exactly a prime piece of real estate for a guy whose first love is gardening. But this is where Mattias goes with his best friend Jorn, an up and coming rock musician who needs a sound man on this Faroe Island tour, and Mattias has agreed to help. The story, with its mysteries of music, psychology, art, and friendship, take place on this windswept, austere terrain. What starts out as a music tour morphs into quite another adventure.What makes this novel stand out is Mattias's voice, unique and intimate, that is paired with naturalistic prose. If you have ever read The Solitude of Prime Numbers, this is a very similar voice-- in rhythm, intimacy and narrative temperament (not story). Mattias possesses a sweet-tempered cerebral, philosophical, emotionally direct voice that enamors the reader and keeps the pages turning, even when the pace or plotting threatens to come to a crushing lull. At approximately 550 pages, I wish it was pared down to tighten up the boggy places. However, Mattias's indolence makes that impossible.The weight of Mattias's singular voice is significant, momentous to the story at hand, as Mattias is in virtually every scene, and as much of the action takes place in his head as it does on the Islands. There is also an ensemble cast of eccentric but beguiling characters, including a nonconformist, inscrutable psychiatrist, which keep the story in the realm of the enigmatic. Pop-permeated (with mostly American icons) and soulful, this is a coming-of-age of the late-bloomers and for those that believe that love hurts and heals, communes equal community, and rock and roll is not dead.Kudos to Deborah Dawkin for her seamless translation into English....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"May 15, 2011","May 18, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9858770-buzz-aldrin-what-happened-to-you-in-all-the-confusion

They have come to this veritable weigh station with all their belongings, dreams and desires, to emigrate to freedom and assimilate in a new land. David Bezmozgis's debut novel reflects a rich repository of knowledge, as he is a Latvian Jew who emigrated to Canada in 1973. He understands the immigrant experience personally, and has used his history slyly and knowingly to create a fictional story that speaks volumes of truth.The Krasnansky family consists of elderly patriarch Samuil, an ardent Jewish atheist and passionate Communist, his devoted wife, Emma, his two sons Alec and Karl, their respective wives, Rosa and Polina (the only non-Jewish family member), and Karl and Rosa's two children. They have come from Riga, Latvia, in the hope of emigrating to Chicago, but their hopes are dashed by relative (literally) circumstances. Now they are émigrés, waiting for visas to Canada, but the family can't readily agree on this bastion of democracy, a place described as similar in climate to their homeland. Additionally, Samuil's precarious health is slowing up the process of obtaining their papers.Samuil mourns for his Red Guard years, and spends his days in Rome isolated emotionally from his family, writing his memoirs. He befriends a one-legged violinist and Ukrainian army veteran whose beliefs are in opposition to his, but is able to reach an understanding and even a poignant intimacy with Josef. He growls at his laconic sons--Alec's self-indulgent, roving eye, and Karl's swift and sordid mercenary involvement with the underworld of Rome.Bezmozgis, an acclaimed ""20 under 40"" writer, blends dark humor with tenderness, and avoids the treacly sentiment often seen in novels of the Jewish immigrant experience. Although not as satirical as Gary Shtyngart, he does jostle, and sometimes stab at some golden calves. Alec, who was charming and prevaricating enough to get a job with the HIAS, assists people in the briefing department with their ""Persecution Stories."" Like Dinaw Mengestu's protagonist in How to Read the Air, Alec helps émigrés embellish their tales of persecution so that they may be granted permanent asylum in the free world.""Some people came prepared with a vast catalogue of grievances that they had been compiling their entire lives; other needed some interpretive assistance.""Later, during a screening of Fiddler on the Roof, Samuil seethes at the facile deceptions and sentimental exploits of the film, while Rosa and Emma, freshly persuaded with Jewish culture, watch in hypnotic reverence. Bezmozgis avoids the pitfalls of judgment while keenly portraying each character's private unmoored and chained melody.The Rome depicted here is hot, crowded, impoverished, and filled with daily humiliations. The memories teeming inside each character vacillate from sensuous reveries to murderous misfortunes. As the clean, lyrical narrative moves along with an almost imperceptible grace, the reader eventually learns the back stories and circumstances of this family, the dirty little secrets and the irretrievable losses of the past that threaten to thwart the future.Bezmozgis laces hope with a laser wit that illustrates the daily confrontations and mortifications that émigrés face as wanderers in a state of ambiguity and uncertainty. As one refugee has pointed out, a man who has lived in the Soviet Union and Israel,""...I've been a citizen of two utopias. Now I have modest expectations. Basically, I want the country with the fewest parades.""The author has no illusions about Zionism, Israel, and the Middle East. Prepare to be mildly offended if you are a staunch supporter of any bully pulpits. Bezmozgis didn't write this book to be politically correct--or incorrect, either; he is too nuanced to be manipulative or polemical. He is generous, playful, arch, comic, biting, and acutely aware of the many facets of social, emotional, and physical purgatory. Accordingly, Bezmozgis begins and ends the book via subtly dramatic bookends that endow this soulfully messy book with an impeccably tidy metaphor for exile and assimilation. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 08, 2011","May 10, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8801805-the-free-world

Miller provides penetrating and complex characterizations--it doesn't get any better than this--through robust interior monologues, counterpoint between characters and scenes, overlay, keen perceptions and multiple perspectives, and an artful metaphor between stage/theater and real life. Her quartet of characters are examined and explored with a gifted pace and subtle precision that is both calibrated and unmannered simultaneously. There is very little overt drama, and no melodrama; the scrupulous and painstaking finesse to character and story is nearly flawless.The parallel between a play staged in Boston at the beginning of the novel and the novel itself is the engine and drive of this story. Two protagonists of the quartet (Leslie and Sam) are watching the play, ""The Lake Shore Limited""-- three, if you count the playwright, Billy, (Wilhelmina), and the fourth, Rafe, is the main actor playing Gabriel. There is also an unconscious ghost or shadow present in the performance, that of Leslie's much younger brother, Gus, who was Billy's lover until he died in the 9/11 tragedy six years ago.Leslie, who is watching the play with her husband, Pierce, and her old friend, Sam, is struck by the story, but especially to Rafe's character, Gabriel. In the play, a bombing incident on the Lake Shore Limited train is emotionally jarring and reflective of the American tragedy that took Gus's life. Gabriel's response onstage to his wife's possible death is unsettling to Leslie, who begins to revisit Gus's death and her perception of Billy and Gus's relationship. Likewise, Billy is startled and moved by Rafe's performance in the final scene. And the effect on Rafe of playing Gabriel is stark indeed. Identification with the stage performance changes the lives of all the characters and brings a robust dimension to the novel.Miller has this brilliantly controlled. The play that readers ""read,"" i.e. see staged, takes up only a handful of pages, and therefore cannot be the entire play. What Miller does is recreate the dramatic turns and action in this section. As the story progresses, more of the play is unfolded through reflection. Although the theatrical ""showing"" is moderately stilted, (in the contrived style of the stage) this proves later to be a seamless counterpoint to the story at hand. In other words, the questionable authenticity of its truncated beginning will cease to be a problem as time goes on. The text of the play is meticulously linked to its intended audience and is artfully reticulated in the subtext of the novel.Leslie, Sam, Billy, and Rafe are irrevocably connected in a combination of direct and circuitous ways that intensify with conversation, memories, and with each character's struggle against the past. The author captures the rueful feelings associated with conflicting and impure affections; she conveys the internal contradictions through extended interior monologues that are reminiscent of Henry James. Moreover, Miller's ability to sustain potent, lengthy dialogue between the characters without a shred of artificiality is remarkable, and evokes the reality twist to the theatrical performance.Through flashbacks and linear chronology, the attachments and junctions, as well as the missed connections between the quartet build to a ripe, organic network of emotions and circumstances. Although there are references and scenes of September 11th, this is not a ""9/11"" story per se. It has a distinctly American texture, but the thrust is the equation of life with theater. The environment is often like a stage set, and the characters move cautiously around, holding back, playing roles, and letting go at concentrated intervals. Yet, the action and story feel completely natural.Throughout the novel, the theatrical play is the axis--hence, the title. Miller returns to the play repeatedly, buttressing the novel and characters, and fortifying the themes with an elegant body of construction. Miller's familiar themes of love, loss, grief, and redemption are present, but sans histrionics and spectacles. The subtle, sublime drama is a quietly pulverizing experience for the reader. The intensity of the story fueled with comprehensive characterizations is so richly satisfying that it will take considerable effort to re-emerge from the novel, from the play, from the indelible characters that make up the story.Ignore the covers; the hardcover picture is misleading and the paperback edition is frivolous, both adding up to an almost generic choice of covers not worthy of such a distinguished work of literature....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 30, 2011","May 05, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7624512-the-lake-shore-limited

At a time when the Great War is receding into the annals of distant history, this elegiac and edifying novel has been released--a small, slim but powerful story of a young soldier, Josef Vinich, who hails from a disenfranchised and impoverished family in rural Austria-Hungary.Josef was born in the rural mining town of Pueblo, Colorado, in 1899, to immigrant parents from Austria-Hungary who dreamed of a better life in the United States. The opening eleven-page prologue, a stunning and deeply felt family tragedy, is subsequently followed by a move back to the Empire, to his father's village of Pastvina (which is now part of the Czech Republic). Josef's father then marries a cruel woman with two young sons. They live the hardscrabble existence of shepherds, barely able to put food on the table, in the cold and brutal climate of the region. Josef and his father live for part of the year in a cabin in the Carpathian Mountains and ply their trade of husbandry in order to survive.At the age of ten, Josef is introduced to his father's Krag rifle, and is instructed in the art of hiding and hunting their prey. A distant cousin, Marian Pes--nicknamed Zlee--who was one year older than Josef, is sent to live with them. Zlee has an instinct for shepherding, and together they form a brotherly bond of love and respect. Josef's sleep is haunted by dreams of loss and he gradually becomes distant from his father.In 1916, when Zlee turns eighteen, both boys go to the conscription office to join up. Josef alters the age on his identity card so that he can go, too. During artillery training, they are recognized for their skill of aiming and shooting, and are sent to train as snipers, or ""sharpshooters,"" which in German is called Scharfschützen. What follows is a coming of age story set in the harsh climate and geography in the trenches of war--to Austria to train as Scharfschützen, and eventually to the sub-zero temperature of the Italian Alps.Krivak writes with the precision and beauty of a finely cut gem and with the meticulous pace and purpose of a classical conductor. Every word is necessary and neatly positioned. His prose is evocative, poetic, and distilled. There is a place between the breath of the living and the faces of the dead, and that is where Josef's soul resides. When the author takes the reader to the abyss of loss and the ghosts of Time, it is riveting. However, the emotional resonance was primarily potent in the prologue and only periodically in the body of the story, and was otherwise low-timbred and somewhat distancing. The narrative is so deliberately controlled that at times it felt antiseptic and dispassionate.Krivak's first novel is highly recommended as an addition to a library of World War I literature.

As a secular Jewish middle-aged baby boomer, I can well relate to Linda Grant's portraiture of aging boomers that once embraced the youth and change and idealism of a new and outrageous culture of acid rock music, heady hallucinogens, diversity, and sexual freedoms.Grant is the British author of Orange prize-winning When I Lived in Modern Times (2000), about a displaced London Jew who heads for Palestine, and The Clothes On Their Backs (2008), about a daughter of Jewish immigrants, which was short-listed for the Booker prize. Moreover, Grant is an award-winning journalist who closely observes the effect of a social climate on its inhabitants. In her latest novel, she creates an atmospheric arc that extends from the radical sixties and moves through historical landmarks and landmines such as Bosnia, 9/11, 7/7, and the Internet.The novel succeeds with sublime precision, avoiding soapboxing and sentimental ruts. Its power arises partly from the narrative form that deepens with the accretion of detail and the passage of years. Chapters alternate with multiple viewpoints of various characters, but don't expect an equal distribution or conventional symmetry of voices. Grant intentionally changes tenses and perspectives throughout, sporadically keeping us in the dark about who is talking. The dissonant intervals bear close attention, which heighten the reading experience, so it appears that the author had a purpose in her contract with the reader. There was something Stravinsky-like about its force, pushing the boundaries of convention with its provocative rhythm and unpredictable turns.The first half of the novel lacks a visible anchor. It roams forward at a slight remove, but there's an assured and poised undercurrent that keeps the reader trusting the author. There isn't a lot of plot action in this multigenerational epic; the big events are a background for the more interstitial tale of people that revolted against their parents' ideals and desperately sought self-realization, while grappling with apathy and complacency and the succor or rancor of their childhoods.Stephen Newman, the central character, a high-strung hypochondriac and secular Jew from California, born in 1946, is the son of a Polish Jewish immigrant and a Cuban refugee mother. He meets a trio of intellectual hippies while studying science at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1968, and they all become lifelong friends. After some unexpected downturns, he marries one of them, the Pre-Raphaelite looking Andrea, in order to avoid the Vietnam draft, and finds love and contentment in Islington, carving out a dignified career making documentaries for the BBC and raising their two children.Andrea, an intuitive offbeat beauty with crooked teeth and luxuriant, tawny hair, finds her niche as a psychotherapist. Her best friend, Grace, the astonishing beauty with a plump trust fund and deep psychic wounds, is a rebel even for the sixties, and globe-trots from one country to another with her pent-up rage and hand-made clothes. Ivan becomes a successful investor and godfather to the Newman's children, Marianne and Max.So what happens here? Is this a cautionary tale, homage to the sixties, a character study of self-realization against a backdrop of social change? Grant illuminates the often frustrating dissatisfaction of ideals--how time eradicates the hope and potential of a generation that hung onto the promise of youth.""How can I be fifty, he asked himself, when I only just began?"" Stephen had it so good--or did he? His free-floating anxiety about the choices he has made and the promises to himself he didn't fulfill careen like a bad twitch through his soul. Theirs was the generation of eternal youth, and that was their privilege. They were supposed to be exceptional, not settled into routine.As the story unfolds and expands to include three generations, the novel becomes a map and a mirror of the human condition, of each generation's desire to break out of the mold of their parents and embark on a trajectory of trail-blazing success, or maybe just to become invisible. The metaphor of illusion is brilliantly summoned in the chosen professions of Max and Marianne.Beyond the current, quick pace of everyday life in the millennium and a tendency to conclude, respond, and move on with instantaneous speed and recovery, this is a rare book that will germinate in the mind of the observant reader after the closing pages. Its esteem rises with each passing day of reflection. Like the lush and dense gardens that bloom between its pages, this story grows as it is tended and cared for with time and patience. What is apparent at first becomes a portal to more, and continues to nurture the hearkened soul of the dedicated reader.""...no one wants to open the doors of perception anymore, acid was about revelation, about the vision of what lies beyond the rim of the knowable, it's a drug for revolutionaries, and they have no interest in revolution.

And that is just a segment of the odd and atavistic population of characters that you will meet in this multiple narrative tale of loss, love and exile. As you enter San Francisco’s Buena Vista Park during this millennial summer solstice, the moon shines eerie and luminous over creatures large and small, and a thick wall of fog sluggishly spreads its fingers during the celebration known to the faerie kingdom as the “Great Night.” Adrian’s visionary epic expands on his short story, “A Tiny Feast,” centering on King Oberon and the ruthless Queen Titania and their changeling son, Boy, who suffered from leukemia. At the start of this novel, Titania is inconsolable after the death of Boy and the subsequent departure of Oberon. She unleashes a malevolent force of magic by removing the controlling constraints of Puck, thereby allowing his demonic urges to run rampant through the park. Meanwhile, three heartbroken people with doleful memories of forsaken loved ones are lost and trapped in the park on their way to a summer solstice party. The tangled backstories unleash the bitter coils of pain and loss, and the mortals and immortals eventually interlock with loose springs. Molly grew up in a pious, gospel-singing family, fuel for unresolved trauma that preys on her like a ghost, and she remains stuck and heartsick over the suicide of her lover, Ryan. Will is a tree surgeon who was dumped by Carolina, the only woman he has ever loved. Henry has a black past with memory holes; he was abducted as a child and has forgotten the terror of those years. Meanwhile, his obsessive cleaning and hand washing, which serves him well as a physician, has cost him a relationship with pediatrician Bobby, the man of his dreams and now ex-boyfriend.Adrian flashes backward into the lives of the mortal three and alternates that with the captivity at the park and the faerie kingdom tale. There were shades of John Crowley’s LITTLE, BIG, as both books use some similar unrealistic elements and fantasy to enhance the realistic elements and emotional heft. However, Crowley’s faeries are more subtle and subconscious, and don’t violate the moral codes of humanity as wickedly as Adrian’s. Crowley also combines a Carrollian and Dickensian wit and artistry that would have been welcome in Adrian’s story. The essential problem I had with this book is that the fantastic elements were crowded with too much symbolism, and I had difficulty getting a purchase on the concepts. The visual surrealism, rather than taking me seamlessly to a deeper consciousness and serving as a metaphor or counterpoint, began to pile up and distract me. I was often bewildered with the action and commotion of the faeries. Rather than surrendering to the story, I had a more cerebral and exhausting experience. I lost control of the narrative—or did Adrian? I was taken with his scuttling energy and the peering furtive faces; I felt the oppressive weight of the shadowed victims. But I was also dizzy, blindfolded and drugged by too much screwball humor adjacent to tragedy, and the clarity I was seeking was etherized. Adrian’s prose is rich and layered with raucous, ribald wit and multiple motifs. It was eventually difficult to identify the core of the story. The fate of Molly, Will, and Henry was subverted by an anticlimactic ending amid black humor and zany twists of immortal madcap magic and erotic mayhem. However, the story resonated with me at many turns. There is a bizarre and churlish glee to the prose and a willingness to take the reader to unknown zones of scary emotional wilderness.

This technique of reversing age was used as a terrible gimmick in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (corrupted from F. Scott Fitzgerald and exploited for Hollywood), but in Amis' morality tale, it was employed as a perspective that was tantamount to the moral. (Also, in BUTTON, only Benjamin is reversing in age.)It is difficult to adjust to the narrative at first, because I did not know what I was witnessing. In fact, the protagonist experiencing his own reverse from old man to embryo does not straightaway understand it, either. What makes it so engaging is the character (and his secondary consciousness, i.e. the narrator) accepting it with an almost chaste goodwill, and describing his backward life with open-minded candor. The dialog is brilliantly conceived and, depending on your point-of-view (whether read forward or backward), contains subtle or compelling differences. What is even more canny--or uncanny--is when the dialog's meaning is stacked up against itself when read both ways.As this character--with the benign-seeming name of Tod Friendly (until I learned that Tod means death in German)--views his life from this new perspective, we learn that he is a medical doctor. The ironies accumulate, which often forced me to stop reading in order to contemplate and consider the implications. For example, it appears that violent injuries sustained by a patient actually heal the wounds, and that a doctor inflicted them. A woman's trauma is healed by assault in this backward chronology.When the reader is taken to certain key events in World War II, the reverse reality takes on a more riveting poignancy. The scenes here are the heart of the book's excellence and the humanity is bestowed via the ultimate paradox, the meaning of which still pierces me. I do not want to reveal too much for readers coming fresh to this book; however, I recommend that you let events lead you unencumbered, and don't try to intellectualize too much while you are reading. Eventually, the pieces interlock with deadly alacrity.My small problem was that Amis' use of reverse events, while central to the theme, did distract me and cause me to intellectualize too much at intervals (which is why I recommend going with the flow). I intend to read this again in the future, and I am confident that a second reading may have more emotional immediacy by allowing me to stop attending to the distractions about chronology, and go deeper into the apparent misinterpretations of the narrator. I will be ahead of the protagonist rather than beside him, which does alter Amis' intention, but a heady book such as this deserves another read.I highly recommend this to literature lovers, and to anyone interested in unusual literary perspectives. Amis executed a World War II morality tale that examines consciousness by transposing time, and excites awareness through time's reversal of consciousness....more",Notes are private!,2,10,1,"Apr 03, 2011","Apr 03, 2011","Apr 14, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23031.Time_s_Arrow

In this long, windy, ruminative story of forbidden love and fetishistic obsession, the city between two continents reflects the conflict of Kemal, the story's protagonist and son of one of the city's titans of export. On the brink of his engagement to the European-educated and sophisticated Sibel, the idle thirty-year-old Kemal falls for the eighteen-year-old Füsun Keskin, a humble but beautiful shopgirl with ambitions of a better life.Kemal smuggles Füsun away for dilatory afternoons at his parent's neglected apartment. He squanders her virginity for his own selfish need, knowing that Turkey's views toward women have not moved as forward as the jet set of this city would like to believe. The cosmopolitan sect struggles to break free and embrace the Western cachet with its sexual freedoms and couture fashion while still holding onto tradition. The hypocrisies of the affluent serve as a paradise for Kemal and a prison for Füsun. Eventually, Kemal becomes his own prisoner of love and obsession, sharing this cell of desire with Füsun.Extending over thirty-five years, but largely between 1975-1984, it begins on the precipice of change for Istanbul, with the introduction of disc jockeys, models, beauty contests, and psychoanalysis, with Istanbul both accepting and deriding the influence of European customs and acquisitions, such as a billboard of a German model drinking a new locally made soft drink, with the slogan ""You Deserve It All."" Kemal's obsession turns him into ""an anthropologist of my own experience,"" as he continues to smuggle and squander, but this time with the objects of his love, and, eventually, the city and society. Kemal also crosses paths with the seedier side of Turkish filmmaking and the decline and fall of the Yesilçam era of cinema.As Kemal walks the streets of Istanbul, seeking his own center, the reader is taken on a disquisition of Turkish culture, politics, ambitions, and ambivalence. Pamuk is too good an author to covet a soapbox or manipulate the reader's sensibilities. We follow Kemal's postmodern journey of collection and obsession and his paradoxes of freedom and enslavement, time and inertia, the single moments and the connecting line of these indivisible junctures. The first line of the book was, ""It was the happiest moment of my life, and I didn't know it."" Does Kemal's life become a fool's journey or an honorable quest?The title of this book is a dynamic thing in itself; by the end, you will treasure its complexity and extol its many meanings. Beyond the discursive flow of events and the action, which often takes place in Kemal's head, is his voice. Part buffoon and part philosopher, Kemal lures the reader into an almost chimerical Istanbul, as we wind through the muddy, cobblestone streets and gaze longingly and hopefully at the ancient blue Bosphorous, contemplating life through a lens of memory, capturing memories through an abundance of artifacts.This is Orhan Pamuk's first novel since winning the Nobel Prize in 2006.

From the Stalinist aggression of Russia to the peaceful, snowy streets of Boston, the reader is taken on a page-turning journey of professional ballet, fancy jewels, and ethereal poetry. This is an historical romance written by a scholar to appeal to readers seeking a satisfying escape.As the novel opens in contemporary Boston, Drew Brooks, an associate director at an esteemed auction house, is preparing for a daring, intrepid auction. The jewels of Soviet-defected and Russian ballerina Nina Revskaya are soon to be bid on, with proceeds going to the Boston Ballet. The now eighty-year-old former danseur is in possession of a most elegant collection, including part of an amber set with the once-popular and now priceless insect inclusions. As Drew and Nina size each other up, a thrill goes down the reader's spine. Nina has secrets she isn't sharing.Russian professor, poetry scholar, and widower Grigori Solodin teaches in Boston. Grigori is in possession of an exquisite amber necklace, and he believes it is a key to his past. He carries a great sorrow, and an unrelieved burden that is about to unload in some penetrating and provocative ways. The mournful professor, now fifty, has not reconciled his past, and he feels he has no future to look forward to beyond academia.Cut to fifty years ago, in post World War II Russia, as Nina Revskaya matures from new recruit to prima ballerina at the Bolshoi Ballet House in Moscow. Her best friend and fellow ballerina, Vera, has equal but opposite qualities, and they complement each other as confidants and cohorts. Nina is a short, classic beauty with jewel-green eyes, while Vera is tall, willowy, and soulful-eyed. Vera lost her parents to the penal labor camps, but found a maternal comfort with Nina's mother. Nina fell in love with poet Viktor Elsin, while Vera's more complicated affair with Viktor's comrade, Jewish composer Gersh, is fraught with problems of safety and security.To be paranoid in Soviet Russia was to be smart and sensible. Anything you say or whisper could be twisted and held against you. An equivocal or questionable comment against communist Russia had serious penalties. Many comrades were recruited by the Committee to secretly write reports on people close to them. Citizens often capitulated in order to be protected. Gersh is not a good communist, and thus is targeted as someone to be watched.As the story moves back and forth from modern-day Boston to the oppression in Russia, the tension builds to a sweeping but predictable climax. Despite the red herrings and complex web of clues, I guessed the outcome early in the book. However, the joy of reading the novel resides in Kalotay's prose, polished as smooth stone and as variegated as fine agate. Her landscape scenes are cinematic and spectacular, from the white snowbanks of Moscow to the blizzards of Boston.When you attend a performance of Swan Lake, you know how it evolves and how it ends. You listen for the mastery of Tchaikovsky's music, you gaze at the stunning sets and costumes, and you feel the visceral, emotional thrill of the dazzling dance. Kalotay's book stole me away from my everyday life with its balletic achievement of scenic beauty, lyrical writing, and universal themes.

(The last time this happened to me was with Possession, by A.S. Byatt.) The force of Franzen’s characters, particularly Patty Berglund, pierced me with such legion intensity that I am temporarily ruined for the next book. I apologize for the lack of restraint in my accolades–that which is diametrically opposed to Franzen’s utterly fluid and immaculate prose, his graceful, poised restraint.No contemporary author in recent memory eclipses Freedom’s degree of character examinations. Patty and Walter are powerfully palpable, and to a lesser but still compelling degree their son, Joey, and their best friend, Richard Katz defy cliché. This novel hits its stride immediately, and continues to get better and better, and progresses to rare species. Not one dull page or false note. This is a siren of middle-class existential angst.If you specifically detest novels of existential angst, OK, skip this. A fair warning. However, Franzen, in my estimation, does not toil or stall in the potential pitfalls of this theme and context. He has an exquisitely metered balance of scorn, mockery, truculence, and self-scorching–the traits that often dominate a domestic drama when the tone is ironic. There is nothing heavy-handed or phony here.There are beautiful moments of self-awareness and growth. And this is where Franzen’s brilliance is doubly conveyed. I am not generally a fan of scatological humor, but there is an astonishing scene where Joey’s evolution is combined, and actually self-realized with the most fecal of matters. The metaphor of his personal excrement and the painfully comic scene amplifies Joey’s self-discovery. Only a pinhead would fail to see the mastery of this scene.Some ers complain that he has no “tone.” Au contraire. As I posted in a comment earlier, the tone is sardonic–slightly more sardonic than The Corrections, and carries with it Franzen’s dry subtlety. Actually, it is the tone that conveys the lacerating narrative observation. You can hear the voice simultaneously wafting from an aerial position and a position of mock polarity. His minimalist but anchor-weight tone allows a vast breathing space for the characters to flex and develop without authorial intrusion.The reader is also privy to the burgeoning effects of parenting on each generation; the parents are a mirror to the children. Franzen’s insight into what makes people tick and how he works that into each element of the story and the interlocking compartments of his characters is done with probity and humanity. The reader, for example, vividly understands the conflicting nature of Patty, because the verity and consistency of her inconsistencies has a foundation. Her flaws are not random. Additionally, the mammoth reflections and refractions between Patty, Walter, and Richard serve to enhance and heighten the tension and thrill of the narrative and events.There is politics, but Franzen is an equal opportunity basher to all parties. He also reserves a special deliverance with fanatics and Kool-Aid drinkers. His specific love and propriety of endangered birds and nature and conservancy in general is advanced, but it is advanced with mindfulness. He leaves his organic footprint on a message, but he is a marksman at not using platitudes to do it. He doesn’t scatter diffuse homilies with ingratiating ownership; he is nuanced and wise.The prose is squeaky clean without ever being sterile. His witty metaphors and euphemisms are an acid delight. Pour another page for me, please. The eponymous title alone is a wealth of metonyms. And there is a moral compass, despite what some ers, who have not read the (entire) book, say in their non- s. The compass is initially foggy, for sure, and many miles of human error and weakness and Rubicons must be crossed. The heart is not irrevocable, in the story’s theme. It is a mighty muscle, a feisty organ, and has two-way valves. Franzen has written a formidable, epic, and unforgettable story of contemporary times.

Jennifer Haigh exerts a sublime spin on the unreliable narrator in this probing, poignant saga of an Irish-American family hailing from South Boston. Sheila McGann, the central narrator, left Boston and her Catholic faith years ago while her family stayed in ""Southie."" The cardinal premise is the question of whether her half-brother, Art, a once esteemed and trusted but now disgraced and defrocked parish priest, is really guilty of alleged egregious acts. This is 2002, when the Archdiocese of Boston is in the whir of sexual scandal and suppression of criminal child abuse.The story is told as verity is sought through Sheila as first-person witness to her family history. She serves as a sieve or net and sometimes a buoy or beacon and even a trespass or misstep as she harnesses the voices of her family and other witnesses. With her own voice, she intimately addresses the reader. Her destination is the hopeful arrival at truth and exoneration.Sheila, as narrator, is like the conscientious driver who reliably navigates known roads, and aims to steer well through dim or dark patches and thick blankets of fog. But the cursory compass of her mother's stoicism, Art's dubious determinism, and (her brother) Mike's aggressive loss of faith in Art keep Sheila and the reader in the alternating shadows of fact and fallacy. We're on a guided (and sometimes inadvertently misguided) tour of one family's hell and well of secrets, lies, and fault lines. We move in time with Sheila to parse gospel from myth.What we do know is that Sheila's mother had two husbands. The first man fled when Art was a baby, and the Catholic Church subsequently annulled the marriage. The second one, Ted, is the alcoholic father of Sheila and Mike, a man whose liver is now the size of a moving van and whose brain is the size of a pea. He lives in the basement of the house with his baseball on television and fragmented memories. Once a tyrant, he is now a pussycat.Sheila's mother, still attractive in her sixties, is the repository of guilt, denial, and appearances. Her preference for Art above her other two children is sinfully transparent and her store of secrets and silence is woefully debilitating. Mike lives ten minutes away with his urbane Lutheran wife, Abby, who detests all things Catholic. Their sons, much to Abby's opposition, receive a Catholic education. Their marriage becomes strained after Art's disgrace from the parish, and Mike vows to find out the truth as Abby's hatred and mistrust of the Catholic Church is vindicated and exacerbated by the scandal. Furthermore, Sheila's attempt to communicate with Art is thwarted by his evasive passivity.The story's progression from shadow to light is finessed by Haigh's ability to organically and gradually tease out the repressed and unknown facts and annex it to Sheila's existing information and beliefs. Nuggets of truth are mined from artifact with shattering grace, and the weight of the past and the sorrow of the present intersect with astonishing clarity. The author took a potentially explosive and sensationalistic premise and turned it into a predominantly quiet, tenacious story of doubt, faith, and redemption.The novel is equally appealing to the secular or orthodox, and Haigh's natural and luminous prose shimmers on every page. There's no preaching or melodrama glossing the story or lurid and commercial exploitation lacing the events. It is a deliberating but nuanced treatment of a subject too often made smarmy and shrill by the media. The focus is the substance of family and the binding and severed ties that tangle the heart....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Mar 28, 2011","Mar 30, 2011","Mar 30, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9592213-faith

She energizes the reader with her keen fidelity to story and character, and nourishes her prose with a delicate balance of braiding and building. At the moment that the troubled and complex Dr. Singh (Marina) appears on the page, I was installed in the story. From the black ice and silvery snow of Minnesota to the lush, dense jungle vegetation of Manaus, I persisted--like the title--in a state of wonder.Drs. Singh and Eckman have worked together as pharmacologists for several years, applying themselves to the study of cholesterol. Anders' wife, Karen, begs Marina to travel to Manaus, where Anders died, to find the body and uncover the details of his death ""of a fever."" They have three young boys at home that need to bury their father. Karen's grief is raw and biting, stricken with the need for clarity.Marina feels dread at the thought of facing Anneck Swenson, her former mentor in medical school. Elderly but still spry Dr. Swenson has been studying the fertility cycles of the women who inhabit this tributary in Manaus, and she works for the same pharmaceutical company as Marina. However, Anneck has eschewed email, cell phone and mobile support in favor of the Australian couple she employs as gatekeepers to her personal fortress. Has Swenson gone rogue? Marina's dual duty is to uncover the facts of Anders' death and find Dr. Swenson.This is a tale of drama, adventure and romance, told with tenderness and a sanguine certitude. There's a touch of madness, a soft mist of magic, and a wide-open view of cultural anthropology. Marina's sensibilities serve as a counterpoint to the local customs and exotic (to the US) rituals of the community. Each character is like a thumbprint or a snowflake--singular and intricate. Time is a ticklish thing in the Amazon basin, where nature is the dominant watch keeper and the river is an infinite enigma.Even through the sorrow of death, life is resilient and mysterious. There's a jaunty side to this mercurial book, and a buoyant sensuality to the prose. There's bark, there's bite, a pontoon, and potent mushrooms; there's a powerful force that journeys through the jungle and wakes up the brave and restless spirit.Highly recommended for Patchett fans--as exemplary as Bel Canto...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Mar 23, 2011","Mar 29, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9118135-state-of-wonder

You came to this farm town in upstate New York via Cleveland to find the ""big-picture"" story on rural waste dumping here in off-the-grid Haeden. You're twenty-four, alert as a cat, keen to pounce like a tiger, with Malcolm X glasses, a postmodern flair, and a Mencken regard. You've won an award in the big city, and now that the Rust Belt stories are waning, you seek the newly pelted. But after several years of living among wind-battered farmhouses, tall white flagpoles, crumbled colonials, and broken-down buses, you're still waiting and suspicious of the omnipotent, industrialized local dairy farm while writing benign pieces about the latent, wall-eyed community.You languish restively amid the cultural blankness of concrete and caved-in roofs, among the two thousand near-impoverished citizens and the rancid smell of garbage stabbing the air. Menace lurks beneath the folksy façade of the educationally challenged and is carried on the chemical stench of the industrial breeze of its one prosperous family. There is an unacknowledged power that controls its citizens. Here, where suppression and denial is as rooted and contagious as tree rot.On April 3, 2009, when the naked, sexually brutalized dead body of Wendy White, a nineteen-year-old woman missing for five months, is dumped and subsequently found in a ditch, the meaning is lost on almost everyone. (This isn't a spoiler--it is the central conceit.) Now, survey the scene. Here is Flynn's story of toxic transgression, but the townspeople aren't talking, or they're talking trash and no one is listening. While people congregate on corners and slink into bars, the police promise they are ""pursuing all avenues."" The tight-knit community behaves with boilerplate banality and assumes that it must be a drifter or brought on by a cult of anarchists, the hippies who live here and their ilk of ""environmental terrorists."" The people hang onto apocryphal evidence as gospel. Now the town is praying for Wendy White, and the school observes a moment of silence.More silence?Alice Piper is a gifted teen and former swim teammate of Wendy. She is the sixteen-year-old daughter of the widely mistrusted and misconceived Pipers, Gene and Claire, who left their profession as physicians years ago to live a quiet self-sustainable life here in Haeden. They sought a place to reconcile their radical ideologies with the realities of the corporate industrial complex. The Pipers raised Alice to question authority--and to examine--not just see, and to engage--not just comply. Alice, like Flynn, can't simply mourn, move on, and accept an unsolved murder.The fragmented form of the narrative mirrors the manifest structure of denial, and the gradual revealing of the facts incite the implacable cries of protest. The chapters seem jarring and incongruous at first, detached, non-linear, occupied with unreliable details, specious facts, and compromised evidence. But it reflects the process that Flynn goes through as an investigative reporter, receiving piles of unredacted evidence--exhibits, historical research, interviews, letters, school papers, and chronicles. The reader, like Flynn, is the source of the redaction. What materializes from the inchoate fog is the reader as character and fierce examiner of truth. The view from the pages is malignant and bracing. And that? That is the genius of the author, Cara Hoffman, who appeared to lock me out at the beginning but gripped me in its claw by the end.This isn't a genre police procedural or conventional crime thriller. There's blood, but it's not gratuitous, and there's violence, but not in a vacuum. The everyday sexploitation in headlines and entertainment is exposed, like a raw nerve, and examined, with a naked eye, but not directly in the text in bankrupt slogans and empty bromides. It's finessed, as a corollary, not milked with pithy epiphanies. If anything, it is turned on its head. The desensitization of civilization results from decades of overgrazing in the vicarious thrill of the kill. The assault on our now denuded senses is acute. We know it. Even as we seek more, we feel less. And that is what Cara Hoffman understands. She doesn't condescend, she weeps. And so did I.

In Munoz's stylistic mise-en-scène novel, the second-person point of view frames the watchful eye and disguises the wary teller. Reading this story is like peering through Hitchcock's lens--the camera as observer's tool and observer as camera--with light and shadow and space concentrated and dispersed frame by frame, sentence by sentence.Munoz applied the famous director's noir techniques to create a story about murder, madness, and longing amid the desire and antipathy of a working-class California town. Lives intersect, scenes juxtapose, and shades of gray color the landscape of the novel. Scenes of tenderness dovetail with acts of menace, plaintive music integrates with the rattling of chains, dark interiors annex the stark white heat of day.In the hushed and dusty working-class town of Bakersfield, California, in the late 1950's, the locals jealously watch the fresh and guarded romance of Dan and Teresa. Dan is the rugged bartender/guitarist and sexy son of Arlene, a bitter waitress at the downtown café and the abandoned wife of a motel owner out on the changing Highway 99.Teresa, a shoe saleswoman and aspiring singer, is the willowy Mexican-American daughter of a mother who left her to chase dreams of love in Texas. The narrow-minded prejudices of the town encroach upon the open bud of romance, and the ill-fated romance takes an ineluctable bloody turn. We know from the start that someone dies, but it is the why and how and where that sustains the tension of the story.At the height of Dan and Teresa's love story, the glitter and fantasy of Hollywood comes to Bakersfield as the crew arrives to shoot select scenes of a revolutionary new film. The unnamed Actress and Director reveal themselves implicitly through details of the unnamed film-in-progress. It was evident when they scouted exterior shots, and during an illustrious scene with the Actress.The interior monologues of the Actress and the frame by frame shoot of that most renowned scene in movie history is worth the price of admission alone. It felt as if Munoz had been standing next to the Director. The author's interpretation of historical data are transposed with polished clarity into film as words, and the searing silences that Hitchcock is so famous for lands on the page in the spaces between passages.There are superbly captured details and Hitchcockian motifs that add subtlety to the story and incite the reader's suspense, such as stairwells, keys, mothers, blondes, confined spaces, as well as loss of identity and optical symbols. The plate glass window of the café serves up a film frame metaphor (and the lens of a camera). Moral ambiguity, mirrors, bars and grills, and kisses, and of course--the MacGuffin, are all woven in with care and control.My primary criticism is that the narrative is dry and cerebral, but this may not be an issue of concern with other readers. I was academically stimulated by the author's style and complexity of techniques, but occasionally it felt studied and detached. The muted coolness kept me at a distance; I wasn't emotionally engaged, but I was intellectually absorbed. The frequent jump-cuts were its strength, but also its drawback.So what do you see in the dark?

In the years before WW1, Tommy Ogden, a wealthy industrialist with a passion for hunting and a penchant for a brothel, spitefully denies his wife the money to commission a Rodin bust of herself. Instead, he turns his lavish mansion and estate, just outside of the city, into the Ogden School for Boys.Years later, during the Cold War era, Lee Goodell is a student at Ogden and later the University of Chicago. Lee aspires to be a sculptor and a world traveler, eschewing his ancestral heritage of practicing law. The ambitious desire was ignited partly by the Debutante sculpture that stood in the school's library, and fueled further by some truly cutting incidents in his life. If you think about sculpture as something that forms out of removal, a shape and dimension that emerges from a formless origin, and a meaning that comes out of chiseling and whittling, then you will arrive at a parallel for much of the book's thesis.Lee is that formless youth who lived in the provincial, sheltered town of New Jesper on the shores of Lake Michigan. His father, a judge, was a titan in the community and a governor of suppression. He was instrumental, along with his secret committee, of stifling the full story of a vicious sex crime and quelling the murder of a hobo from the wrong side of the tracks. Judge Goodell had honorable but misguided intentions, and Lee overheard these secret meetings, which became a defining moment in his life. Soon after, he moved with his parents to the tony and suburban North Shore.Once Lee goes off to college, he meets a worldly, sophisticated group of students that open his eyes to life's more expansive possibilities. Another defining moment occurs when he becomes the victim of a crime on the gritty South Side. Rather than turning him away, he became more enriched and dedicated to establishing himself in this rich city of turbulence, truculence, and diversity.This is my first Ward Just book, and yet over the years I have collected several of his novels, now beckoning me from my bookcase. I look forward to more of his silky, supple, chiseled writing. His depiction of Chicago is superb, rousing me with its teeming, provocative nature. Just's ability to portray the city occasionally eclipsed his less rounded characters. You read him for the stately prose, and for the themes that come alive through the heartbeat of Chicago. Allusions to Melville's Omoo and Balzac's Old Goriot are prevalent in the book, and parallel this novel by shoring up a lot about class distinction and locale.The characters and plot are efficiently portrayed, and at times they are subverted by the themes. Just was occasionally expeditious in turning points that I would have wanted to see more fleshed out, some landmark moments in Lee's life. However, I think Just intended for the characters to be less individual than a product of a political landscape, a locale and a time--an homage to Chicago's twentieth century, and to those tumultuous memories. In Just's story, the city inhabited the people as much as the people inhabited the city. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 10, 2011","Mar 12, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9673935-rodin-s-debutante

To wit, whether you love, like, devour, admire, or even scorn Shakespeare, you can easily negotiate your way through this accessible ""problem play"" and trundle along with page-turning merriment. By the final pages of this faux memoir/novel/play, you will have also amassed a literate and impressive font of Bardology. You'll acquaint with the big hits and the B side of the Bard. You'll learn facts about his peerage, his years, the sources, printing houses, publishers, private life, naysayers, comedies, tragedies, a comedy of errors and a troupe of ""King's Men."" Phillips is a genius at conditioning the reader and searing Will into your brain. There is much ado about a lot of Willie's works in there, implanted carefully and wound into the occasionally (purposely?) overweening story. So let us assay our plot. Arthur Phillips is given an ostensible Shakespeare quarto from his father, a Shakespeare scholar and recidivist con man, who spent most of his adult years incarcerated. The play is called ""The Tragedy of Arthur,"" and dad wants Arthur to be his literary executor and family goodwill ambassador, overseeing its publishing and ensuring that the family prospers from the millions of dollars sure to come. First it has to be authenticated by experts in the field via stylometry (linguistic style) of verse, metrical characteristics, vocabulary, paper, and other and thorough attributes. In the meantime, Arthur Phillips is busy being naughty and fortune's fool, but not the way you may think at this glance. Arthur has to govern his way into and beyond the breach of his father. His sister, Dana, is the true Shakespearean scholar, now an actress in the controversial and finally partially Bard-attributed, ""The Two Noble Kinsmen."" And has Dana finally found true love? What is true in this memoir? Arthur Phillips is...Arthur Phillips. But what's in a name? He shares a birthday with Shakespeare, that is true. But does he have a gay twin sister born April 22nd (my birthday)? Is he really Jewish? That and other things--he does have a rather lean and hungry look--are for the reader to determine. (Shakespeare fathered twins.) And, at the end of the novel/memoir, the play's the thing, and The Tragedy of Arthur is not only there, but well explained and annotated. Something interesting about the whole insane Shakespeare phenomenon: one-sixth of all the Elizabethan plays that survive now are his. But, in his day, he was just a middling playwright, in-between a slew of others who we don't even read any more. Was this a superb publicity stunt by Ben Johnson, who wrote a fawning blurb, and invented modern literary publicity as we know it today? Perhaps we have inflated Will beyond proportion. Whether he deserves this praise or whether this is a matter of the public wanting a literary god and hero is something else to ponder. ""But this is a trick of perspective, a rolling boulder of PR, a general cowardliness in us, a desire for heroes and simple answers. Laziness: it's easier to think one guy had it all."" Phillips may have had his tongue firmly in his cheek, but he isn't above a little controversy, a little hoist with his own petard. This is a book about family--about loyalty, betrayal, fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, twins, and of course--love. From this story, I learned something else about Arthur Phillips' character, Julian Donahue, in one of my favorite books, The Song Is You. He may have been another homage to Shakespeare, who mourned the death of his son, Hamnet. There are a trough of pellucid Shakespeare lines that would reflect the theme and story of this book.

Hustvedt is no stranger to dismemberment, both in fiction and in life. If you peer into her history with novelist husband, Paul Auster, you will note that she has a stepson with a troubled past that features dismemberment, although once removed. In THE BLINDFOLD, the main character, Iris (Siri spelled backwards) examines the detritus of a murdered woman's life, including a severed finger in a box. In WHAT I LOVED, Gile's art is centered on dismembered bodies. In this novel, dismemberment is often metaphorical, such as the protagonist's separation from her sanity. Mia is an educated woman, with a PhD in comparative literature, married to boorish Boris, a neuroscientist. She had a mental breakdown and spent time in the ""loony bin."" Now, Boris wants a ""pause"" in their thirty-year marriage so that he can have an affair with a young French colleague. There are scenes from the book that create an image of bodily separation and/or disintegration. ""After crumbling to bits, I had lost that brisk confidence in the wheels of my own mind..."" When Mia first meets the child next door, she is only partly visible, ""her short, naked legs"" and then, later, atop the dollhouse, her wigged-top Harpo Marx head comes into view. Later, when describing the pubescent pupils she is teaching in her summer poetry class (all girls), she describes one who ""constantly adjusted her arms and legs as if they were alien limbs."" Hustvedt's recurring themes of exile, separation, identity, and the dislocation and severing of the self is examined in her latest novel. The premise is Mia's personal journey to reconstitute herself and to emerge whole, individual, changed. Mia escapes from Brooklyn to the provincial Minnesota town of her childhood to be nearer her mother. Here she becomes part of her mother's octogenarian group of friends, who she calls ""The Five Swans."" These aging, sheltered, debilitated women are surprisingly stout and vigorous in ways that both endear and enlighten Mia. ""...the Five shared a mental toughness and autonomy that gave them a veneer of enviable freedom."" And, that, dear reader, is something to discover for yourself. Dear reader? That is how Mia addresses us, and her notebook detailing her former sexual adventures, (of her life before she met Boris, the ""rat-man.""). She visits her low-key therapist once a week, keeps a close but distant correspondence with her actress daughter, Daisy, and indulges in emails with a ""Mr. Nobody,"" a derisive and anonymous somebody that contacted her online. The structure of the novel is where this story had slender success with me. She didn't take on a new theme--middle-aged woman is dumped by husband, suffers a breakdown, works to reconstitute self--so it is necessary that she engage the reader with a fresh approach. The approach she utilized often felt forced, flat, or strained. Despite the flying woman on the cover, there was meager liftoff inside the pages. Her inclusion of art, poetry, psychology, and science, a technique she has used with impeccable agency in the past, felt dispatched and rhetorical. The ""Dear Reader"" was coy and distracting. The structure was too much like a blog, which made it candied instead of candid. Hustvedt has been one of my favorite writers for several years. I have been swept up in her ability to bend it like Beckett, deliver like DeLillo, and ruminate with the cerebral province and style. In fact, she avoided the pitfalls of stylistic prose, until this novel. It is aiming to be whimsical, charming, and mordant. It comes off as pointedly quaint and capricious, and doesn't read like the mature Hustvedt I am used to reading. Regardless of the scholarly inclusions, it seemed superficial. It was lazy writing propped up with obscure quotes she decanted coquettishly. Hustvedt capitalized (with upper case) too many words/passages, as if she were afraid we wouldn't get the nuance ourselves. It made those passages clunky and amateurish. Additionally, she employed too many clichés and worn-out phrases. And if you want to watch adolescent girls impugn each other, read CAT'S EYE, a much more thorough and chilling portrait. I realize that Hustvedt was just gazing gauzily through these many devices, but I felt like she was telling me something, rather than taking me on a journey. If I had never read this author before, I may have assigned three stars, for the few times I was delighted with the story. One of the Swans created some astonishing embroideries, and Hustvedt's sensitivity and insight into aging is often spot-on. However, her psychotic break was canned and almost embarrassing in its effort to seem authentic. Mia's odyssey of change was stale and discharged. I am disappointed in this corny, ponderously whimsical novel by a usually fierce and imaginative author.   ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,Mar 2011,"Mar 03, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10223697-the-summer-without-men

Startling ironies hint at Frannie's personal tragedies--accumulated and melancholied--heaped in a corner of her heart and cresting to bleed out onto the pages. It is this prose that creates a vivid depth of feeling and a taut, fresh, exciting rigor of momentum. Frannie is a scholarly woman--a linguist and a Creative Writing professor for intelligent students with low motivation. Frannie's personal despair and emptiness are well illustrated in the first few paragraphs. It is as if she is a shadow of herself or a mirror of the dereliction that she lives within--both in her soul and in the city. After she witnesses an erotic act between a wrist-tattooed man and a young woman, she becomes involved with the tattooed man--who she learns is a detective--although she thinks he may have killed the woman. She is turned on by the dangerous masculinity of the detective and the power of seedy erotica.The murder/suspense thriller is, to me, the vehicle for a larger but more subtle story of personal isolation. The story serves as a medium for inner desolation and the loss of the soul. Most of the characters, whether they live or die, seem to have lost a chunk of their soul to the already embittered and fringed.I love Moore's style of writing more than the story. At under 200 pages, it was quite short and therefore more brief in certain characterizations and relationships than a reader might desire. However, it may have been intentional to keep all the characters in shadow. I suppose Moore could be considered a nihilist (based solely on this book)---when you finish the book, the reaction you have is more a response to the concept of dreary insulation/isolation and the failure of human connections than it is an empathy for any particular character. If you are eagerly awaiting the arrival of hope, you will not be fulfilled in that quest. However, the author does give a layer of searing suspense, buoyancy, and liveliness to the mordant theme.

When the Austin paper ed The Echo Maker prior to its release, I was intrigued and drawn This is my fourth Richard Powers book in as many weeks. When the Austin paper ed The Echo Maker prior to its release, I was intrigued and drawn to this author with an immediate urgency to read him. First I read the beautiful and opera-like The Time of our Singing and followed with the tender Galatea 2.2, two very different stories that demonstrate Powers' narrative alacrity. (Now add to that The Gold Bug Variations, which I plan on ing as an equally powerful novel. )Then I read The Echo Maker. Read the first few pages of the book. If you are not hooked, then this is not your type of literature. I was so swept up by his magnificently poetic description of the sandhill crane migration on the Platte River in Nebraska that I was compelled to study more about these birds on my own. The cranes are both a reflection of the story's concern of species preservation and are also allegorical, metaphorical. Powers' generous mind and renaissance intelligence weaves the story of the crane migration into issues of neuroscience and neuro-cognition as it soars into the mystery thriller plot of the story. This is a Pulitzer-worthy novel, perhpas too intelligent for what passes as Pulitzer these days. It is easily one of the best contemporary novels I have ever read, along with his books The Gold Bug Variations, Galatea 2.2, and The Time of our Singing.I am so driven to tell others to read this beautiful story that although I can not give the description it deserves, I must persuade readers to purchase it. It is a combination of naturalist concerns(the preservation of the cranes and the physical descriptions), neuro-science, dysfunctional family (with utter compassion and insight) and suspense thriller. Although there is an ethereal glow that swirls in every page, there is a definite, concrete and suspenseful plot. Powers has been compared to DeLillo; I agree only surfacely. Both are linguistically erudite and have dense meaning packed between words and thoughts, but DeLillo is more elliptical and ambiguous, while Powers has concrete fasteners to keep the plot driven. Additionally, he has more heart, the heart of Marcel Proust. It would be difficult to make a film of any of DeLillo's books I've read, but Powers has an immediacy, a muscular story that would transfer well to cinema (where of course they could ruin it if they made it too linear). The Editorial s reveal enough of the outline of the story; my intention is to tell readers just how profound is the experience of reading this novel. I was literally and literarily transported while reading and was engaged deeply by the third sentence. I am an RN that works in a neuro-psychiatric treatment center on an adolescent ward, so I usually avoid the subject matter in novels and look for different experiences; however, this story transcends the subject matter. Powers takes an aerial view of the life of an individual, the loneliness and solitude, while the characters strive to bridge the gap and explore the gap of connectedness. There is not one false note or sliver of self-consciousness in this exquisitely constructed story. Pathos without any treacly sentiment, startling science written poetically, and ancient rhythms humming all over. Powers has an amazing grasp of the utter incomprehensibility of time, and as in his previous novels, time is a major theme. I could read this story for the passages about time(and the cranes and the imagery) alone. However, there is a solid suspense mystery thriller, also, that keeps you on the edge even while you fall in love with the writing itself and go back and read passages just for its beauty. Mark Schluter suffers a closed-head injury after his truck veers off the road. He is then the first diagnosed case of Capgras syndrome sustained from injury rather than psychiatric etiology. Powers uses Capgras syndrome (the neurological disorder causing inability to recognize those closest to him while perceiving others accurately) to explore philosophical issues of memory, human fragility, and the vague recognition of the human brain. He delves into consciousness, reciprocity, the two-way valve between the head and the heart of the self, and the division between the human and the natural world. Powers' theme is dualism--familiar vs defamiliarization, and how that echoes in our perceptions of self and our relationship with our family and our environment, both personal and ecological. Mark feels exiled from his sister Karin, whom he no longer recognizes, and Karin in turn feels exiled from her brother, shattered at the way this disease symbolizes her separateness from her own self and the world around her. Powers' explorations of neurology and ecology render a chilly warmth to the story. His heart pumps clearly throughout the pages, and he bridges the (DeLillo)authorial distance by making accessible the burning concerns of everyman. The coldness of Nebraska and his virtuosity in geological and georgaphical descriptions is heated by the eerie passion of the story, the tenderness of the characters and the haunting allegorical presence of the cranes. This book has circulated through my dreams on several occasions; The Echo Maker certainly lives up to its title. Also, the characters are well drawn and sympathetic, and you care deeply about what happens to them. Interestingly, although the author's main protagonist in Galatea 2.2 was named Richard Powers, I felt him undulating enigmatically in this novel even more so than the former. There is something so powerful and reverberating and epic about The Echo Maker that you want to embrace the author, who you feel breathing and bleeding and searing through the most spiritual parts of your being. It is utterly and unassailably elegant, peerless, sublime, soulful, exalting, eternal, and yet grounded and accessible, palpable and wet....more",Notes are private!,3,26,1,not set,Oct 2006,"Feb 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19794.The_Echo_Maker

It is writI appreciated and enjoyed Berlinski's novel that infuses scholarly information on anthropology with a suspense story set in rural Thailand. It is written in a memoir form (although it is fiction). I did wonder why he used his real name rather than changing it. This distracted me at times--it made it difficult for me to separate the author from the narrator, which is important in any book that is not a memoir or autobiography. I do think it would have been helpful if he had changed his name. I think some problems stemmed from this. At times, the story seemed to digress into the self-consciousness of the narrator which brought me out of the story and into the author's consciousness. The story is suspenseful and full of intelligent insights into human character. He takes us back to the beginnings of serious fieldwork in anthropology and shares the common threads of angst that exists between anthropologists--whether to immerse yourself into the lives of the people you are studying or whether to stay on the outside looking in. The main protagonist's (narrator) anti-heroine, the anthropologist who murdered a Catholic missionary, did immerse herself completely into the Thai culture of which she was studying and suffered (possibly) from a complete personality alteration. I was enthralled with the author's description of the dyal, the rice ceremony indigenous to this rural culture. I do wish he had introduced it a lot earlier in order for the reader to ride its thematic importance. Instead, the author digressed quite a bit in the novel and then introduced the dyal ceremony and culture late enough for me to wonder if it was an artificial plot invention. I came to the conclusion that it seemed that way because of the first time novelist's editing problems (could have used a more aggressive editor). The dyal was central to the story but unfortunately appeared to be tacked on due to its awkward placement. The main problem for me in reading the story was its structure/execution. It was a bit uneven, with a huge chunk afforded to the whole Walker family tree and their eccentric personalities. In the end, this had little meaning to the overall poignancy of the mystery. I do enjoy detailed descriptions of characters, but in this case it felt a little engineered as a red herring--or, perhaps the author wasn't quite sure how to balance the two cultures. It is also as if the author had not fully committed to writing either a book on social anthropology or a novel so decided to merge the two (without actually having a writer's firm control over it). If this all sounds very negative, it is that I am slightly annoyed by these little inconsistencies that occasionally blocked my enjoyment of the story, i.e. the author writes with compassion and flare and really engaged me in this mystery, but often he got in the way of himself. By not separating Berlinski the author from Berlinski the narrator from Berlinski the protagonist, he was a distracting presence. In spite of these problems, I was able to look past the unevenness of structure because I was so engaged in the character of Martiya. The author made her come alive for me, and I felt deeply concerned with her travails. She popped out of the pages and was so powerful a presence that I was able to overcome the stiltedness of Berlinski vs Berlsinski vs Berlinski. Her story moved me; she became legendary. Many days after I closed the pages of the book, she entered my thoughts. Martiya was original, striking, and haunting. I could almost smell her. The other characters in the story were well drawn, also, but not nearly as captivating as Martiya. Her presence and vividness is what raises a two or three star rating to a four star rating. Berlinski is forgiven his first time author flaws because he created a first rate character in Martiya. I do recommend this book--it is rich with humanity. Martiya is a character worth knowing, the descriptions of anthropological research and its roots are meaningful, and the outcome is provocative....more",Notes are private!,2,7,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Feb 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/209851.Fieldwork

Was it deep tasty chocolate, or plastic fruit? I could not put it down--it IS somewhat like good TV and is obviously written with cinema in mind. I also did care about the characters very much because Patchett has a knack for writing about people's psychological bearing and emotional state. And there are lovely descriptions with imagery that made me float through the story with ease. The plot line has already been laid out well enough in the editorial s. Although highly coincidental, I would not have minded that so much--that can make for good storytelling if done with finesse--which it does do. But there is another aspect to her writing--the pandering. It peals loudly. Moreover, the 11-yr old girl, Kenya, has thoughts and actions like a 30-yr old. Even if she were a veritable genius, this level of sophisticated psychological insight would not be possible. I frequently groaned when Kenya was around. I felt that the characters were essentially tools or straw for Patchett's larger purpose--to tell this story and to weave some nice imagery along the way. But, I felt that when she was depicting the African American characters, she made them either cardboard or fatuously heroic (their tiny flaws only adding to their heroism) and that she was concerned about being politically correct. Her white characters suffered from the same wimpy characterizations, except for the old priest Sullivan. However, I felt he was also a tool, a vehicle for the story.

This is not callow, veneered, cinema-informed CIA, or any of the ""tell-all"" non-fiction embellishments of CIA activity. This is a psychological study of the necessary duality of agents, teased from the central soul of the duality of humankind. Mailer has a comprehensive insider's knowledge of the structure and workings of the CIA. Paradox lives on every layer; the characters in this fiction, other than the main characters, are people such as Howard Hunt, Che Guevara, Marilyn Monroe, John and Robert Kennedy, Allen Dulles--and the list goes on. Mailer cheekily provides notes at the end of the book stating that changing the names to fictional ones would cause readers to say, ""That is really Howard Hunt,"" or, ""John F Kennedy,"" etc., ""He just changed their names."" By using their known names, he expects readers to say the opposite. There is a very thin membrane separating historical fiction from fact. With cozening and cunning guile, Mailer writes about cozening and cunning in the CIA. The prose is gorgeous, with sharp imagery, layered references, wry observations, and poetic paragraphs. This novel also has Mailer's most fully realized female character, Kittredge. She is a CIA psychologist specializing in duality of spirit in both academics and in her career. The public self, the secret self and the inner conflicts that cloud an agent's ethics and takes over his soul are well-developed in Kittredge, as well as in the characters of Harlot and Harry. This book contains the intricacies of Cold War politics and treachery. I was deeply fraught after reading about Operation Mongoose (as well as other subversive operations) in all its explication. It allowed me to connect the dots better on the enigma of 9/11. I was deeply disturbed, enlightened, and exhilarated to read a colossal, mammoth, unafraid novel about how trespasses into other minds and other countries are accomplished; this does not exclude state-sponsored terrorism by our government. This is astonishing literature and a spine-tingling filter remover.

I believe it is intended that way, until you fall into its rhythm. At about page 60 I was hooked. By that time, I really grokked the narrator's flow and the prose became so natural that it was like I was living the story. The low-star ers did not get it. This was not ""zany"" or ""40's style"" or vacuous. The narration is intentionally tongue-in-cheek and subversive. And yet...and yet. The Woody Allen movie, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, had a similar style of narrator. It winks at you and yet it rings true. It is agile and poised and yet disarming. James Collins' story is like a painting or a beautiful photograph. Do you know how a painting or photograph, although depicting something real, can seem fantastical because of the play of light and shadow and mood and atmosphere? Do you know how a painting can be something unearthly, unreal, but because of the emotional rendering and quality can seem more genuine than a realistic interpretation? That is how this novel unfolds. It reveals itself through the crevices of the seemingly obvious story. It is like this big paradox. From the (wink wink) outer story the aperture widens, or even narrows simultaneously. You are holding a camera and you focus it on a field and in this field is an array of images. If you choose to look at it shallowly, then you will only see genus and species. But if you are sympathetic to your surroundings, there is a whole palette of beautiful colors and tones and textures to capture and captivate. This is a page-turning love story. The characters are not meant to mimic ""real"" life. It is a romantic tale that hovers above reality but is an equipoise between absurd and exquisite. It is very human with spare but striking prose. His ""big words,"" as some ers complain about, (they need to get back to their James Patterson, I guess) are not pretentious or overblown. The author has an elegant, clean, and precise but artistic flow of metaphors and imagery. I do not see one false note in this story. Yes, the characters are almost bigger than life in its broad strokes. But it is the small and eloquent strokes that give it its invigorating originality and artistic merit. There is a skeptical and farcical outer shell harboring a thumping big red heart. This is a classic bildungsroman. It is also refreshing, clear as glass, never canned. There is moral ambiguity and well-wrought characterizations, a noirish tale of bright and beaming sunlight. The whole unfolding is done in the colors of paradox. I actually felt slapped by the bad s because they were so far off the mark. They read like bully s. It reminded me of people criticizing Picasso's art by saying, ""It is just a bunch of squares."" It is OK to dislike and criticize a work of art--each to his own--but when something that ignorant is said about a work of art that the viewer does not even understand, then it reflects more on the er. The beauty of this novel is that it is sublime but direct, sly but open-hearted, insouciant but mindful, irreverent but reverent, layered but simple. It does have a similar tone to a British comedy of manners but it is so much warmer and more generous. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Sep 2008,"Feb 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1845050.Beginner_s_Greek

Itsik Malpesh is a Russian Jew who grew up during the vicious czarist pogroms of the early 20th century. The son of a feather-plucking goose-down factory manager, he was exposed to the slaughter of animals and people at a tender age. His actual birth occurred in the midst of a brutal attack on his family. As a young boy, he is arrested by romantic fantasies of the butcher's daughter, Sasha, who was present at his birth. Although he has never met Sasha, he is obsessively in love with her and spends much of his young years on a journey to meet her. By the time they meet, he has composed hundreds of poems about his passionate love for her. His epic memoirs from Kishinev to Baltimore are contained in a stack of accounting ledgers. His love affair with language is expressed continuously through symbolic language, extended metaphors (many of them relating to his early years in the goose-down factory), playful contradictions and aphoristic passages. Malpesh plucks words like his father plucked geese, he turns them, bleeds them (like his father's machine invention to pluck feathers from geese), lets them fall lightly like feathers until the lightness of words falls like snow that covers the earth. Like the Kabbalist scholars, Malpesh understands that there is a mystical, earth-shaking relationship between the smallest letter and the mysteries of creation. ""You see how language itself explains the mysteries of man?"" and ""Such letters. The flexibility of the alef-beys impress me even now."" From his beginnings shoveling goose droppings through his apprenticeship with typesetting and then in a sweat shop in America, Malpesh's poetry travels with him and within him. At the age of ninety-three he meets the young translator. The translator is in a liminal time of life, a recent graduate of religious studies working in a warehouse shelving Yiddish books. He meets a woman, falls in love, and suffers the consequences of a lie. The novel alternates between Malpesh's life and the translator's notes. Although they are very different men who lived diametrically opposed lives, they ultimately mirror each other through their emotional experiences. The writing itself deserves five stars. However, the denouement, as jolting as it was, was given a secondary treatment. The disruption of moral fibers left a taste like too many feathers in my mouth. Even by the story's end, I couldn't get rid of the discomfort. However, the journey of letters, words, language, religion, poetry, and love provide a provocative, piercing, and passionate adventure for the reader.

She spins straw into gold with wise witticismsJulia Glass has flair for what Flaubert called the mot juste, the exquisitely right expression or word. She spins straw into gold with wise witticisms, well-crafted metaphors, and meaningful meditations on life. Her language has a layered intelligence; her inner dialogue reverberates and resounds, mirrors and bounces. As she demonstrated in a previous novel, The Whole World Over, Glass is capable of handling a versatile range of characters in a balanced, compelling story. She is also a National Book Award winner for Three Junes (which I have not yet read). However, in this latest novel, her talents did not coalesce--the whole was not a sum of its parts.Although her insights were just as evident as ever, the story suffered from constriction and a one-note tone for most of the narrative. Yet, it is Glass' ability to conjure ripe phrases with robust philosophizing that kept me intermittently riveted through to the end of the novel. I was glad that I finished it, because she redeemed much of the sagging story in the final chapter.In this double narrative of well-bred Rhode Island sisters, she spans twenty-five years (1980-2005) of their adult lives. She depicts the connections, disconnections, and missed connections to each other and to their own ideas of self in isolation and in relation to others.Written in a quasi-diarized style, Glass alternates between older sister Louisa, who has more conventional aspirations, and Clem, her buccaneer sister. Louisa is a Harvard grad art editor and self-proclaimed failed potter desiring true love, babies, and recognition. Wily Clem, a wildlife scientist, eschews love and seeks sexual adventures as she travels to remote areas of the country studying fish, whales, birds, and bears.Lousia and Clem were engaging, clever, provocative, and sympathetic, but the author's tone and dialogue did not adequately provide distinction of the two narrative voices. Although the tone is fittingly ironic when the sisters engaged in wry self-reflection, it eventually became overindulgent and tedious. Instead of two narrators, it felt like one narrator pretending to be two people. This led to confusion when I began a chapter or new section of narrative. We know Clem and Louisa by what they did and how they lived and thought, but I had to rely on information that was often teased out too cagily in order to know which character was speaking. The necessary shades and contours of separate voices were missing. Even in context, the voices were often difficult to identify.The progression of events drifted, sometimes aimlessly or messily. After some juicy inner dialogue, for instance, the narrative would often become stilted and expository. During these expository phases, the story went flat, the center did not hold. The author began telling rather than showing, displaying rather than revealing. Long passages of wildlife descriptions, for instance, did not feel fluidly connected to the story--it seemed like I was reading from National Geographic cut and pasted into the scene. It was artificial, like Glass was straining for a device in order to move events along. Dramatic tension inevitably snared--the narrative would gather momentum, offer a dramatic pause and wilt. The characters' thoughts stayed elastic but the story itself was stiff and narrowly executed. The important events were explained, often offhandedly, in a desultory tone.Clem, Louisa, an eccentric Aunt Lucy and a panic-driven mother were the only characters with buoyancy. The men in their lives, including their father, did not resonate. They existed, I felt, as contrivances. There was another character, a male employee of their mother, who entered with a blaze of comic zaniness and provided a dramatic surge for the sisters. However, he just as quickly disappeared with an ambiguous resolution. I felt manipulated, as if he were only there to provide counterpoint to Louisa and Clem--don't get attached, he is going away, no longer useful.The climax also felt synthetic. I do not want to give spoilers, so I can only describe my response. It felt like the author decided to assault the consistency of character in order to make a point about the elusiveness of human nature and the enigma of the human condition. I came to the conclusion that she never intended the characters to have a life of their own beyond the decisions she made prior to putting pen to paper. In her vision to place them outside the box, she paradoxically boxed them in.The anti-climax was thoughtful and redeemed the manufactured denouement. The author pondered the climactic events through character and plot, giving the reader a rest from endless insouciance. The mood was suitably contemplative and compassionate, and when I finished the last sentence, I closed the book with a piece of my heart pierced and open. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 29, 2008","Feb 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3078805-i-see-you-everywhere

So I was wary but seduced, anyway, to buy Lehane's book--by Boston, by the Red Sox, by themes of racial injustice and social unrest, by the parallels to contemporary issues, and by Lehane's accomplishment with Mystic River. I was impressed by Lehane's ambitious genre-crossing. The quality of this book is sufficiently steep that the minor flaws are forgivable. This resonant story with memorable, marrow-deep characters did not fade away after the final page. Amazon provides an exuberant introduction to this novel, so my desire is to share my response to reading it rather than retelling the events. And there are teeming, cataclysmic events that vitalize the story. Danny Coughlin and Luther Laurence, the two main protagonists, are portrayed with virile consciousness and psychological intensity. I see them, feel them, hear them, smell them-- until I am breathing them. They are nervy and knuckled. They are not merely the broad strokes that you sometimes get in a period piece of sprawling, epic proportions (although there are a few Rocky-esque contours). They are not secondary to advancing the plot. Danny and Luther drive the story as the story also fuels them. And there is enough brio to keep them elastic and passionate. Danny's father, Thomas Coughlin (police captain), is especially interesting. He is a mixture of confident swagger, moral ambiguity, and tragedy--the closest of the characters to a literary one. He is the most unpredictable and enigmatic and keeps you changing your mind about him until the end of the novel. Although there is some sentimentality to the story and main characters, I did not feel short-changed. Although the author is transparent about his political views, he makes them tactile and combative in detail and luster. The background and landscape become character, also. It breathes and belches with dust, dirt, steel, mortar, sky, and water. The potent imagery adds dramatic tension and texture to the story without dragging it down. Individuals struggle to harness their environment and reconcile with its impersonal but cruel nature. Lehane intertwines the landscape as extended metaphor and foreshadowing as well as time, place, and temperament. His descriptions give a fierce undercurrent to a subdued atmosphere and tone--there is never just one sustained note (another problem with some period pieces). Some ers cite stilted dialogue with too much exposition. I did not experience that to any significant extent. There were some moments near the beginning of the novel that were a bit awkward, but once the momentum got going and the characters were well-oiled, the story became fluid and powerful. There is a curve in historical fiction where readers adjust to the author's chosen prose style and narrative flow. This is not a perfect novel--some of the architecture of it can strain believability and it waxes sentimental. And yet it is exhilarating, consistently engrossing. It never got musty or flat--it remained plump and invigorating. Its visceral engagement kept it at a 5-star excellence. Like Steinbeck's East of Eden, it is flawed and overflowing and exciting. This is an intelligent page-turner--also a thriller, a drama, a period piece, and family saga. It is fiery and wet, tempestuous and fierce.

This is an author who braids craft with art without sacrificing one for the other. Cronin controls his story and characters with a fierce yet velvet subtlety.

After reading the last page, I closed the book and just sat there, staring at the cover, drifting back into the story, a shudder through my body, a sigh that wouldn't quit. It was such an exalting experience that I have to gush. I want to share this compelling and unforgettable story with everyone. It is practically flawless.

What kept me anchored to this story was her eloquent narrIn her debut novel, Irina Reyn writes lovely, luminous prose in a gentle, intelligent style. What kept me anchored to this story was her eloquent narrative flow--her evocative passages and her penetrating look at Russian Jewish immigrant life in Queens. What ultimately fizzled and fell short for me was Reyn's rendering of the re-imagined Tolstoy classic. Rather than the bracing and exuberant experience I had reading Anna Karenina, I felt constricted, claustrophobic, hemmed in by this version. I was grateful that the author did not write an exact parallel to Tolstoy's version; however, just knowing that it is a (departed) remake floated regularly in my mind--perhaps that added to why the novel failed for me--the continual tugging of 19th century Anna Karenina. I had high expectations of a sprawling epic and a passionate, enigmatic Anna manifesting a riveting, heroine's energy. Instead, this Anna embodied only the prosaic and pitiable aspects of Anna Karenina. Reyn described her very well, giving us an astute psychological portrait of a self-absorbed romantic, a harsh critic of others with a tendency to see the world in black and white (by her own estimation). She was contradictory--a feminist, but aspired to live in her romantic 19th century novels. Unfortunately, Anna K lacked the inherent drama and tragedy of Tolstoy's Anna; Reyn's Anna was static, descending into her madness only by her own limitations and self-entrapment. Tolstoy's Anna had 19th century mores to consider--her loneliness was deeply felt, even though she had a hand in her isolation. Anna K's behavior, choices, and subsequent desolation often strained credulity. Additionally, the story of her marriage was dull. She marries for financial security at age 37 because her dreams of a ""Heathcliff"" coming along are fading along with her looks. Her cynicism is blind-sided by a young writer, with whom she starts a lustful affair. Euphoria. Then cynicism and unhappiness strike again. This was not enough to make a novel. Anna did not have any interesting eccentricities or experiences to vitalize the story. The author did a peerless job of depicting the Russian Jewish immigrant experience in Rego Park, Queens, including the characteristics of the Russian ""soul."" Their philosophies, insecurities, and provincialities resonated on every page. Reyn had enough nuggets of back story and minor characters to write a rich, rewarding novel beyond this modern-day but tired remake. She also did an interesting twist to Tolstoy's version of the French influence on 19th century Russian politics. Reyn brought in the art of the French film and the impact it had on the character of Lev, another romantic and protagonist of the second narrative. He saw through the lens of Godard, Bardot, Irene Jacob, Jean-Paul Belmondo--Lev, like Anna K, felt special and unique (through art) and unable to fit in with the sensibilities of most people. Paradoxically, he thought that this made him more sophisticated, rare--life was supposed to mirror art. He was a legend in his own mind. Fortunately, he eventually emerges from his myopic worldview (unlike Anna K). Of all the parallel characters in this modern-day take on Anna Karenina (Anna K, Lev, David, Alexei, Kitty), Anna K was the least appealing or compelling and the most frustrating. She went from potentially faceted at the story's beginning to cynical and flat by the story's end (while Lev and Kitty became riper). She never was a siren, or beguiling, like Tolstoy's Anna. I would read another novel by this author, however--she is a skillful prose writer. I think she will impress me more when she writes a true original. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Oct 30, 2008","Feb 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1779869.What_Happened_to_Anna_K_

It is a book I immensely enjoyed, as Mastras is a rich storyteller and paces the events well to keep the pages turning and the tension taut and ripe. However, it is also uneven in significant ways that undermine some of its strengths. Two narrative threads converge. First we meet Nick Sunder, a disillusioned American lawyer who has been backpacking in perilous areas of Central Asia for several years. Encountering a couple along the way--a brazen French woman and her British boyfriend--the three travel together and evolve into a passionate love triangle. After separating under mysterious circumstances (which unfold gradually and non-linearly), Nick is later arrested in Pakistan at his hotel room just moments before boarding a train to India. The police torture him in a filthy prison cell and later negotiate a dicey deal for his release, which is unacceptable to Nick. After managing to escape, Nick subsequently has to trek for many weeks through the Himalayas on the other side of the Tribal Line of Control. He ends up traveling with two very spiritual, noble men (Ghulam and Fidali) from these mountainous regions who invite Nick to accompany them under their aegis and experience with the harsh domain. Introduced next are Aysha and Kazim, the stunning and brilliant Muslim star-crossed lovers from the small, primitive village of Indian-controlled Gilkamosh in the Kashmir mountains. They separate when Kazim leaves to train as a Mujahid in the rural mountains and Aysha goes to medical school in New Delhi. The question is whether they will reunite when she returns to Gilkamosh to open a clinic. This is also where Nick ends up after his long trek with Ghulam and Fidali. After a short, lyrical, and haunting prologue, the story begins with muscular, crisp, and thrilling prose. The descriptions of landscape and the difficulties of survival from prison to the Himalayas and the crossing of the Tribal Line of Control are breathtaking. The author writes riveting details of these hardships, and a sense of immediacy and urgency lures the reader on. Additionally, the sensuous, enchanting coming-of-age story of Kazim and Aysha is very moving and compelling. Unfortunately, as the novel deepens, the tone becomes inconsistent. From a brutal and sharp and often laconic tone at the beginning, the prose turns sentimental. And the parts written to reveal spiritual contemplation and reflection are conveyed through heavy-handed and expository writing. These cogitations tend to be synthetic and cloying. Instead of offering visionary and invigorating argument and thought into spiritual and religious debate, it offers up overused and simplistic notions. The characters of Nick, Kazim, and Aysha are arch and three-dimensional, with realistic and textured lives and complex inner conflicts. However, they are often thwarted by the uneven tone and style, which lead us into convenient (and sometimes predictable) plot contrivances at various points in the story. And Ghulam, who starts out as enigmatic and formidable, narrows into a background caricature that emerges ceremoniously as a disposable vehicle for other characters or events. The author has a cinematic talent to his writing, and I frequently envisioned a potent film version of the novel while reading. Mastras has a keen eye for visual appeal and sensuality when he isn't being derivative. Some of the dialogue and scenes could potentially be improved and heightened to correspond to this otherwise lush and exciting story. I was annoyed with one scene between Nick and Aysha that was all but airlifted from the movie Witness (with a few altered details); however, if you are not familiar with the movie, it could stir you with its intoxicating sensuality. The climax of the story is powerful, and I had to tear my eyes away from the pages to digest and accept some of the bracing and harrowing scenes. I did feel largely satisfied by story's end, and I would recommend it with the caveat that it suffers from the pitfalls that impede many first-time novelists. I look forward to more from this author. 3.5...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jan 24, 2009","Feb 27, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6984552-fidali-s-way

From the With lean, clean, clear, and well-lit prose, Barry Unsworth delivers a flawless and restrained masterwork in a sober but subtly ironic tone. From the opening passages until the end, I was enveloped in the naturalness and ease in which this historical novel unfolded. On the precipice of World War I, a convergence of civilizations and a clash of egos surround an archaeological dig at Tell Erdek in Mesopotamia (Iraq). British archaeologist John Somerville seeks fame and something deeper as the head of the dig site of what he hopes to be an ancient Assyrian palace. For three years, he has come up almost empty-handed, and pressures surmount as a German railway threatens to cross into the path of the tell and sabotage the venerable past and his uncertain future. His wife is distant and newly energized by Alex Elliot, an American geologist posing as an archaeologist. Eliott is working in cunning collaboration and competition for different countries and interests bent on excavating oil rather than artifacts. Jehar, an Arab hired by Sommerville to assist him with various duties, has his own agenda to secure enough money to marry the beautiful woman of his dreams. Various other characters enrich the story with their guile and their quest to control not just the oil fields of Mesopotamia, but the hidden and unbidden tangibles and intangibles that haunt them. The plot quickens and thrills without ever becoming heavy-handed or sententious. This cautionary tale of the past ultimately reveals a chilling tableau of the present. If you seek superior and sublime literature, you will savor this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 27, 2009","Feb 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3952795-land-of-marvels

It failed to do that. The cadence is choppy and before I can attempt to grasp a scene or a character, it has skittered past me. Its very lightness was ponderous. This is a first novel for Houghteling, and she does show promise and passion. The passion was buried, however, under needless exposition and too many paintings.

In 1955, American in Paris Sally is plucky, wry, sardonic, bohemian, sexually liberated, and spontaneous--like a butterfly out of the chrysalis. This book was written in 1958 but Elaine Dundy's prose and narrative still hold up. This was before feminism! But was it really? There are many instances in literature before the women's lib movement where female characters were assertive as hell, (aggressive even), daring, independent, and wily-- in touch with their erotic selves. It was Sally that kept me tethered to the story. She leaps out of those pages and is very much alive in the reader's mind. Dundy also gives rich texture to her secondary and minor characters. Everyone has his or her own soul--or lack thereof. I admit to getting weary of the story. When I remind myself that this is a bildungsroman of Sally Jay Gorce, I am less bothered by the meandering of the plot. Every night Sally parties with friends, usually gets mindlessly drunk and ends up pursuing her ambivalent passions. She goes on a beach vacation with a group of friends and becomes an Extra in a film, also pursuing her passions. We love Sally Jay because she is flawed but candid and honest. She is too guileless to be a phony. There are elements of a thriller potential in the story via a lost or stolen passport and the possibility of a man abusing women and helping them turn into prostitutes. However, it came pretty late in the story and puzzled me. By the time I got to page 200, I wanted the story to end. As much as I loved Sally, her hi-jinx and social life were becoming enervating. I just wanted to get on with it. Dundy writes with intelligence and class. Sally Jay is so well-developed that long after the story recedes from memory, Sally Jay will remain embedded. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Feb 12, 2009","Feb 27, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1059856.The_Dud_Avocado

Grab you by the hair, the head, the heart, the teeth, the gonads? Well, this epic family saga is one of those. It takes a little while--you need to have a little patience as it introduces the numerous main and supporting characters, the place, and the twines of the story. At about page 80, ballast is apparent. You are fastened. Momentum increases and you are completely absorbed. The narrator, Marion Stone, a 50 yr-old surgeon, recounts his life from inception and of his twin, Shiva, and the lives of the people that loved them; raised them; abandoned them; permeated them. They were born conjoined at the head (successfully separated), sons of a Carmelite nun (and nurse), Sister Mary Joseph Praise, and an extraordinarily talented surgeon father, Thomas Stone, who had worked together for seven years. The place is Abba Adaba, Ethiopia, at the fictional Mission Hospital (pronounced ""Missing"" by many Ethiopians), where much of the story takes place. These characters will inhabit you as you inhabit them and this staggeringly beautiful and moving story. They shimmer. They resound. You will see them as you go about your day--the deep color of their irises, the creases and folds of skin, the texture of their hair, the resonance of their voices. And you will feel the spirit and nature of them as they surround you. Missing (Mission) becomes a powerful symbol in the story--the lacunae of memory, of narration, of events. All will eventually come together stunningly. Additionally, the title of the novel gathers not moss but succor, essence, and context as the story deepens and disparate pieces of the past become a whole. By the time you get to the end of the novel, those three words become the poignant portal to the denouement and the thrust of its theme. At turns playful, comic, adventurous, distressing, shocking, tragic, and tender, Cutting for Stone has an unbearably beautiful soul.

During the Jim Crow days prior to and on the precipice of the Civil Rights movement, the black housekeepers and maids raised the children of elite white families and cleaned their houses. However, they were expected to use a separate bathroom (""Negroes carry different diseases from white people""), eat from separate dishes, and refrain from opinions on racial inequality. Crossing boundaries could lead to fines or imprisonment, or even death. It is from these indignities that ""the help"" are aided by a budding, brave, young white journalist named Skeeter. Told in separate voices in alternating chapters--Abileen, Minnie (two black maids), and Skeeter--the author is able to give an unvarnished view of social injustice and the individual lives it affected in the Deep South. Through Skeeter's clandestine meetings with twelve black maids, the stories of their lives are culled covertly from in-depth interviews with these women. Over a period of several months, she sets out to complete an intrepid but protectively anonymous profile of a town and time under siege of segregation. But she took some brazen risks by including material that was specific to Jackson and its inhabitants. Skeeter plans to submit her finished book to an agent in New York, risking alienation from friends and family and even criminal prosecution if her identity (and the identity of the maids) is discovered. The prose is lilting, crisp; the tone is lively and droll, igniting the serious subject matter through irony and illusory irreverence. I turned the pages eagerly as the tension mounted and headed toward a dramatic climax. I was very impressed with this first-novel achievement by Stockett. She poised compassionately on a tightrope of pity, honesty, empathy, and all the inscrutable emotions that stretched between a black person and a white one in the days of segregation. Her candor and intimacy hinted at autobiographical moments. The characters were largely three-dimensional and vibrant, although the story is dotted with some one-note figures. Additionally, there were a few plot devices/ techniques that were a little contrived, a common occurrence with first time authors. The middle section lagged in a few places and the pace briefly lost some of its buoyancy, but the story overcame this idle interval and advanced to an exciting denouement. I was not ready to let the characters go when I finished the novel. I look forward to reading more from this author. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2009","Feb 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4667024-the-help

Because I had to read the whole book to appreciate it and be gripped by it. The book was like an embryo--rudimentary, unborn. But when I read the last paragraph, I actually got a spine chill. And, later, after shelving it, my thoughts wandered back to the story with a deeper pleasure. For the first 100 (or more) pages, nothing much happens. Young provincial Irish girl Eilis Lacey travels to America(circa 1950), leaving her sister and mother in the Irish berg. She improves her education, her appearance, and refines her tastes. With the help of a family friend (a priest), Eilis finds a place to live in a rooming house and a tedious job in a clothing shop. She encounters new friends, (all rather shallow), meets a man, has a courtship. It is all very mundane. When she lies in bed after receiving a letter from home, she actually thinks about her mother or sister taking out the envelope, what kind of envelope, how many envelopes. I was exasperated at that point. Yet I kept reading. Toibin is a competent writer, and I was at least partially engaged, although I remained skeptical of any interesting story emerging. You know how some authors fail to maintain control over their story and characters? Well, Toibin has perhaps too MUCH control. That is how it seemed as I was reading. It plodded along, but rather lightly. I did like Eilis and cared what happened to her, but I wanted something imaginative or inventive to occur. At least one splashy thing. But when something dramatic happened in the last 100 pages, it didn't really affect me too much. It seemed more of a vehicle for other action to take place, for Eilis to enter into decisive conflict and change. It is so subtle and restrained that I almost didn't know when I became fully engaged. During the last portion of the book, I was in suspense, wondering what would happen, but speculating that it would be predictable. Full resolution occurs in the final moments. That last paragraph was a titanic moment for me. It undid all my former expectations with its bittersweet irony and unpredictable ending. My four-star rating went up to four+ stars. I finished this quick novel in two sittings, but the impact really begins at the end and continues to foment even after you are finished. Don't give up on it even though it seems that nothing is happening.

Due to the absence of her remains, all that stands in the graveyard is her cenotaph.Twenty-five years later, the three grown-up children are still trying to cope with their grief. None ever married.

Gaelan is a weatherman (ah! the irony) who has only superficial, sexual relationships with women, and the youngest, Bonnie, is a virgin and garbologist. She roams after storms to look for ""archival"" remains of things that flew away in the tornado with their mother. And she talks to the dead at the cemetery.There is also a beloved but inscrutable stepmother, Viney, (although she never legally married their dad); a large supporting cast of unforgettable characters; ancestral Welsh traditions; and the Nebraska weather and topography, a salient ingredient in pulling the story together.The prose is beautiful and evocative as the story moves along non-linearly, but with grace.

But this Amazon vine selection was supposedly for ""adult"" readers and therefore is ed in that context.The tone of this book and the character of Jordan Weiss, the main protagonist, remind me of movies I have had to endure with my daughter when the Olsen twins or Hilary Duff take on spy or intelligence work. Although Jordan has a degree in international relations and has a spotless reputation working in intelligence in the State Department, going to war-torn or sensitive areas like Monrovia, Bogota, Jakarta, and Montenegro, she behaves like an emotional basket case and feels ""guilt rising in her"" frequently for blundering from the hip and watching people get hurt or killed. She has never heard of the Kosovo Liberation Army and is unfamiliar with the conflicts in the Balkans, so she receives a two-minute history lesson from one of her colleagues. The book TELLS us she is the best and the brightest, but doesn't show us anything but a silly and indiscreet young woman still sobbing over the reported drowning of her boyfriend from college ten years ago. This colors everything she does and--oh, of course, it turns out to work in her favor. How did an emotionally labile woman handle dangerous missions for ten years?She does not even think to google a man she is researching as a possible suspect or link to her assigned case, but her best friend, a civilian, does that. After some inner conflict, Jordan also decides to share classified information with this girl about the case she is working on ""because she is now like one of us.""The writing is on a middle-school level. For example, she repeats the same cliched metaphors and similes. Information and guilt and the resulting emotions always seem to be hitting her stomach like a rock. Sometimes slamming her like a stone. This is predominantly cut and paste prose. Supposedly, this author has been either developing or writing this book for 10 years. And Jenoff is obviously an intelligent woman--she is a graduate of Cambridge University (like her protagonist). I often take an author's academic credentials into consideration when choosing a novel. I was confident that the narrative style would be textured and literary. But the writing is utterly juvenile.This is equivalent to a more mature Nancy Drew book. I was expecting an intelligent, heady book blending literature with spy/intelligence work. I thought she was going to be as provocative as John Banville, John Le Carre, or Tana French. I was prepared for extended metaphors and lush imagery, as well as a healthy dose of irony. I did not expect this TV in a book. Very bad TV. And so earnest it made me wince when I was through cringing.There are no literary elements to this novel unless you want to keep hearing the same tired figures of speech. And the behavior and approach to their work of these State Department colleagues is laughable. Additionally, as people die or are seriously injured, Jordan has ""guilt rising up"" but then, oh well. It has an ""oh, dear!"" tone to it. She comes across as fatuous and silly. There is no substance to this woman beyond the tragedy she suffered 10 years ago. Nothing in the elements of the story reflects Jordan's alleged intelligence or competence. She blindly breaks protocol and rules, but never really has a plan beyond the next few hours. She is on her own rogue mission, with the help of her dead boyfriend's best friend. But there may be a tie-in with her current assignment. Yet, she has no historical, political, or economic frame of reference. But, oh, yeah, she is the State Department's golden girl. She can do whatever she wants. And she does. She is not reflective or cautious with information or action. She reminds me of something akin to: Liz McGuire goes undercover. And the author just conveniently inserts heroic deeds or histories so that the reader KNOWS what a whipper-snapper Jordan is. It is heavy-handed and ludicrous.I finished this book only because it was a vine selection for .

She wakes up in her vomit and her filth, with no recall of last night--she experiences frequent blackouts when she drinks. A young, talented, comely, and statuesque college professor, Patsy is nevertheless on a grease skid to oblivion due to untreated alcoholism. This time she is accused of running down and killing a mother and daughter in her driveway, and her life subsequently takes a turn to prison. The first part of Patsy's story reflects the jacket blurb and marketing for Blame--bracing, taut, suspenseful. The book description even contains an unnecessary, thoughtless spoiler, which doesn't affect my rating of the author's work but does illustrate that the publishers are intent to mislead readers into thinking that it is one kind of book when it is entirely another. The author is a superbly talented writer, i.e. her use of language, the written word, is obviously what earned a sterling endorsement from Richard Russo. Her metaphors and turns of phrase are verdant, fragrant, lyrical. Her characters are sympathetic and genuine. There were no false notes there. Her erudition is in the contemplative, the characterizations. I adjusted to the temperament of the story, which often meanders and slows down to a staid portraiture of a collection of people. The narration actually reads like a 19th century novel at times, even though 20th century issues were involved. Now, that was unexpected. The author seemed to forgo what she started out to do and then changed course. The fuel-injected thriller morphed into a balmy sea. I went with it, but I want to warn readers--if you are looking for a tight, twisting, adrenaline-pumping thriller, look elsewhere. This is a cerebral look at rehabilitation and redemption. AA plays a vital role in this story, and the author does a stellar job of capturing the impact and life-altering possibilities of its sobering influences on existence. Blame opens in 1981 and spans twenty years. The weakest area of this story is its architecture and structure. Some characters are introduced as poignant, but elusive. And then they recede or disappear awkwardly (which is too bad, since she creates compelling characters). Direction is lacking, uneven; it is as if the author had several books or story ideas and then labored strenuously to fuse them together. It came off as choppy and indistinct. She kept my interest up because of her beautiful passages; the warm and dusky tone; and the characters of Patsy and her gay friend, Gilles, whose brio is scene-stealing. The concocted denouement was prosaic, tipping toward bathetic. As if the author decided to get back to writing a thriller again. I sighed. And the anticlimax was dour. Events felt cobbled together, the story was circumvented--and yet I read every word. And I would read her next book, too. She is a classy wordsmith, a sensuous writer, a fathomless thinker. Another draft or two would have helped this story to coalesce. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 27, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6514824-blame

At the outset, it is historical fiction-- the story of a subway worker, Peter Force, who is hired to help dig the first transit tunnels in Manhattan, circa 1900. Interspersed with Peter's story is a fable about a pioneer family from France that ruled their own ""Free Estate"" in Ohio during the latter part of the eighteenth century. The Latoledan family *kingdom* was separate from the rest of the United States and the boundaries drawn by the Treaty of Paris. For almost a century, the rulers enjoy a pastoral and aristocratic life.The story soon proceeds into speculative fiction, as elements of time travel are introduced. A beautiful and mysterious woman named Cheri-Ann Toledo, descendant of the Ohio kingdom family, sharply enters the narrative and upsets Peter's life. A frayed polymath, she claims to be a time-traveler, and is targeted by both the police and the scientific community. Additionally, the battle between Nikola Tesla, the trenchant inventor of alternating current electricity, and Thomas Edison, (with his backing by financier J.P. Morgan), is a parable and a fuse for the chasms between realms of reality and the riddle of time. Cheri-Ann and Peter are ensnared at the center of the enigma.The narrator of this tale is an elderly owner of an antiques store who currently lives in Los Angeles. He finds an old but familiar photograph during one of his business-related treasure hunts, which leads him to a life-changing decision and the unfolding of this story. As we follow him to his final destination, he braids all of these elements into one epic tale.Flaming's use of non-linear narration epitomizes the philosophies embedded in this novel--the lacunae of memories and the distance of time. However, the novel becomes a bit long-winded and cumbersome as the story progresses. He tends to declare these conceptual mysteries rather than weave them delicately into the tale. I was frequently removed from the story into the author's dialectical pondering. It was an engrossing novel, but it was too cerebral. The story never evoked a tone; instead, it felt like a vehicle for a tract on the conundrum of existence. The flow was dry and distant and clumsy. The narrative perspective was not well controlled, either--the unnamed narrator was sometimes buried in these musings (or it awkwardly shifted to Cheri-Ann's or Peter's point of view).And yet...and yet--I really liked this novel. Despite its flaws (which is evident with many debut authors), I connected with Flaming's fable of ideas. If I hadn't been smitten by his philosophy, I would have assigned a three-star rating. But within the scope of this very ambitious and blemished book was a winning and exuberant saga. If you seek a polished piece of literature, you won't be satisfied.

He was always In late 18th century England, Daniel Rooke is a marine lieutenant who reluctantly goes to war for the Crown in the American Revolution. He was always a square peg, bullied by other boys in his youth. A generally solitary person, he studies math and music and gazes at the stars. His true calling is astronomy and linguistics, not fighting. Physically toughened by the violence he witnesses in the war, he continues to remain an outsider to the status quo. He seeks knowledge, unity, and connectedness with the constellations and the cosmos. He is not comforted by the stern God of the chaplain's book; his heaven is within the heavenly bodies of the universe. He believes that to injure any is to damage all.After the war, Daniel is recommended to go with a regiment to remote New South Wales, where his Majesty has mapped it as an ideal place to deposit an overflow of prison convicts. Rooke goes primarily as an astronomer, as a man of science--to deduce, to calculate, and to wait for a comet. He constructs an Observatory away from the regiment and the convicts and busies himself with his sextants, his books, his graphs, and his thoughts.What follows is a stunning journey of Rooke's consciousness, instigated by the presence of the Aboriginal natives of the island. Before long, a contrast takes shape between the regiment's condescending treatment and Daniel's touching gestures toward the natives. He opens his Observatory and his soul to them, awed by their strange beauty and unfamiliar language. For the first time in his life, his heart overflows with his fate as he is magnetized and forever changed by the humanity of a community and by a child that especially and fiercely affects him.Inspired by a true event, this story is a timeless, soul-piercing tale of compassion, mercy, and empathy.

I wasI dashed out to buy Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, Philip Caputo's, latest novel after reading an enthusiastic  in my local newspaper. I was unfamiliar with this author, but I was intrigued by the promise of a burly border tale. I was not disappointed. This is a generational saga and epic of the southwest, bristling with illegal border crossers and warring drug cartels, studded with outlaws and vaqueros. A dense book, it starts rather slowly, gradually lassoing the reader into a complex, emotional story brittle with sepulchral secrets and spilling with scoured grief.Gil Castle, a Wall Street broker broken by the death of his wife in the tragic events of 9/11, lives day to day in suicidal agony. At the advice of his grown daughters, he has submitted to therapy. However, the platitudes of ""healing"" and ""closure"" bring him even further to the brink of despair. He prefers to read the intellectual, reflective stoics, such as Seneca, or the Greek tragedian, Aeschylus; they speak to him with a deep and thoughtful gravitas. He rebuffs what he considers the psychobabble of grief counseling, of America's proposition that we weren't meant to suffer for long periods of time, ""as if grief were something like digestion."" As a last grasp for hope, he decides to leave New York and move to a small cabin in fictional Patagonia, a berg in the desert of the Arizona-Mexico border, where his cousin still owns and operates a cattle ranch that has been in the family for a century. His maternal grandfather, Ben Erskine, pioneered this business, the San Ignacio Cattle Company. What Gil and the reader gradually discover is that this sprawling ranch is riddled with ""ghosts and bones.""Two main narrative threads emerge, each with its distinct flavor, tone, and color. The author creates a scintillating outlaw tale of the early twentieth century that is both chilly and taut, ripe and ropy. The actions of Gil's desperado descendants alternate with the modern-day fable of family and the open graves of grief. The story seamlessly goes back and forth from Gil's twenty-first century tale to Ben Erskine's of a hundred years ago. Peppered throughout are letters and interviews with Gil's relatives from mid-century. Caputo heightens the broad western tale with an astute character study, giving us some salty figures a la Cormac McCarthy meets Larry McMurtry, but branding his own mark and riding in his own saddle.CROSSERS keeps its narrative focus, even as the subplots spread and the landscape widens. The vengeance and violence of the drug runners and border crossers keep the pace tight and the action grisly, as well as reticulate the ancestral histories and hatreds between and within families and neighbors. Moreover, the subplots serve as allegory and as metaphor to the wide divides of the human heart, and to the sorrows and histories that threaten to bury us in modern and distant tragedies.Some of the characters are a little contrived or thin, although there are some, like Ben and Blaine, who are vibrant, blunt, and truculent, knotted like a fist. Gil's unbridled Midas touch is a bit too convenient at times, but it is a minor affliction. Additionally, the author laid on the idea of evil terrorists a bit thick in the beginning of the novel--but, thankfully, to a larger purpose, which became evident as the story leavened. I am reluctant to discuss my controversial perceptions of 9/11 in any detail, except that I initially considered abandoning the story. Yet my instincts told me to persevere, that this wasn't a polemical novel. Fortunately, the author's dynamism eclipsed the indictments and he keenly underscored the dreadful, wretched terrorists that roam our souls--the penetrating terrorists that inhabit the psyche and scream from our hearts--the terrorism of the unconsoled.I have read complaints (of earlier works) by a few readers that Caputo's storytelling is too expository and more suited to journalism. Occasionally, CROSSERS is indulgent and immoderate, and I can see vestiges of the tendency. But he reined himself in and penned a captivating, sweeping story. Even with the minor flaws, this is a powerful, piquant tapestry of a tale. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 13, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6593158-crossers

Not since Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye have I read such a powerful novel about teenage feminine conformity, coercion, betrayal, jealousy, secrets, and love. Godwin creates a labyrinth that begins with a simple layer and gradually builds to a complex and knotted snare. I was pulled in from the opening pages as this rich, multi-generational tapestry is woven as if from the loom. The book never loses steam, and the lyrical rhythm amplifies as the story builds. Godwin designed an absolutely beautiful brocade of a book. She sublimely and organically explores the conscious, unconscious, and subconscious layers of the human mind and all its dark and light attributes while she braids a tale of intrigue, desire, and loss from the fabric of memory.The central narrative is the school year of 1951-52 at a Catholic boarding school, Mount St. Gabriel's, in the Appalachian mountains of North Carolina. Mother ""Suzanne"" Ravenel, age 85, is reaching back and writing her memoir in 2001 of her time as a student and then headmistress of the now defunct school. She is plagued by events that occurred that one year, especially after her freshman girls staged the annual spring play and brought buried secrets into the performance. She feels stuck and unable to write about that time. Memories--how they are interpreted and relived and revived by the people who remember them--that is the primary theme that this intricate web and convoluted story is built upon. Their unfinished desires, a key element of each person's intimate story (and of course the title of this book), is subsumed and sometimes emotionally tampered by various interpretations of past events.Godwin uses several narrative devices with ease. Developments are non-linear and yet not confusing, and she uses several perspectives, along and within the third-person voice, to tell the complete story. There is Mother Ravenel at her tape recorder or walking with other nuns at the retirement home, contemplating her past and receding into her future. Interspersed with that is the story of that ""toxic"" year and the girls at the boarding school--shy and recently orphaned Chloe, who talks to her dead mother and draws pictures that explain mysterious incidents; Maud, the enigmatic, elusive and beautiful daughter of a broken home; and Tildy, the assertive ringleader and undiagnosed dyslexic who switched best friends that year from Maud to Chloe and added tension to the clusters of girls.Tildy's sister, Madeline, animates the narrative with her grounded and giving nature. Their acid-tongued mother, Cornelia, a former classmate of Mother Ravenel, adds history and a fiendish dose of doubt and a wicked but droll perspective. She is contemptuous of Suzanne and imparts her derisiveness to her daughters. Cornelia's twin sister, Anotnia, was Mother Ravenel's best friend when they were students at Mount St. Gabriel's, and their shared history is the source of many of the secrets and future scorn by Cornelia. Then there is Mother ""Kate"" Malloy, the young teacher and protégé of Mother Ravenel. She is pale, beautiful, and empathic, and a fortress for the teenage girls. She claimed her vocation at an early age, but she also identifies with the tumult of her students.A handful of the male characters are also dimensional and integral to the story. In any sprawling novel there will also be a few paper-thin walk-ons or mere vehicles for some larger purpose, and Godwin's is no exception. Often, she mirrors the scope and tone of Dickens, especially with her male characters.We also move forward in time through some epistolary passages, which add a surprising twist and intrigue to the tale. As Godwin switches perspectives, we are carried effortlessly through the story. This is a difficult task for many authors to pull off, but Godwin engages us instantly from moment to moment, even as she changes time and perspective and narrative mode. The story deepens as the pages turn. I found myself in a kind of wonderment when the story was about 2/3 of the way through. I realized that this initially straightforward story, a story that could have become a sappy melodrama in lesser hands, had evolved into this monster of an organism with knotty, knuckled tentacles that surround and imbibe the heart. What is outward about this story is also latent and hidden. There are many submerged facets of this tale that pour into your psyche with a subliminal but fierce gusto.Unfinished Desires is a dense but very accessible novel. It is not a ""quick read"" kind of book for the beach. It is a novel you savor and read as it is intended--closely and with its gradual, exalted rhythm. It is a quiet squall, a subdued tempest. The driving action is mostly psychological. It is masterful but not perfect. The last few pages, although revealing, felt a little tacked on, without sufficient roots. However, it doesn't weaken the overall novel, which delivers a sterling tale of humanity, warts and all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Dec 11, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6072275-unfinished-desires

That novel doubtlessly I was floored that Louise Erdrich did not win the Pulitzer this year for her magnum opus, The Plague of Doves: A Novel (P.S.). That novel doubtlessly cemented her as a peerless wordsmith and unrivaled postmodern writer of satire cum tragedy. Her dazzling metaphors--pataphors, actually, place her in a pedigree by herself. She combines ripples of Philip Roth, undertones of Nabakov and the mythical, regional realism of Faulkner. Her locale is often within the Ojibwe Native populations of North Dakota, as in The Beet Queen: A Novel (P.S.) and Love Medicine (P.S.) (as well as Plague of Doves). She has mastered the multiple-narrative voice, braiding multi-generations of families into an innovative whole.In a striking departure from her previous work, Erdrich's Shadow Tag is a psychological examination of a marriage and family on the brittle brink of decay. Instead of the focus being on ancestral histories and buried secrets, the focus is on one family--Gil and Irene and their three young children--and their private devastations. Gil is an artist who achieved substantial success painting portraits of Irene, some of them deeply disturbing. Irene has resumed her doctoral thesis on a 19th century Native American painter whose subjects have died soon after being painted. This provides a stunning metaphor and theme for the title, Shadow Tag, a game where each person tries to step on the others' shadow, while protecting their own. Native peoples believe that their shadow is their soul. To step on their shadow or to paint their portrait is to steal their soul. Irene is one-half native and Gil is one-quarter, a fact that adds a personal engagement with the lore.Gil possesses a stealthy, dangerous charm; he is haunted by jealousy and lashes out physically at their son, Florian. Irene, a tall, arresting beauty, drinks wine like water and keeps two diaries. She leaves a false, incendiary Red Diary for Gil to find (she is meting out punishment for his invasion of her privacy) and the true Blue one hidden in a bank vault. Gil and Irene inflict mental, emotional, and physical pain on each other as they struggle individually to maintain control.Although narrated in the third person, the unreliable voices of Gil and Irene are woven in variously--through their introspection; by Irene's diaries; and from the children's uncertainties. The shocking candor of their actions is mired in dark motivation and murky intentions. A maddening cat and mouse game ensues; the Muse is a jealous mistress and will not be ignored. As Gil agitates over his final portrait of Irene, and Irene skillfully undermines Gil, a menacing cloud is cast over the family.Erdrich controls her narrative with razor precision, deftly restraining and then escalating the spaces between words to arouse and intensify the reading experience. The prose is starkly sensuous, lean and taut, nuanced but inflammatory. The characters connect with a singed, bitter bite and a sable, blighted love. If you require ""likeable"" characters that are moral exemplars, this novel is not for you. However, if you want to sink your teeth into a bald and naked exploration of a shattered marriage, etched with moral ambiguity, you will not be disappointed. Moreover, the ending will stagger you with its poetic brilliance. It is one of the most thought-provoking final pages I have experienced in eons.

However, I must make an exception and celebrate this debut novel by proclaiming this as the most visually stunning, sublime prose I have encountered in any book this year. Every sentence is an ineffable bliss to read. I urge you to experience it the way I did, without too much information beforehand. Be dazzled and bedazzled by this symphony of the senses; the words transcend the story. Rockets will fire from all your synapses. Dinner may burn.The story's premise, which takes place in 1751, is solid but does not break new ground in literature, although the element of fireworks and their meticulous craft adds a fresh and novel spark. Agnes Trussel, 17, and in dire straits for a woman of her time, runs off from her rural Sussex countryside and farmer family to escape to London. There she is employed by the brooding, enigmatic pyrotechnist, J. Blacklock, and becomes his apprentice. She is a quick study of powders, pigments, and combustibles; she learns to load pastilles, gerbes, Bengal lights, and numerous other explosive projectiles. Agnes is an anachronism, which fuels the narrative and makes her a potent protagonist. The story sizzles and bursts with a seamy cast of characters--dandies; scullery maids; creepy men with rotten teeth; prostitutes; merchants of every class; a mute; and other baroque personalities. And although the author illuminates this era vividly, it isn't satire or burlesque. It isn't a bodice-ripper. And there is not a lot of irony, either. Yet it is not melodrama, or bawdily theatrical. It is a well-plotted arc that builds to its conclusion without a lot of fireworks--just the genuine kind.What elevated me while keeping me rooted to the pages were the flawless, contoured passages. Every sentence is like a Vermeer, or a painting from the most atmospheric of landscape artists, or a shimmering photograph. Facts and physical descriptions become high art and nuanced, dimensional photography. Nature, light, and color are brilliantly defined and lyrically expressed. Borodale is a master of metaphor, alliteration, and allusion. She is a visual virtuoso of words, and her depth of field is sharp and resplendent, perforated with poetical texture. She has striking control over scenic aperture and placement, as if she had used a Swiss lens to frame it, and a blade to sharpen it.I am astonished that this is the author's first novel.

He digs daily and ferociously, determined to find his uncle's grave and bury the past sorrows. He wants his Nan to stop waiting for the impossible and for his Mum to quit grieving. When no evidence turns up, he writes a letter to Avery in prison to ask where his uncle is buried. Avery admires the pluck of this painfully brief letter and writes a cryptic letter back, even though he doesn't know whom the missive is from--man, woman, or child. The tension of the story progresses with the letters, and a tender, taut tale unfolds with remarkable restraint and depth.This is not your typical serial killer story. Gratuitous violence is supplanted by a quiet desperation, which is more effective in revealing the insidious horror and rippling ramifications of Avery's atrocities. The narrative is largely advanced through psychologically interior scenes and internal reflection, and the details are exhumed through Steven's crusade for redemption.This pacing is unhurried. The action is gradual, and at times is too slow and plodding. Additionally, I thought that Steven's acuity of thought and cleverness a bit too sophisticated and believable for his age and experience. However, these were minor blemishes in an otherwise original and atmospheric story....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 04, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6596845-blacklands

I thought it was rather banal and ultimately resided in the upper end of the guppy pool. Deeply superficial. It was billed as DeLillo-esque, which is why I wanted to read it. It tanked.When writing about obscenely rich navel-gazers, it helps to be fresh and original. I enjoy essentially unlikable characters in literature--they are often savagely solipsistic and subversive. Tom Wolfe, Martin Amis and Zoe Heller create self-regarding characters with a literary elan. It was the pasty cardboard cutouts that irked me; Adam and Cynthia were conspicuously thin and stale. Within the text, Dee advances his theories of manufactured art ruining culture in this day and age, but he didn't really give us something fresh-out-of-the-wrapper, either. Maybe he was being cheeky, but it fell flat to me.The second part of the novel, once Cynthia and Adam have been established as scheming masters of the universe, highlights their children, Jonas and April. April doesn't do one unexpected thing or have two original thoughts. Jonas tugged at me for a while with his ambivalence and innocent pretense. His lofty cynicism and earnest ideology had a guileless streak, which gave him some dimension. But, almost abruptly, he unraveled into stream of consciousness nothingness.There was a hospice scene toward the end that was authentic and effective. I know this from working as a hospice nurse for many years. The author captured the helpless fury and the meek awkwardness. The saliva in my throat burned and I was there with the characters. Dee either did his research or experienced this personally. However, the ending (following the hospice scene) was grandiose and melodramatic. It rattled hysterically and left a stream of synthetic fibers everywhere....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Dec 15, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6624929-the-privileges

Marika, a Czech immigrant to the US, has a sorrowful past. Her father was the target of a political execution and her mother descended into schizophrenia after his death. Marika was subsequently inspired by the writings of Pulitzer Prize-winning Lewis to become a journalist and enter war-torn and dangerous countries such as Angola, the Congo, and Liberia to expose the torture and suffering of others. However, she has not come to terms with her own personal suffering, which affects her ability to foster deep, sustaining relationships. Her career is successful and exciting but she is wounded and savaged by her own demons.This was my most challenging book  to write. Why? Because White Mary is a combination of spell-binding and stilted, beautiful and blemished. This is journalist Kira Salak's first novel, and maybe she just needed a peerless editor to fix the flaws. But this novel transcended its weaknesses and what remains in my memory is the ripe and horrible beauty of its prose and story. I experienced the page-turning and powerful pleasure of a 5-star book. But for the purposes of fidelity to criticism and other readers' sensibilities (who may be bothered by these flaws), I gave it a 4-star rating.Salak's dialogue was sometimes stiff and decorous. It should have bothered me, but it didn't (I will get to that). Her handling of the themes of loss, trauma, survival, and redemption; fear, love and forgiveness are structurally simplified and calculated, even predictable in its arc of unfolding. This prevented many readers from enjoying the story as a whole.I had the inverse experience, as the whole of the story enveloped me and allowed me to forgive its shortcomings. The journey and its dark heart reverberated with elements of spiritual grace. Although Seb, Marika's boyfriend, borders on one-dimensional thinness and sainthood, what lifted him from type was his Buddhist-like presence and allure that heightened his compassionate vulnerability. His characteristic platitudes were obscured by his utter humanity. As an example, Seb expresses the principle of ""mudita,"" a Sanskrit word difficult to describe in English but closely resembling the feeling of sincere rejoicing for another's good fortune and success. It is a practice he embraces and attains and is a significantly occurring refrain for Marika's inward journey. And I felt the deep love he has for Marika as authentic.The pulsing and ongoing, almost agonizing pleasure of this narrative resides in the proverbial and elusive presence of Robert Lewis. Marika has never met Lewis, yet they are conjoined inextricably. His presence or absence, his anima, echoes throughout the story. Paradoxically, her obsession with finding Lewis overshadows her relationship with Seb and keeps her at arm's length from her past traumas, (both familial and in the field as a journalist) yet Lewis is also the key to unleashing and unlocking the walls to Marika's joy and redemption. Until Marika can determine whether Lewis is dead or alive, she is prevented from finishing her biography on him and is, more importantly, stuck in a psychic purgatory.Marika is accompanied through PNG by Tobo, a native guide of the region and a colorful counterpoint to her sensibilities. Tobo is fierce and daunting and often wry and cunning. He places the mourning necklace of his sister around Marika's neck and makes incantations throughout the journey to help protect the ""wei meiri"" (white mary), who he sees as spiritually broken and certain to die.Although some passages, dialogue, and philosophical insights are varnished or inflated, my ultimate and visceral experience was to bypass these flaws and melt into the unnerving and unsettling beauty of this generously humane story.A distinguished book is one that doesn't end with the last page; the vibrations hum considerably and provocatively. The White Mary is a song that soars, through the flat notes and even the off-key ones. As a whole, it is a tender, harsh, mystifying, and compelling aria of survival and love....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 08, 2008","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3301347-the-white-mary

Not being familiarI was initially reticent about reading this book because I struggled through The Savage Detectives, which was maddeningly abstruse. Not being familiar with esoteric Spanish/Mexican literati, much of its sly wit escaped me. But I was willing to engage myself in Bolano's final masterpiece because he is so probing and original. I was warmly astonished.These are five books in one with a common thread through all of them--the murder of over 400 women in the past 15 years in the fictional town of Santa Teresa (based on true accounts of these murders in Ciudad Juarez). The first story is a search for the elusive German writer, Benno von Archimboldi, and a love triangle (or quadrangle) of Archimboldi scholars. The second story concerns a Professor who hears voices telling him to hang a geometry book on the clothesline, and is very fetching with bittersweet humor. In the third section, a reporter named Fate goes to the Mexican border to cover a boxing match. All these stories lead us to Santa Teresa, where the fourth and most staggering story takes place. It is a penetrating account of the deaths of these forgotten women and the sociopolitical and socioeconomic forces that shape the investigation. The last section does a full circle to illuminate Archimboldi's life.Bolano could describe trousers drying and leave you haunted and awash in the beauty of his prose. While reading his words, the way sentences are stitched together like soft resplendent fabric, I felt like I was walking in it, or it was walking in me. This was liquid, fluid, creamy prose. It was very accessible because it was so natural. Never synthetic, never dry, never pretentious. In fact, it felt effortless. It was stark in its landscape but lush and sinewy in its tone, not one word wasted and yet it draped a world with a hypnotizing glow. It often was surreal; at times I felt I was entering a fifth dimension, but not in a David Lynch/David Foster Wallace/Nabokovian manner (but interesting that Bolano paid homage to Lynch). That is what dazzled me so deeply--that Bolano could rupture all the boundaries while maintaining them, that he could make you feel like you are in a postmodern world but easily so-- by writing with clarity and simplicity and alacrity. (Sometimes it was like being on LSD even though the writing was so pure, which was a feat in itself. You don't need to struggle to understand his novel).Finally, what made this book so transcendent, so unutterably beautiful, was this massive, monumental heart at its center. There is so much love in it and so much humble wisdom and naked truth, that it cried. It cried for the women and it cried for humanity, and it did this without grandstanding, without asking it from us or telling us with trumpets. It just spoke for itself with mortality and through its mortality, its immortality....more",Notes are private!,4,34,1,not set,"Jan 26, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/63032.2666

You have surely lodged with the savage nobility of the human spirit--the exquisite pain and extraordinary beauty of the soul; degenerate misery; wild exultation; unutterable grief; merciful exaltation; boneless survival. All this manifests and more as a crescendo of disparate voices intersect, climb and caterwaul to a swirling catharsis.Above, at 110 stories, in artful equipoise, funambulist Philippe Petit performs on a high wire between the North and South Twin Towers, captivating a swell of onlookers on the ground below.

While her husband lies in a coma, she is told some uncomfortable news about his dirty little secrets. With a kind of acerbic, acid aplomb, she spins into a denial that threatens to unravel her. As it is, she is wound so tight that I felt my own circulation threatening to block off. But she is so exuberant that I was often reeling in her energy.

Don't be fooled by the product description (of a man in love with his ipod). This is not a jaunty, trendy escape tale. This is for serious readers who love literature, and who love literature to descant.Julian Donahue is middle-aged, affluent, and adrift. After his son's death, his marriage unravels, but he remains tightly wound. He has a successful career producing commercials, yet he is increasingly filled with self-loathing and dread. He spends dissolute nights seducing beautiful, indifferent women or drearily bantering with his eccentric, cunning brother. The consummate and lugubrious loner, Julian is unable to pursue happiness. His ipod shuffle is his only source of bliss; each song is a monument to a moment in time, a memory stilled or distilled, a dream of an image of a life. Julian's opaque existence is thrown into sharp relief through the prism of his songs. As his father before him, only music and his past can pierce his diamond-hard heart.And then one night Julian walks into a bar and is struck by the young Irish rock singer on-stage, Cait O'Dwyer. A rising star, a supernova, a red-haired songbird, Cait commands his attention with her saucy but vulnerable charisma and nubile essence. After the show, he buys her CD, returns home and googles her, downloads her music into his ipod--and so begins their love affair. But this is an unprecedented romance. They decide not to meet right away; rather, they circle one other. They spend time together alone. They shadow each other. He illustrates her on cork nightclub coasters--images of her vibrant potential--each with a title--and leaves them for her at the bar. One is entitled ""Bleaker and Oblique."" She responds, writes an eponymous song and leaves him clues and a key under her mat. Yet they tacitly understand that it isn't the right time to meet. Julian captures her on film from a distance, enters her home when she isn't there. They email, occasionally talk on the phone, and correspond, paradoxically, in ways even more intimate than can be imagined in person. Their relationship is a sensuous aria and they are each others' accompaniment.As the story crescendos toward its fascinating denouement, I actually broke out in a sweat. This is an emotional, psychological, and romantic thriller that creates a bubble of tension so taut that it will leave you breathless and drenched. During the last 60 pages, I was heaving. This novel was an emotionally athletic experience that exhilarated and moved me into strange and intoxicating places.I have read two earlier novels by Phillips--The Egyptologist and Prague, which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, this novel is distinctly different in narrative style. What a virtuoso--I didn't recognize him in this book by his erstwhile prose or any previous patterns. I was stunned by his ability to engulf me with this story. Although his prose is cerebral, it is also poetic. You could lift almost any sentence from this novel, place it on a clean, white sheet, and contemplate it, ponder it, reflect on its individual acuity. And yet, inclusively, the sentences connect beautifully into a quiet explosion, a bonfire of a book. Like a poet, he can be simultaneously precise and circumspect--a razor and a rhyme, canny and uncanny, at once and out of time.Read it the first time for the hot chill, and then read it again for the quiet thrill.""Breakdown on the shoreline,Can't move, it's an ebbtide.Morning don't get here till night,Searching for her silver light.""---Electric Light Orchestra...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 26, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5444895-the-song-is-you

The following (first) chapter opens with promise--a dead body. Then the author tries too hard to tell the story. That's the problem--too much telling and not enough showing. The sentences read like announcements or headlines and the prose is shopworn and musty, hauled from a high-school creative writing course. The author is also on an adverb and gerund frenzy (in the same sentences!), which bogs down the narrative to a watery substance. Sentences are lifeless and clunky and contain no fresh turns of phrase or descriptive power. This is a typical passage, not an exception to the rule:""He loved to sit on her lap with his head resting against her while he played with the gold necklace she always wore and never removed. The pendant was a little butterfly, because she loved butterflies.""The author states the obvious ad nauseam. Here I go again with another example (he is describing cars now):""...and the most ostentatiously obnoxious of them all, Hummers.""We know that Hummers are ostentatious and obnoxious.""Razor-thin"" and ""the broiling sun"" or ""the scorching sun."" Physical descriptions are jejune and often inserted into unmanageable sentences:""Her forehead was high, as were her lovely cheekbones, her nose straight yet flared, and her lips were rich.""""Sometimes, when she looked at her son, at his tallness, his strength, his beauty, she felt a jolt, a shock as she realized that she had him and that he was real and not just a vision.

The tone is flat and without a style. Aesthetics are absent--the author fails to convey the sensory component of writing--the power of choice words and the art of connecting them in vital and vigorous passages.The locale and subject matter of the novel enticed me--I love novels with an African geography and culture. But this book had no seasoning--just sentences sputtering with a dull thud. I thought it would have piquant passages depicting an exotic ambience. Instead, you get trumpeted exposition that prevents a mood from emerging and an atmosphere from ascending. No nuance, no style. There is an agenda here--to educate us about the disenfranchised culture of a marginalized community. It is as if he forgot he was writing a novel and began writing a polemical magazine article about the trials and tribulations of living in Arccra (capital of Ghana)--but there was no flair there. Even as a magazine article, it would flail. So many lost opportunities to create a rich atmosphere with a tasty blend of textures. But there is no sensory substance or strength to the prose. Sentences are hamstrung together with a fingerless hand.The story is diluted by the various loud pronouncements of Ghanian life. (Subtlety is absent.) What could have been charming was churning and dull. The author never leaves your side--and he doesn't trust us to get it unless he delivers it with hammer-blows and drives it on with re-treads. Tension was absent, suspense was suspended for lack of imagination. The novel isn't taut--it's trite and forced.The dialogue/banter between Darky Dawson and his colleagues is puerile and corny. Again, no texture--just banal bluster. This is the second book from the Vine shelf this month (that I have read) that was marketed improperly. It was described as ""crisp."" And ""great artistry."" Crisp? An English professor or competent editor would keel after seeing these unwieldy, soggy sentences. Apparently, editing wasn't a priority with this novel. Great artistry? Who is writing these blurbs? It was pallid, ready-made. It is written like a drugstore-shelf mystery--clichéd and hokey. Are publishers getting more cynical or just more desperate?The only positive strokes I can offer are to workshop it. This reads like an early draft. It needs several more to trim the fat and polish the prose. Although my  is blunt and brutal, it is honest. I see only 4 and 5-star s (so far) and I am puzzled--did they receive an improved manuscript? A later draft? I risk being highly unpopular with my solitary and excoriating criticism.

But if my superlatives start to stack, readers may disbelieve how bold and dazzling this novel really is! It is genre-busting, defies singular categorization. However, some characteristics are certain--postmodern, and somewhere on the continuum between anti-utopia and dystopia. It's a hard-boiled noir detective thriller in salty Chandleresque style that also intersects the child of Jung with the nephew of Nietzsche. Let's not stop here--throw in some Huxley and Orwell--but a lot of what I am describing is subsumed in themes and transcended in style, tone, and story. A pastiche. It would be detrimental to disclose almost anything about this novel--the wonder and adventure comes with reading it and discovering every street and corner of the city and the city through the prose.From the first page, you are transported from here--to there. You are steeped in the city (two cities, actually)--somewhere in the purlieu of Eastern Europe. The city of Beszel and the city of Ul Qoma--and, most importantly, the indecipherable place in-between. A strange murder occurs in Beszel and we are introduced to our main protagonist, Inspector Tyador Borlú of the Extreme Crime Squad. Instead of a routine investigation, it becomes the most dangerous and inexplicable crime he has ever encountered. The enigmatic history and the disturbing laws of both cities are revealed through the action of the story--the author jolts you into a new world without *telling* you--it is as if we already know. And, word by word, page by page, we become inundated. We leave our own world--the story is that convincing.Miéville occasionally expands and invents words; frequently, they are fused from a combination of two words, e.g. ""grosstopically."" The new word not only describes itself without overt explanation (you apprehend them within the context of the story), but it often staggers your mind by defining a new or existing concept that is unequivocally precise and at once comprehensible. It drills into your grey matter instantly--as if it has always been there. I was always saying ""ahhhhh"" to these new words that were immediately recognizable as limning the sphere of the cities--the ideology, politics, socioeconomics. They serve to deepen your experience of the story and immerse you in the geographical topography, as well as the psychological topography. Familiar words, such as ""breach"" and ""crosshatch,"" expand and shift into the more psychological regions of your mind. Their meanings intensify and become simultaneously opaque and transparent, masked and exposed. What is withheld moves into focus.The narrative is written with a fine balance of craft and artistry.

Although this novel is not as sprawling as The Hummingbird's Daughter, it is a lively and sensory mini-epic about the love of a village in Mexico and the chance of a dream that extends into America--into the beautiful North--and back.Nineteen-year old Nayeli shimmers and sways when she walks. She dreams of better things than working at the taco stand in Tres Camarones, the remote village of her birth in Sinaloa. Her father traded his family for a job in the US, ""Los Yunaites,"" years ago. Over time, the men have been disappearing from the village and migrating to Tijuana or even further into the U.S. And now bandidos are threatening to take over the unguarded town.Nayeli and her friends, as well as her Aunt Irma, who is running for mayor, hatch a plan after watching The Magnificent Seven at the local cinema, The Cine Pedro Infante. With the brio of Yul Brynner (who Irma insists is Mexican) and a determination to repopulate Tres Camaorones with men, they conceive a mission. Nayeli and her friends will find a way to sneak into the US illegally, find seven robust, strapping men, and bring them back to their village. Additionally, Nayeli intends to travel to Illinois, find her father, and convince him to come home.This novel embraces the exuberance of life and the love of Mexico with a witty, irreverent, and lyrically fluid narrative. All the prime characters are three-dimensional, authentic. Nayeli, with the strong brown calves and alluring, inscrutable smile; La Vampira, or Vampi, the only goth girl in Sinaloa; Yolo, the heady intellectual; and their lone male friend, Tacho--taco-master of The Fallen Hand. They are recruited to join Nayeli on her adventure North. The four friends experience dangerous adventure at the boisterous border in Tijuana and the pain and pleasure of growing up and shedding a few provincial feathers while they test their wings. Odd, ripe characters pepper the novel with their salty tongues, and a striking balance of ardor and menace keeps you off-balance and in suspense. Potent, enchanting, and sizzling like a tortilla in the sun; Into the Beautiful North will dance and delight you, seduce and entice you. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jun 06, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5970496-into-the-beautiful-north

Not since Philip Roth's early works have I read an author that strikes such a sharp equipoise of comedy and tragedyThis is a real fireball of a book. Not since Philip Roth's early works have I read an author that strikes such a sharp equipoise of comedy and tragedy. I had twenty different kinds of laughter while reading this--inward grins, hardy howls--even gasping intakes of breath, while simultaneously my heart was melting. The narrative zips along at roughly the speed of light, but the exquisite irony, megawatt metaphors and the urbane satire that saturate every page incited me to read it out loud. I was on a break at work when I started the novel. And I was so blown away by the images, the juxtapositions, the deadpan timing, and the heartbreaking hilarity that I pulled a friend outside and read the first two chapters out loud. We were captivated. And by the next break we had kidnapped another colleague so I could read it once again. By the end of the day I had read 100 pages to several co-workers while spontaneously acting out the scenes for our progressive amusement.Judd Foxman, the self-deprecating, slightly out-of-shape protagonist, is in marital purgatory--in-between marriage and divorce. His atheist father has just died after a suspect deathbed request--that his family sit shiva for him. In the Jewish religion, this means seven days of mourning. The story takes place primarily at the Foxman house over the course of the entire shiva, and the book is divided into the seven days of the week to cover each day. However, it is non-linear; told from Judd's point of view, the narrative goes back and forth in time with crystal clarity. The high points of Judd's childhood and those of his siblings are revealed gradually with a potency and power that informs the trajectory of the present-day events.The author is an elegantly economic writer--no wasted words, every sentence brimming with droll wit, and the timing is impeccable. I am tempted to quote him here, but I don't think that I would stop at just one. Or three. Or thirty. His sentences are more than just one-liners (although there is a plethora of them). They build unerringly on each other. The prose is visually and audibly robust, penetrating as well as cinematic.Jonathan Tropper wrote with a fierce, philosophical, and piercing pen about love and loss.

How to sift through and determine which are worthy? I have a teenage daughter and have read quite a few. Even when I thought I was impressed, there was always something nagging at me about them. I determined that many of the books had an outside or hidden agenda, which was to socialize parents according to a specific sheep-herding mentality. Often, a social consciousness or a reaction to a negative social consciousness about raising children informed these ""manuals."" In other words, the science behind the thinking was weak--they were often politically charged or reactionary.The blurbs about this book intrigued me, but I was also skeptical--until I read the first chapter on the inverse power of praise. Parents and guardians--just get ye to a bookstore and read the first chapter. I think you will be galvanized by its immediacy and logic (as well as back-up data) and it will inspire you to continue. It all clicked when I read about our praise-junkie tendencies, and how it has a paradoxical effect. The authors never condescend to us; they maintain that all of us want to make the best and most informed decisions. For instance, most of us start telling our babies, from the cradle ""You are so smart"" as almost a mantra of parenting. The authors do not criticize positive praise--they are revealing the data for specific types of praise. Telling a kid he or she is smart rather than specifically praising them for their efforts will eventually backfire. The child will have a tendency to not put out a lot of effort when they are challenged because they are stymied by the feeling that they have to stay smart, or that they must be NOT smart if they can't solve a problem or puzzle. Telling a kid (s)he is smart is praising an innate feature that is out of the child's control. Praising them for each genuine effort (whether they solved a problem or not) will have a better outcome. I cannot convey to readers the way that these authors channel and support this information--the statistical data and the entire beautiful logic of it--you must read it for yourselves.The chapter on race relations also woke me out of a deep slumber of complacency. Too often, parents try to teach their kids equality just by placing them in diverse environments or showing them videos of multicultural friendships and cooperation. The book explicated a longitudinal study done by Dr. Bigler in Austin, Texas that revealed the lack of actual parent/child discussion on racial equality. That is the key ingredient to integration. Silence is not golden--(silence is black and white, and never the twain shall meet)--it is the wrong kind of colorblind. Just read this chapter and it will open your eyes.Each section is such a wake-up call to parenting that I found myself reflecting on the blind spots in my own methods--not in an immolating way, but rather in an ""aha!"" manner. It isn't guesswork or just someone's opinion. The longitudinal studies, ongoing tests, data compilation, and control studies are explicit. But, more than that, you will feel a light bulb go off--it is seriously the most intrepid book I have ever read on parenting. No exaggeration. I can apply the book's information to my own parenting experiences and trials and realize how on the mark these studies are.There is a chapter on sleep--its bearing and consequences on child performance, on obesity, and on mood. This section alone is worth the price of the book. I learned which parts of the sleep cycle are integral to the storage of which information. They describe the parts of the brain being affected when information is received and when sleep is disrupted. But, more importantly, the authors lay out the pitfalls of losing just 15 minutes or an hour of sleep--so many teenage problems are associated with this that some trailblazing schools are finally arranging the hours of education based on these studies. But more schools need this call to action. And we need to encourage a positive sleep pattern with our children. I know this sounds de rigueur and obvious. But this chapter on sleep is way more comprehensive than anything I have read before, and profound. Almost everything in the quality of your children's lives depends on it.One of my favorite sections was the one that is like a riptide into everything you thought you knew about your child's language acquisition. Baby Einstein? Fuhgettaboutit. And don't try teaching your children a foreign language by popping in a Spanish DVD and parking them in front of the TV. Not going to happen. As a matter of fact, it will have a deleterious effect. A child needs a ""live"" person to learn. Additionally, it is the call and response between parent and baby that is the key to increasing their vocabulary and comprehension. Baby Einstein videos are like disembodied voices that do absolutely zip for their education. Sesame Street in Spanish is just as ineffective. Please read the chapter--the whole controversy is revealed when the studies proved that these baby videos are empty and hollow forms of education.Perhaps my personal favorite is the chapter on teen rebellion. I recognize the arguing and lying of children in a whole new way now. How and why children cultivate what we think of as egregious behaviors usually stems from a psychologically astute and desirable place in their hearts and growth. It is the same with arguing. We need to shed our preconceptions and outmoded concerns about teen compliance, obedience, and integrity and understand the necessary steps in their development. There is a paradox about child/teen lying--it is expected, but it still must be dealt with.And there is more--sibling rivalry, IQ testing, testing for elite schools at an early age, self-control, and playing well with others are covered immaculately.Yes, it will blow the lid off, turn upside down just about everything previously advocated in parenting books. But not in a confounding way. That is an important ingredient to consider. This book, the way I perceive it, is not intended to upset or horrify you or derail your parenting experience. (Although, by its very nature it does derail previous long-held concepts, but in a compassionate way.) As a matter of fact, it provided clarity into numerous bogus concepts and the pious conditioning that we have been hanging onto for years. Additionally, it offers specific practices and interventions that can be measured rather swiftly in your own home with these changes to your personal parenting skills. As much as this book ""shocks,"" it is not intimidating or finger-pointing at parents (although it does point a finger into disingenuous studies). The accessible and engaging flow of narrative is dotted with levity, lightness, and always benevolence. I read this book in just a few sittings and I retained the information well. It is easy to go back and reference what you read, as the chapters are laid out in an explicit, user-friendly manner.Slide your other parenting books to the side of the shelf and place this one squarely in the middle.

It is irresponsible to tell you much more than that, because this book hinges on the reader's simultaneous suspicion and disarmament at every twist and turn. Much of the book is necessarily circumspect, which made me feel distant and dislocated during the first 2/3 of the story. And although a lot of it takes place in wide open, (and often) desolate places, I felt a contraction of space and time, and a reader's claustrophobia. The narrative edges collapsed into a flat darkness, and I frequently wondered where I am, where this is going. But an ominous atmosphere of mendacity and a disjointed, shadowy sense of the sinister pervaded.Alternating chapters distinguish the storylines. In the opening pages, we encounter a disturbing and unusual scene of vague, escaped violence and torment, as Ryan and his father are headed to the hospital. In the next chapter, we are introduced to recent high-school graduate Lucy and her lover, George, who was her twelfth-grade history teacher. They are headed toward a new life, far away from where they were teacher and student. Subsequently, we join Miles, a lonely man obsessed with the disappearance of his twin brother. These disparate narratives continue to alternately build with greater complexity and with mounting tension. All will be revealed by the closing pages, although the journey there is often ambiguous. I often felt restive and off-kilter while turning the pages, anxious for the story to become more transparent. I suspect that this was the author's intent, as these holes in our comprehension actually add weight and dimension to the story by giving it greater immediacy and urgency. Our participation as a reader is paramount to the theme of the story. I don't want to explain too much more, because I do not want to dilute the reader's tension and uncertainty. What I can say is that the question of identity, in its many guises, is the thing we are chasing, while it chases us.Dan Chaon delivers this dark and dire tale with a cagey cachet.

The focus is tighter than usual, ultimately concentrating on Doc Sportello and his comically dangerous adventures as a PI in LA. The narrative flow favors cinematic appeal, also--there is an essentially linear progression of a noirish detective story. Moreover, it is an exhilarating homage to the sixties. There is enough pot smoking and acid dropping to leave traces on the reader's fingers as the pages turn. There's surf to roar in your ears; babes and bikinis and beaches; bad guys and moral ambiguity; greed and dirty money; and a savior or two. I don't read Pynchon for the plots, but Inherent Vice actually has a fairly strong one, a main one, that keeps you guessing.If you haven't yet plunged into Pynchon, this isn't a bad place to start. It's a jubilant paean to sex, drugs, surfing, and rock 'n roll. A stoner's tribute.

As the novel opens, he is placing the ashes of his dead father (9 months in the urn now) in the wheel well of his car, (they have been in the trunk) intending to scatter them in Cape Cod. He is meeting his wife and daughter there for the wedding of his daughter's best friend. During this time, the lacunae of memory begin to break free and combat with the credo and convictions of his consciousness and close orbit. The bittersweet reminiscence of family vacations on the Cape with his parents and the tart taste of the ""Truro Accord"" he made with his wife on their honeymoon over three decades ago provide the propellant fuel for this story of late middle-age angst and awakening.Russo navigates the banks of this novel with a constrained and firm hand on the tiller, with not too much wind in the sails and with a decidedly inner-directed course. And he seamlessly flows from the sober and contemplative to an uproarious physical comedy, placing him in the same league as Bellow, Roth, and Irving, with a laconic protagonist possessing tragically comic (or comically tragic) inner demons. Griffin's inability to complete a short story that he started years ago, for example, opens a chasm to a dark abyss that plagues him up and down Route 6 through the Cape, through the story. A rehearsal dinner for another wedding is headed for an imbroglio when a wheelchair ramp does the unexpected.Russo triumphs when he concentrates on Griffin, a thoroughly three-dimensional character whose perceptions and failings and desires are authentic and prismatic. It is Griffin's character that illuminates his parents' and underscores the pathos of his wife, Joy. When other characters are seen through Griffin's emotional turbulence, they are interesting and affecting. However, when given their own free rein, they tend to flatten, lose their luminescence. A few characters even come across as red herrings. You need to come to your own conclusions about this canvas of characters--I don't want to ruin anyone's reading pleasure by diagramming every character or their worthiness to the story and its themes. These complaints of mine do prevent me from considering this novel flawless, but the story nonetheless has a resounding quality, with writing as smooth as sea glass and as craggy as the Cape coastline.I grew up not terribly far from the Cape, and Russo brought back the magic of my own family vacations--crossing the Sagamore Bridge; eating oysters in Wellfleet; the cathedral spires in Truro; the moss, grey, blue of the ocean; and running up and down the sand dunes in Ptown--the dunes speckled with bleached green grass under a pale, hot sun.As an addendum, I recommend this novel for the over-40 or 45.

In the mountains of rural Japan, in 1954, Satomi lives with her mother, Akiko, who runs a pub, or *izakaya.* Satomi has sufficient talent to enter piano competitions and subsequently goes to college on a music scholarship; however, she struggles in her search for an authentic life. Her independence is nearly thwarted at various times by her cruel stepsisters and her penury. Additionally, a man she started a platonic but deep relationship with abruptly leaves to join a Buddhist monastery. She goes to Paris to study Western classical music and meets an enigmatic American man, Timothy. When Timothy mysteriously disappears, she has to make some bold decisions about her future.The story then moves forward to the 1980's, San Francisco, and we are introduced to Satomi's daughter, Rumi. Now motherless--Satomi left her and her father when she was a baby--Rumi and her American father collect, sell and trade rare Asian artifacts. Rumi possesses a mystical talent: these artifacts ""speak"" to her in vibratory ways. Rumi believes that this talent is inexplicably bound to the hidden facts of her mother--and her mother's disappearance. This leads her to Japan, on a physical and spiritual journey to search and find the answers to her identity.In non-linear narrative, the story weaves both Satomi and Rumi's lives together. The ethereal quality of the prose is often dreamlike and sensuous, and the author educates the reader well about the culture of rural Japan--the food; the religions; and material and spiritual aspects of Japanese life.As the tale unfolds, however, the story loses its stride. The rich and promising beginning wobbles and wanes, and the story weakens in its intensity and focus. The secondary characters are generally thin, dotting the landscape of the novel in order to support the story of Rumi and Satomi, but otherwise not very interesting. Therefore, when characters from the 50's appear in the latter part of the story, they don't reverberate. By the end of the book, I felt that I was reading a tract on cultural anthropology. The information that the story imbibes is often fascinating, but the tale flattens . I have witnessed this before with first-time novelists, where the tone is inconsistent and the prose becomes too expository. Mockett is learned in her subject and gives us a portrait of Japanese culture, but there isn't enough *story* in this adventure. Or, rather, the story loses amplitude.

Readers unfamiliar with Irving may not be impressed--they will have a lot more to complain about. So don't start here if you are largely uninitiated with this author. Begin with his fourth book, the tour de force, The World According to Garp (Modern Library) or his masterpiece, A Prayer for Owen Meany (Modern Library). And then work your way through his oeuvre. The more Irving you have read, the more poignant and personally enriching is the symbolism and recurrent themes of this lugubrious tale; you will be less distracted by his prolixity.The opening epigraph is from Bob Dylan's ""Tangled Up in Blue:""I had a job in the great north woodsWorking as a cook for a spellBut I never did like it all that muchAnd one day the ax just fell.I credit this stanza, as well as a sizable chunk of the song, as informing the story. After I read the last page of this novel, the lyrics from Dylan's song floated back to me. Although not a direct transposition (not at all), you could lift a considerable portion of that song, shake it up Irving style, and see them rising in the novel. And as Dylan stated (regarding this song), ""You've got yesterday, today and tomorrow all in the same room, and there's very little you can't imagine not happening.'"" Irving's non-linear narrative mirrors that statement. A fifty-year period (1950's to 2005) is covered, but it ebbs and flows non-sequentially within each section. (Sometimes on the same page.) And the unimaginable takes shape.I come from the veteran enthusiast's point of view. The familiar chords and refrains abound--bears; tragic accidents; his love affair with the semi-colon; fathers and sons; absent parents; odd couplings; hands; furry creatures; and working class cultures (that's just a start). Critical analysis aside, I was emotionally riveted by this story. My experience of loving this book went beyond the novel itself--I embraced the connection to his oeuvre. It is a river that flows into the sea. Although it is a tremendous story, it can't be entirely perceived in isolation. I frequently uttered, ""Here we go"" as my heart stopped, slowed, sped up, froze, and slammed into the channels of my soul. And like a river's flow, this epic journey expresses what is always changing, always the same with Irving's literature.For seasoned Irving readers, the vintage ribald humor will be noticeably tempered; his farce is minimized, and the story is less picaresque than usual, more mournful. He is still the master of telling a tragic event with bawdy details, but there is less rogue here, more lament. There are outlaw characters, but the rebel prose is not as evident. New readers may even describe it as cloying and overwritten. It should have bothered me, but the story overrode my criticism. He gets in the way of himself while inserting himself--but eventually he moves over again and gets out of the way to let his characters exhale.Never have I read so much Irving in Irving (or Irving on Irving); he would either diverge from Danny the writer into Irving-as-writer (while vehemently denying the memoirist aspects of fiction writing), or overshadow the narrative with proclamations, expository writing that felt like Irving apologia for Irving. And yet, these indulgences did not impair my absorption. They were more like narrator-as-Irving bursting through that fourth wall for something peevish to declare and then pulling back. The story is juicy and plump; the haunting beauty is stunning. The twisted narrative flows and echoes from his previous works and courses and tangles through and loops out like a billabong from the body of Irving--that remains interconnected to, but also separate from the arteries of his oeuvre.The characters are familiar but original--colorful anti-heroes with more than a touch of moral ambiguity, emblematic of past characters, but ripe and fresh. The taciturn cook, Dominic Baciapalugo, is restrained and reflective, while his blustering best friend, Ketchum, is strident and outrageous. They both deeply love and try to protect the cook's son, Danny, from the secrets that torment them. The women, for the most part, are big and briny and dimensional. Very few characters are mere conveniences--they are memorable and succulent and keep the story flowing.I experienced this novel as if it were alive. I could not put it down, and it moved me to tears. The narrative has shortcomings and needs editing, and, again, I think that readers new to Irving are going to find salient complaints and miss the meritorious connections. Understandable. This  may seem bewildering and inconsistent with my five-star assignation, but the humanity of this literature is a bent tree with many branches, and a twisted river.

Although recognized at one time for a few brilliant poems, he has waned from the public eye. He is given the opportunity to resurrect his name and his bank account by writing an introduction to an anthology of poems, but he dawdles and delays the project. Paul spends his days reflecting on his career; the recent departure of his girlfriend, Roz (who left him due to his dilatory ways); the need to organize his office; his neighbors; and the mundane. He provides a stunning and critical analysis of select poetry and other poets, but continually fails to write his introduction. He waxes whimsically on the suicides of depressed poets, such as Sarah Teasdale and Vachal Lindsay, and vilifies Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot for their antisemitism. He makes a tidy space near his pillow for the poetry of Mary Oliver, who he cherishes.To rhyme or not to rhyme? He probes and ponders the fine points of meter and the minutiae of quotidian distractions, and continually obstructs his own forward momentum. He resorts to lengthy rambling and self-flagellation, yet his constant need for approval is disarming. This story is narrated like a memoir written by a rueful humorist teaching us the power of verse. It is a droll and touching examination of a consummate lyric scholar who happens to be a stubborn boondoggler.I came away from this book with a renewed vigor and love for verse. Through Paul's extolling of meter and rhyme, his preoccupation with the definition of iambic pentameter, and the virtues of almost every aspect of verse, I received a revitalized education on the art and aesthetics of poetry. He contemplates the meaning of various poems without dislodging the reader's own sense of discovery. He leads you to the brink, but you get the satisfaction of plumbing the poignancy with him. It never comes off as pompous. His fertile eloquence, as he shares his shuddering love of the immediacy of Elizabeth Bishop's poem, ""The Fish,"" left me breathless and aroused--a poem that never had any particular effect on me before.Baker's protagonist expounds on what Horace really meant by ""carpe diem."" That sentiment, according to Paul, has been misinterpreted for years, yet the veneration of those two words and its permanence in our culture is dependent on its very misconception. That notable paradox, and the fecundity of Bishop's poem, typify the fetching delight of this novel. The Anthologist is brimming with poetic enchantment. The loitering, melancholy journey of Paul Chowder and his sublime salvation through meter and verse is smart, beguiling, and tenderly irresistible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Oct 26, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6364068-the-anthologist

Tim Farnsworth, a successful, accomplished attorney, has an affliction that intermittently overtakes him. He walks and walks and walks interminably, with no regard to inclement weather or safety hazards. It may be hours, days, or even weeks before he calls his wife, Jane, from a remote location to ""pick me up."" In the meantime, Jane and their daughter, Becka, live in constant fear when he disappears. Tim has been to every specialty MD and research scientist imaginable around the globe in order to diagnose and treat this illness. However, it remains a mystery. As his illness protracts, it strains the family's coping mechanisms, challenges the binding love, and threatens to unravel them.This could have been a spellbinding book. Tim's enigmatic illness is an inventive metaphor for any mighty stressor that can bewilder and impale a marriage. Ferris also uses it to explore the differentiation between mind and body and examine the breaking point of the human spirit. He brings alcoholism into the narrative, which is a clever analogy to the walking illness, as it raises many of the same questions, i.e., is it controllable? Can you conquer it with will--mind over body? Or does the body overtake the mind? These issues were implicit in the novel, but meagerly addressed.Too much narrative is spent on the grinding details of each walking episode and the frustrated search for a cure. Even the family interventions become repetitive after so many attempts. I was slogging through tedious, overwritten, and bloated iterations that descended into melodrama. And Ferris' use of stream-of-consciousness to illustrate Tim's intervals of incoherence was laced with awkward parody. The third person and very detached point of view was precarious to begin with; it eventually declined into one despairing note. Additionally, he threw in some red herrings and manipulated the reader around some close curves that abruptly or insincerely dissolved.There was so much potential here. I recognize the brilliant symbolism and the harrowing forces that encumber this family. Ferris is an adroit writer, in that he pens masterful metaphors and riveting ideas. But the narrative pounded like a sledgehammer of Tim's misadventures and devolved into a mere sketch of the family. He should have trimmed these episodes and concentrated on penetrating Becka and Jane; instead, he reverts to informational prose, telegraphing what happens and reporting on how Becka and Jane feel. The sequence of events is communicated through dry and hurried exposition as the climax approaches. It does not sustain, even if his purpose was to heighten the poignancy of Tim's absenteeism from his family. We are swallowed in Tim's illness without the balance of inner dialogue and animated experiences of Jane and Becka (which was present at the beginning of the novel but shifted into the illusory). We dryly observed rather than experienced. The climax was colorless and lost luster in the shadows of stream-of-consciousness. The story became sludgy and stultifying.I appreciate that Ferris experiments with different styles of writing and isn't stuck on one approach. I thoroughly enjoyed his first novel, Then We Came to the End, which was a socio-comic send-up of an ad agency in its final days. But The Unnamed was undisciplined and self-conscious. I encountered authorial autism and self-indulgence and I checked out emotionally way before I came to the end of this novel. This was a heartbreaking family, but the narrative style was unbearably numbing and prevented my surrender to the story. The execution undermined its purpose and thwarted its brittle beauty. ...more",Notes are private!,2,4,1,not set,"Oct 26, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6422678-the-unnamed

If (as I imagine) you have read countless novels on murder cases, you may wince at the immodest and implausible coincidences (even for a small town!) that occur. You will embrace the noir, Arctic atmosphere of Finland during its most glacial and darkest time of year, known as Kaamos, or polar night (as cold as -40 degrees). The lean, sinewy prose will hook you in immediately. But will that be enough to sustain a veteran private-eye reader? Probably not. The climax is a bit overwrought and will cast a long, thin shadow over the landscape of this book. However, you will appreciate the solid, rich forensics as well as the ever-engaging Inspector Kari Vaara and his American wife, Kate. Their relationship draws you in, and the residents of this provincial Finnish town are vivid and stark and chillingly felt. But the payoff for a crime-novel enthusiast may inspire a few dreaded eye-rolls.So why the four-stars? Because, although I do love an intrepid, byzantine murder mystery (and would have given it five stars if this were more the case here), I am even more devoted to a scintillating, character-driven story where the prose sparkles like stars in an inky sky and falls like accumulating snowflakes. In short, James Thomson delivers a haunting, icy tale of a fascinating, bleak population largely unfamiliar to most North Americans. He writes with empathy and wit, and with a fresh, clear, effortlessly engaging style. He penned a moving profile of the inhabitants north of the Arctic Circle and a story of their inner lives, as well as the reverberation of a shameful tragedy on their customary isolation and repression.The Finnish culture and environment is lucidly characterized--the language, topography, relationships, and sociological underpinnings. The reader becomes educated into the silent, bottled-up nature of the townspeople and the heavy toll--religious, political, and personal--that the murder and mutilation of a beautiful Somalian actress bequeaths. Much of the population is alcoholic, due to the seasonal darkness, the bitter temperatures, and the attendant isolation. This is certainly true of the hinterlands of Vaara's jurisdiction. The confined community is under the influence of either the strict, almost medieval manifestation of the Laestadian church or the allure of its many bars. The suppressed racial and sexual tensions drive the story further forward while class and ethnic distinctions hover. Thomson does this organically, without ever pontificating. The writing stays lustrous with an economy of words that create sharp, striking images. Additionally, the private history and agonies of Inspector Vaara are sensitively and smartly portrayed by Thomson.I am equally fascinated by the biography of this American-born author. Raised in Kentucky, he studied and is fluent in both Finnish and Swedish, and he has actually lived in Finland for the past decade. He has forged a colorful life with many professions, including (but not limited to) photographer, bartender, bouncer, and soldier. It is evident from his narrative that he has an intimate grasp of the convoluted and insular complexion of this region. I was also piqued by the attendant struggles of Kate and her difficulty acclimating to this culture and climate. This added a frothy antagonism to the story.This is the first in a series of crime novels featuring Inspector Vaara, and I am confident that the seemingly preposterous coincidences are confined to this debut. I suspect that the agenda here was to introduce Kari and Kate, to add subtext to the terrain, and to heighten the admixture of the Inspector's personal biography with the behavior and mores of the people he routinely investigates. Like Peter Hoeg's Smilla's Sense of Snow and Karin Fossum's The Water's Edge and The Indian Bride (Inspector Sejer Mysteries), this murder mystery is a thrilling vehicle but not an end in itself. The deeper exploration is of individuals and societies--how a harrowing murder affects a socially parochial, Arctic town, and how its citizens operate in these frigid, insular conditions. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Dec 07, 2009","Feb 26, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6978614-snow-angels

Although it is considered a mystery, it is much much more than that. It is a story of identity in all its literal and metaphorical forms. It is a social commentary (but never sententious) and it is also about fear and flight and love.Cassie Maddox and Sam O'Neill are detectives from In the Woods. Although Operation Vestal (from In the Woods) is mentioned several times, these books can be read in any sequence without ruining it for the reader. The setting is again Dublin, Ireland.Cassie is the star attraction of this story as she goes undercover to live with four liberal arts doctoral candidates whose housemate, Lexie Madison, is found dead from a stabbing in an abandoned cottage. Lexie Madison looks exactly like Cassie, and the name is her last undercover alias, which adds to the mystery. The housemates will be told that she survived the stabbing.It isn't necessary to give too many plot details. What is more important is the response from reading. This is a generous, gorgeous, thoughtful, poetic story. The tone is almost elegiac at times, especially during her descriptive paragraphs, and the author's use of the extended metaphor is prolific and often profound. At the end of the novel, I looked up hawthorn (the tree, flower, bush) on Wikipedia and had a chill run up and down my spine. Her descriptions, turns of phrase, elegant passages and graceful unfolding keep me fastened and fascinated. What I love about Tana French is that her novels are both character-driven AND plot-driven. She does not sacrifice one for the other. With most mysteries, I only read them once. But The Likeness can be read again just for the aesthetics. Also, there is no deus ex machina here.

She has that gift to appeal to a variety of readers-- even readers who look for largely escape mysteries. But this is not escape reading; it is the kind of reading that makes you ponder. It is philosophical and it echoes.

Language, imagery, poetry, sensuality, metaphor, emotional density, visceral fear--that is how the story is revealed. This isn't exposition and a lot of declarative sentences. It is not formula. It performs a vivisection on genre. As much as it is a mystery of the present murder of a young girl and an unsolved past mystery of the main protagonist's boyhood (he is now a detective who as a young boy survived a violent attack on himself and two friends, who were never found), it is much, much more. The story is allegory. It is about the enigmatic quality of relationships, the complicated enmeshments glued by dysfunction, the underbelly of fear that keeps people from leading full lives, and the question of survival in a life of elliptical events.Detectives Cassie and Adam were characters that haunted me around the clock, even when I was not reading the book. The characterizations were meticulous. The inner dialogue was fresh with deep, psychological insights, and the minor characters were not drawn for convenience or contrivance, either. Not one character seemed cardboard. The book was unputdownable; the story was a generous mix of harrowing and romantic and wry and witty and dramatic and tragic. I might even consider the word epic as an apt description. And it was this epic quality that makes it stand apart from your prosaic thrillers that flood the marketplace.This is not Stephen King. It is way too literary, layered, full of allusion, and linguistically lush. The author makes it both accessible to the reader while also challenging the senses. She has a grasp of comic timing and dramatic irony. She loves her characters. It is evident in every beautiful sentence that Tana French writes. She did not use a cookie cutter to write this. This came from the marrow of her bones, the center of her heart. The unfolding of the story never feels forced or artificial.If you are looking for a dues ex machina, or if you are inflexible about having all your ducks in a row, then this is not a novel for you. I was initially frustrated at the close of the novel because all the answers were not forthcoming. But as I chewed on it for a night and a day, I realized that my reaction is also a part of the story. I do not want to reveal too much, but the ers who criticized the author for essentially cheating them out of a certain kind of ending remind me of the characters in the story also working out their personal demons through this mystery. I do believe that the author slyly and discreetly puts the reader right there in that Irish berg. It forces the reader to reflect on personal issues concerning resolution.I am one of the characters by the time it is over--I am part of the town.It is plausible, also, that Tana French could bring back Cassie, Adam, Sam, and several other characters in a future book.

Teresa (Teresita) Urrea, the Hummingbird's daughter, possessed me, made me want to dig my bare feet in the earth and rub rose petals and lavender all over my body. She is now my beloved hero of contemporary literature. Strong, courageous, formidable, guileless, beautifully vulnerable, compassionate, quick-witted, and luminescent, Teresa is a modern-day *saint* without the dismal, pious sobriety of one. She is more like a noble iconoclast. She hikes up her skirts and rides a horse better than any man, eats like a lumberjack, and engages in astral projection. She denounces organized religion and behaves more like a pantheist. She can heal with her hands, bandy words with politicians, and flirt with the infamous.The author based this work of fiction on real events in the life of an eponymous blood relation, circa 1880 (when the story also takes pace). He spent 20 years in the research and writing, which is evident in the stirring, complex, yet easily digestible, mouth-watering narration of this novel.Teresa is the illegitimate daughter of wealthy (and married) south-of-the-border rancher Don Tomas and a fourteen year-old peasant Indian woman who fled Sinaloa for greener pastures. Raised initially by her mean-spirited aunt, her adventurous spirit eventually delivers her to the house of her father at a tender, young age. The protective, flinty Huila, a medicine woman who works for Don Tomas, apprehends Teresa's destiny and mentors her in the art and botanical science of healing. Huila is also aware that Teresa has a native and inherited shamanic talent way beyond midwifery and organic medicine.Filled with a sprawling and vivid cast of characters--vaqueros, caballeros, Indians, pilgrims,politicians, the wealthy as well as the indigent, apostates as well as the devout, this is a colorful, astutely comical allegory that is ripe with thought, action, and spirit. It is a story of familial love and redemption and the vastness of the soul. It is a tale of adventure that you won't want to end. (Rumor has it that a sequel and a film is in the works.)Luis Alberto Urrea is an exuberant storyteller oozing an alchemical mixture of warmth, humor, satire, and vigorous vitality. His style is a reminiscent witch's brew of the best of outlaw and magical realism--The Milagro Beanfield War; Lonesome Dove; a dose of Garcia-Marquez; a glittering sprinkle of Isabelle Allende.

These were men and women of all ages and backgrounds. However, this entire novel was written in one note, one cloying voice. If the author hadn't pointed out the name of the character that was speaking, I would not have known. The voice of the middle-aged black man was identical to the young teenage Chinese-American girl. Shrink-wrapped and indistinguishable. Neither the gravity of their situation or their personal torments came through with pivotal urgency or genuine force. The emotions were saccharine and their stories were manufactured and bromidic. It wasn't seamlessly stitched and powerful; it was synthetic and obtuse. The pat narrative was hurried and grossly sing-song, dissolving anger, bitterness and sorrow into formulary warmth. The tone was so confectionary that it cooed falsetto. The fabric of this intended quilt of stories felt like polyester. Moreover, the author ended a lot of the reflective/interior dialogue with exclamation marks. !!!!!!!! Trite outpourings!!!!

Ashvin dies and James survives. Ashvin's sister, Armeina (Meina), hooks up with James in shared grief to forge a tentative but tender friendship. This is their story.There is a lot of potential in this plaintive novel of redemption. It has heart, and it murmurs. It doesn't quite sing, though. The story is narrated largely through Meina, with a few sections by James and other characters. The primary problem is that the author didn't adequately distinguish the separate voices of James and Meina--they are too similar. Even the cadence is synonymous, which you wouldn't expect from two people from separate countries and disparate backgrounds. Meina was raised in an educated home, by intellectual parents, and witnessed their terrifying, horrifying massacre at the hands of the Ethiopians during civil war strife. James was reared by the horrors and betrayals of his family and neighborhood. The lack of narrative distinction distracted and removed me from the immediacy of the story and conferred an unnatural tenor.The book was described as tautly constructed, written with a controlled rage. I disagree. Rather, the voices were a bit precious and lacking in the subtext necessary for the reader to register the contained rage. There was restraint, but it was unintentional. The wattage was dimmed by authorial trepidation, as if Akinti was unsure of asserting the fury of his characters. This created a languid tone and lack of muscle in the prose delivery. It felt like he was playing it safe to ensure that we connected with and liked the characters. I would have preferred that he liberate himself from that self-conscious mode and get out of his own way.Interestingly, his graphic scenes are very well done, crafted with menacing weight. They were not gratuitous. On the contrary, they exploded with tormenting finesse, like a coiled thunder. It permeated the prosaic air with a crackling heat. The violence that the Somalians endured during more than dozen civil wars is heartbreaking. And the devestrating terrors perpetrated on the youth in this London neighborhood are merciless and harrowing.If this debut novel went through a few more drafts, it could be a dazzling, evocative story, as Akinti's talent is evident.

Every two years, a new orphan is sent as a ""practice baby"" for a half-dozen female students. Not only do they practice mothering, but they also learn to fix kitchen equipment, remove stains, balance a budget, and manage a household. Ironically, the program is a subversive defender of women with ambition. They learn chemistry, physics, economics, and engineering, among other challenging subjects.

She relaxes her rigid routine and secretly champions Dr. Spock's touchy-feely approach. And, in a surprising twist of fate, Henry becomes the first and only baby to stay and be raised at the practice house, with Martha as the primary caregiver and a succession of women vying for his love and attention. Conversely, Henry thrives on their adoration, and learns guile and charm early in his life, endearing himself to his many ""mothers."" He doesn't attach himself to the ultra-needy Martha, or any specific caregiver or peer. He learns to manipulate and gain power by extracting differentially from each ""mother"" and later uses similar techniques with children his age. However, at nursery school he meets Mary Ann, a beautiful little girl that becomes a constant, although interrupted, presence in his life.If you have been schooled in attachment theory, you know that the first few years of a baby's life are critical. That is the time when a baby needs to develop a primary relationship. If this is disrupted, like in the case of the Wilton practice baby method, the baby may form maladaptive behaviors and fail to develop healthy attachments. In Henry's case, he consistently keeps everyone at arm's length. As he matures, he is filled with rage at his parents' desertion and is unable to love or affectionately bond with Martha or anyone else.Henry is prepossessing, yet affable, and women are naturally drawn to him--his long, lean, angular body, soft full lips, and striking green eyes. Yet, he all but sucks the spirit out of women who get involved with him. He objectifies them and accumulates them with an uncanny indifference, seemingly without any dents to his hard shell or damage to his psychic wall. He closed up that opening years ago, as a toddler. He is intermittently cruel to Mary Ann and supercilious towards Martha. Ironically, he becomes an ""in-between"" animator by profession. The novel examines Henry's journey to find his heart and to feel it beating. The key is for Henry to find a source that leads to a towering self-reflection.Grunwald's buoyant prose is as bewitching as Henry. Clear and crisp, it glides effortlessly, ripe with terse paradoxes, engaging us with radiant characters. The author's ingenious insights into human behavior and her ability to keep the reader off-balance but fastened to the story is truly inspired. She captures the atmosphere of the times, as we move from poodle skirts to mini-skirts, and from Howdy Doody to Hair. I have not read another novel that captures the liminal time and essence of attachment theory with such clarity and imagination.The author's premise for this story was stirred by research into an actual ""practice baby"" house that was part of a Cornell University home economics program from 1919-1969. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 11, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6706812-the-irresistible-henry-house

The story contemplates the nucleus of art, the essence of beauty, and the inestimable measure of loss.

This novel, while still a loosely constructed story with main characters and a forward progression, is primarily a meditation on the eternal forces of the human condition entwined with the timeless elements of the earth. The poetic narrative is like an instrument hovering above the earth's atmosphere and producing a lyric and a music of everything that is nascent to life, as well as everything that withstands it, crushes it, beholds it--and it is this instrument that carries the memory of love, light, space, and grief. The bones of the story are the ashes of the earth, and the compost of the earth imbue the bones of the story.On this poignant first page is written ""Grief is desire in its purest distillation."" I did not initially comprehend this and thought it was a pithy but obtuse statement. However, as I continued to read, it evolved into a meaningful, trenchant theme that coursed through every facet of the novel. Like many of the seemingly elusive cogitations contained in this book, it leads to a profound examination of human nature. Every tragedy in the book is borne from desire, and every desire has a lasting relationship with grief.Avery is a young and able engineer, the son of a deceased but once preeminent engineer, who passionately wants to preserve and continue his father's great legacy. In 1964, Avery is charged with heading an operation in Egypt to remove an ancient temple in embedded rock and placing it on higher ground. In order to do this, they must build a cofferdam, which will displace and flood water temporarily into the water of the adjoining village. The removal of the relics of the temple is an exacting process. One millimeter off in measurement and the relics can be ruined, cracked beyond redemption.This project requires that the Nubian villagers be moved from their homes--these indigenous people who have a deep and native history with this place--and displaced to a new location. Avery's wife, Jean, a botanist who loves to carry seeds from the places of the dead to new ground, and who reveres the natural world, is disquieted by the project, but supportive of her husband's philosophy of man and machinery working together to lofty purposes. But, when personal tragedy and a glitch in the project gouges the foundation of their bond, their ability to find solace with each other is shattered and they must journey alone to find each other again.I am not a scholar who can deconstruct this novel into all its meanings, only a reader who engaged with this enigmatic story. I may have failed to assemble or pinpoint or break it down for a potential reader reading this . What I can tell you is that this is an atypical story written in poetical prose. It is not a pretentious rambling or unfathomable masquerade. You must pay attention and let it wash over you, read it slowly or read it out loud (I found myself doing this at intervals), surrender to the indefinite and its mien. At some point, you will abdicate need and expectation and just succumb to it. I have not read another novel that examines grief with such awakening, and that finds such incipient stems of rebirth in human suffering, all by combining and enfolding the essence of humans, nature, and machinery into folds of memory. Once you capitulate to its montage, it assembles into the most breathtaking convocation of gestures--gestures that encompass everything, and cascade like the butterfly effect....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 22, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4682252-the-winter-vault

This is a glittering exampleThere are a few prized novels in memory that ransacked me raw and bare while simultaneously enveloping me whole and full. This is a glittering example of one, a slow burn of a book that ignites slowly, gradually, like kindling around a giant bole. For the first half of the book, I admit, I wasn't seduced. I wasn't taken or thrown or fiercely engaged. For approximately 200 pages I held on ambivalently. Even my reader's body language was telling--the pages at arm's length, the angle of my body twisted away from the book. I was impatient for a gainful lift-off. I was poised to relinquish it for another. I needed a release, a cry, a laugh, a scream of my own.But there were embers flaring below the text. I trusted in the story's elemental power, despite my lack of commitment, even though I wasn't yet appreciably moved. I respected its lean, stark, clean, atmospheric prose, and the elegant construction, but I didn't know if it was gathering momentum or dust. Was the story going to progress in one plaintive note? Fortunately, I stayed with it, because once it does reach that point of critical mass (about halfway, give or take several dozen pages), it sears you with its ferocity. The narrative tension accelerates; the symbols and motifs are in full bloom; and the raw power of this epic story is manifest.THE SURRENDERED is now a treasured book for me. And, although it is austere--OK, bleak--it is not relentlessly dreary as a reading experience. There is an exciting current of electricity that carries you to astonishing emotional depths. It has contours, corners, cusps.I don't want to tell readers too much, and I urge you not to read s that give away major plot points and milestones in this powerful journey of redemption. The experience of turning the pages in discovery is paramount to its visceral, immediate pleasure. But even if you have already read bits about these characters or circumstances, nothing can remove the lingering exaltation once you close the final pages. This is a tour de force that is impossible to shake off. The characters are fleshed out and organic in every aspect of being. They are coiled, agonized individuals, but what makes them so tremendous is their brazen tenacity. They are cultural outsiders, alienated and severed, but savagely resilient. They are singular, wretched creatures who infinitely penetrate the reader--cruel but sympathetic, elusive and yet naked, authentically human.Three lives intersect in 1953 in this story that spans fifty years in backward/forward time sequences, from the 1930's to the 1980's. June Han is a refugee from the Korean War when she is brought to an orphanage in the early 1950's. By the age of 11, she had already suffered devastating adversity, enduring periodic starvation and witnessing unspeakable violence. Hector Brennan is a benighted ex-GI from Ilion, New York, a damaged young man who is already shorn of any noble ideals, depraved and sodden with whoring and drink, and who comes to the orphanage to work the physically strenuous jobs of construction and repair. Sylvie Tanner is the comely and mercurial wife of the Reverend Ames Tanner. She is the daughter of missionaries and is accustomed to being uprooted and exposed to shocking conditions. Sylvie and her husband oversee and teach at the orphanage with dedication and generous benevolence.Sylvie has a haunting past and is drawn to June's gripping isolation; Hector's derelict history and provocative good looks are equal burdens; June is terrified and truculent, insatiable, greedy for Sylvie's maternal love; all three are hollowed out and tormented. Through Lee's brilliant and tightly controlled narrative, the past is gradually revealed--brick by brick--masterfully, woven into and through the story as it takes place thirty years hence. At this future juncture, June is searching for her prodigal son, which is the seed for the redemptive action of the book and its germane themes of identity, love, and dislocation.""War is a stern teacher,"" Hector's father quoted from Thucydides, from his perch at the bar. In every pore of this story, from the desolate, burnt, and barren fields of Korea, to the grey skies and filthy streets of Hector's seedy, combative youth, to the shabby, brittle, and frail hope of the orphanage, war communicates its harsh lessons.This is a shattering, phenomenal masterpiece.

He reveals the folly of doublethink, groupthink, and egomania in a ferocious satire of many-layered complexity. When you close the pages of the book, you are apt to appreciate it more as it settles into the parts of your brain that mingle literature with social commentary. The entertainment value is actually eclipsed by its brilliance, the dazzling rays reaching out to prior gems and reflecting an awful lot of sublime light. It's cheeky, satirical, uncomfortable, and to some readers, it will be controversial.Our unsympathetic protagonist is Michael Beard. (I note that the name is no accident, a beard being a person that is used by someone else to cover something up, and Michael meaning someone who is like God.) Michael is a 50-something former Nobel laureate, resting on his fleshy laurels from twenty-two years ago, where he stood on the shoulders of Einstein and proposed a scientific ""Conflation Theory"" that was trailblazing at the time. Now, he tours around the globe giving lectures and consults for a large fee, and he sits idly as a member of a board at a center for renewable energy in the UK. His main pursuit is women, and he pursues them with -aholic depravity. As the novel opens, his fifth marriage is falling apart due to his infidelities. But this time, his wife got the last word by having some side dishes for herself and leaving him labeled as the cuckold.Michael is a bozo with a brain. He is selfish, hideous, immoderate, and amoral. He exploits what he sees as the folly and weakness of the mass ideology in order to feed his degenerate egomania, but he is in denial of his own foolishness and excesses. He observes the current hysteria of global warming fanatics. (By the way, don't kill the messenger--I am not denying the seiousness of climate change, but rather sharing aspects of the novel). He compares them to Old Testament Armageddon-addicts and peril-seekers. He proclaims that global warming has created so much heat that it has evolved into a religion of sorts, so that even left-wing atheists have merged science and religion into a cataclysmic catastrophe, a noble purpose--and, for some people, a fanatical life quest.Well, Beard wants IN. He swindles and schemes and adopts ideas as his own, swaggering in with a proposal for a renewable energy source by artificial photosynthesis. He commits the most menacing breach of humanity and moral ethics in order to achieve his aims, and the reader can see him barreling toward comeuppance right out of the starting gate. His massive appetite for food and women continue to grow--he feeds the beast and the Buddha-belly at every opportunity, and drinks booze like water. He fervently maintains his invincibility as a hustler and a savior of mankind. Along the way are moments of physical comedy that are sheer hilarity, reminiscent of the Farrelly and the Coen brothers. And his apartment is so squalid it would make Dickens howl.McEwan pays homage, with his own brand of subversive humor, to previous literary monuments. There is a character with the surname Aldous; a twisted reference to the sex-hormone chewing gum; and Beard's doublethinking (although the latter is implied rather than identified), saluting Brave New World (P.S.). Beard is less a hypocrite than a doublethinking egoist. A nod to the water-sharing (substituted with Scotch) and media circus of Stranger in a Strange Land and the mob frenzy of The Bonfire of the Vanities are also peppered throughout the story.In order to appreciate this novel, the reader must be OK with a thoroughly revolting reprobate as a protagonist, and able to find humor in the tempest of global warming politics. Additionally, the reader is going to encounter that Beard is the only fleshed-out character. If that doesn't appeal to you, this may not be your cuppa. In lesser hands, I would not have enjoyed the focus on a singular person, with no supoorting charcters rounding out the story. Moreover, the prose gets scientifically dense, even verbose, at times. It was on the verge of distracting me from the novel's momentum at intervals, but not enough to thwart my pleasure.

As Infinite JesDavid Lipsky has done a laudable service for both David Foster Wallace and his readership with this jaunty road-trip/interview/memoir. As Infinite Jest was being launched in 1996 and Wallace was nearing the end of his book tour, Lipsky, a rising name in journalism, followed Wallace through the last week of the tour, the Midwest portion, and recorded almost every word spoken. (The piece was supposed to run in Rolling Stone , but never did. Bad timing due to the untimely death of a rock star and other foibles of the industry.) Lipsky interviewed Wallace without ever being obtrusive or intrusive. He allowed their relationship to form organically, gradually, and avoided a forced fellowship. Rather than a stilted outcome of an interview, this cohered with warmth, wit, warts, a wink here and there, and a wily charm. A salty, chatty Wallace emerges as a captivating and unreliable narrator of his own life.Lipsky precedes the interview with a mighty potent ""afterword,"" a several page editorial that is also filled with specific facts about Wallace's depression and suicide. I sprung a leak; it was like he died all over again and I had to mourn him once more. It was tender, frank, and genuine. This is also the only section where it is revealed that Wallace had been on MAO inhibiters (an old-school anti-depressant) since 1989, a fact that Wallace chose not to reveal in the interviews. On the contrary, Wallace fairly denied being (currently) on any medication for depression. But, throughout the text of the interview, Lipsky tells the reader each time the author's watch beeped an alarm. It took me a while to put it together--it seemed extraneous to tell us that. But, I think that Lipsky was allowing the reader to connect the dots and draw the arguable conclusion without making any personal statements. Wallace was forthcoming about his depression, and even about his ECT treatments (electroconvulsive therapy). But he was opaque about his current medication regimen. He chewed tobacco almost ceaselessly, drank Coca-Cola like water, and enjoyed the occasional draught beer. And he ate like a lumberjack. (He was 6'2"" and robust, athletic.)Throughout the three hundred pages of this protracted interview, I engaged with the momentum of Wallace-speak. Because his verbiage is unedited, it is sometimes necessary to read his sentences more than once. They are often choked with articles, prepositions and conjunctives that, idiomatically, are natural, but difficult on the page initially. However, I got into the zone and flow. Wallace is an enthusiastic interviewee if erratic at times. He vacillates from agile, amiable, and arch to repetitive and awkward. There are also words that hold a lot of charge for him, such as ""continuum."" In fact, Lipsky relates looking up that word after he went back to his hotel room, because it was so fundamental to Wallace's formal conception of the psyche.For the most part, I was illuminated by the book-sized interview. Wallace shares in-depth insights on growing up, his scholarly pursuits, tennis, depression, love, and of course, the process of writing. He discusses (not all at once, but at episodic intervals) the themes of Infinite Jest and the fear that we are in a culture of entertainment addiction. Additionally, Lipsky and Wallace deconstruct movies--from Lynch to Tarantino and several stops in-between. I was delighted that he waxed about my my favorite movie scene of all time--the scene in True Romance between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. They argue and examine literature and gossip a little about other writers and celebrities. Wallace had an almost childlike crush on Alanis Morissette, permeated with a fetching adoration and wonder.There are about fifty pages in the middle that lost steam. They were repetitive and grinding at intervals and seemed to be placed there in order to add to the ""road-trip"" ambiance. I got antsy and wanted to move ahead to more luminous discussions.By the end of the book, I felt closer to understanding Wallace, who yet remains an enigma and a haunting cautionary tale. Unintentionally, I felt a pull toward Lipsky, too. His observations are quick, inconspicuous, and often sublime. I was impressed by his tasteful treatment of Wallace's memory, of his regard for integrity, and his ability to capture the essence of this beautiful and tormented man and phenomenal author....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Mar 16, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6916961-although-of-course-you-end-up-becoming-yourself

The novel, textured with the natural world of impermanence and change, progresses with an almost hyperreal cohesion, drawing out its themes under drifts of snow, sheets of ice, bare-branched trees, windswept sand, and glassy lakes. The map of this region moves from macrocosm to microcosm, from the mutations of the landscape to the private storms of it inhabitants, from early nineteenth century to recent times. The story flickers beneath the earth and through the air.Sylvia is a middle-aged woman with an unspecified ""condition"" that sounds a lot like Asperger's. She has one friend, who is blind, and a husband, Malcolm, who is blind to her secret life. She stays shuttered in her house, images of tables and bibelots running through her head ceaselessly, the light from the windows casting shadows and reflections that play on the artifacts and with her consciousness. She is an autodidact of esoteric knowledge, of the entire history of this isolated, disappearing, glacial town, and she makes luxuriantly detailed, three-dimensional maps of the area. One day, she gets her driver's license and starts combing the peninsula. She meets a historical geographer, Andrew Woodman, and has a long, secret passionate affair that becomes the focus of her existence. Time passes, (their affair is interrupted by a seven year separation) and she knows that Alzheimer's is eroding his mind and his life, until one day he just disappears. A year later, she reads in a newspaper that he had died (a year ago), was in fact found floating in an ice floe and discovered by a three-dimensional wilderness artist named Jerome McNaughton.Jerome is a young man suffering from an unresolved past--an alcoholic, abusive father and withering, spineless mother--who now has difficulty committing fully to the woman he loves (Mira), of sharing all his private sorrow and rage. When Sylvia contacts him to meet and discuss Andrew, he reticently agrees. The series of meetings between Sylvia and Jerome and Mira focus on Andrew's ancestral journals--the history of the Woodmans going back to Andrew's great-great grandfather and the timber industry. What the journals reveal about Andrew and his family forms a cynosure between Jerome and Sylvia. And, in turn, their tenuous, brief bond becomes a niche where history, love, and home are revealed and a palpable epiphany takes place.The novel's most transcendent attribute is the poetic fusion of the landscape with the themes of loss, identity, and home. The story of Andrew is told in reflection. His profession as a historical geographer cleaves with the history and geography of the region (much of it contained in the journals) and progresses to his relationship with Sylvia. Time vacillates between static and dynamic as events almost pour out of time, while the present feels stagnant until the journals' history can influence the ones left behind. There is never an immediacy that the reader feels between Andrew and Sylvia, because Andrew is already a piece of history when the novel opens. I believe the author intended that, and she effectively placed Andrew as a polestar for the healing of others.The nineteenth century sections were, for me, the most vivid and electrifying. It was through that lens that I was able to visualize the landscape evolving by unchecked capitalism--from forest to deforestation, from rich soil to topsoil for barley, and, eventually, to sand. The tycoon daddys were reminiscent of the American robber barons J.P Morgan and J.D. Rockefeller, steely tycoons who were often tyrannical. The female characters are particularly well fleshed out here. Annabelle, Andrew's great-great aunt, and Marie, his great- grandmother, added pathos to the grandeur of the industrialists. The parallels between characters from both centuries were finely drawn and the fusion of all Andrew's ancestors into his psyche gave the story its most authentic depth of character.I did have a hard time believing that someone as cloistered as Sylvia for thirty-odd years, who is afflicted with a pronounced social disorder, could go out and have this passionate affair of tremendous life-altering proportions and yet be unnoticed by her husband. I cannot believe that Sylvia has the capacity to live a double life unobstructed. However, she is effective because of the momentum she creates around her and how she is contrasted to the changing environment, as well as paralleled to the history of this region--the hyperreal context I referred to at the beginning of my .The story also suffers from a clumsy construction at times. Some of the events are told in a hurried narration and some revelations are telegraphed rather than experienced. There is also a character named Ghost, an archetype who enters late and feels forced into a centerpiece arrangement.Fortunately, the grace of this story resides in the timeless humanity that is poetically and symbolically rendered. I recommend this unique novel for its astonishing beauty, breathtaking prose, and moving themes.

As the characters move into focus, the lighting techniques add a perspective to the dialog. Just like a play's story is told through dialog; lighting; and movement (called blocking in theater lingo), Catton's novel coheres and communicates through the visible frame of a theatre lens; the boundaries of the theatre are the boundaries of the narrative technique that she employed to tell this story. Any action that is not possible within the constraints of a stage is not part of the immediate action of the novel. In lesser hands, this could have gotten weary for the reader. However, it felt like Catton effortlessly exhaled this novel. The theme of escaping yourself--of desperately wanting to be someone else--is a context of narrative construction as well as foundation for the story.The story takes place between three neighboring groups of students. The Drama Institute is a drama college for aspiring actors, and the girls' high school, Abbey Grange, is an elite private school. The music school rounds out the settings of this novel. The sax teacher, a female of unknown identity, is often seen in shadow or startling light. Speaking of identity, only first or last names are identified, all except for one replacement teacher, Jean Critchley, who came on board when music teacher Mr. Saladin was let go. He had a scandalous affair with Victoria, one of the girls from Abbey Grange. This affair is the centerpiece story, from which all other stories, themes, and actions unfold. The abbreviated names personify the characters and their motivations in shadow for much of the story.This is a cloistered world where arch teenagers say cruel things to each other and communicate through a pecking order. The most genetically sparkling are the most popular, and deviance is not tolerated (although desired). Reality is less authentic than truth, insist the acting teachers. Truth is uncovered and dislodged via a staged experience. The Theater of Cruelty is an exercise taught to first year drama students that both perverts and illuminates the human boundaries and boundlessness of ambition and fear.The sax teacher speaks with a frank and flinty tongue to intrusive stage mothers and manipulates her students into shocking reenactments of her own past desires. Julia, (earmarked as the deviant ) and Isolde, (the beloved and in vogue), two of her students from the high school, feel caged by their status. Additionally, the students envy Isolde's sister, Victoria, because she was desired by an adult. She is now a celebrated victim. The sax teacher taps into their confusion and pulls their emotional strings, inwardly avid as they puppet her predilections.The acting teachers, known mainly as The Head of Acting and The Head of Movement, seek out favorite students who are reinventions of their past selves. Stanley is an earnest first-year student looking for his niche and willing to do audacious things to shed his virginal skin and experience the adult and sophisticated world. As reality is eclipsed by truth, the core of human behaviors--shame, fear, love, hate, and ambition--are played out with glee and gloom on a stage of human experience.As a former and very amateur stage actress, I was fortunate to take acting classes with strong teachers that taught me techniques from various schools of thought. It allowed me to identify that this novel did a masterful job of conveying the philosophies and approaches to acting that are taught by places such as the Berghof Studio, the Stella Adler Academy, and the Method school of acting. Catton, raised in New Zealand, was twenty-two when she wrote this impeccably researched book. She explored and exploited the stage experience with a witty and subversive precision. Moreover, she told a story about human nature, about pretending and escaping your limitations, about navigating through the quagmire of human desires--to find truth though lies....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,"Mar 18, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7381740-the-rehearsal

You don'tIn this novel about a struggling international newspaper based in Rome, various characters tell the story through chapter-divided vignettes. You don't have to wait until the end for it to pull together, as it is loosely connected from the beginning. As you get deeper into the story, however, the connections deepen, complement, and piggyback each other. It spans about fifty years, from the first edition in 1954 until near-present time. The ineluctable end careens with humor and pathos.The stories are alternately dry and humorous or wily and campy with a sharp eye registering human foibles and, at times, desperate aspirations. There is a love story triangle between Betty, Leo, and the newspaper's founder, Ott. The reader is cued early on, but over the years the journalists, editors, and descendents of Ott are in the dark about the reasons he started this floundering paper. Also, the twenty-first century is not on the horizon of the newspaper's advancement into the web-based age, and it is amusing to watch the editors act as apologists and defend the stasis of their decisions. As the finance department calls out for layoffs, the staff behave in comical ways with some dramatic results.Each story has its own flavor and rhythm. There is one about an Asian American academic, Winston, attempting to break into journalism by competing for a job in Cairo as a stringer correspondent for the paper. His naiveté is surpassed only by his passivity when a vulgar, self-centered man name Snyder overtakes his lodgings and possessions. The interview on the street is hilarious, as Snyder gets Winston to do his bidding and ask harassing questions to a burka-clad woman.There is also a touching story about a middle-aged, uxorious editor living with his young, pert girlfriend in Rome. It reads first like a winsome love story, and then a hair-raising zinger is thrown in that turns it into a bittersweet irony.Ornella is a woman with OCD that is essentially trapped in the house by her own Kafka-esque torments, and will not advance on reading the newspaper unless she has read every word of every daily piece. Therefore, she is still hemmed in at the era before the Internet and is barely out of the Cold War. Rachman's portrayal of Ornella is both comic and tragic but never reductive. I felt the discomfort of the people around her and also her private agony and self-imposed siege.In yet another chapter, one of the copy editors who were laid off is on a plane with the woman (""Accounts Payable"") responsible for his demise. Their relationship goes from introduction to friendly exchange to attraction and evolves into a final, electrifying, and disturbing scene that gripped me with its magnificent timing and rhythm.The novel charmed me with a shake of quirk and whimsy but stirred me with its saucy and salty blend of ingenuity. The cast of expatriates contrasts brilliantly with each other and form a keen and off-kilter portrait of a newspaper dying to stay alive. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Mar 24, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6834410-the-imperfectionists

The unnamed narrator, a successful playwright originally from Northern Ireland, is staying in Dublin at Molly Fox's house while Molly is in New York. Molly is a celebrated stage actress, a woman who seems mousy and nondescript in person but is charged with charisma on-stage. Moreover, she has a bewitching voice. ""At times it is infused with a slight ache, a breaking quality.... "" and ...""both a visual and sensuous quality, an ability to summon up the image of the thing that the word stands for.""Molly and said narrator have been best friends for twenty years. As the narrator struggles with writer's block during her visit, she traces Molly's steps through the house, fingers her treasures, sits in her garden, and recounts their friendship. Her memories includes their mutual friend Andrew, a successful TV art historian, specializing in memorials; Fergus, Molly's troubled brother; and Tom, the narrator's devoted brother--a Catholic priest who is also a dear friend to Molly. The day in question is June 21st, Molly's birthday, a date of penetrating significance that unfolds gradually through the narrative.Molly, Andrew, and the narrator have built firm and lucrative careers. Each has shed their native skin and taken on new identities that, paradoxically, manifest a more palpable singularity and congruity of self. Whether it is escaping traditional familial bonds or facilitating a triumph in artistic pursuits, the three friends have remained a touchstone for each other. Molly is the enigmatic force; Andrew is the medium of transformation; and the narrator relates through acute examination.""The closer you get to Molly, "" thinks the narrator, ""the more she seems to recede. Sometimes she seems to me like a figure in a painting, the true likeness of a woman, but as you approach the canvas the image breaks up, becomes fragmented into the colours, the brushstrokes and the daubs of paint from which the thing itself is constructed."" For Molly, the actor, the stage is a point of departure; for the playwright, it is a final destination.The narrator's musings often settle on Andrew, whose brother was a paramilitary Loyalist in the North and a poignant source of Andrew's pain. A dissection ensues in the narrator's mind as she digs into the deepest interstices of her psyche. She fuses the artifice of stage with the authenticity of life, recalling how an actor can be removed from the stage or a person can depart from your life but leave a resounding presence. ""Sometimes the most important and powerful element is an absence, a lack, a burnished space in your mind that glows and aches as you try to fill it."" As several visitors drop by at the end of the day, surprised to find Molly gone, the narrator experiences some visceral and vital insights.This kind of prose is rare and exquisite. Lean, poised, and elegant, the tenor is restrained and natural, dipped in elegiac quietude. The book packs a lot of punch in just over two hundred pages and leaves you exalted. Active silences peak into sublime epiphanies, and as the story spires, the characters inhabit you and burrow in the tender places of your heart. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Mar 27, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7896227-molly-fox-s-birthday

He hOn a sweltering spring day in Austin, Texas, Kevin Quinn spends several hours exploring the city while waiting to go to a job interview downtown. He has just arrived from Ann Arbor, where he is a small-time academic editor, and a big-time commitment-phobe with women. He is thinking of leaving his latest girlfriend, Stella, but he hasn't even told her about the interview. Over the course of the day, the reader will be thrust into the poignant loves that Kevin has left behind in the wake of the last twenty-five years.Kevin, at 50, is used to attracting younger women, and having imagined sexual encounters, but he knows his number is up soon. His enlarged prostate and whisker-sprouting ears are a sign of the vicissitudes of middle-age. But he continues to pamper his inner adolescent, and ill-advisedly follows a comely twenty-year-old woman from the plane and attempts to keep her at close range. Perspiration accumulates on his brow and under his arms, and he makes a pretty ragged mess of his suit as he proceeds to have some risible misadventures over at the hike-and-bike trail.As an Austin resident, I was thrilled to read such adroit descriptions of local landmarks. I don't think I can ever look at the wide bleached sky or view the Austin skylight the same ever again. Hynes' descriptions venture into the hyperreal, and he refers to the ""Longhorn Tower"" where he has his interview as Barad-dur, right out of the Tolkien universe. Austin occasionally lifts to fantasy heights in Hynes' literary universe.Hynes writes with dazzling and savvy prose and has a keen eye for the details of human behavior and countenance. He described a moment dancing with a woman he loved-- ""She was always watching you like she was right on the cusp of derision. But in a good way..."" Kevin's vulnerability is both hilarious and heartbreaking, and his ability to acknowledge his limitations mitigates the blustery and bloated ego that keeps him at arm's length in relationships.This darkly comic story of a man's confrontation with his moral ambiguity is biting and marvelously warped, absurd and surreal. The author structured juxtapositions between past and present with a split-second precision that fairly teeters and often had me laughing out loud. One moment he would be with Stella in an Ann Arbor food market, and the next sentence or paragraph, he would be chasing a woman at a same-named market in Austin. His scenes are elaborately detailed with spot-on timing. The results are uncanny and ripe with an ominously comic gusto.This is an author who knows how to blend highbrow, lowbrow and pop culture to create a frenzied portrait of a desperate and appalling man that you nevertheless root for and empathize with--a lecherous loser who keeps searching, who never gives up, who strives for a tattered integrity. He knows his fatal flaws, his salacious impetuosity, his lack of engagement with the future. In a particularly revealing scene in a Mexican restaurant, he shares some pivotal moments of his past with a beautiful woman who is compelled to first share a secret of her own. If you are not touched by that scene, then this probably isn't a book you will connect with conclusively. Later, there is a mordant scene in a bathroom of a clothing store that is searingly bald and telling.There is a moral compass here--it is cracked and bent, but Kevin is holding onto it for dear life. The author delivers a magnificent ending, a daring and audacious finale that airlifts every emotion simultaneously. Hynes gives us a complex and ultimately sympathetic character portrayed through a brutal and magnified lens.Addendum: This author likes Firesign Theater and quoted them in the book, which indubitably delighted me--so way cool.

Despite the characters' dark and soul-shattering journeys, light reflects on every page, both literally and aesthetically. Kennedy writes with an exquisite and tender timbre, lyrical and poetical, from core to root to stem to stalk to bloom. His prose is fueled with gravitas and grace, as he probes into the seeds of the subconscious with a Jungian finesse.Nardo Greene is a Chilean teacher who is in Copenhagen receiving treatment for PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). He was tortured during Pinochet's regime for educating his pupils about ""a poet who sang dangerous songs,"" a poet who was captured and died in a dungeon. Nardo's wife and child are joined with the *desaparecido*, the disappeared.""The poets were captured, but not their songs. For a song, once it is let loose in the air, can only be captured by one person at a time and cannot be stopped, for there are not ever enough policeman, will never be enough policemen or enough soldiers to stop a song. Even all the money of the rich cannot stop a song from reaching the ears of those who will hear it. If only one person hears it and learns it, others will, too, and others again. And they will teach the song to others.""This beautiful passage points to the essence of the story, connecting with others to heal wounds, and about the power of human souls to surmount horrifying ordeals and ultimately prevail. Throughout the novel, Kennedy weaves in beautiful poetry, by authors such as Pablo Neruda, one of my cherished poets, and poignant Scandinavian poetry. Moreover, this is the first time that Matthew Arnold's ""Dover Beach"" mesmerized me with its rousing expression and eloquent sound and rhythm.When this novel opens, psychotherapist Dr. Kristensen is trying to bring Nardo back to the land of the living. Nardo is emotionally, psychically, and spiritually dead. Kristensen is an enthusiastic and diligent doctor, facile at his work. But with Nardo he has hit a wall. His ability to maintain a professional and therapeutic distance is threatened by the fact that Nardo's demons are visiting him. Moreover, he is losing his grip with his family. The chapters from the doctor's perspective are the only chapters written in first person. It is as if he is the center, from which all others radiate outward and back, even the characters that don't personally interact with him. And, yet, he remains the most enigmatic, the most difficult character to pin down. His character feels disembodied at times, as he is woven in as the literal healing force.Michela Ibsen is a lovely woman, an ordinary woman, burdened with unresolved grief. Her much younger boyfriend is Voss, a boyishly handsome and emotionally stunted individual. He is suffocating her with his perverse needs and possessiveness.Michela's parents are both seriously ill. They live in separate rooms in a facility for the aged and infirm. Her relationship with them is complex and crucial to the novel's themes, and they furnish subtext and context to Michela's private agony. Michela's love-hate bond with her father is deftly rendered with intense color and character. Her mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's, bestows an echoing impact that is ceaseless and ultimately full of wonder.The chapters alternate seamlessly from one character to another, as the circle shrinks and all their fates ineluctably entwine. The angels, who appear with a stunning literary presence, represent the figurative healing force, the deep consciousness shared by all humanity.There is violence, but it is measured and never gratuitous. The story unfolds with a noble and elegant symmetry, leaving the reader exalted and wanting more. It imbues you like a penetrating symphony; and, like a symphony in four movements, this is the first of Kennedy's quartet.

The cadence, as well as the story, is briskIn this adroit debut thriller, Attica Locke delivers the goods with an understated and assured confidence. The cadence, as well as the story, is brisk and balanced. She avoids the pitfalls of many debut authors, i.e. the prose is not self-conscious or cloying, and the story develops with a natural ease. Her sentences are a joy to read, as they are poised, with a sense of the poetic, and well scrubbed. This is a novel with political overtones and racial conflicts; however, Locke executes her narrative without pounding in the polemics or preaching to the choir. In this restrained and mostly character driven story, the corporate controversies develop with a refined intelligence, building with a controlled and subdued temperance. Moreover, Locke paints a keen portrait of Houston's Third Ward of 1981, a place where political activism in the African American community has declined since its days of Carl Hampton and the Black Panther activism of the 70's, as many black business owners and homeowners have moved to the suburbs.Jay Porter is a young, thirtyish lawyer with a very pregnant wife, Bernie, living in the Third Ward and trying to pave a career. He has a tenebrous past that is revealed gradually within the arc of the story. At the beginning, we know he feels clouded and frustrated with how his career and life is unfolding, and there is a palpable tension between Jay and his wife. He tries, on her birthday, to surprise her with a boat ride on Buffalo Bayou in Houston. What stars off as a romantic quest turns into an uninvited adventure, as Jay saves a drowning woman and gets pulled into a quagmire of murder and dirty politics. Things get murkier as Bernie's father, a respected Reverend, beseeches Jay to get involved with the looming strike of the longshoreman dock workers. Although Jay was an activist for black power and equality in his college days, he does not want to get involved with this racially divided conflict. ""This is not my fight,"" he murmurs over and over to himself. ""This has nothing to do with me.""The thorny history of the Third and Fifth Wards, as well as Houston's power boom of the 70's and early 80's, informs Locke's superb story of human politics. She weaves Jay's past into the present with a lyrical control and economy of words, creating page-turning tension for the reader. This isn't about dead bodies piling up or gratuitous shoot-outs with larger-than-life characters. The characters in Locke's story are authentic, conflicted, and wholly believable. Jay's fight to provide for and protect his family and to forge a meaningful life are the gripping forces of this novel.Locke skillfully blends the Houston climate and geography into the mood of the characters and the action of the story. The tone is pitch-perfect and the events progress with a measured intensity. Locke's gift for character and narrative kept me fastened to the novel from the arresting opening pages to its credible and transitional end. I eagerly look forward to her next novel.

Early on, Taylor convinced me that this was going to be a character-driven book. But as the cast grew and the characterizations diminished, I ceased to inhabit it fully. The essential ingredient--individual portrayal--blurs into the larger themes of racial unrest within the genesis of the Civil Rights Movement. People became mere sketches. Except for the main protagonist, Loyal Ledford, the cast was populated by archetypes and one-dimensional figures. The author has a talent for earthy, gritty prose and his rendering of place is evocative. The soil and air of Marrowbone, West Virginia gets in your pores. But about one-quarter way through the book, it starts to meander, sag, and make its high points with platitudes.Loyal Ledford was orphaned as a young boy in 1935 by a reckless, drunk father. He lingers in Huntington, West Virginia, tending the furnace at night at The Mann Glass factory and squires the boss's daughter, Rachel, a company nurse. During the day, he goes to the local college. But he suffers from ennui and abruptly enlists as a serviceman in World War II. He returns after the war a haunted man from the horrors he has witnessed and the things he has done in the name of war. He is reemployed at Mann Glass, this time as a supervisor; marries Rachel; and starts a family. He befriends a black employee, Mack Wells, who has been subjected to ignorant prejudice. At night, Ledford is infected by abstract dreams that carry uncertain messages, which seem to be juxtapositions of past and future. He turns to whiskey for solace, which gradually alienates him from his home life.Ledford is thoroughly disgusted by racial prejudice at the workplace and in the county. He leaves Mann Glass and enlists the help of his distant relatives, The Bonecutter Brothers, in order to start up The Marrowbone Marble Company, an act inspired by his dreams. He persuades Mack to leave and come with him on this new venture. Loyal wants to do more than open a marble company. He desires to build a community that is based on kinship between black and white, a town that is built on integrity and the rights of human beings of all persuasions. One brick, one stone at a time, this town will grow to represent partnership and community between all ethnicities and colors.He seeks out a scholar, Reverend Don Staples, who becomes his mentor in all things from philosophy to religion to basic human relationships. Staples is a gentle Christian, a thoughtful theologian, not a fire and brimstone preacher. Ledford quits drinking and reestablishes his role as husband and father. He is determined to put his demons at rest and forge a meaningful future at Marrowbone Cut. However, he also maintains a friendship with a fellow serviceman, Chicagoan Erm Bacigalupo, a crude man of little integrity--a bookie with mob connections.It is a precarious undertaking to write a novel of race relations without tipping into the sententious and obvious. The author made it there by half, but it leaked around the edges. Don Staples became little more than a straw for Taylor's pulpit themes, and Rachel and Lizzie (Mack's wife) became mere wisps, undercut by the grandiloquence. In essence, the story was preaching to the choir (i.e. the reader). I do not need to be convinced that segregation was heinous, or to read pithy sermons about human decency and racial equality. I wanted to get back to the individual families.Taylor's focus and cadence drifted as his architecture staggered under its own weight. He selected a few individuals to expand upon, such as Ledford's son, Orb. He gave him an Edgar Sawtell-ish construction, and his story, while precious, meandered until it also became fuel for the big battle of good vs evil. I felt cheated at the end. Taylor demonstrated an art for creating crisp and eccentric and fully realized characters at the opening of the book, then retreated from them and the story of two families--one white and one black--in order to fulfill his larger themes. Ironically, he filled his canvas with more and more characters--too many to handle with care--and I got weary of the soapbox, even though I agreed with his politics.This could have been a five-star book; the author has a gift for storytelling, and, when he chooses to, solid characterization. The scenes of Ledford as a marine were powerful and the men in the corps were superbly depicted. The problems ensued when he traded out the rich and textured story for the grand platform. At that point, individuals became either caricatures or cursory sketches. Taylor gets his point across, and at times I was captivated; however, it was uneven and too often rhetorical. Nevertheless, I have faith in Taylor's skill as a writer, and I will undoubtedly be in line for his next book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 27, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7337165-the-marrowbone-marble-company

BThis is a modern, woolly mastodon of a book, a book with tusks and chewing teeth, a throwback to the most towering storytelling in literary history. But it is also a Seraph, a three-paired-winged novel that is full of zeal and respect, humility and ethereal beauty, an airborne creature that gave me five days in heaven. And, it is a sea serpent, because it lifted itself up like a column and it grabbed and swallowed me. Whole.Pardon me while I gush; I bow to the spirit and heartbeat of David Mitchell, a force of nature who wrote this unforgettable, epic tale of adventure and colossal love. It is really...all about life and love. At turns knotty, briny, ribald, sensuous, fearsome, biting, daring, cerebral, grandiose, infinitesimal, and what did I leave out? It's panoptic, and exquisitely poetic. The first page-and-a-half of chapter XXXIX rivals Shelley's Hymn to Intellectual Beauty. It will make you laugh, it will make you weep, it will make your soul utter its secrets.The novel starts with a birth, ends with a death, like bookends to all it contains. It contains two calendars, the Gregorian and the lunar. Time is an expanding and contracting entity in this story. In the strictest and most Western sense, it is linear. But when you are addressing a more Eastern orientation, as well as gestation and birth, the lunar calendar is more fitting. Mitchell makes them work, hand in hand, in alternating chapters.The eponymous Jacob de Zoet, the Dutch Zeelander and clerk, is the strong and very moral center of this novel. Copper-haired and green-eyed, robust but reserved, he is a devout, sensitive, patient, tolerant, artistic, and keenly intelligent young man. He is sometimes troubled, and often prescient. He is posted indefinitely on the fan-shaped, artificial island of Dejima in the bay of Nagasaki with the Dutch East India Company's warehouses and stock and motley crew, and the year is 1799.At first sight, Jacob falls in love with Orito Aiwabaga, midwife and student to the scholarly Dr. Marinus. A burn scar on the left side of her face is no impediment to her beauty in the eyes of Jacob; his principled nature is his obstruction. I inhabited his quiet torment and pleaded with the pages to bring them together. I fell a little in love with Jacob myself--he transcended the fictional; I felt his hands.Drawing on historical facts but twisting it into a magnificent, almost mythical tale, Mitchell casts a spell with words and images. His juxtapositions are painterly; the narrative is colorful with stylistic and linguistic leaps that keep you on your toes. This is a demanding novel. Mitchell stays one step ahead of the reader (but not arrogantly so), and he does it with brio. It is as if he is aware of what he needs to do to take you to the fathomless waters of his prose. He starts off with these tongue-slicing, lip-curling crazy names that may frustrate you initially, but it makes you slow...down...and pay attention to the minute details as well as the grand canvas.I have rarely read a book (in third person point of view) that makes me feel so intimate with the author's artistic strokes. It was as if he made a contract to take our senses, gradually tune us to his rhythms, and descend further and deeper. With not one stitch of self-consciousness, he envelopes you. And there are lovely sketches in the book that add dimension to the narrative.(I wish I knew who the artist was--is it Mitchell? His wife?)There are three major shifts in the book. The first part sets up the tension and gives you the flow and rhythm and landscape of the novel, and introduces the Dutch and Japanese equipoise of politics that teeter-totters in this faraway place. The hierarchy of administrators, leaders, shoguns, samurais, medical practitioners, merchants, interpreters, servants, and slaves encompasses the serious to the sensational, and is often comically ingenious. This is also where I was most a tenant of Jacob.The middle section focuses more on Orito, and has a feminine spirit to it, as well as cautiously moving into a thriller mode. And just when you think you got ahead of the author, he wrests that predictability away and keeps his promise to elevate his purpose.The third section is the most challenging to read.

This is not your typical zombie or vampire novel; it isn't cheesy or reductive. It shares some characteristics with its progenitor, The Stand, and fans of King's work will be arguably riveted by this (more updated) novel. But there are as many differences as there are similarities, and Cronin's ambitions are ultimately more complex and expansive. Cronin covers a longer period of time and delves more densely and philosophically into the dark and grey areas of the human psyche. Also, his poetic and luminous language and metaphysical subtext eclipses, in my opinion, King's earlier work.The story is teased out gradually, moving back and forth from places as far and deep as a Bolivian jungle, to the deserts and mountains of the west and southwest, to the concrete jungle of Houston, Texas, and many stops throughout. The disparate narrative threads converge to a point after the first 250 pages, and then we are thrust into a new world order at a place called The Colony. Some readers feel that this middle section is rather slow, but it is actually where Cronin shines. He introduces new characters that are likely to stay the course of the trilogy, and he is more meditative and succulent in his prose. The final 250 pages illuminate ambiguities that may still be humming and create a climax that heads toward a continuation.There is a lot more than good and evil at play here, although the moral heft is evident, as human forces must combat malevolent viral creatures. But the incipience, growth, and psychology of these viral entities is not so simple. The relationship between the survivors and the creatures is more like a Venn diagram than a dualistic paradigm. Moreover, the human condition is explored in different states of wakefulness and sleep, in a myriad of conscious states, and connects all beings, whether viral or human. It also raises the question of, ""who are the monsters?""Divided into eleven sections, (with numerous chapters), the novel covers approximately one hundred years, starting circa 2014. However, there are three time periods that are pertinent to the story, two that are covered in detail. Each new section is headed by a short verse of Shakespeare from a play or sonnet, or else a poem by Shelley or other poet that has a poignant significance to the narrative. For instance, this verse by Henry Vaughan, from ""The World:""I saw eternity the other nightLike a great ring of pure and endless light,All calm as it was bright,And round beneath it time in hours, days, years,Driven by the spheres,Like a vast shadow moved in which the worldAnd all her train were hurled.Cronin's sense of place; of time; of timelessness; and his magnificent explorations of memories; of memories folded and unfolded and twisted in time; and of the self and the Shadow self, are examples of his bridges from genre to literature. He balances intellectual and action narrative with enough gusto to keep all audiences satisfied. The plot and story have a solid pace, although he takes his time to develop his characters and illuminate the back-stories. Additionally, as in his superb novel, The Summer Guest, Cronin's prose glitters with moving beauty. ""...while you sank into the dreamy softness of your seat and sipped ginger ale from a can and watched the world float in magical silence past your window, the tallest buildings of the city in the crisp autumn light and then the backs of the houses with laundry flapping and a crossing with gates where a boy was waving from his bicycle, and then the woods and fields and a single cow eating grass.""There are, occasionally, some minor snags in the construction. A few devices are employed at intervals, and there are times when a character is improbably saved from the clutches of disaster. Yet, the author does it with panache, in dramatic scenes portrayed with a soulful and melancholy elegance. He avoids melodrama. He gets inside the head of his characters, and they are made of flesh and bone, not straw. It is also satisfying to see that this is a very diverse cast of multi-ethnicities. The landscape of people is naturally rendered, not making a statement but rather reflecting a realistic ethnic pool of combinations.THE PASSAGE is the first of an ambitious trilogy. The journeys on foot or by hoof, by machine or by dream, are full of serrated adventure. And it immerses you in all strains of love--sibling, maternal, paternal, friendship, romantic, and a crushing one of cross-purposes. And it has stars, the moon, bones, and blades, guns and garrisons, trees and cliffs. And did I say stars?

It represents our continuing, revolving narratives, partly hidden from our consciousness, the ocean a repository of life and death, a connection to all. The horse is totemic, an aid to self-discovery and understanding of our past, as well as glimpses into our future.The title is undoubtedly taken from Francois Truffaut's superb movie, whose theme is that movies are more important than life for those that make them. In the book's context, it is the narratives that make up our lives. And what are narratives but the integration of the deepest memories that have broken up like shards and scattered, or hidden in our deepest and repressed recesses? Our narratives don't exist in isolation; the stories travel, the voices make up our universal experiences and nourish our shared humanity. We are a latticework of voices.Reiken's novel consists of ten narratives. In each one, a character is brought into focus, their individual story highlighted. Most characters reappear in several of the other narratives, sometimes in the background, or in counterpoint, or even as a parallel. The core story underpinning all of the narratives is a story of survival during the Holocaust. Five hundred Polish-Jewish men in Soviet-occupied Lithuania were promised jobs as intellectuals, as archivists. When they assembled, they were killed. The story has taken on a fable-like history, the fable being that two of the men have survived. These two men are related to the present-day narrators in some way, either directly or through six degrees (or less!) of separation.Reiken writes with such a natural ease that the connecting lip into deeper consciousness is fairly imperceptible. You start out on the surface of things and spool almost dreamily, tranquilly into penetrating waters. The construct is Jungian and his concept of the collective unconscious is illustrated through the psyches of the narrators and their overlapping stories.The motifs/symbolism is ripe and transcendent. The Shadow self (which Jung describes as the repressed/suppressed aspects of the conscious self that often appears in dreams as a dark figure) is particularly expressed and explored by different characters, but is centered on Beverly, whose father was one of the five hundred men ""lost."" It is this Shadow self that stalks her and forces her narrative to emerge more fully into the open and connect with other narrators.This novel is unputdownable. It winds around the reader so effortlessly and pulls you down, down, down into the heart of mercy, of kindness, of compassion. Secrets and guilt are often toxins that prevent us from knowing ourselves and understanding our lives fully, and divide us from each other. How do we begin to love, and how do we forgive?All of us with our separate narratives are part of a deeper, richer narrative, a story much larger than we know. ""Only later did I realize that the question the story caused me to ponder more than any other was that of what it takes to find a thing that's hidden, a thing that lurks within whatever it is you're staring at each day. Perhaps the meaning of the story is that you must look deep rather than far if you want to unlock any of the secrets of the universe, that once unlocked a secret loses its power unless a part of it is withheld.""If this novel does not move you uncommonly, I would be surprised. If you are not astonished by the beauty and elegance and immeasurable compassion of this book, I would be confounded. What is this book about? It is about everything. Who is it for? It is for everyone. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"May 18, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7530820-day-for-night

The pages fly, and the prose is crisp and economical. He tackles difficult, dicey, and controversial subject matter without handing out platitudes or falling into blunt party line agendas. I am tempted to call it a non-puff beach read. It is lively, energetic, and easily accessible, but it is also thought provoking and ultimately bold.Loving mother and housewife Gwen Raine bought some pot from ex-boyfriend Jude for recreational use. On the way home, driving down some precarious mountain roads, she was involved in a car accident. She was hit by an elderly driver (suffering from dementia), and both end up in the ER. Although Gwen was not at fault, the police found the bag in her car and the THC in her system, and now the DA is poised to strong-arm or throw the book at her due to escalating drug sales in the community.Concurrently, husband Brian is having some problems at his high-paying job at Caladon Pharmaceuticals. They have been walking a fine line with marketing an anti-anxiety medication as an off-label weight loss drug. Some speculative and hazardous risks were taken by the company's executives, which threaten to topple over onto Brian. The Raines have separate stressors and two small children together. The marriage is now loaded with accumulating anxieties and legal problems. How--or if--they pull through keeps the reader on edge.Told from multiple narrative perspectives in alternating chapters, the story focuses primarily on Gwen and Brian Raine; the enigmatic and laconic Jude; and Jude's daughter, Dana. Gwen and Brian's depiction as a suburban married couple devoted to their children do fall into a quasi-stock profile. The ""form"" of their characters is familiar. However, Klein keeps the story taut and the reader tense by compounding the problems resulting from a ripple effect that connects the characters to each other. He convincingly pushes the envelope with Gwen. She is faced with difficult ethical and moral choices, and her responses aren't canned or predictable.Jude is morally ambiguous, and I applaud the author for an honest and organic rendering of this character, never falling into an easy trap of stereotype. Moreover, Klein doesn't demonize all recreational pot smokers into categorical addicts or amoral/immoral deviants. He aptly illustrates the various lifestyle choices that people make and the consequences of their behaviors.The author did his research and applied his details fluently. I worked for a company that performed drug trials, and I recognize the spot-on ethical dilemmas and vicissitudes that were portrayed and plagued Brian.The denouement was tidy on one front, luridly messy on another. Klein doesn't tarnish it by creating a sea change in his characters or laying on a heavy-handed, disingenuous morality. The final and anticlimactic scene was authentic and arch, and I admire the author for his audacious and honest story. It is sure to create animated discussions, which makes it an excellent selection for broad-minded book club readers....more",Notes are private!,1,6,1,not set,"May 28, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7694515-stash

Her depiction of the labor camps and the atrocities of the Holocaust are visceral and unforgettable, and I applaud her theme and scope of the story. However, I am ing this as a novel, not an historical text. As a novel, it did not succeed for me.The hero of the story, Andras Levi, is beyond reproach. He reminds me of the war-hero characters in 50's movies--perfect in every way. Any potential faults are corrected because he is immeasurably sensitive and brave and good. It goes beyond human believability. Klara, his love interest, is also straight out of central casting. She is infallible. His two brothers, Tibor and Matyas, also deserve medals for immaculate character and courage. There are no refinements, no subtext. It lacks nuance.As the story progresses, it becomes utterly predictable. When there are no fatal flaws, there is no real tension. When problems are solved inorganically and incredulously, I am turned off as a reader. Each time Andras or Klara get embroiled in a difficult situation, it is solved categorically with one coincidence piled upon another. Additionally, their human errors of the past and present are glossed into gallantry. Orringer sabotages some ripe possibilities of conflict between characters and situations by resolving it with over-precious and staggeringly implausible fixes.At the eleventh hour, during the last 100 pages, there are some raw scenes of human deprivation and depravity, sickness and decay. But, it wasn't anything I hadn't read or seen in a movie previously. She had fairytale characters and one-dimensional villains. I honestly wanted to throw this book across the room in disgust. It was too simplified and disingenuous, but she manipulates by putting her invincible characters in the context of a sacred and untouchable history.Orringer didn't bring anything fresh to the table. This was a synthetic soap opera. I was engaged with it only because of the harrowing re-enactments of the Holocaust horrors. This was part of my ancestral history, too, so it naturally evoked strong feelings. Yet, the historical aspects were presented in tedious exposition rather than novelistically. The fictional characters and story were preposterously foamy and unctuous.There was substantial gristle in the last section, but I had already read 500 pages of grandstanding and artificial construction. I hesitate to give this novel two stars because of her massive research and her virtuous themes. I respect Orringer's dedication to keep this topic alive and in the hearts of others.

Population ten thousand, including native people that have lived on this land for thousands of years; it was their flesh and blood. Now the Mackenzie Pipeline project, a huge construction of an oil and gas pipeline, threatens to ""rip open open the Arctic...like a razor slashing the face of the Mona Lisa.""A little radio station of the CBC is the center of the novel. Harry Boyd, the 40-something interim manager, whose luckless history of ill-repute but brilliance has brought him back to radio after a wash with TV, is an unlikely romantic. He has fallen in love with the sound of Dido Paris on air, a resonant, smoky-voiced and Netherlands-born young woman of unconventional beauty, a wide-shouldered, slim-hipped enigma of melancholy temperament. She was hired as a parting shot of the former manager.Gwen Symon, a mousy young girl-woman from Ontario, has bravely driven herself in her Boler trailer all the way to Yellowknife to work in radio. She listened to a radio show as a child called ""Death on the Barren Ground,"" about John Hornby, the Englishman who starved to death on an Arctic adventure into the Barrens in 1927. She has since read his biography, three times! Harry is familiar with Hornby's history and his biographer, who lives close by. He is willing to be patient with Gwen's parched and defenseless voice.Eleanor Dew is the point person or office manager at Yellowknife radio, a woman who manages to be pretty even though no part of her is pretty. She is a striving poet and a thoughtful friend to everyone.Eddy Fitzgerlad is the cipher, a radio technician of unknown other talents, a well-cut but terse, insolent man, an unsettling presence in the radio station, with his eye on Dido.Ralph Cody is the radio book er and prodigious photographer of the far North Canadian landscape, with small nicotine-stained hands that are deft with a camera and tripod.This cast of well-drawn, unforgettable characters, as well as some lively secondary characters, is the driving force of the novel. Hay's sumptuous sense of place, redolent of author Jane Urquhart (but more droll), and her precision with character building, fuels the story with an electric and kinetic buzz. Her use of radio as an extended metaphor, her vast store of literary allusions, and her buoyant linguistic play are the ingredients that make for an intelligent and contoured novel. The back story of the proposed pipeline add dimension and depth to the tale.During the summer, four of these characters agree to a six-week Arctic adventure by land and canoe to visit the place of John Hornby's exploration and death. The Barrens were the rugged, treeless, and desolate landscape of the interior Arctic. This would be a mighty challenge for the group, even in summer. The adventure is filled with drama and a supple examination of the human spirit. All four of the radio adventurers will be put to a supreme test of inner and outer strength and tenacity.This is the first book I have read by Elizabeth Hay. I am a delighted admirer of her work now, and I look forward to reading her previous novels.

But I will say a little more, and then try to persuade you to read this heart-shattering, elegiac, lyrically beautiful book.The key characters in this originally Italian-language novel are Alice and Mattia, and the story spans from 1983 (roughly age 7) through 2007 (I'll let you do the math). Chapters alternate between Alice and Mattia and the story is essentially linear in time. The first chapters illustrate the separate tragedies that befell and scarred them and imprint their outlook and all their future actions. If you are not emotionally gripped and demolished by these events, then this probably isn't the book for you. You will know pretty quickly whether you will connect with these characters.The prose is stunning, spare, subtle, and sensuous. You will feel sorrow in every space, solitude on every page. But it moves along at an effortlessly steady pace. It has a page-turning vitality that engulfs you; I was rarely ""outside"" of the story looking in. I was beside Alice and Mattia; they inhabited my heart as my heart expanded. The pages pressed in on me. I dare to say something flip--but it had me at hello.I don't need to give you a synopsis. I knew nothing about this story going into it, but I soon fastened to wherever they were going. Alice and Mattia are like twin primes, and their story is a gentle, moving, and soul-ripping journey.My only complaint was that during the last ¼ of the book, the narrative wasn't as tightly focused, and the story meandered a bit. I felt the teensiest bit of impatience until it re-entered its momentum. The ending is not gift-wrapped and tied in a bow. It stimulates thought and discussion and is open to several interpretations. If you like your denouement neat and tidy, you may want to take a pass on this one.Paolo Giordano was the youngest winner of Italy's prestigious literary award, the Premio Strega. He was only 27. I am deeply impressed by the depth of his understanding of the human condition at such a young age.

Since his wife, Sara, died several years ago, he has walled himself off emotionally from relationships, frustrating his twenty-five year-old girlfriend, Regina, a research fellow and budding poet. He is fifty-eight and suffering from impotence. She is a potent, burlesque-loving young woman that dances naked for him on their routine weekly rendezvous. They keep a regular regimen of Fridays and a secret email exchange at work.Victor's links to his dead wife include a series of index cards that she left behind, detailing the various vectors of their thirty-odd year marriage, and her octogenarian Aunt Betsy, the bellicose island doyenne. He pencils in a regular Friday supper with Aunt Betsy following his Friday afternoon failures with Regina. He compartmentalizes his relationships and quarantines his heart, wallowing in melancholy over his loss. The troubled arc of his marriage left a wake of unsettled issues that Victor is trying to stitch together from their memories. Sara's index cards tell a story that threatens to unhinge him completely.The novel contains some elaborate observations on life, particularly memories.""Some theories said the most accurate memory was one that's never recalled. The more the mind retells a story, the more that story hardens into a basic shape, where by remembering one detail we push ten others below the surface and construct the memory touch by touch. A sculpture between the neurons that looks like its model, just not completely.""As a philosophical writer of tart reflections, Baldwin has a pungent flair. However, the story was often fuzzy and unfocused, as it lurched from character to character, from scene to scene. Likewise, this eccentric cast of oddballs was self-consciously overplayed. They were a little too quirky and frenzied, as if the author was trying to fill a weak story with ambient noise. The narrative felt boggy and bleary, and I was routinely impatient to return to the examination of Victor and Sara's marriage. The book needs some crisp editing; the story tends to become either repetitive and muddy or windy and discursive. Also, a dark and defining event in Victor's past was too affectedly reminiscent of a scene out of Pump up the Volume.The narrative thrust declines when Aunt Betsy's son, Joel, a background character during most of the story, is corralled to front and center during the final stretch of the novel. Once the climax is reached--an over-the-top but ultimately enervating experience--the story continues tonelessly with Joel and his transgressions. He was the least engaging character of all, presented wearily as the stock alcoholic. The story's indulgence into Joel became tedious to read, and I often lost interest.Baldwin's freshman effort does show promising talent, but it suffers from the flaws of many debut novels. The jacket cover describes this book as ""dazzling."" Honestly, dazzling it is not. It lacks focus and rhythm and suffers from structural jam and story caulking.

Dr. Siri Panboun, seventy-two years old and itching to retire, was essentially coerced into the appointment of national coroner after the Communist takeover. Prior to this, he knew nothing about autopsies. Siri was a general physician earning respect and warmth from his patients. He had never worked on cold, dead bodies. His predecessor had fled across the river to Thailand, leaving a gap in the state-controlled medical examiners office. Most of the professional classes have hightailed it out, leaving the poverty stricken to submit to the new Party line. Yet, with nothing but the inherited motley staff and his curiosity, Siri has become adept at his job.Then the body count starts to rise in this typically uneventful morgue. A Party leader's wife (herself an appointee of high position), some Vietnamese soldiers that were tortured--and it doesn't stop there.

A meeting in the Khamuan province piques the spiritual element and explains the coroner's visitations, but it never takes away from the political intrigue or social commentary, so exotically understated.Cotterrill has created inventive and palpable characters that navigate through a ham-handed regime, but the author does it with a droll finesse.

My skin tingled and my eyes watered; the passages melted in my mouth and dissolved on my tongue, making me buoyant, almost weightless. Pardon my gushing, but this is the most lyrical, musky, magical prose I have ever encountered in a freshman novel, and it has easily become one of my desert island books.The characters are so vivid that they surge from the pages and stand before you. They are fiercely alive, vulnerable, sometimes shocking and appalling, entirely human. Near the beginning of the book a myth is revealed about the first day of every century in Uruguay, and recounts what happened in 1800, when succulent, ripe berries appeared at a church altar in the starving town of Tacuarembo'. Next comes the folklore of 1700, about the songs that haunted the air, from one sunrise to the next, disembodied but potent, songs in the vanishing Tupi'-Guarani' language.The narrative segues seamlessly to 1900, to a tree and a miracle, and our first prominent female character, Pajarita. There is a touch, just a touch of magical realism in this section, which hums with the atmosphere of the time and place. However, this novel isn't couched in the supernatural; rather, de Robertis writes with a penetrating realism that consummately grips you.From Pajarita, the herbalist, to her daughter, Eva, the poet, and finally to her daughter, Salome', the revolutionary, the reader is transported to an intense and intimate journey of independent women trying to survive in the upheavals of political and familial turmoil. Each woman is distinct, all three of them magnetize the reader. Moreover, most of the secondary characters are fertile and vivid and command the narrative when they are present.If there is a weakness, it is a minor one. The characters, prose and story are flawless, the dialogue is authentic, and the essence of the story is supremely evocative. It is how they are hinged together overall that sometimes falters. It may be because each woman, subsequent to their individual story, takes a back seat to their next female descendant. Once I was steeped in one woman's life, it was difficult to accept them as background. The author does bring each woman back in to the spotlight now and then, but they are mostly subsumed into the new generation as the focus switches.Some readers may feel Salome's story drags a bit, as the second half of this woman's story contains as much internal dialogue as actual movement. But, for me, the beautiful texture of the sentences describing her plight was always revelatory.She also weaves in a controversial subject matter, one that all readers may not be prepared to accept, or at least to accept in this story. There is no way to address it without giving spoilers, so I will refrain from dropping any more information except to say that it is daring and brave. After reading the acknowledgments at the end, I suspect that it may have a basis in the author's personal life. And the following quote is thematic for every event in her story (including the one I referred to).""But if it was true that everything that disappeared was somewhere, then even those still breathed and glittered, somewhere, in the hidden corners of the world.""Monte. Vide. Eu. I see a mountain. The irony of a flat city with no slopes being named after something that wasn't there--the invisible mountain along the very visible Atlantic Ocean. This novel brims with poetic observations and piercing encounters. The language is polished and iridescent.""This could be such a wet and heavy world. It could flood a normal night with ruthless rain; could sweep a man away along its currents, and spit him up again on long-lost shores; could seep into your secret soil, even when you wish you wish you wish you could stay dry.""This is a story about mothers and daughters; hope and love; survival in horrifying circumstances; connection and fulfillment. This hypnotizing novel is unforgettable, the enchanting prose indelible, the characters singular.

In Cape Town, South Africa, at six in the morning, an American teenage tourist is running for her life. Her best friend's throat was slit in front of her and she is bolting from the perpetrators' clutches. The story hits its stride early and swiftly as events unfold over thirteen-hours. Vicious outlaws and the snarl of conspiracy; Afrikaner, Xhosa, and Zulu crime-fighters; and crooners and corporate fleecers storm the pages of the book. Besides Rachel Anderson, the pursued and wily tourist, there's music industry giant, Adam Barnard, found shot and dead near his hard-drinking, faded-diva wife.This is my third Meyer book (this is his seventh), after reading Dead at Daybreak and Blood Safari, all set in the author's home country. The narrative is bracing and the characters resonant and ripe. Meyer delivers with sizzle in this dual-crime novel; his terse prose lances the pages, and the pitch-perfect pace purrs and thrums. The reader feels like a detective as fragments eventually pull together from the grime of corruption. You suspect, you speculate, and you quiver. The knot of Barnard's death is teased out concurrently with Rachel's web of intrigue. Meyer is brilliant at interlocking disparate characters, events, and scenes, and at solving parallel puzzles.The crisp story is supported by trenchant characters. Benny Griessel, the Slavic-eyed, bushy-haired Inspector with a sinking marriage and six months sobriety, has a sharp radar and a fox's energy, as well as a tarnished reputation. He pursues the perps with thirsty zeal while trying to keep his inner demons at bay. Can he save his marriage? Can he rescue the girl? Will the lure of drink undo him? Benny struggles to keep it together while people's lives are falling apart.Fransman Dekker, an apt, avid cop with a strident temper, is furious about the racial hiring practice in the department. He's close to losing his cool over the results of affirmative action--not black enough, not white enough, feeling the statistical stab of ""eight percent coloured."" His nemesis, Zulu Mbali Kaleni, is one of the most delightfully imperious and exotic policewomen I have come across in fiction. She looks like an ""overstuffed piegeon,"" with a ""big bulge in front and a big bulge behind in her tight black trouser suit."" Dekker, Griessel, and Kaleni, like the other players in the book, are dimensional and sympathetic. Meyer has a knack for fiery characters that vault from the pages while they crackle and burn.The story is taut and the climax is gripping. Although more cinematic and conventional than his previous work, Meyer's brio is seductive, his pointed narrative is spicy. Some parts are predictable, yet without feeling tired and shopworn. He tells the story with a candid depth that is wholly humane and authentic. A primal essence buzzes and hums as he juxtaposes scenes, cutting from one jolting moment to the next. And although I am typically put off by cell phone bits in a novel, Meyer's snappy insertions actually increase the story's tensile strength. The chapters revolve around the clock and the minutes fly with the pages. He controls the fluid narrative with an acid restraint and never goes overboard. It vibrates with soul, but it's not for the faint of heart. ...more",Notes are private!,2,7,1,not set,"Jul 02, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8614975-thirteen-hours

Then it would be time to rely on the kindness of strangers, and the hope that this would prove more than a fond illusion.""Anita Brookner is arguably one of the finest prose writers living today. Her keen precision and clean, stark sentences are edged with luminous turns of phrase and biting ironies. Her characters lead insular, lonely lives and rarely do anything optimistic with their existence, no matter how astute their insight.Retired banker Paul Sturgis is no exception. He is 72 years old and lives a tightly circumscribed life. There is minimal pleasure in his activities, such as frequenting art museums, occasional travel around Europe, visiting his hairdresser, and his obligatory sojourns to a distant relative, Helena. Walking is his favorite activity, and it is during his perambulations that he examines his life in detail.Paul is in constant conflict with himself. When he meets a woman in Venice, Vicky Gardner, he alternately can't wait to escape her and get to know her better. When they meet up again in London, he allows her to manipulate him and leave her belongings at his house, while she takes off for parts unknown.Paul has an ex-flame, Sarah, who was exuberant and sensual. After years of separation, they have a chance encounter and renew their bond, but it is one of friendship, not romance. Her health is declining, although her tongue is as astringent as ever. Paul entertains longings and fantasies of marrying Sarah, but he knows it is illusory. She is reproachful and inscrutable, and he cannot conquer the walls between them.Paul is one of those neurotics whose basic mantra toward others would be, ""I would die to have you, and kill you to get away."" He is a passive man who has never been able to negotiate strong women, although he admires them. He is in perpetual battle with his own desires, and his contradictory thoughts are often serially juxtaposed, one warring thought after another. That is part of Brookner's wit and wisdom, her almost-aching but caustic acumen in matters of human psychology.The drawback of this story is its torpor. Although the author has an infinite supply of description and inner dialogue for Paul's endless indecision and confusion, it begins to wear on the reader. It becomes repetitious, irritating, monotonous. Eventually, it devolves into a long-winded soliloquy. In lesser hands, I wouldn't have even finished it. But Brookner's magic with language kept me hanging to the bitter end. This would have worked better as a novella, reducing the pages by half.I am a sturdy fan of Anita Brookner, and because of my familiarity with her work, I remained fastened to the narrative. I will read her for the scintillating prose, for her intoxicating metaphors. If you are unfamiliar with her work, start with her Booker winner Hotel Du Lac, her shattering Look at Me, or her stunning Brief Lives. Brookner's elegiac prowess captivates with her story and character in most of her novels. But STRANGERS is not her finest achievement, nor one I would highly recommend to other readers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jul 04, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6063521-strangers

This novel, this arresting and wholly authentic portrait of late twentieth-century family lifeI am utterly nonplussed that this book is out of print. This novel, this arresting and wholly authentic portrait of late twentieth-century family life, deserves an emblem that says: timeless, exemplary. Robert Boswell portrayed these contemporary characters originally and credibly, seducing the reader from the opening prologue to the masterful ending. There were no false notes, no manipulations of narrative or person. It germinates beautifully, organically.Angela and Stephen Landis are divorced, but their six years of marriage produced a daughter, Dulcie, now 15. Angela is remarried to the promiscuous Quin, a theater agent who genuinely loves her, but is a serial cheater. Angela left Stephen because she didn't want to be a farmer's wife anymore. She begged him to give up their farm and their struggle to stay afloat in the farm's punishing Iowa landscape. Even Stephen doesn't like being a cattle farmer, but husbandry got hold of him, and he can't let go.""True, as he inevitably pointed out, they had chosen the farm together...Now the farm seemed to her a prison, not only because of its isolation, but because it meant her unhappiness had its source in his pleasure. It pitted them against each other.""They still loved each other when Angela left, but her departure was a shattering blow for Stephen.Dulcie has become incorrigible. Actually, incorrigible is putting it mildly. She could crush Holden Caulfield between her knees. She is wild, sometimes menacing, possibly disturbed, and her mother, approaching forty and fed-up, decides to send Dulcie to spend the summer with Stephen. In the meantime, Stephen has finally allowed himself to engage in a relationship. He has invited Leah, his paralegal girlfriend, and Leah's 14 year-old spiky daughter, Roxanne, to come live with him.There is a scene toward the beginning of the book, where Angela, naked except for a bathrobe, is forced to follow Dulcie as she sneaks out to skinny dip at the beach with friends. The scene is so appallingly captivating, so riveting, that I knew I was in the hands of a brilliant artist.This is a solid and often poetic read. Never quirky or breezy or whimsical, this combination of outlaw and marginalized characters are adamantine, fierce, seductive. Even Boswell's secondary characters are powerful, unbreakable.I was alternately agonized and appalled. Boswell holds your heart in the palm of his hand. I laughed uncomfortably; I was pinned by his savage story; I cried out loud. For a penetrating story and complex characters with real gravitas, Mystery Ride has all the quality elements--ripe and vicious, vulnerable and noble, piercing and singular. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1044402.Mystery_Ride

Because of the significant social issues contained in this story, such as the mistreatment of animals, corporate misdeeds, and guerilla marketing, this will appeal more to socially conscious individuals and those whose principles stand in opposition to the current CEO-type establishment. But, even then, counterculture types may still not like it if they don't want to see these issues advanced in a novel. That said, I applaud Scarlett Thomas for weaving these controversies in without sermonizing and laying on dull exposition. Thomas is clearly brainy and imaginative. She is subversive without being cynical, intellectual without condescending.Two storylines alternate throughout the novel, and eventually merge into a complex whole. As a child, Alice Butler was raised primarily by her grandparents, as her mother died when she was very young and her father took off to find a buried treasure. Alice's grandfather is a formidable cryptanalyst, cracking codes and ciphers and teaching Alice the essentials of prime numbers, poly-alphabetic ciphers, Vigenere enciphering, and other forms of codes and ciphers. The reader is exposed to some fundamental lessons that are thrilling and mind-boggling. The author infuses this in the story so naturally that it feels organically part of the storyline.Alice's grandmother has been working on the Riemann Hypothesis for many years but has not solved it. Alice's upbringing has made her hyperaware of the layers of complexity that exist in her surroundings, and she is a lover of paradoxes. She is often alienated from her peers, and develops a tough shell due to the immaturity and abuse she endures from her classmates (as well as some teachers). I have never read a book that illuminates adolescent behaviors so well--such as taunting, striving for popularity, the desire to fit in. Not even Margaret Atwood, known for her stark portrayals of teenage predatory behaviors, has illustrated the harrowing anxieties, shame and adversity so baldly and authentically.As an adult, Alice works for the corporate toy company, PopCo, the third largest toy company in the world. The story opens as Alice is on her way to a ""thought camp"" retreat. Her job is coming up with marketing strategies aimed at teenage girls. Her team is designated to design a new product, with specific potential to become a craze. Essentially, create a desire where none exists and persuade teenage girls that they have to have it. The ideation seminars at the thought camp instruct PopCo employees to create identity manias, a veritable fever that infects girls and coaxes them to covet a trend and crave a product.In lesser hands, this could easily become an elongated slogan or a sententious rant. However, Thomas is a gifted writer with a blazing, generous spirit. She is out-of the box and brimming with provocative, piercing ideas that are fleshed out and powerful. This imaginative novel is unclassifiable and yet compelling. The author has a keen sense of adventure, keeping the reader in suspense. Alice's narrative voice has a vital, dynamic sensibility that is suffused with compassion and wisdom beyond her years. The prose is eloquent and her characters fully developed.

His about childhood, adolescence, and a lost father, mine about writing, teaching, and a father found. Our story has come full circle. The story's meaning mystifies me, yet if Frank were alive he'd agree that neither of us would choose to live in a world that was unmarked by the passage of time, and anything other than inscrutable.""Writer, teacher, and philanthropist, Tom Grimes, wrote this memoir about his friendship with Frank Conroy and his struggles with writing and publishing. Grimes opens his narrative in 1980's Key West, where he's striving to write publishable work while earning money as a waiter. After applying to the Iowa Writing Workshop MFA program, he heard Frank Conroy speak at a seminar in Florida. Later, he approached him offstage with enthusiastic questions about writing and the workshop. Conroy, who had recently become Director at Iowa, dismissed him. He ambled right past Tom to talk to a friend, waving him off that his chances of acceptance were slim to zip (in so many words). His confidence punctured, Tom went home to tear up--really, he gutted--Conroy's celebrated memoir, Stop-Time: A Memoir. He tossed it in the garbage and wiped his hands of Frank Conroy.During the subsequent interval of furious emotions--getting rejected by various schools, being frustrated with his job--Tom received a phone call. It was from Conroy, who had no clue that he was speaking to someone he had snubbed. He wouldn't have even remembered the encounter. Frank spoke to him in his hoarse, cigarette-laden voice, saying that he loved his manuscript (Grimes' unfinished novel) and that he has been accepted into the Iowa program. Grimes was ecstatic. He and his wife, Jody, and their two cats, moved to the Midwest to begin the journey of his mentorship and friendship with Conroy.Conroy took Tom under his wing, which caused jealousy in some of Tom's classmates. There are some hilarious and horrifying examples of how this played out in the classroom. Frank believed in Tom's talent and mentored him closely. Eventually, their relationship became more like a father-son bond. Although Conroy was often inexplicable, with a deadpan affect and wooly exterior, he was exuberant about Tom's writing and ambition. He had given him a job teaching freshmen (Tom turned down scholarship money in lieu of real work), and, by increments, invited him into his life.Grimes and Conroy had things in common. They grew up with an absent father; they wrote to secure a center of gravity. Moreover, they shared an emotional hemorrhage into the dark side of their minds. Grimes' description of losing his grip and his personal dislocation with reality was nothing short of riveting. Frank's STOP-TIME memoir describes his repeated attempts to kill himself, without success.Also, they were impassioned teachers and had a knack for organizing others to raise money, as well as culling collaboration on anthologies and projects. Grimes was instrumental in saving Katherine Anne Porter's childhood home in Kyle, Texas. He directs the MFA program at Texas State University (in San Marcos, Texas), which is just minutes away. In persuading others to become part of the project, he helped get the funds to restore her home and use it for visiting writers to the University. As an Austin resident, I remember when the press released the decision to save her house. Conroy was well loved by writers and trustees alike, and he was adept at obtaining endowments for the facility and scholarships for students. Grimes related that Conroy flew to Austin to be at a dying James Michener's bedside. In a lesser man, it would have seemed merely opportunistic. But Conroy did just about everything with aplomb.What is so touching about this memoir is the candid honesty of the narrative. Grimes isn't afraid to reveal his awkwardness, his rejections, and his missteps. He keeps a fluid balance between light and heavy without tipping into a confessional mode. He confides with a generally natural ease, describing how his relationship with Conroy made it difficult for him to separate from his need for Frank's approval. When one of Grimes' novels failed to succeed, it took him years to realize that his confidence in it had been Frank's confidence all along.""I hadn't been able to separate my need for Frank's affection from my need to look at my novel as objectively as possible. Which is why it's taken me twenty years to understand that our unexpected friendship, rather than my novel, was the real work of art.""This is a commendable memoir for budding writers, also. There are teachable moments on the art and craft of writing, a peek at the editing process, and a gaping look at the vicissitudes of the publishing houses.Occasionally, the narrative is too earnest or overripe. Tom's trip home to his family after a tragic event was a bit self-conscious and overwritten. The incident speaks for itself, and required no additional melodrama. However, the impact of such an incident and the difficulty coping with mental illness in family members was poignant. I comprehended that Grimes may have some difficulty with the more gruesome autobiographical memories.There are beautiful nuggets, especially about Tom's relationship with writing, even more so than his relationship with Frank Conroy.""Every day I face a blank page, knowing that the majority of the words I commit to the page will be wrong... But for me writing is a necessity. I exist in sentences. I forget my sense of failure. I forget time. I forget aging. I forget that one day I'll die. Revising sentences is an act of hope, and connecting with a reader is the only leap of faith I'll ever take.""I was unacquainted with Tom Grimes before I read his memoir. I won't forget him easily, though. He made himself transparent and known; he connected with this reader in intimate, echoing ways. Additionally, he invited us into one of the most important relationships in his life, to his deeply touching bond with the enigmatic Frank Conroy. His humanity and his heart form a moving testament to his story. It is a memoir of friendship, faith, time, teaching, writing and reaching out to others....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jul 26, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7840064-mentor

And all this while waiting for the final crunch, as everything becomes everything else as the universe begins its beautiful collapse, panting and sweating until all life arcs out of it and all matter in existence is crushed into a single point and then disappears.""What makes Scarlett Thomas' writing stand out is her gift of largesse--the narrator's generosity combined with a brainy appeal that tunneled fluidly into my psyche. She is plainspoken and warm and yet finely cultivated. Thomas introduces esoteric principles as if it were the natural state of things. She can talk about Derrida and Darwin in a way that is effortless, intuitive. Her protagonist's voice is addictive and honest; indeed, Meg's thoughts mirror the everyday banter inside my head. Like an overlapping image in pictures, her voice became my voice.Meg is stuck. She is stuck in a dead-end relationship with Christopher, while her lips sting from a memorable kiss with unavailable Rowan. She lives in a damp, asthma-inducing flat in Totnes, bogged down in a job writing s of science books, as well as ghost-writing plot-o-matic, genre sci-fi. The novel she began long ago is headed toward entropy. Every time she adds 800 words, she deletes 780 more. At present, Meg has 43 words, and just about that many £ left to her name.At this time, Meg is ing a new science book by Kelsey Newman, who has written The Science Of Living Forever. Newman advances the theory of the coming Omega Point, which is the moment that the universe becomes so dense and full of energy that it will be able to simulate another universe, a new one that will never end, and one in which we will live happily ever after. Forever. Meg dismisses this hypothesis, but it lodges in her mind and lingers in her thoughts.OUR TRAGIC UNIVERSE is not a post-modern novel, despite the implications of the jacket blurb. Yes, there are big ideas and lots of brilliant concepts buzzing on the pages, and speculative philosophies layering the story. But the core of the novel is about love; second chances; the future; the fabric of the universe; how to knit socks; a dog named Bess; a beast from Dartmoor; and how to write a storyless story that may save your life. It is an accessible labyrinth, a compelling page-turner that frequently made me feel smarter than I am and more hopeful than I thought I could be. It is a journey of the mind and body, and there's plenty of love and friendship and everyday twists and tangles.My only (and very minor) complaint is that Meg, who is similar (in voice and sensibilities) to Alice, in Thomas' earlier PopCo, thrashes far longer than Alice in her muddling inertia--a bit of navel-gazing. But she is gradually climbing out of her torpor, for the threat of failure has imposed itself on a woman who believes only in its spectacular opposite.This book is alive with keen contradictions and spirited connections. These are characters you can relate to; they have problems that are infinitely human. The prose flows with reflective, radiant purity and clarity that will cast you under her spell and give you fairy wings to fly through the pages. The narrator's tone is like the best friend you always wanted to have. Scarlett Thomas is a celestial storyteller--a supernova, a literary bodhisattva. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7140917-our-tragic-universe

The Product is a promise to live forever, through ""dechronification"" and other life extension interventions. To qualify, you must have an LDH, ACTH, and BMI index in the super-healthy ranges, as well as a high credit ranking and a mood to match. If your blood levels are too high, and your credit rank too low, then you are deemed Impossible to Preserve. Additionally, there are LWNIs (Low Net Worth Individuals) living in tents around the city, in areas surrounding Central Park.Everyone can ""scan"" everyone with an äppärät that they carry around their neck, which is essentially a futuristic, jacked up iphone. When you walk by a credit pole, it scans your rating. Others can scan your cholesterol levels, your history, and your net worth, and there is a score revealing your personality and Fu**ability quotient. Everyone texts through their GlobalTeen account, and the line between personal communication and media is blurry.Lenny is a retro man heading toward Impossible to Preserve. He is a little flabby, a little unhealthy, but his credit is still tight. It was love at first sight when he met twenty-something Eunice Park in Rome. Tiny--barely 80 pounds--and beautiful, she is a Korean American from Fort Lee, New Jersey with a long, thick mane and fetching, tea-colored freckles. Her father, a once successful podiatrist, abuses her, her sister, Sally, and her mother. She has broken free but is constantly worried about her mother and Sally's safety from her tyrannical father.Eunice agrees to go to NY and stay with Lenny, but she is disgusted--by his bunions, his non-breathable clothing, and the way he brushes his teeth. However, the almost impossible happens and she gradually falls in love with him and helps him to ""improve."". This novel is their story--the love story of Lenny and Eunice amidst a post-modern world of onionskin pants, the quest for zero-calorie food, and the search for eternal youth.This is a brilliant send-up of people's obsession with media, money, youth, and pop cluture, and Shtyngart writes for the reader, maintaining a clear focus within this outrageous and harrowing world. As absurd as it is, there is a frightening authenticity to its themes. The economy is unraveling while tightening the noose around everyone's neck. Everyone wants to be everyone else while simultaneously wanting to be more of her/himself. Identity is wrapped up in square boxes with streaming data, and people like Lenny are a fading value.Shtyngart has his finger on the pulse of our times, but he also has his hand on our hearts. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 03, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7334201-super-sad-true-love-story

In 1895, ocScience, religion, and language intersect in this edgy, Judeo-mystic satire about love, brotherhood, and neuroses in fin-de-siècle Vienna. In 1895, oculist Jakob Sammelsohn meets Sigmund Freud on the same night that he eyes and falls in love with Freud's primary patient, Emma Eckstein. As Jakob is guided into Freud's world of psychoanalysis, he reluctantly becomes a guide himself. He plunges into the mythological realm of a dybbuk, the dislocated spirit of his dead wife, Ita, who possesses and inhabits Emma. Or so Ita-as-Emma claims. As the relationship intensifies between Jakob, Freud, and Emma, Ita's haunting voice lures Jakob into a psychosexual seduction. But here in Vienna, the cultural center of the world, supernatural notions and Jewish folklore is rejected in favor of more intrepid theories of science and psychology. Freud believes Emma is in the throes of hysteria, while his friend, Dr. Fliess, advances the theory of ""nasal reflex neurosis"" as the source of all unhappiness. In the meantime, Jakob just wants to lose his virginity. His tyrannical father, who spoke to him only in Hebrew scripture, forced him to marry Ita, the village ""idiot,"" after the first forced marriage to Hindele ended in chaste disaster. Just after the wedding, Ita fled and drowned herself. But she is back and commanding Jakob with menace and affection. Jakob later meets Dr. Ludvik Zamenhof, a half-blind, retired oculist and language enthusiast. Zamenhof's aim is to join all of humanity in a utopian, universal language called Esperanto. When Jakob meets the radiant Esperanto patron, Loe Bernfeld, he is smitten. Subsequently, Jakob is thrust into an idealistic world of love and linguistics--the neutral tongue to unite the world and a passionate one to join him with Loe. But the ether world has a different design on this incurable romantic. Jakob's Hebraic-Homeric journey is full of colorful and magical characters, such as bickering, burly angels; a bedeviling dybbuk; a wicked demon child; and zealous polyglots, to name just a few. A clash of the titans of intellect and faith crosscut through the leviathans of lexicon and argot. The story follows Jakob from the countryside of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to the cultural hub of Vienna, from the terrifying streets and ghetto of Warsaw, and to celestial, rarefied dimensions. ""Indeed, I was quite the romantic. A man would have to be heartless not to be, and a fool not to outgrow it. Of course, every Jew wishes to summon the Messiah, to draw him down, through the force of his own goodness, from the throne upon which he sits chained in the Heavens. But one might profitably ask: Who has chained him there, if not the Lord Himself, the devil being a theological convenience we Jews...forbid ourselves?"" Skibell's tale is wholly imaginative and inventive, with ripe and rollicking prose and outrageous, unforgettable characters. In addition, it is peppered with an array of languages and dialog, most notably Hebrew and the enigmatic Esperanto, which endow symbolic and metaphoric texture to the narrative. At times, he is overwrought and long-winded, dawdling down his shadowy side streets and rambling for too long in his self-indulgent thoughts. But his ardent, spunky voice keeps the reader engaged and hooked in this fantastical and sometimes unearthly odyssey. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Aug 10, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8087582-a-curable-romantic

What, or who, put the ""y"" in unhappy, in dysfunction? Canadian author Lee Kvern mines this question with a brutally honest sensitivity in her intimate family portrait of Lloyd and Jacqueline Burrows and their three children--""four, if you count Sylvie.""In short, enigmatic, alternating chapters, over three decisive Wednesdays in three successive decades, the story of the Burrows family is teased out with measured restraint from its blistering beginnings to its nuanced conclusion. Three days of narratives gradually unite--Jacqueline in 1961, Lloyd in 1973, and Lesa, their oldest daughter, in 1987--and the years between them melt away and form a cohesive, lucent whole.In the punishing prairie landscape of Red Deer, in Calgary, Jacqueline Burrows lives with her philandering husband, Lloyd, and their three small children, in a small and indistinct row house next to other RCMP wives, aka ""the abandoned wives."" Lloyd is on the night shift of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and is rarely home. In 1961, Jacqueline is pregnant and exhausted, her maternal eyes on Lesa, Nate, and Sylvie, as they frolic bantam-like through the street. A devoted and sensible mother, she nevertheless relies on five-year-old Lesa as her bulwark to keep Sylvie close.Sylvie was born asphyxiated, the cord wrapped around her neck. She was left with severe mental challenges and suffers from grand mal seizures. Jacqueline loves her fiercely but is overcome with guilt.On this hot July Wednesday, Jacqueline sees Sylvie (from the kitchen window) start to climb in a strange man's car. She intervenes and saves her with a scream, blames Lesa for failing to protect her, and subsequently chides herself. To make matters worse, the RCMP can't find her husband when she calls for help.""She thinks about her husband...in the arms, the bed of some other woman. Another other. And...while she no longer wants her husband--whether by God or by the sheer luminosity of their children, she needs him. The two are twisted up like electrical wires, complicated and live.""Flash forward to February, 1973, and Corporal Lloyd's narrative. His shift has ended, but he is embroiled in rescuing Jimmy Widman, the town drunk, who has been beaten senselessly and left frozen in the snow. Jimmy has had countless drunk-and-disorderly troubles, and no authority wants to help him anymore. But the taciturn corporal overextends himself and risks his job to help him.Ironically, Lloyd recoils from home life and is often absent during family crises. Early in the marriage, he was Dudley-Do-Right to Jacqueline's Nell, but the moniker has faded along with his vows; the matter of Sylvie has eroded his love."" He sits in his cruiser, motor idling, glances down Main Street--his street, his town...farmers, ranchers, one doctor, one vet...one drive-in theater...one wife, three--no, four children, if he counts Sylvie, but he seldom does. The cruel, imperfect line across her small lips, her dark eyes glimmering like Lloyd's, like the blonde's in the bar last night...""The connection of Jimmy's destiny to the Burrows' fate is disclosed through the drama of his story. Lloyd hauls a bundled-up Widman through hoops in a cat-and mouse chase to save Widman's life and perhaps his own soul.Lesa's Wednesday of 1987 begins with a plane ride home to visit her mother in Red Deer. She's a wreck, an adolescent at thirty-one. She flirts shamelessly but silently with a stranger at the airport, hoping to--she doesn't know what. Her live-in boyfriend is home in Vancouver, but she's terrified of emotional intimacy. She has dyed her firebrand red hair to the inky black of Sylvie's, her agenda unknown.Moreover, she is parading around in a super-hero costume with spiked pleather boots and a tawdry wig. (Her excuse--it is almost Halloween) Her brother, Nate, doesn't recognize her at the baggage claim. When they get to Red Deer, her courage takes a flying leap. She deposits Nate at Jacqueline's door and goes on an adventure in her Storm costume and cape that is poised to either sabotage or awaken her life.""She wishes she were a kid again. That brief period of time when no matter what, all is forgiven; everything slips away like silk to skin, smoke to air, a magician's trick performed by her mother...She knows the trick of the dysfunctional family all too well in that it leaves you lacking, looking for something that doesn't exist.""This isn't a sentimental story about caring for Sylvie, a child with special needs. It is about a family's catalyst to a long, uncertain truth. Sylvie, at age four, was that catalyst, on a particular thorny day when Murphy's Law and Wednesdays became destiny. In elegiac and spare prose, Kvern brings the reader from the oblique to the sublime, from the edges of the family to the heart of the matter...of Sylvie....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Sep 05, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9413809-the-matter-of-sylvie

Lines drawn across my face divide my horizons--mark the end of my childhood and the beginning of another phase--these fractions of my life blur together if I am honest now.""This is a short but pungent tale about crime, betrayal, passion, love, and a scar--both real and psychic. How juicy is that? Especially when you blend in the Côtes du Rhône-Villages wine made from the dark-skinned Syrah, Mourvèdre, and Cisault grapes. Throw in a pivotal love affair, a chateau, a virulent father, and an odious priest, and you have the crushing, pressing, and fermenting ingredients of a serious page-turner. The title refers to the legacy of the protagonist--the chateau, estate, and wine cellar he is set to inherit.In a tiny village at the foot of the Dentelles Mountains, sixteen-year-old Christian Aragon is finishing up his education at the village lycée. The year is 1920, and his brother Eugene has already died in the Great War several years ago. His father (Papa) runs the wine chateau of Montmirail and expects Christian to honor his legacy and enter the family business. His mother has no influence on the racist, violent, and hateful rages of Papa, and Christian is often the beneficiary of undeserved beatings and mental cruelty.""In the countryside, where the village is the kingdom and the child is the peasant, the father is king. The son is like a granite rock on the edge of a vineyard; his job is to reflect, and his destiny is to remain in that place forever.""Christian is a headstrong, fearless young man who has experienced loss and deep sorrow. Besides the death of his brother, there was a boy, Couderc, who inflicted a large facial scar on him with a hunting knife. Cicatrice is the French word for scar, and for a time this became Christian's sobriquet. Coudrec died of TB a year later, and Christian grieves for him. They shared an enigmatic glance the last time they met in the village square, right before he died.Christian is psychologically advanced for his years; he's a complex, self-willed, and passionate young man that hails the freedom of the spirit, the self, and the soul.""I believe most of all in the inherent capacity man and woman possess to change.""""...to become what we want, and to refuse to continue to be who and what we are if those manifestations do not reflect our own desires.""Fate brings opportunity and a school trip effects a turning point for Christian. Desire leads to love and consequences, and a crime could bring ruin on Christian's life and the life of his beloved, Vivienne Pleyben, his geography teacher. To add brimstone to the fire, the Jesuit priest, Father Leterrier, inadvertently learns of Christian and Vivienne's relationship and tries to turn it into a sordid affair. Letterier is an obsessive fanatic and a hypocrite who is mired in his own secret desires and contradictions. He comes in twice a month to instruct the adolescents on moral welfare and ""Holy Purity,"" and delivers his sermons with a frightening zeal.Christian does have a friend, George Phavorin, his father's foreman, who offers indefatigable loyalty and fatherly love. His character is a striking contrast to Christian's bully of a father.The narrative is told by Christian in a solemn style that fits the times and setting. There is a mournful rim, but the tone is blended with the compelling and muscular verve of the protagonist. The final scene is foreshadowed with a hint of danger and a tortured suspense, and the ending is satisfying and messy, but strangely immaculate.Conor Bowman is an Irish author who spent many summers in France. Like George Moore(1852-1933), he is a largely naturalistic writer that was obviously influenced by the French realist writers, like Émile Zola(1840-1902). However, there is a healthy dose of Romanticism in this tale that offsets the harsh darkness and pervasive pessimism of the former writers. This is his first novel published in the United States. I look forward to his next novel, THE REDEMPTION OF GEORGE BAXTER HENRY.This  refers to an ARC received complementary from the publisher.

The myth of the first Thanksgiving shapes and parallels the thematic core of Vanderbes' new novel, a scathing, biting, and bitterly droll portrait of a suburban family that takes place on Thanksgiving 2007. It is no coincidence that Stamford Connecticut, the site of the massacre against hundreds of Pequots by Puritans (and the cause for the second Thanksgiving celebration), is the story's site of greedy real estate expansion and criminal expropriation under the deception of eminent domain and public safety.On the one hand, this story of the Olsens can be read as a novel of a modern-day dysfunctional family in America. This includes a Yale graduate turned Vietnam vet (Gavin); Gavin's Wellesley grad wife, Eleanor, who spent her entire adult years as a housewife; their leftist academic daughter, Ginny, who majored in the history of the American family and who, as a single mother, adopted a mute, seven-year-old orphan from India; their son, Douglas, a real-estate entrepreneur on the verge of bankruptcy due to the subprime crash; and Douglas's wife, Denise, who escaped her blue-collar roots in Pittsburgh and desires a comfortable, upper-middle class comfort zone for them and their three children.On the other hand, Vanderbes probes beneath the family itself and mines deep into the myths that underlie and underscore the American dream, as well as taking on issues of race, class, and the basis of war and the male warrior mentality.The novel could be said to be a pastiche of Wharton, Franzen, Updike, Roth, Bellow, and other prolific writers of social criticism and the nuclear family. But Vanderbes puts her own thumbprint on this tragedy, especially with her creation of Eleanor Olsen. Eleanor is a shattering composite of strength and fragility, a fiercely loyal and upright wife and mother who is also a sad and fractured soul. There is a private moment between her and Gavin that centers on a singular opportunity for Eleanor to write professionally. It is so penetrating and heart-stopping that I had to put down the book and weep. Moreover, her palpable sense of exile throughout the story just blew me away.""Her friend...noticed the same thing: this menopausal cloak of invisibility. They were a forsaken demographic...Still, she sometimes wished she had known that a time would come when the world would quietly brush her under the rug, suggest she kindly step out of its way.""As the family gathers at Douglas and Denise's McMansion in Greenwich, a crime invades their tenuous peace and shatters the shaky boundaries between the privileged and the poor, the dominant and the dislocated. And in this novel, the shock waves occur after the denouement. The climax is the cauldron and the anti-climax is the scorching segment of the story, the boiling spill that turns everything upside down.This is a page-turner that reads like a domestic thriller. It isn't without its annoyances, such as Ginny's irritating and pedantic political correctness that borders on fanatic. However, the author has a purpose here and deals with it quite capably . Each person will surprise you; just when you think you are in-step with events and tuned into the characters, the narrative tilts and shifts you into a gear that simultaneously revs you up and brings you to a grinding halt. This is a savage must-read to feast on. The prose is tart; the words are edible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Aug 25, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7114359-strangers-at-the-feast

But, like a fist through her soul, he signed up for a major offensive, another twenty-eight days. Barely holding her sanity together--her husband, Ilan, has trekked off to Bolivia with her oldest son, Adam--she flees from her fear of the ""notifiers"" (the government officials who deliver grave news) and leaves, anyway, sans cell phone and contact access.Ora pleads with her reclusive old friend and former lover, Avram, erstwhile best friend to Ilan, to accompany her to the Galilee. She believes that, with Avram, they can form a thread that ties them to the land, to nature, to safety, to Ofer, and weave a tapestry that protects him from peril. With Avram, she can magically keep Ofer alive. No one else can extinguish bad thoughts and assist her to defy fate.""...she was always easy with Avram, letting him see all of her, almost from the first moment she met him, because she had a feeling, a conviction that there was something inside her, or someone, perhaps an Ora more loyal to her own essence, more precise and less vague, and Avram seemed to have a way to reach her.""Years ago, Avram and Ilan were soldiers together, and the story explains how Avram lost his artistic spirit and love of words and suffered permanent damage and a death of the soul. As they hike, climb and acclimate to the wild terrain, Ora recapitulates the story of her family--the details of raising her sons and her forsaken marriage to Ilan. The germination and withering of the friendship between Ora, Avram, and Ilan is recounted in flashbacks and threaded into her story as a wife and mother.The following quote refers to Ora talking to Ofer when he was only a few hours old:""It surprised me how simple the story was when I told it to him. That was the first time (and probably the last) that I was able to think about us that way. The whole complication that was us, me and Avram and Ilan, all of a sudden became one little unequivocal child, and the story was simple.""The reader clings to the tensile wire of a mortal coil that underscores this hefty opus. Ora is beseeching the universe to keep Ofer alive while simultaneously striving to rescue Avram's spirit. The secrets and treacheries they share and their separate and private agonies are knotted together, and the frayed but enduring fibers unwind and snap through the story.Grossman is an eloquent and assiduous writer of internal struggle and emotional combat. He leaves no stone unturned, and the reader is saturated with Ora's psyche on every page. I was sometimes exhausted with the relentless, strenuous tone of his narrative. The surplus verbiage and chronic turmoil drowned his beautiful nuances and periodically made reading a chore. Ora's self-indulgence struck me as pretext for the author's prolixity.However, there is abundant beauty and unbreakable heart to this story, which, while swollen at times, is never pompous. It is visceral and sometimes surreal, but much less stream-of-consciousness and magical realism than some of his previous novels purport to be. And, from Avram, there was often relief from Ora's tautology. The sections on him were full of delightful, clever word-play and ribald wit.Aesthetically, the final, transcendent scene was painterly, exquisite, and delicate, recalling, for me, (in spirit, not in actual event) the elegance in the final scene of Kate Grenville's story of war, The Lieutenant. Grossman shakes the reader with the toll of war and the trials of raising a family. The burdens of choice, ambivalence, and fate linger on from one generation to the next.This moving story has a loose, allegorical significance to Tolstoy's War and Peace and reworks the first line to Anna Karenina to remind us that all happy families are miserable in different ways....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Sep 02, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7779571-to-the-end-of-the-land

In the fertile flat lands of South Texas, in the fictional town of Dalton, 1895, Karel Skala is the fourth son born to Vaclav and Klara, and the one that results in Klara's death. Vaclav's pain shuts him down, and he forsakes holding his son.Instead, Vaclav treats Karel and his brothers like draught horses and works them to the bone on the farm. As Karel grows and develops into an apt horse rider and racer, Vaclav gambles land, and Karel rides to win. A particular race in 1910 squeezes the last morsel of strained loyalty and affection between Karel, his three brothers, and his father.The story goes back and forth in time between 1895 and 1924, in a seamless and tension-building tale that is both heart stopping and lushly evocative. Machart writes like a veteran writer and is reminiscent of William Faulkner and Cormac McCarthy, both for his brutal tale of family instability and his towering, metaphorical passages tying the land to the people, and the narrative of his social and moral themes surrounding the decay, anguish, and redemption of the human heart. Like McCarthy, Machart has an arresting, commanding sense of predator and prey:""Across the creek along the far bank, near the tangle of water oak and pine roots and the deep impression of boot soles in the wet silt, she [the amber-eyed horned-owl] discerns the slightest distinction in the clustered dancing of bluestem spires, knowing by some sharp and instinctive insistence in the grainy fibers of her muscles that rain and wind bend the uppermost inches of grass blades while the scuttling of prey and the dragging of a tail will set the reeds to shivering upward from the tillers.""Machart's frequently long and undulating sentences are not awkward or burdensome, as his assured, poetic, and elegant style takes the reader deeper and more evocatively into the richness of the landscape and the texture of Karel's pain. Soon after the race of 1910, Karel quits riding, folds up into himself, and begins his own family and future without reconciling his past. The story brings the reader into key events in a well-paced manner that also teases out the facts gradually. The past and the present intersect in the denouement with an uncompromising and resolute exhilaration. Getting there allows the reader to accompany Karel into the territory of his tormented soul.""It occurred to Karel that this was the way the whole county must see them, as the family that everyone but they themselves recognized as such, and the thought of being the kind of fool who called for fair weather when green clouds folded up in hail-bearing corrugations on the horizon wicked at him until he felt parched and withered and longing, like a cotton plant wilting in a month-long drought, for the unabated battering of that which might save him.""Whether it is the rich, metallic smell of rain; the mineral scent of flooded soil; a sun-struck fence; a moonlit winter pine; or stray swirls of cotton in the brisk, smoky air of a burning mesquite tree, Machart sears the images of his story so thoroughly that they will cascade down your spine and give you an electric buzz.

This book begins roughly where the other left off, circa 1989, and then segues to fourteen years later midway through the novel. It is the story of love and family, and the vicissitudes of six or less degrees of separation.Middle-aged Dick had an affair with nubile Elsie (in Spartina), which resulted in baby Rose. Dick, the boat-builder and sea-lover, lives primarily out on the ocean. When he is landlocked, Dick stays in the house with his wife, May, and their two sons, Charlie and Tom. Dick and May have not quite resolved the pink elephant in the boat's deck. May wants Rose to be part of their lives, and she hasn't fully forgiven Dick. She is tormented about seeing Rose, and about not seeing Rose. How to accommodate the X-factor, Elsie?

It seemed as endless as pulling rocks out of a field.""Elsie is free-spirited and nature loving. A Natural Resources officer, she is euphemistically called ""the warden of the Great Swamp."" Despite her affair with Dick, she is a sympathetic, strong, and enchanting character. She is feisty and warm, as seen through her nurturing devotion to the island's aging doyenne, Miss Perry. And she still loves Dick.""She [Elsie] looked at Dick's face. She'd wanted him for the certainty of his fierce instincts; she'd put herself in the way of them. Now he was uncertain. Perhaps he was undone by seeing his daughter--perhaps he was undone by the trouble he was in.""This tight-knit, incestuous Irish community, where almost everyone is related by blood or marriage, is a roaring and clattering collection of individuals that form an uneasy alliance of entanglements and estrangements. As Rose grows up, she bickers hotly with her mother; while Elsie is the butterfly, Rose is the butterfly out of the chrysalis.But Rose is also the compass, or the ""compass rose."" Casey uses this nautical term as a superb extended metaphor, whereby there are two rings--the outside ring denoting cardinal directions and the inner ring referring to magnetic cardinal directions. Rose's positioning in the two families exemplifies the symbolic and directional purview of their bonds--to each other, to the island, and to the trajectory of their hearts.I had to start this book twice. The stylized beginning has staccato sentences and bulleted names, initially confusing me and turning me off. However, it is short-lived, and Casey's prose soon opens into a poetic and lyrical rhythm. The cadence is occasionally offbeat, but is uniquely exhilarating and provides a salty mood and atmosphere. The story is spicy, unpredictable and mouth-wateringly messy. The wily characters sizzle--from the dedication of Rose's protectors, such as Mary Scanlon, the town's chef and songbird, to Jack Aldrich, the town's land-grabbing, acquisitive swine.""...it was part of the same thing over and over, the sun heating the surface of the ocean, vapor rising into clouds and fog, blowing over the land, turning back into water and running back into the sea, carrying bits of earth, the earth made of cracked and crumbled rock and the dead matter of everything else once so busily alive.""I felt like one of the residents of South County. John Casey is an assured storyteller whose spiky, nervy characters fly off the pages with pluck and spunk and longing. I highly recommend this for readers who love resonant, character-driven stories.

Krassner, circa 1988. Was it an accident, a suicide, At the center of this Swedish espionage thriller is the death of an American journalist, John P. Krassner, circa 1988. Was it an accident, a suicide, or murder? The facts known at the opening is that first his body and then his boot falls from the 16th floor of a student dormitory. The boot struck and killed a Pomeranian named Charlie. Charlie's owner, Vindel, is trying to recount the seconds between the body and the boot falling from the window. After this wry and arresting opening, the reader is plunged into a dense and plodding world of Swedish politics. The characters and their careers are portrayed in all their Byzantine splendor, from the intricacies of the police and secret police (SePo) departments; to the police surveillance squad and covert operations; inside the Swedish Parliament; as well as the connections to WW II, the Cold War, and the U.S. central intelligence agency. There are many circuitous routes in the midst of this story, from the Russian communists to the beginnings of Sweden's system of neutrality. Lars Johansson is a solitary man, a ""real policeman,"" and the police superintendent on his way to becoming the head of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. He is a perspicacious type who seems to see around corners and figure out how things stand. The case comes to his attention from his best friend, Detective Chief Inspector, Bo Jarnebring, (from the department's surveillance squad). He received Krassner's belongings, including his boots, which had a hollow heel and a slip of paper stating ""an honorable cop, Lars Johansson,"" complete with Johansson's address and phone number and a key to a safety deposit box. Additionally, there appears to be a suicide note typed on Krassner's Panasonic and parts of a manuscript of a book documenting and revealing spy secrets and transcripts of the West. Lars had never heard of Krassner before, and this begins his investigation into the case. While Johansson is in the U.S. for some FBI training seminars, he follows up with Krassner's ex-girlfriend, Sarah Weissman, to seek out more information. This proves valuable and sets him on a trail of espionage leading back to WW II and the OSS. Krassner's uncle was a spy and an intransigent Irish racist who passed on his traits and his personal effects to his nephew. In the meantime, Erik Berg, the head of SePo, is apprised of the case. He brings in his best friend, Claes Waltin, who he doesn't fully trust. Waltin is the Police Superintendent and head of external operations. He is also a psychopath and a sexual deviant who keeps his perversions under wraps and uses his shrewd talent to further his personal and career ambitions. As story unfolds, a web is manifested that expands into several areas of the government, covering a wide range of people and bureaus, including the Ministry of Justice. The author, while keeping the reader with one eye blind, teases out the facts gradually and uncovers a tremendous trail of secrets that connect, interconnect, and even disconnect various departments and governments. There is a huge cast of characters, made up primarily of assorted members of the police force. Moreover, there are other colorful people and events, such as an alcoholic professor, a ""deep throat"" type, female exploitation by Waltin, a heavy-lidded special advisor to the prime minister, and the fascinating childhoods of Waltin and Johansson. And there are enough hearty, heavy meals to whet the appetite and gain ten pounds! I was intrigued by the elaborate story and the complexities of plot and character. The problem was that, after the droll opening, the narrative style becomes ponderous and almost crushes under its own weight. The pace was labored and read much like a text or chronicle. It was too often too dry, and would have been improved with more of the sly levity that characterized the opening pages. Instead, it was frequently fraught with detail and tedious profiling. But his acumen--what makes people tick--kept me wanting more. Moreover, the book was highly engaging and entertaining when Persson portrayed certain incompetent members of the police force and their operations as comparable to Keystone Kops adventures. And, in the end, Persson doesn't let the reader down. We eventually understand that Krassner is at the center of a Gordian Knot with many fibers. After reading the author's bio sketch, I understood his style better. Persson has chronicled the political and social development of modern Swedish society for more than three decades in his novels. He has served as an adviser to the Swedish Ministry of Justice and is Sweden's most renowned psychological profiler. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Sep 04, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8718765-between-summer-s-longing-and-winter-s-end

It is the gateway to Mecca, but also the most cosmopolitan of cities in Saudi Arabia. It lends itself to exploring the conflicts between a more traditional way of thinking and a more progressive outlook. The novel contains men and women on various sides of belief, as well as the American perspective. In Jeddah, laws are more liberal, and lend itself to some ambiguity, such as the wearing of the burqa for women. It isn't mandated like in Riyadh, but you still may end up being picked up by the religious police.The novel opens with a dead body of a woman, brutally mutilated, washed up on the beach. Unidentified, they labeled her ""Eve,"" after Eve's tomb, the narrow strip of beach north of Jeddah where she is found.We then cut to Miriam Walker, an American woman boarding the plane (after a month-long vacation in the States) back to Saudi Arabia to return to her husband, Eric, who is working for a year as a bodyguard and making good money. Miriam is concerned because he is warming to Saudi culture. She is cold on the culture and doesn't enjoy being cloistered, not being able to drive, and being treated as a second-class citizen. She meets a strange Western man on the plane, Apollo Mabus, who is a Qu'ran scholar.The story moves forward and backward, introducing the main characters, such as Osama, the more progressive inspector of police, and Nayir, a conflicted man who holds tightly to tradition while it slips away. He loves Katya, a lab technician in the crime lab. She has a lot of ambition, and getting married at twenty is not high on the list of her priorities.The novel delicately scrutinizes Jeddah's way of life as it probes the evidence in this case. I was more fascinated with the social interrogation than the tracking of Eve's killer. The thriller aspect lacked tension, and the outcome was a bit anticlimactic for me. But the story's inquiry into Islamic beliefs, and how it affected the individual characters, held my attention far more than the crime-solving. I even chuckled a few times, such as the revealing of the ""burqini""--Islam's acceptable form on the Western bikini.If you are looking for a super crime-thriller, this may not fulfill that desire. The pacing is casual and rarely taut. But, there was a superb adventure out in the desert in a fierce sandstorm. That was a nail-biter. However, if you are up for a peek behind the burqa, into the clash of Islamic culture within its own community, as well as the American (mal)adaptation to living there, you're in for a satisfying tale. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 15, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7168509-city-of-veils

Equal parts dystopian thriller, bildungsroman, penetrating psychological portrait, love story, and psychosocial examination, it is told through the context of a parallel universe. The harrowing truths of these children's lives are revealed elaborately yet with deceptive simplicity by Ishiguro. The reader isn't jolted by the science fiction aspect but rather by the emotional intensity of the exquisitely controlled narrative's unfolding. I have rarely read a book of speculative fiction that is this superbly nuanced. You could knock me over with a feather by the end of the story.In the rural British countryside resides Hailsham, a privileged and insular boarding school with wild fields, ponds, and fences demarcating boundaries from the outside world. The story is narrated in three parts by thirty-one year-old Kathy, who reminisces about herself, Ruth, and Tommy, three friends who met there as children. It reads like a chronicle or diary, with Kathy's alchemy of naturalness, naiveté, and sublime powers of observation reminiscing almost like an open letter. As the novel opens, Kathy is reflecting on her life as a ""carer"" and recapitulating the many events that brought the three of them together, split them apart, and united them again.At Hailsham, the children work diligently to produce qualifying pieces of art to get chosen for Madam's mysterious gallery. Tommy struggles to find his creativity and hold his temper, while Ruth's opinionated and ruthless decisions often overrule those of the peacemaker, Kathy. Their friendship is built on the firmament of secrets, lies and a sheltered upbringing by circumspect teachers, or ""guardians."" When one of these guardians deigns to reveal more than is customary to the students, she is dismissed. The children grow up learning the truth by degrees about their future lives as ""carers"" and ""donors."" Information is smuggled into lessons in a crafty way that ultimately makes them feel like it was something that they have always known.""This might all sound daft, but you have to remember that to us, at that stage in our lives, any place beyond Hailsham was like a fantasy land; we had only the haziest notions of the world outside and about what was and wasn't possible there.""I went into this novel knowing nothing about the chilling facts of the story. I recommend that you know as little as possible, also, in order for the impact to be consummate and undiminished. Kathy's intimate tone is (ironically) oblique, giving the mournful narrative an edge and anxiety that accumulates and teases the reader through to the bittersweet conclusion.The finale left me breathless and sobbing, and I continue to revisit the rich themes of this bleak but unexpectedly inspiriting story. What makes us human? What gives us a soul? What is the meaning of an individual life? This moving, compassionate story offers germane insights, and for this reader, will never let me go.Addendum: After finishing the book, I watched the movie trailer. Wow--talk about spoiler spoiler spoiler. It highlighted just about everything that is wrong with Hollywood. What the trailer does is bluntly give away what Ishiguro masterfully reveals gradually, by suggestion. That is what makes Ishiguro such a genius in this work. The movie trailer felt absurdly like it was undermining the beauty of the book by dismantling the exalted subtlety of the narrative and replacing it with obvious and heavy-handed cues. My fear is that the movie will fail to be vigilantly discreet and will instead induce horror conspicuously. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Oct 03, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6334.Never_Let_Me_Go

Born in Virginia in 1916, he was raised by a magical-thinking mother who was always looking for Mr. Moneybags, or ""Mr. Produce the Cash."" She moved William to Mexico when he was just a lad after she hooked up with an enigmatic rancher and oilman, Enrique.Told primarily in a diarized form, the book depicts Shepherd from his boyhood at Enrique's hacienda, where he becomes part of the kitchen help; through his friendship with Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo; to his work as Lev Trotsky's amanuensis; as a best-selling writer of historical novels; and finally, as an outcast and scapegoat for public scorn and damnation.The word lacuna has meaning both concretely and metaphorically. Physically, it is a cave under the water at the base of a cliff in a cove that Shepherd frequented as a child. Well, not exactly a cave, but an opening, like a mouth, that swallows things. It also refers to the universal definition of a gap, or missing part, as in a manuscript, series, or logical argument. Kingsolver weaves the concept of a lacuna beautifully and unerringly through the novel. Yellow journalism during the Red Scare is a result of government and media-staged lacunae and crowd mentality, and the people and events in Shepherd's life have an engagement with lacunae on either a mirco- or macrocosmic level.This is Kingsolver's most powerful book to date, and most sublime. The style and tone are matter-of-fact, which allows the reader to spot the toxicity, the menace, of a society's ills and ill will toward its fellow man, as well as the poison of gossip and misinformation. The U.S. propaganda machine during the Cold War was venomous, and the novel illuminates this through newspaper articles and press releases from that era, threaded through the text. The author never forgets the central story, however, and Shepherd's life is always the most paramount to the reader. We experience him as honest and noble, the casualty of the howlers, the mark of public evangelism, and the newspeak's agitprop. In lesser hands, this could have been a sententious cautionary tale, but Kingsolver's exalted novel is poignant, arresting, and supremely satisfying.This is primarily a theme-driven story. Famous historical figures are somewhat attenuated in order to keep focused on the protagonist and the story. It is Shepherd's relation to the characters that matter, and the public distortion of them, not so much the characters in isolation. It is a densely populated canvas with dozens of smaller parts and walk-ons. When we step away from the canvas, we see a landscape of hot political climates that have frozen some souls and fired up others. Through this story, the author has excavated some heavy revelations of our past. She has mined the breach between truth and public presumption--between lies, false candor, and principles.

The desk is largely a monument to Jewish survival, loss, and recovery, and mirrors the dissolution, pain, and dire hope of each character. Additionally, it is a covetous object, given a poignant and existential significance by the chorus of voices that are bound to it by their memories.""Bend a people around the shape of what they lost, and let everything mirror its absent form.""This elegiac story opens with Nadia, a now divorced and successful writer, who received the desk in 1972 from a Chilean poet, Daniel Varsky. Daniel needed a place to store furniture, and Nadia had an empty house. After a long night that resulted only in a brief kiss, he leaves her his desk, as well as other pieces of furniture, and returns to Chile and the tragic conditions of Pinochet's Junta regime. He never returns. Years later, during a particularly low period of her life, she receives a call from a woman, Leah Weisz, who alleges to be Varsky's daughter, and who has called to claim the desk. In the midst of this narrative, we occasionally break to Nadia confessing to an unknown ""Your Honor."" Nadia's attachment to the desk is profound and the loss of it signals keen despair.Leah and her brother have lived a nomadic (yet insular) privileged life with their father, George, a mordant, esteemed antiques dealer who is legendary for his prowess in recovering any loss object. He is obsessed with scrupulously reconstructing his father's study, to make it the way it was before the Gestapo pillaged it during World War II. Odd as this may seem, this reassembling in relation to Jewish culture and history is sublime.There is another Jewish family, a father with two sons, Dov and Uri, whose link to the desk is more obscure and is revealed in the latter part of the book. He plaintively details the loss of his wife, Eve, and confesses to the tenuous relationship with his sons. Its climactic section is the weakest and most strained of all. I suspect that Krauss used it as a more concrete connective device.We also meet a grieving widower, Arthur, whose wife, Lotte, once in possession of the desk, died of Alzheimer's and left an elusive trail to a dark secret. Arthur warily and then desperately decides to investigate her past. The strands of Arthur's narrative lead to connections with other voices and a searing self-examination. Certainties are founded on shifting sand; a commanding desk holds many compartments.The central denouement (there is more than one climactic scene) is the most moving and mystical of all the segments of the book, and for this reader, poetic and riveting. Its link to ancient Jewish culture is beautifully rendered and breathtaking. It makes sense of the entire book, as well as the title. I am tremendously indebted to Nicole Krauss for hypnotically transporting me to this summit of Judaic history.Krauss is a cultivated and gifted prose writer; she edifies the reader with striking imagery while digging down to the boots of a person's soul. At times, she is long-winded, which nearly thwarts the pace of the story. And the peppering of Nadia's proclamations to ""Your Honor"" was a stylistic choice that didn't always work for me and felt self-conscious.This non-linear and (architecturally) unorthodox story covers approximately sixty years, and is theme-driven; plot is secondary. The engagement is often cerebral, but also powerful and emotionally acute as the threads unravel. Additionally, what contents can lay for years in a locked compartment? What does a key open us to? There is much gravitas and many memories to unlock.Some characters seem oblique, impinged upon by the relentless peal of confession, or lack distinction from each other. They run together, like spilled ink, (but sympathetically so). It may be what Krauss intended, because the characters' words, (and sometimes their absence) fluidly conjure that metaphor. Moreover, Krauss' delicacy of insight and reflective wisdom, like a haunting obituary, overcomes most obstacles, even a towering desk, and comes to a transcendent conclusion.Highly recommended for all literary collections. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Oct 03, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7907782-great-house

This is my first ""Patrick and Angie"" book, and I was thoroughly disappointed by it.This novel appears to have been written primarily as a screenplay, one that panders to a fist-in-the-air high-five PC audience. If you removed all the unnecessary filler of political references, you could probably cut out 40 pages. (I agree with many of the references, but I don't agree that they belong in this book). It was overt and pandering distraction.The characters are straight out of cardboard central and are either implausible or ludicrously precious. I don't believe any adolescent from Southie uses the word ""arcane"" or rolls the words ""Solntsevskaya Bratva"" off her tongue. But just because Lehane spends a lot of exposition time telling us that this girl, Amanda, has a blazing intelligence does not back up the incongruous profile he has created. Her diction reflects a mature, older woman, an academic or maybe a senator. No matter how smart she is, her diction and vernacular are going to reflect her turf, age, and home influences. I don't believe she would speak like a dissertation candidate at Oxford. Additionally, Patrick and Angie are nothing short of adorably cuddly and the Russians are meretricious stereotypes.Ironically, Lehane inserts his moral compass, to the point of intrusion, on a regular basis. But somehow I missed his righteousness paired with a morally abhorrent assassin playing ""uncle"" to Patrick and Angie's toddler daughter. It is supposed to be charming and cute, especially when Bubba gets a love interest. He strikes me as a sociopath who I wouldn't let near any member of my family. That kind of manipulation in books and movies goes beyond gratuitous. The thing is, if this had been an Adam Sandler comedy, I would have accepted it.

His innate, shimmering talent is steady and captivating throughout the novel, the characters are riveting, and the story itself is painfully soulful. With as much history as he conveyed in this story, you would think that at times, it would be flawed with a ""researched"" tone. But, no. He threaded the history, story, and characters together with magical stitches, and he laced it with myth and folktales that enhanced the story with awe and beauty.The narrator is the Kitchen God. He made a bet with the Jade Emperor that he can divine the workings of the human heart. Each chapter is entitled with a symbol of the Chinese zodiac and is prefaced with a conversation between the two, and each conversation is like an ancient proverb that underscores the story.The main characters are Yuying and Jinyi, and this book is their love story. When I think of them, I think of the love between Dr. Zhivago and Lara. I know that the latter are western, and it is a different story altogether, but this love is epic and enduring like that. It is the story of love under the most atrocious conditions, a love that threatens to collapse at times, but the human heart prevails over history, torture, and political oppression. How? That is what the Kitchen God is there to mine.As their love story begins, the Japanese invasion is ending. The narrator refers to this second Sino-Japanese War as a time in history when the Chinese took a time out from their many civil wars in order to band together to resist the Japanese. It is no wonder that communism controlled the country in the subsequent era, a kind of recoil from Japanese imperialism.Yuying is from a wealthy family with servants and would have lived in even more luxury if it weren't for her father's bad habits. Yuying's father is a shameless boor who has his own agenda for forcing Yuying to marry Jinyi, a lowly kitchen employee at one of his restaurants. But Jinyi is a tough and virtuous man, despite the fact that his introduction to his employment was stealing a morsel of food to abate hunger.A year or so after they are married, Junjyi wants to take Yuying back to his home, the place where he grew up but was mistreated by his aunt and uncle. This journey was long, arduous, and the beginning of their hardship. Later, The Gang of Four come to power with the Cultural Revolution--a decade of turbulence, chaos, and propaganda so deep that even children were turning their parents in for seditious behavior, and people were frightened of saying anything that would be considered a dissent from the communist doctrine of Mao Zedong. The effect of Mao's brand of communism on Yuying and Jinyi was paramount to the struggles of their relationship, and even created an inner dialectic that often muddled their own inner truths and core beliefs.""Have you ever dreamed of being invisible? It is easy, Jinyi thought. Turn your eyes to the ground while others are speaking. Be thin in a land of skeletons; be hungry around a man and his meal. Be hunched around the straight backs of men with medals and insignia; be dry among the drunk. Be a country boy in the crowded streets of the city...it is the unseen masses who knot the country together, the busy atoms rushing unseen between slow bodies.""Starvation, devastation, violence, oppression, and death are the cruel enemies of their marriage, a time so deeply tested that the act of survival would seem to eclipse love. But perseverance through suffering and forbearance through agony are the qualities of this couple that beguile the beguiling Kitchen God, and further entice the reader.The author defines a sense of place, of culture, and of food, even the absence of food, within a seamless and lyrical narrative that induces an almost dreamlike state of mind when reading. The prose is aphoristic and poetic, and the pacing is flawless. This is a novel that appeals on many levels--aesthetic, historical, and political, and much more.

Dinner gets burned, if it is even made, phones aren't answered, and appointments are canceled. This is one of those novels. It is seductive, darkly sexual, haunting, and even frightening. You start waiting for the penny to drop, as the pages keep turning and the clues keep mounting. This is one very hypnotic novel.After an enigmatic prologue, this noirish book opens in Sydney, Australia. The narrator, Julia Alpers, is a law student not committed to her studies at this time. We are brought up to speed with her current dilemma: whether to go to New York on her old friend Ralph's dime to investigate the last day's of Ingrid, who disappeared on 9/11 (a year ago from the current events), or to tear up the ticket and ignore Ralph altogether. A murky undercurrent presides as pieces of their relationship unfold gradually.At a leisurely but still tight pace, we learn the background and history of the friendship between Ralph, Julia, and Ingrid. Ingrid was almost an anachronism, a Grace Kelly type with a combination of innocence and power. Ralph had that androgynous and sometimes diffident charm. The triangulation of their relationship was complex, and I liked that it was uncommon, even within a certain familiarity.This is a story that turns like a screw, gets more and more tense, as well as cross-stitched and dusky. It is finely artistic, with enough literary and art allusions to give you goose bumps. As the editorial description states, there is an analogy to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady (Penguin Classics) but it also imbibes other references. It has the appeal of a nineteenth-century portraiture with a twenty-first century excitement.This is not a ""post 9/11"" novel. The events of that day, i.e., the tragedy of the dead and missing, were procured for the purposes of a personal tragedy. There are some unique references to the hole at Ground Zero, but this is not an exploitation novel of that day, or of the inherent politics surrounding that time.I felt this rapt hum as I was reading, like a deep secret or a liquid center. The characters are lucidly drawn and filled with that brio of privilege and youth, an intellectual group of arty students who have a casual, refined, urbane sophistication and ardor that is sensual and ephemeral. Tranter's sense of place is simply elegant, filled with the light from a window, a shadow across the wall, a tint in the eyes. Her descriptions of Sydney and New York are hypnotizing. And Tranter has a Tolstoyan grasp of psychology blended with physiognomy. Subtle, enigmatic expressions are given intricate meaning. It sometimes cut me to the bone.The prose is fluid and rich, with a restrained passion and hunger. The story and characters become more complex, more complexioned, musky, ripe. It is moody, elegiac but droll, with what I would call a licorice tone to it. Deep, fertile, rooty. This is a real sleeper of a novel.

Writing about such a serious subject as the Holocaust sometimes constricts a novelist into a more conventional form of storytelling/historical fiction. But as we have seen with such books as Frederick Reiken's Day for Night and Nicole Krauss's postmodern Great House, as well as Death as a narrator in Markus Zusak's The Book Thief, the only unwritten rules are to grip the reader in a credible story and to edify through words. Winer has done both, and he puts his unique stamp on it with his fluid, page-turning, thriller style blended with his out-of-the-box imagination and mellifluous prose. Like Plath did so craftily with The Bell Jar, Winer will reach a wider audience by his hewing of the elevated with the pedestrian. Saul Bellow meets Stephen King. I applaud his ambitious style, which he succeeded with on many levels.""...the dead take with them not only what we love in them but also what they love in us...""Two stories parallel and merge, reaching forward in one, backward in the other, fusing in a transmigration of redemption. One starts in 1928 Vienna, a time when the Jews, once so integral to the art and intellectual community, are being persecuted. Some Jews, such as the novel's Pick family, have converted to Catholicism in order to assimilate (which I say with irony, as assimilation in this case was more like betrayal to one's faith) and garner financial success without oppression. Young Josef Pick, the son of converts, visits his Jewish grandfather Pommeranz in the very poor Jewish district and begins his career as a ketubah artist, or ""marriage artist.""The second storyline is the one that opens the novel in modern times. A highly acclaimed native American (Blackfoot) artist, Benjamin Wind, has plunged to his death with the wife of an esteemed art critic, Daniel Lichtmann, whose glorious accolades to Wind made the sculptor famous. Aleksandra Lichtmann, a beautiful, seductive survivor of Russian anti-semitism, was a woman of rare charm and dauntless courage, a woman who spoke her mind resolutely and with artless candor. Her husband, Daniel, is heartbroken and suffused with guilt for falling into an emotional detachment with her (for reasons I won't go into--readers will want to see the details revealed on their own). This is further complicated by the fact that their marriage is a second marriage for both of them.In Jewish tradition, a ketubah is a document, one that is fundamental to the traditional Jewish marriage and is a form of Jewish ceremonial art. It outlines the responsibilities of the groom to the bride and is written in Aramaic, the vernacular of Talmudic times. (I strongly recommend that readers google ketubah images in order to see the stunning, detailed artwork involved.) The ketubah is also fundamental to the themes and storylines of this novel.Josef Pick, at age ten, becomes immediately arrested by the poignancy and beauty of ketubot art and, with a mythical and mystical spirit, is imbued with an aesthetic grace that permeates him and allows him to create a ketubah, largely influenced by his childhood desire for his feuding parents to fall back in love. He eclipses his grandfather's talent and is soon mentored by him. Pommeranz, who earns few schillings blessing fowl and meat, becomes a Jewish star with his grandson. The storyline with Josef continues into adulthood, highlighting his relationship with his lifelong friend, Max Weiner, and Josef's wife, Hannah, a complex and triangulating trio of passion and suffering. This story takes us into the terror of the Holocaust.Daniel is determined to uncover the seeds of this tragedy. Were Aleksandra and Benjamin having an affair? Were they unhappy, filled with guilt, or did someone push them? The police haven't found any clues to a crime, and Daniel commences to investigate on his own. This leads him into his own crimes of the heart as well as important details of his wife's history and the provenance of Benjamin's ethnic roots. Wind's artwork is explored with exquisite sympathy and philosophical mien and woven into a deep abyss of pain, symmetry, and expression. This storyline also leads back into the marrow of the Holocaust, which gives the novel its quintessence. Two artists from two generations bifurcate and meld. The reader is pulled into an intricate labyrinth of lies and love, horror and shame, betrayal and faithfulness.Winer's prose is masterful, with a restrained floridity that anoints the story with poetic lyricism. This is the second  I have written that compels me to allude to Flaubert's mot juste, the ability to find the exact right word or expression. His metaphors and imagery are scintillating and prolific, and I will dare to say orgasmic.""She laughed at him with an unbearable harshness. The laughter spread across her features like a fast-moving storm front, until it was all darkness.""In describing a created ketubah:""...first as blooming yellow florets in a tussock of dandelions and then as gossamer ball angels raised by the wind to the impure geometry of the living...the sky is a fabric of seraphic, thickly flowered souls whispering advice at its edges.""There are flaws. Winer tends to telegraph events, but he is one of the few authors I know who can make exposition emotional, stirring. Some plot turns are too quick and convenient, preventing the reader from forming his or her own conclusions, or from finding the spaces between the words. When Winer is describing art, it is exalting, and it moves the reader to interpret and have a go at personal translation within his own. But with the plot, he intermittently spells out too much information, and truncates some elements of the story. And some components (which feed the potboiler aspect) are a bit contrived and overwrought, and I had to wince, especially the emergence of another, later romance in the book that felt inorganic.In a lesser author, these blemishes would have decreased my overall satisfaction. But, despite this criticism, there is something about the whole here transcending the sum of its parts, (and I am not condescending in this observation) and the parts interlocking in a resonant and finally delicate and ecstatic way that moved me to accept the warts and come away with my heart on fire and my senses roused to tears. This is a highly engaging, memorable, exuberant, and yes, even boisterous and entertaining Holocaust and modern tragedy tale....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Oct 24, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7749218-the-marriage-artist

Here she develops her own notions about the middle-class, upper class, working-class, fighting-class, and college class, as well as a reality bite about racial divide and prejudice. She becomes a part-time nanny to a middle-age couple, Sarah and Edward, who are trying to adopt a baby.Sarah is an eccentric restaurateur, a bird-like woman with the idiomatic foot-in-mouth syndrome who talks to everyone as if they were obtuse, and Edward is a haughty but enigmatic scientist. Tassie accompanies them through the whole process with the adoption agency, meeting the *birth mother* prospects (*a term, says Tassie, probably invented by adoption agencies), and finally taking home Mary for provisional adoption. Mary is a mixed-race toddler on the upper end of two-years-old--a comely, friendly, loving, bright-eyed baby who bonds with Tassie and her new family easily. If all goes well, the adoption will be sealed in six months. During these months, Tassie also falls in love for the first time, with a fellow student in her Intro to Sufism class.Tassie tolerates Sarah and Edward because of her growing love for Mary (now Mary-Emma, now ME, now Emmie); eats their banana pudding baby food; and drinks their briary or woodsy wine when offered. On Wednesday nights, she listens a few flights down through the laundry chute as Sarah runs a support group for mostly Caucasian parents of mostly not Caucasian children. Tassie babysits the children and listens sporadically to the Greek chorus of voices downstairs:""Racial blindness is a white idea."" This would be Sarah""How dare we think of ourselves as a social experiment?""""How dare we not?""""Diversity is a distraction.""""...Look, the whole agenda, like feminism, or affirmative action, is decorative. Without a restructuring of the class system, the whole diversity thing is a folly.""""The only black people you know went to Yale.""""Yeah, all the white people she knows went to Yale, as well.""""How dare we use our children to try and feel good about ourselves?""""How dare we not?""And etcetera. And when Tassie teaches Mary-Emma, ""Been Working on the Railroad,"" Sarah responds with, ""There's just two things I'm worried about with that: the grammar and the use of slave labor.""Tassie, who narrates the story, is a combination of naïve and knowing, of engaged and detached. Moore uses a deft duality of perspective--the story is being narrated linearly as if it just occurred, but from a distance, years later, circa 2009. Tassie's powers of observation are irresistible, acute, including her eye for the natural world.She describes mosquitos:""... with tiger-striped bodies and the feathery beards of an iris, their wings and legs the dun wisps of an unbarbered boy, their spindly legs the tendrils of an orchid, the blades of a gnomes sleigh.""The story also shifts spotlights during the last third of the story, as Tassie returns to the farm for some self-reflection and to heal from several losses and mishaps before returning to Troy.This book could fail you if you require extrinsic, external verisimilitude of plot/storyline. That outer layer has some knobby-knots and a few surface craters. The plot points are held together with brush strokes rather than mortar. For instance, Tassie's boyfriend--his presence and his exit--demand a credulous or forgiving pardon. But it is the effect he has on Tassie that holds our attention. And if we are talking plausibility, Moore has it dead-on target when it comes to social observation and themes, which are her triumphs. She may have ironed out some wrinkles with a few bursts of steam, but honestly, I didn't care. Moore is probably in the top 10% of writers alive today. She has a Kafkaesque sense of the ticking of bureaucracy as seen in the sections with the adoption agency, and she has a Nabokovian ear for language, for words, for the very atom of words. If Mencken was a lyricist and could write like Iris Murdoch, he would be Lorrie Moore.The accumulation of detail, of small matters and observations--those are the profundities of this story. It feeds the themes of loss, negligence, betrayal, and the force of memories. The pearl necklace given to Tassie by her mother becomes a ""gyno-noose,"" for example. The reader becomes gradually inducted into this story of sweetness and doom, of arsenic and lace.""Mordancy: there was something that could not really be taught. But it could be borrowed. It could be rubbed up against. It could scrape you like bark.""The pace is unhurried, requiring total absorption in the passages, in the sentences she constructs. If you skim or skip, you could miss a piercing observation tucked in a seemingly throwaway line. She accesses the soul with words; she illuminates the profane encroachments on people's lives, whether it is past mistakes haunting them or the present miscalculations of heart. And Tassie learns that grief can render you ""passive, translucent, and demolished.""The gears of the plot, even when fumbled, are offset by Moore's wicked, lacerating, poetic, utterly human eye for the intrinsic. Her prose is vicious, vivid, scorching and candescent. She exposes the hollowness of some of the contemporary shibboleths and the hypocrisy of Troy's community. She executes this with rarified poignancy.This is a novel you go along with for the sheer beauty of the writing, for the fierce presence of it. She is never derivative or cliché, not with her passages or her thematic wilderness, not where it counts. If you need a plot to stand on its own, skip this one. But for a penetrating view into the rudderless innocence that never was; to be caught off-guard like the songbirds in this story that stayed too late and froze when the snow began in earnest; to see the sacred through the profane; the malevolent in the noble; and to lose yourself in the irresistible power of language--this is why you read this book. Its literary muscle and harrowing commentary are unsurpassed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Oct 28, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6076387-a-gate-at-the-stairs

The road The Butlers, a once prosperous Irish-American family, ran a progressive farm and orchards on the shore of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario. The road that ran from the shore to inland was called Sanctuary Line. The orchards have now decayed, the farm has gone to seed, and the family has been gone since a crucial night in the 1980's, a night of crisis which is the dramatic center of this novel. The enigmatic patriarch, Stan Butler, was uncle to the fatherless Liz Crane, the novel's melancholic narrator. He abandoned the family and never returned, and his literature-loving poet daughter Mandy, Liz's closest friend and confidante, died during a tour of duty in Afghanistan one year ago.Liz, now a forty-year-old entomologist, is studying the monarch butterfly, which has brought her back to this land that she spent her summers and to the sadness of memories that revisit her. In measured tones, she recounts her childhood history with the Butlers and the accumulation of her losses--Mandy, her uncle, and a boy named Teo, son of one of the crew of Mexican migrant workers who also came every summer. Some of her memories are impaired by their very trauma, and Liz's inward and outward search for answers about the night her uncle left and the haunting memories of Teo provide the primary tension of the story.This is a quiet, introspective novel, but despite its brevity (200 pages), it is also sprawling. The numerous characters are memorable mostly for their impact on the themes and the epic sense of loss, and are mainly imprints, except for Liz, Stan, and Teo. Urquhart's use of symbolism is meaty and powerful, and the fragile beauty of the monarch butterflies and their mating, migratory, and survival patterns are tied into the central drama. Additionally, the geography of the land and the themes of family, (ancestral) history, and transition are delicately woven into the story.I had a little difficulty at times pairing Mandy's love of the military with her soulful connection to literature and poetry. In retrospect, Mandy herself seemed less a character than use as an emotional context for Liz and a source for the anti-climax. The contrast of soldier-poet seemed a bit forced and contrived, but it is such a small complaint and forgivable overall. On the other hand, I especially enjoyed the rambling stories of the ancestral bifurcation (she likes that--bifurcation--and uses that word a lot): in the 19th century, one half of the family became farmers and one half became lighthouse keepers. There is a potent myth of one of the lighthouse keepers that resounded with me as much as Liz's predominating story.The power of Sanctuary Line lies in Liz's narrow aperture of her family history that gradually deepens and widens, revealing that her often grim and irresolute past yet opens up to a more clarifying and promising future. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 06, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8548164-sanctuary-line

But It is rare that I consider a book unimpeachable--that also has the dubious horror of being anointed as a sacred cow or a platitude in the making. But there is a reason that Vonnegut's work is acknowledged as ageless and incomparable. He really is just that. MOTHER NIGHT is his third book, written in 1961, and the first book written in the first person, which allows the reader to descend deeper and deeper into the protagonist's mind. Vonnegut's past history of surviving the 1945 bombing of Dresden while underground in an abattoir has provided a lot of meat for several of his novels, and this one is a riveting example. This isn't one of Vonnegut's shaggy dog or science fiction stories. It has more of a reality-based feel to it. Every sentence is necessary and carefully wrought. His satire is on full display, but love and humanity are intertwined. His ability to embrace the skeptic with the sentimentalist seems effortless.The primary theme is penned in Vonnegut's introduction, written five years after the hardback was released.""We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.""After the editor's note written by the (fictional) editor of this confessional story, we are introduced to Howard W. Campbell, Jr., the protagonist and narrator of his story as an American spy and former playwright and poet living in Germany during WW II. He is imprisoned in Israel for war crimes of treason and crimes against humanity; he was so good at his job that no one presently believes his patriotism and service to America. Campbell gave impassioned radio broadcasts, delivering prolific anti-Semitic messages to all of Nazi Germany. His ""code"" to the Americans was conveyed in mannerisms, emphases, coughs, and verbal stumbles. He became a minor celebrity to the Nazis.He loved and adored his German wife, Helga; together they were a ""nation of two."" As a playwright, he understood ""lies told for the sake of artistic effect"" and that lies, in art, can be ""the most beguiling forms of truth."" He never told Helga that he was a spy. He was separated from her, and she was presumed dead, and he later emerged in Greenwich Village to attempt to live in anonymity, although he kept his name. Helga--or someone like Helga--re-emerged, also. And a variety of white supremacists found him and wanted to herald him and protect him from harm. Only Vonnegut can combine slapstick with white supremacy and hold your heart in his teeth.This book had me in thrall from the first to last page. I paced periodically while reading--re-reading sentences, phrases, paragraphs. I was captivated by Vonnegut's ability to turn every truth upside down and every lie inside out. The revelations of truth were in every contradiction and the fullness of humanity in every insanity and evil act.

Jonah Woldermariam, born and raised in Peoria, Illinois, is the son of Ethiopian immigrants, Yosef and Mariam. As the novel opens, he has separated from his wife, Angela, and left his teaching post in New York, where they live. He embarks on a road trip to Nashville to retrace the inauspicious journey that his parents took years ago when his mother was pregnant with him.Jonah is critically isolated from others, implacably at times--and until he met Angela, he lived in a bubble of one. He was never close to his parents, whose relationship was destructive and toxic. His unhappiness has a root of violence--familial and ancestral--and Jonah is irresolute and melancholy, unable to climb out of his dread. He discovered that reconstructing and revising stories about his past allows him to cope with the present. Angela joins with him in this, like a parlor game, but when she realizes that his coping mechanism has become pathological, as well as detrimental to their lifestyle and intimacy, their marriage starts disintegrating.Jonah's trip to Nashville is a starting point to exploring key events of his parents' life and ultimately gaining understanding of his own. There are several narrative threads interwoven--his own history, his parents' struggles with each other and their turbulence in Africa and America, and his relationship with Angela. Jonah has refined the art of embellishment so well that sometimes he doesn't know where the truth left off and the reconstructions begin. Revising history has served him for many years. He is like a functional alcoholic whose powerful addiction (anesthetic) gives him fuel to carry on day-to-day while it gradually destroys him. At first, it was a healthy outlet for him to accept and control his existence and gain some personal identity. It even helped refugees at the center where he worked for a while by assisting them to amplify their personal histories with acute poverty and violence, sometimes when it didn't exist. But now the past has urgently infringed on the present and threatened his future, and his imagination is now eclipsed by volatile and sobering realities.Mengestu's prose is tender and beautiful, and he creates an atmosphere of foreboding that is palpable and deep. I felt Jonah's pain on every page, and there are poignant moments of his parents' past that cut like a blade. However, it became a bit tedious after a while; instead of moving forward, the story was stuck in the same gear for many pages and meandered in a revolving door. He also skimmed over some details that left me puzzled. One sentence that bothered me was that he went to stay with a friend in Brooklyn for a period of time. That may seem like a throwaway line, but Jonah didn't have any friends! The whole point of this depiction is to illuminate his isolation and inability to effectively sustain a relationship. That small convenience of the author felt like a betrayal of the authenticity of the character.An ick factor crept into Jonah's revisionist history, too, when his fabrications went over the top and seemed unnecessary, and instead of rooting for him I wanted to scream. Perhaps that was the author's intention, but it impeded the pathos and I wanted to shake him out of his self-indulgence, which I felt droned on too long. The revelations are hinted at early, and the major revelation, by the time it came, felt anti-climactic.Despite these drawbacks, I was moved by this heartrending story of redemption.

The story's approach and focus reminds me a lot of Herman Wouk's Marjorie Morningstar, and more than a cut above Shaw's Rich Man, Poor Man. High-end chick lit, or in this case, lad-lit. But Pomerantz has a fertile sense of place and era that wafts of historical fiction. I visualized the sensual transformation of New York City from what it was in post-WW II through to the mid-1980's. No skimping on the details of the rise of modern Manhattan, such as TriBeCa and the Upper West Side. I felt when the air was tumescent or icy, and the clack and clatter of the streets was audible. She does the same with blue-collar Philadelphia, and you can fairly smell the asthma-provoking cleaning products of Stacia Vishniak, taste the knishes hot out of the oven, see the eyesore of one-step-above-tenement housing. The core of Robert Vishniak's ambition is tangible, primordial.Robert Vishniak, lower-middle-class Jew from Philly, has his eye on the big fat cherry pie. He wants to get out of his humble straitjacket and into the movers-and-shakers world. His brother, Barry, is five years younger and admires Robert's physical attractiveness and the benefits that go with it. Robert attends Tufts in the late 60's, and then finds himself in NYC after graduation, driving a cab. His brother, the perpetual student selling drugs on the side, eventually moves in with him. His best friend from college, Tracey, teeters in a sexual identity crisis. Robert glides from one clique to another with ease, even though inside he continues to have the quiet roar of desperation. He falls in love with a wealthy but tragic woman when he is still young and unsophisticated in the ways of the world, and the outcome of that affects his future countenance and attitude toward love and marriage .The primary men in this novel are fleshed out, and the reader will be rewarded with a contoured intimacy with Robert and Barry, and to a lesser extent, Tracey. The women are adequately portrayed, but not overly original. You read this book for its page-turning storytelling and the theme--a search for a sense of home, the striving to belong, and of course the whole class struggle. There's doom around every corner, and an existential angst in every home. The emotional punches are compelling, and of course there are touches of melodrama, but it isn't schmaltzy. OK, a few scenes border on schmaltz, but that's all part of the Woukishness.A better than average beach read of a rags to riches fable.

But, in this claim, Froderberg is truly MDozens of books have promised the sentiment ""for lovers of Cormac McCarthy"" and left me sorely disappointed. But, in this claim, Froderberg is truly McCarthy's literary offspring, echoing his hot, haunting brand of southwest essence, desert landscape, and gothic narrative elixir, if not yet fully capturing his linguistic sublimity and lethal, graveyard humor. In this ambitious debut novel, the author explores desperate and broken souls living through a drought in southern Arizona--a land of sand and scrub, cactus stands, spiny shrubs, bitterbrush, dusty maiden, diamondbacks, rodeos, distant foothills, punishing climate, and an endless starlit sky. If you don't like McCarthy's prose style, you surely won't relish Froderberg's highly stylized prose and narrative, either. If, like me, you adore McCarthy's (particularly his southwest) lore, such as The Border Trilogy: All the Pretty Horses, the Crossing, Cities of the Plain (Everyman's Library), then you can potentially connect with and savor this quasi-mythical tale.Seventeen-year-old bride Katherine lives with her (significantly older) husband, Son, and his kind-hearted and affluent parents, Rose and ""Rose's Daddy,"" on their ranch on Old Border Road, in a stately adobe house above an aquifer. Rose's Daddy calls Katherine ""Girl"" (affectionately), and Son calls her Darlin.' She accepts her new identity and learns how to live and work on the ranch, including horse riding, barrel racing, and driving the water truck. Besides prospering from the ranch, Rose's Daddy channels water to the coast, just like his father did, earning a heavy bounty and a lot of frowns from the local people. He tells Girl the history of the nomads who wandered to this land, leading up to his own father's industrious wealth.""They sought a fabled people within a fabled landscape. They sought a promised life...They walked across sandbanks of hot ash, the ground on which they walked trembling like paper sheeting, as if it were a fiery lake bubbling and steaming right beneath them.""The narrative, told in Katherine's voice, reads a lot like gothic fable. Although set in contemporary times, there is a timeless quality about it, and the author's temporal sense is frequently ephemeral. Like McCarthy, she plays with tenses, and sustains a biblical subtext and timbre.""The words as they were chalked, the sand and the dust, the grime and the duff and the tar and the oil and the mud, and whatever else of the earth we collect along the way, will all be washed away in the moon after, once we are back to here where we are, to begin another beginning.""Katherine tells the story of the drought, of Son's cruel infidelities, stemming from Rose's Daddy's infidelities, of Rose's fragility, and the ghosts of stories that still haunt the adobe house. The desire of Katherine to stand by Son is increasingly frustrating as the story progresses, but taken as poetic fable, I was able to tolerate it. The characters are often not what they seem, and some shocking revelations are even more unnerving to the reader as the protagonist continues to honor her spousal obligations. Most characters do not develop over time; rather, they are gradually amplified, the aperture widens, and the person you see is more resonant and less inscrutable, but unchanged. Unlike McCarthy, the author portrays a woman with some finesse.There is a New Age priest, known as Padre, who beguiles his congregation with a noble mien and zen-like homilies, and whose relationship with Katherine leads her to a further maturity of mind, while she retains her fastness of character, deepening it. A rancher and businesswoman named Pearl Hart, her husband, Ham, and her daughter, also named Pearl, round out the story and enlarge the myth and mystery of the town.You don't read this novel for the individual characters but for their fate, and for Katherine's. You read it for the themes of disillusionment and strength; the narrative grip of lush, elliptical language; the earthly elements that imperil and fortify these marginal people; and for the landscape that resounds like a character. You tacitly observe what is in a name, and what is not.At times, the author's talent overreaches, and the overwrought language and florid descriptions threaten to choke the narrative flow. I occasionally experienced reader fatigue. Froderberg hasn't yet harnessed the nuanced linguistics and tension of McCarthy and his ability to create a chemical reaction in the reader, although she clearly is aspiring to. The tale acquired some dark humor toward the end, which the story was begging for at intervals. The problem with her style so closely resembling the master is that she hasn't fully developed her own unique one. When she fails to attain McCarthy's bracing, muscular tongue and allegorical depth, the reader notices her self-conscious drive to try.As a novelist, this is Susan Froderberg's first rodeo, and I am inclined to give the rope some slack. She is a debut author that will surely evolve over time. This is an earnest, inspired start, and facets of the story were well realized. I was exceptionally moved when I came to the last line of the story, a sentence that touched me with its purity, subtlety, and pith.

If Steinbeck and Hemingway married the best of Anita Shreve, you would get David Vann's Caribou Island. His prose is terse and the characterizations are subtle, but knifing. His characters are saturated with loneliness and disconnection with their lives, with each other, in a pit of misperception, despair and exile, in a conflict of selves that beat each other down. The topography and remoteness of this ""exclave"" state, a place non-contiguous physically with its legal attachment (of the US) serves as one of many metaphors to the attachments exemplified in this story.Virginia Woolf, while attempting to write the life story of artist Roger Fry, observed:""A biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves, whereas a person may well have as many as one thousand.""Although this is a novel, not a biography, Vann's characters are desperately attempting to grasp, hide and reinvent themselves, trying to fill impossible voids, reconcile the past. The author explores the links between memory and myth, the gray area between real and idea, the notion of identity, and the truth of self-deception. There is stoic Irene, haunted by a childhood of abandonment; her cruel, mulish, and spineless husband, Gary; their (often) oblivious daughter, Rhoda; and Rhoda's puerile and feckless fiancé, Jim. Minor characters (such as their taciturn, alienated son, Mark) move through the novel and accelerate the anxiety and self-destruction of this quartet of refractory souls. They unconsciously use their mates to mirror and shadow what is desired, lost, forgotten, or never was. Vann creates a circle of repetition and insularity in a vast expanse of territory, a terror of the self at its most heinous and human.""...if they could take all their previous selves and nail them together, get who they were five years ago and twenty-five years ago to fit closer together, maybe they'd have a sense of something solid.""Gary is insisting on building a log cabin in the isolated Caribou Island, pulling Irene into this last-ditch retirement dream, rife with poor planning and ripe with the unspoken threat of finally leaving her. Thirty years ago he brought her to Alaska from Berkeley, another time that he tried to create an idyllic life from an idea, and failed.""The momentum of who she had become with Gary, the momentum of who she had become in Alaska, the momentum that made it somehow impossible to just stop right now and go back to the house. How had that happened?""""Gary was a champion at regret...Their entire lives second-guessed. The regret a living thing, a pool inside him.""Thirty-year-old Rhoda is devoted to Jim, (who is a decade older), in an almost frantic state to get married to a man who doesn't really love her, on the precipice of repeating her mother's mistake. Meanwhile, Jim is on a quest to redefine himself, to combine two opposing lifestyles.Vann does a spectacular job of engaging the reader gradually into this blistered turmoil of dissolution. The climax was compelling, creating a circle, a literary architecture of repetition. However, as penetrating and irresistible as this form was, I do wonder if symmetry eclipsed credibility in the outcome. I cannot go further without giving spoilers.Despite my vexation with the ending's credibility, I was gripped by the power of this atmospheric story, the characters, the exquisite pacing, and the infinite amount of quotable passages. It took me a long time to remove myself from this moody, nuanced tale.""In the beginning, Irene thought.

Griffith's sense of place--the salt marshes ofI was both charmed and haunted by the first Ruth Galloway mystery, The Crossing Places (Ruth Galloway). Griffith's sense of place--the salt marshes of Norwich, England--was stark and moodily disquieting. The land seemed almost anthropomorphic in its presence, and served to heighten the story and even strengthen the weak spots, including her strained and rushed denouement. Ruth, a Ph.D. anthropologist, is a flawed and frank woman of forty, an unapologetic atheist with a no-nonsense style. In this second installment, she remains steadfast. One of my favorite lines is:""...God is a made-up fairy tale, like Snow White, only nastier.""And she is now three months pregnant. The father is Detective Chief Inspector Harry Nelson, the taciturn and capable, and generally happily married father of two teenage daughters. In the first novel, Ruth and Harry were thrown together in a case. Bones buried beneath the marshes led to a twisted investigation and one intimate night together, a night where forces almost transcendent brought them together. They did not embark on a continuous affair, and their feelings for each other are blurry. Harry is still a bit of a cynical enigma, but a tender family man.Now, in the heather and coarse grasses of Swaffham, a university-supported ancient Roman dig site is the primary location for the second team-up of Ruth and Nelson. Bones are again unearthed--this time the headless skeleton of a child of indeterminate age and time. Complicating matters is the necessary interruption of a development project of entrepreneur Edward Sens. He is building a seventy-four-unit luxury apartment complex on this site that was once a Catholic orphanage.A cat-and-mouse crime thriller ensues, with a variety of new and old characters, including (but not limited to) an elderly Catholic priest, a sexy love interest for Ruth, (he is also an anthropologist), a dying nun, and Cathbad, the Druid, from the first novel. Griffiths balances Ruth's personal story and the criminal investigation with sufficient finesse and wry wit, and there is a tough tension whenever Ruth and Nelson are in the same room or space. However, despite all the back stories of peripheral characters, they don't organically come alive. Griffiths uses too much exposition to tell, more than show, her characters and story. Even Nelson remains archly narrow, but there's hope for his character to develop.Moreover, the landscape and climate, which was so potent in the first novel, is given short shrift in this one. It is there, and lovely when it is, but more sparing, in small doses. How disappointing, because it was the most moving aspect of the author's talent. THE JANUS STONE is lightly competent, and she has learned to control the plot better this time around, but the pacing is just as rushed. The unfolding is a bit more manageable, less hysterical, but still melodramatic. Griffith's police procedural is just another stone in the river without her earthy, lucid, topographical and climactic inclusions. The archeological parts add color and weight, but sometimes they feel like artifacts to the story, and were more telegraphed than embedded, despite their impact.I may go back for the third installment, THE HOUSE AT SEAS END. The prologue and first few chapters were included in this book, as a tease. Why am I going back? To see what happens to Ruth and Nelson, of course. And to hope for more vibrant terrain. If I don't see significant improvement and development of character and story, then it will be my last go-round for this series. And if the author kills off Nelson's wife in some tragic accident for convenience, I will put the book down even before I finish it....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,"Dec 06, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6268632-the-janus-stone

Her minimalist style is for the veteran reader, and for those of us willing to ponder their poignancy like we would a numinous painting whose meaning is often beyond its containment and yet embedded there. Her photographic eye for surface details expose cracks and tensions that open to a scalding world of suffocation and denial. Her characters circumvent the truth by poking at it peripherally or trying to defy it, shielding covetously from the pain or cynically attempting to control it. Comprehension is lying in wait behind the ambiguity of the narratives. But Beattie isn't superior to her reader; she entices you to be the psychologist of these subterranean reveals. She isn't going to solve their problems.There are forty-eight short stories chronologically advancing from 1974 to 2006. I feel an intimacy with her narratives that I don't always feel in this form. She isn't over-stylized. Her almost toneless, declarative sentences are wry and cinematic rather than stilted and dismal. Beattie is ingenious at blending the strident with the yielding, the clamorous with the quietly desperate. The indirect slap and the whispered howl threaten to topple each house of cards.They illuminate the weakness and dissolution of her characters. Additionally, she enhances their impotence by the presence of the animal word. The dogs (present in numerous stories) are more lively and resolute than the people, and inhabit their space more fully.One of my favorite stories is ""The Burning House,"" written in 1979. Amy is the only female in the story, surrounded by a boisterous number of family and friends and a husband, Frank, who doesn't love her. Her closest friend is her gay brother-in-law, Freddy, who is perpetually stoned and, although he loves Amy, remains more dedicated to Frank. This story reveals Amy's chronic alienation from her supposed ""supportive"" loved ones . The final sentence, uttered by Frank, in bed, is soul-ripping.In the 2006 ""The Confidence Decoy,"" Beattie's atmospherics include a pronounced sense of unease and self-doubt. A retired lawyer, Francis, is packing up his dead aunt's house. He is interacting with the hired movers while also attempting to puzzle out his ineffectual son's actions. One of the movers carves confidence decoys for duck hunters. These decoys serve as a metaphor for Francis' own listlessness of confidence and focus, and lead to a harrowing course of events.Beattie's ability to inflict her characters with shame, fear, confusion, alienation, and incapacitation is chilling . These tales are dark but not bleakly executed; they are crisp and deadpan and astonishing. The author is brilliant at limning the time period of each piece in just a few short sentences, yet they are timeless in essence. The later stories are more lyrical but just as emotionally terrifying. And her opening sentences are unrivaled. I highly recommend this for lovers of erudite and commanding literature.From ""Zalla""--says Little Thomas to his mother, after being struck for mutilating some silhouettes of the family:""Do you think I care if I didn't have a nose?...I wouldn't care if I didn't have a nose or a mouth or eyes.

These allegorically linked stories, notably the middle novellas, bring the reader to a naked immediacy, a place where there is no escape and no room to sit on the perimeter. David Vann has re-imagined his father's suicide (thirty years ago, when Vann was 13) and mythologized it in this semi-autobiographical memoir, and he has done this with a graphic, naked brawn and authenticity that I have rarely encountered in other stories of suicide, real or imagined. There is a place beyond the threshold, a place where gifted writers access with the reader in the subconscious strata, a sort of ""it"" place, for lack of a signifier. And Vann meets the reader here with a staggering intensity. It produced a chemical reaction, and I was fully in that submerged dimension.Vann's influences are present, such as Cormac McCarthy (who also produces that chemical reaction in me), Elizabeth Bishop, and Chaucer, among others. But this is uniquely Vann's voice, an echo of his personal history, his education and beloved authors, with his own original stamp. Every passage is nuanced and muscular. There are also acrid scenes of Kafkaesque absurdity and graveyard insanity that blew me away.I read his later Caribou Island: A Novel before this one. There is a linked sensibility in both stories, and even some of the character's names are used in both books. They are fused or clipped or reinvented altogether, but it is evident that names are critical and symbolic to Vann. This book, in my humble opinion, is the best of the two, a legitimate masterpiece. (Although, now that I have read this, it gives more heft to the later work.) I was deeply moved and impressed by CARIBOU ISLAND and wanted to go back to this earlier work.

His home is a veritable biology experiment, as the mold and filth has not been cleaned in months, maybe years. Ptolemy urinates in a can because the bathroom is uninhabitable; he uses the diner down the street for the sit-down chore. He remembers pieces of his youth, enough to know there is a treasure and a secret in his past.At home, the TV news blares 24/7 and competes with the classical and jazz music on the pumped up volume of the radio. The resultant commotion of sounds kindles Ptolemy's confusion, but occasionally serves to unearth pieces of his past or inspire epiphanies. When he walks the streets of this run-down, poor, and sometimes perilous neighborhood, he encounters the personal hazards of the forgotten and the forgetting. One vulgar woman invariably ambushes him, and beats him until she gets his money. Family members often subvert him with their dissembling.When the comely, young, and earnest Robyn comes to help him, to scrub his dwelling to a habitable sheen, and accompany him on all his excursions, Ptolemy begins a surprising and rejuvenating end to his life that reads like a contemporary fable. Mosley imagines a drug that will restore Ptolemy's mind, but with consequences. Sort of a twist on Flowers for Algernon but with foreknowledge.This is my first Mosely book, but I am keen to read some more and get into the woolly mind of this half-Jewish, half-black author, who is skilled with storytelling and witty with vernacular. He characterizes, with an economy of words, his black protagonist's experience in a white man's world, but he doesn't back down from exploring Ptolemy's rollicking family--the black man's experience in his own culture. And he does it with empathy and levity. There's no racial grandstanding; the author is too capable for that.Mosley's assured opening is filled with visual and linguistic cues, placing me right at the scene and into the action, allowing me to quickly amass Ptolemy's precarious existence and his forceful but vulnerable nature. He gives us a contoured and unconventional portrait of a man's twilight days. The novel gradually evolved into something a bit more precious than its irascible beginning, but I was satisfied overall.

It is a term coined by Nicolas Bourriaud to describe a type of art within today's global context that is a reaction against standardization and commercialism, stressing the experience of wandering in time, space, and mediums. I mention this primarily to warn that this type of fiction is an acquired taste.Dasgupta examines the life of centenarian Ulrich, a Bulgarian from Sofia with a German name and German wanderlust. The first half, or ""movement"" of the novel takes us through Ulrich's difficult life. The second half, ""Daydreams,"" is Ulrich's re-imagined life of repressed dreams flowering into a fabricated existence.Much cross cutting of events and ideas takes place to realize the fullness of the story. Ironically, the first half, Ulrich's actual life, is more dreamily narrated. The dream-life events of part two are more linear, with a concrete storyline occasionally interrupted by temporal shifts. Certain characters from the first half reenter the dream world but are altered to a different relationship with Ulrich.Ulrich's desire to become a musician was cruelly arrested by his father. Later, he studied chemistry in Berlin until he was forced to return to Sofia and care for his mother. Ulrich's life of mediocrity and tragedy in part one was re-imagined in part two, which takes the reader to Georgian territory and eventually to the U.S., in New York. A Gypsy musician, a quasi-narcissistic mistress of a gangster, and her bohemian poet brother seem initially disconnected to Ulrich. This is where Dasgupta's style of altermodernism comes into play and unites the two disparate halves.It took me a while to warm up to this book. The author is a skilled craftsman of descriptive language; however, it was initially too muted and cool for me to engage emotionally. There was a riot of images taunting me like a slide show, but the tale was told through a portal of politics and sociology more than felt. Dasgupta's cerebral approach held the essence of the story suspended above me, or from me. It was educating and coldly visceral, rich in its industrial ugliness, and dryly poetical, yet I felt vaguely outside of it. But, in the last 150 pages, I was hooked, and read it in one intense sitting. The narrative was splintery, immediate, and petulant. The author also used various entry and exit points of the first half and juxtaposed them in the latter part of the story to render a measured gravity. I don't want to say any more except that the author's insurrectionist technique is part of the journey and grip of the tale.""Life seemed nothing more than a series of improbable accidents, and yet everyone had a sense--didn't they?--that there was something else, deeper and prior, to which they had to return.""As you read, you will feel and anticipate that deeper sense of things, dormant but sharp. Stay. The whole is a provocative sum of its parts....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Dec 27, 2010","Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8149206-solo

You glow brightly wherever there is pain in your body. As a motif, it is a mixture of fascination and gimmick.A journal of love notes written by a young husband to his wife over their years together provides a connection between all the stories, and a weaker, less effective thematic link. The journal symbolizes a poignant and authentic love, and the etch of great loss. Almost every sentence in the journal begins with ""I love it when you..."", which becomes cloying.So now there are two gimmicks to this story, and it was important to me that the author rise above this conceit and give me something above the vehicles he used. He accomplished that well in the first story, and the journal (beyond the passages) becomes more than mere device. Additionally, Carol Ann's emotional fatigue paired with her almost childlike hope engaged me. Her awkwardness and reticence was genuine; the story of her injury was potent.The second story, Jason, pertains to the author of the journal. It was unnecessary and heavy-handed, as it (over)explained the journal's incipience and felt contextually repetitive. It was as if Brockmeier didn't trust that the rest of the book would properly convey this information.Chuck is the mute ten-year-old of the third story. It was the most maladroit of all the tales, too earnestly trying to convince the reader of Chuck's endearing precocity. It was also exhausting, as it repeatedly reminded the reader of what we already understood about the widespread ""Illumination.""The next story, about the evangelist, Ryan, was heavy-handed. Besides the repetition of the ""Illumination"" syndrome without any further insight, the authorial management was too pronounced. Additionally, Ryan's lifetime grief was quite a stretch that didn't transcend for me.The best story of the five was Nina, an author suffering from chronic lip ulcers. It felt organic, and Brockmeier's poetics was wonderfully hungry and haunting instead of his tendency towards sententious cliché. I engaged emotionally and admired the author's figurative language. I didn't feel that Brockmeier relied on the journal or the ""Illumination"" pandemic to convey a powerful theme of *pain as the most beautiful thing about us.*The final story, about a homeless street vendor, Morse, was tedious and static. The idea of an Empath, which could have added perspective, blandly overreached.Brockmeier has a rich, dream-like imagination, but this 250+ page dilatory book could have been shortened into a brief novella, with the stale excess and repetition removed. A deft edit to eliminate the saggy elements and boilerplate platitudes would leave us with the unflinching, vibrant parts. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8472655-the-illumination

When a sixteen-year-old high school girl goThis is a small concept book, very short and insular in premise, that deepens and reverberates eloquently. When a sixteen-year-old high school girl goes missing one Halloween from a ""mid-Atlantic"" (and obviously small) town, she is mythologized by the people she left behind, especially a group of her male peers. The narrative covers several decades, in a non-linear but succinct, crisp structure. The narrators are a group of voices that become one voice, a collective consciousness of sorts. The reader doesn't distinguish differences between the voices, which Pittard intended. I liked the concept in theory (the collective voice) but occasionally, in reading, the lack of discrete voices was understimulating.The missing girl, Nora Lindell, becomes more than herself. She morphs into an enigma, and eventually into a symbol of ""a tally of the people who left us behind."" Nora is merely a point of departure to explore and examine the lives of these boys, now men, who failed to live large, whose dreams were often squelched, and who sometimes made poor choices. Their fantasies of Nora's life or death after that Halloween are projections of their own private guilt, fears, diminished dreams, and desires. Nora herself alternately fades and hovers in the subconscious of these men's lives. She becomes their cherished avatar.The prose is economical and lovely, giving us a haunting coming-of-age story that is innovative and engaging. I did have a bit of a problem accepting that the voices were male, as it read as soft and female to me. I wasn't convinced that these disembodied voices were attached to male characters, and it became a weakness that occasionally removed me from the story's authenticity. (The gender is quite significant in the book's context and mood.)As a debut novel (really, novella), it is still an impressive and courageous accomplishment.

TThis fictional and comical memoir about a Jewish man's youth and his family grabs you right away, maintaining a galloping pace from start to finish. The marathon rhythm and gonzo narrative gets you through the first, rather (too) earnest and overeager pages, and before long you are installed in a compulsively readable, page-turning story that is endearing and funny.Seth Shapiro is an aspiring writer from a family that puts the dis in dysfunction. His parents divorced when he was very young, and his father essentially abandoned the family for a new one--with a repressed and cruel French wife. Lots of angst and abandonment issues there. Seth is close to his twin sister, Sarah, but not so much with his younger brother, Seamus, who found solace in religion and ritual.Seth, Sarah, and Seamus live with their mood-shifting mother, Ruth, who fails to edit herself or her feelings, often causing a bit of a role reversal with her kids. When she drinks, take cover. Ruth denigrates their father at every opportunity, but Seth is determined to win back his love, anyway.Seth's hero is Saul Bellow, who is a distinct model for Adam Schwartz's writing style. There are also hints of Philip Roth, Jonathan Tropper, and Woody Allen--a pastiche of Jewish humorists and writers. (There is also a whiff of Brock Clarke.) While still in high school, Seth garners praise for a story, which helps his acceptance into the University of Chicago.While in college, Seth writes a story called ""A Stranger on the Planet,"" a fictionalization of his hapless and battered family life, which earns him high praise from an esteemed literature professor and a scholarly award.Herein lies the problem. Although Schwartz's novel is a crackling good read, his eponymous story within the story is a big letdown. This is Seth's prize-winning bildungsroman, also a fictionalized memoir, yet it was actually stilted, amateurish, and ungainly. I was not convinced that any luminaries from the scholarly university would praise it. It shrank the triumph of the book for me and squandered some of its essence.In retrospect, I am able to regain much of that lost essence, as it was a wild ride with many moving, primordial events and memorably rich characters. The love of Seth's life, Rachel, is a compendium of touching cross-purposes and levity, and his relationship with Sarah has that Jewish brother-sister realism (that I can relate to!). The dynamics between Seth and Ruth were the most captivating of all, a Freudian roller coaster of a ride.Although I assigned four stars to Schwartz's debut novel, I highly recommend it for lovers of Jewish familial stories and turbo comic humor. It is a swift read--two or three sittings, and never dull. There is also a very intriguing dissection on the craft of writing, woven into the story organically.

Cassandra Brooks is a modern-day diviner, or dowser, living in upstate New York, the only woman in a long line of patriarchal diviners in her family. A dowser is someone who can sense a water source underneath layers of earth, (and sometimes minerals or other buried treasures), using a rudimentary Y-shaped rod or branch. This ancient art has not been embraced by the scientific community, and is often misunderstood as a pagan art. Cassandra's father, Nep, who is now declining from Alzheimer's, had passed her the legacy and taught her the art. Besides dowsing, single-mother Cassandra teaches high school classes part-time to help support her eleven-year-old twin boys. In this story, buried secrets from her past are coming back to haunt her. This story received positive, exuberant accolades by authors Joyce Carol Oates and Valerie Martin, to name a few. It was described as mesmerizing, irresistible, insightful, riveting, charged with emotion, and a masterpiece. Did I read a different story? I am absolutely confounded. I love a gripping, haunting tale, and that is what I was expecting. But, what I got was a ham-handed, flat, one-note, contrived, manipulative narrative arc lacking any nuance or organic substance, filled with one-dimensional characters and villainous archetypes. There was absolutely no atmosphere to the tale. It had the mood of a journalistic piece or a dry text. I learned some interesting facts, but it was expositional rather than braided into the story. When Morrow attempted a tone, it was folksy and beseeching, downright schlocky at times. The story was telegraphed relentlessly from beginning to end, and there was no mystery to the mystery, because the author foreshadowed with a hammer, and then restated his foreshadows in case the reader forgot. There was a hopeless lack of suspense and texture. Cassandra is supposedly an outcast, but she seems to be a paragon of virtue with angelic sons. The townspeople are the blue meanies, until they see the light of Cassandra's unassailability. Her boys have the superegos of fully adult, mature men. They are completely devoted to their mother, at all times, and would sacrifice any of their desires to accommodate her. Jonah is brainy in math, Morgan is a super-athlete. They are darling. They clean house. They have the wisdom of forty-year-olds. The author is long-winded, but never once brought me beyond the literate interpretation of events, events that he rebroadcasts without subtlety. He also sets up ludicrous scenarios. For example, Cassandra took her sons to the isolated family cottage on coastal Maine where there is no medical facility, telephone, or cell phone service, and only two other inhabitants. A mailboat is available for transportation at intervals. Once, following a creepy incident, she left the twins alone for several hours on the island while she boarded the mailboat to be taken to make a call. Later, her parents join her on the island, even though her father's health is precarious. But Nep is winningly lucid at all the right times, including producing a key to an old lighthouse at just the right moment. When I read a story, I hope for literary elements, such as irony, contradiction, and metaphor. This was absent, except in the most obtuse way, such as an effigy that failed to produce its desired effect on me, other than eye-rolls. By then, I already knew what would happen, and who to suspect. In a suspense thriller, I expect to be alarmed or horrified, caught off guard. I wasn't. The narrative read much like a Young Adult novel, but I have read fiction for teens that contained much more subtext, surprise, and complexity. The only textural element is the parallel to dowsing (combing the land, circling until you strike the source) and how it relates to events in Cassandra's personal history, but it was weak. I cannot recommend this book for readers of literature or lovers of haunting suspense thrillers. The age range for appreciating this book is roughly between twelve and sixteen, but only if subtext, pacing and atmosphere are irrelevant to the reader. There was so much potential, as this was an unusual subject (dowsing/divining) and a strong opening. But it was inevitably diluted, and soon veered from its source and dried up like an empty well....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Dec 2010,"Feb 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7997293-the-diviner-s-tale

The laconic Vaara requested a new assignment following the personal trauma and collateral damage of the Sufia Elmi case. His American wife, Kate, is 8 ½ months pregnant, and Kari is plagued with headaches and stress over her pregnancy.In this story, Vaara is investigating the murder of a woman, Iisa Fillipov, who was married to a debauched business leader in the community. Iisa's extramarital Estonian lover, Rein Saar, is the primary suspect--he woke up with her dead body beside him. Vaara is also asked to investigate an alleged war criminal, and to cover up any trails that lead to affirmation of his guilt (keep Finland spotless). The chief of police and interior minister are pressing this case on him because of his grandfather's possible involvement. that On top of all this, Kate's American siblings are coming to visit.This is a taut police procedural with a graphic opening and an implausible denouement, an over-the-top climax that is now a hallmark of Thompson's work. This second novel is not quite as atmospheric as his first one, (i.e. climate as character) but it hits the high notes with assurance, and is also a lead-in to the next installment. Vaara's skill at balancing several plot lines simultaneously and braiding them together is exhilarating. Moreover, he saliently blends in Finland's history and social issues to support the story.This next paragraph is NOT spoiler information--I am merely conveying Vaara's fears at the outset of this novel, together with a criticism of the facts that Thompson alleges. I was bothered by the author's lack of precision in his research of pregnancy.

On a dark and stormy night…wait--there was no storm. Long ago and far away…but, it was only a few years ago, and not far if you live in suburban New Jersey. So, one dark and December night in the safe and tidy suburb of Stellar Plains, New Jersey, an arctic chill seeped under doors, a frigid blast blew through windows, and a glacial nipping swirled between the sheets of spouses and lovers. And, just as suddenly, the woman turned from their men, and stopped having sex. A spell had been cast, unbeknownst to the enchanted. Married woman turned in disgust from their husbands, and teen girls recoiled from their pimply boyfriends. The town was in chaos, but nobody was talking.At the start of the new school year, the new bohemian and canny drama teacher, Fran Heller, had come to teach at Eleanor Roosevelt High School (Elro), where much of the action takes place. She was staging a production of Lysistrata, the ancient Greek play written by Aristophanes. And, in case you aren’t familiar with it, it is about an entire city of woman that resolves to stop having sex with their men in order to end the Peloponnesian War. That includes their favorite position—The Lioness on The Cheese Grater. Yeah, think about it! This extraordinary mission inflames the battle between the sexes in Athens, just as the suburban spell provokes a war between the mates in Stellar Plains.Dory and Robby Lang, the central couple of the book, are spirited English teachers at Elro with a high approval rating with students. Until this spell, the Langs had a youthful vigor and robust sex life. Their sophomore daughter Willa, who Dory has deemed “conventional” (average), had found first love with Eli, the drama teacher’s son. But things are now frigid in the soundless fury of their house. Only their old lazy dog lingers to lick himself clean.The Nordic, big-boned gym teacher, Ruth, had a largely healthy sex life with her sculptor husband—as active as one can expect with twin toddlers and an infant—all boys. She was not immune from the “enchantment,” either. Then there is Bev, a stout and menopausal woman with her hedge fund husband, Ed, who had said some cruel things to her not long ago. The spell has her in its grip, and she is fighting back frisky.Does Leanne Bannerjee, the hot school psychologist, go on an icy sex strike when the wind chill factor blows her way? She has three boyfriends and a love life that rivals her students.Wolitzer’s prose is gusty and cinematic, immaculate from start to finish, with well-considered, write-‘em-down one-liners and irrepressible, lucid characters. The voice and style are similar to Tom Perotta, but with a more whimsical moral thrust. The spell’s chaos must reach some conclusion, and this is where the reader enjoys sliding into the ice.This is a domestic comedy/drama with some acid moments, some poignant insights, and a sprinkling of the psychology of love, coupling, and married life. To enjoy this book, it helps to be flexible about a few unrealistic elements present in a contemporary, earth-bound setting.This is warm Wolitzer on ice, with a few Mazurkas and a double lutz finale. She did employ a risky contrivance, but it was an active choice, not a slack trick of the pen. Along the way, she demonstrates fine regard to our tech-savvy, digitally addicted society.

Eighty-year-old Pittsburgh widow Emily Maxwell lives alone with her ripe old intractable dog, Rufus, in the modest and dignified neighborhood where she raised her children and loved her husband. She's alert, oriented, and productive in the garden, a wisp of a woman with a waning appetite and bones like balsa. She goes about her days with routine ruminations and mingled sensations. Her nights are lonely and sometimes sleepless.You learn so much about Emily though her deliberations, her friendship with sister-in-law, Arlene, and her devotion to Rufus, who is one of the most convincing, unadulterated dogs I've met in a book. Emily's uncluttered life is centered on her aging dog, on waiting to see her children and grandchildren, (who live far away), and attending the funerals of her peers. Her faith in God is fastidious and her charity to the church is noble and steadfast. Of course, Emily isn't without blemishes--she has her own peculiarities and peckish ways, the details that make a fictional character authentic and memorable.O'Nan's portrait of Emily is bald and unflinching. Many issues that affect the elderly are addressed and thoroughly examined. What happens in this story is conveyed through small gestures, in Emily's day-to-day activities, in the minutiae of her thoughts and conversations. Her transactions with the younger world around her are subtly shattering, the visible world that casts her to the sidelines and render her invisible. But Emily isn't pitiful--far from it. O'Nan's polished, unstinting prose and nuanced narrative paint a portrait of a plain and austere woman who has lived an unadorned, faithful life, a woman of her time. But beneath the wrinkles, the papery skin and the murmuring heart, there is a fragrance of youth and passion, too.This niche book will appeal to you if the subject of aging and a protagonist who is elderly can sustain your interest. There's no fury or zeal or stormy drama inside these pages. It's an unhurried start and a gradual completion. The familiar peccadillos of ordinary people are the purr and the glue of this story. In lesser hands, it would have sagged and sputtered. However, O'Nan keeps the pace with the surest way I know--crystalline prose and consummate humanity. And a formidable dog!

Boyle's latest wise epic puts ecologists on a restless collision course with agitated animal rights activists. In his vintage style of tackling issues with snarling drama and incendiary humor, Boyle plots a political novel without sending the reader a preachy message, although he comes right up under it.Boyle turns eco controversy on its head, turning back to the theme that man's desire to keep a clean footprint on the earth is a messy and dirty job, often with dire consequences. This is Boyle; bully pulpits are bent with irony, and righteousness is fraught with disobedience. Endangerment of the species brings on reckless endangerment of lives. Who has the right to dominate, to possess this planet? Humans, creatures, natural inhabitants, invasive species--several are examined, many left wanting--especially humans.Restoration ecologist/ biologist and PhD Alma Boyd Takesue spearheads a program with the National Parks Service to exterminate invasive species on the Channel Islands of California. She argues that the infestation of rats and feral pigs are killing off the endemic Channel Island Foxes and disrupting the natural ecosystem.Her dreadlocked redheaded nemesis, businessman Dave LaJoy, knows all about disruption. He protests every one of Alma's presentations to declare war on her efforts, and is opposed to the idea that extirpation leads to preservation. No public presentation by Alma is without LaJoy's outcry."" `How can you talk about being civil when innocent animals are being tortured to death? Civil? I'll be civil when the killing's done and not a minute before.' ""LaJoy is the contentious head of FPA (For the Protection of Animals), a small organization viewed by ecologists as fanatical. His folksinger girlfriend, Anise Reed, is at his side on this issue, contrary to--or a result of--her childhood on a sheep farm on one of the Northern Channel Islands, Santa Cruz, which ended with a bloodlust tragedy.Alma has the law of the federal government, if not always nature, on her side, as well as her Park Service employee boyfriend, Tim Sickafoose. LaJoy is the underdog, dependent on citizen donations and ruled by his unbridled rage. He is primed to fight with subversive acts designed to undermine Alma's program. No ecologists will keep LaJoy from his battle to save the animals. Boyle, in his typical rogue tenor, demonstrates that both sides of the fence are imbued with truth and riddled with internal contradictions.Boyle shifts time periods to illustrate the recent history of the islands and dramatize the inextricable links between past and present, from the introduction of non-native species, to the family connections of Alma and Anise. Alma's grandmother survived a shipwreck near Anacapa while she was pregnant with Alma's mother. Boyle's portrayal of this disaster was stunning, a pinpoint event of woman overcoming the storm of nature's catastrophes with some tragic and triumphant results.Years later, on Santa Cruz Island, Anise's mother suffered a chilling invasion of corporate corruption and a hideous attack on the sheep farm where she lived and toiled. She had worked hard to keep the hungry ravens from the ewes, their carrion cries now reverberating through the years.The historical segments were superbly vivid and requisite to the central story, but interspersed throughout were florid narrative ambushes and excursions that slowed the central movement to a crawl. The cadence was generally barky and rough, as choppy as the Channel Island waters, as emphatic and forceful as a winter storm. I never felt that Boyd hit a rhythmic stride; it was loud and strident, with a manic refrain. But there were jewel-cut, Boyle-cut passages within that often lifted off and flew from the turgid overflow.Although he dodged from sermonizing, it periodically read like an almanac or lecture. His voice tapped in the background, then ceded to the ripe moments of story. It was page-turning terror until the advent of excess fluctuations, like waves crashing against the wily outcroppings of jagged rock. The symmetry was lost at sea, and the climax was drowned in the fury.However, despite these complaints, I was mentally fastened and stimulated, although the emotional resonance faded by the last hundred pages. It's a visionary story, but it lacks visual constancy except for some eye-popping flourishes.Also, some of the characters drift off or stagnate, or are trammeled by the themes. It was their ""purpose"" that overrode their other characteristics. There was something missing emotionally, and I lost interest in them as individuals. But, alas, their absolute certainties are left for the reader to ponder. I am tempted to just say: Boyle was being Boyle, only more so. He is one-of-a-kind, an island of Boyle, and who am I to cross it?The inclusion of pigs, whether capitalist or feral; the onslaught of rats, both animal and human; a nest of snakes, poisonous or colloquial; and the carrion birds circling the sky are just a few of the metaphorical joists that furnish the narrative and add dimension to the interlocking sequences. As a conservation story, the prose isn't too thrifty, but in the end, you will be glad you read it. I hesitate to say it is significant, but there you go. Boyle is a rare species. It is topical and arch, Boyle and boiling, trenchant and tough.End note—there’s an intrepid video trailer of this book, directed by Jamieson Fry.

Jung and Freud on their revolutionary visit to the United States in 1909. Rubenfeld braided historical fact and fiction in this Manhattan corkscrew murder mystery, centering on Freud's pioneering ""talking therapy"" and penning some biting dialogue between the three psychoanalysts. Younger's skepticism and attraction to Freud's theories enhanced the mesmerizing story of his attempt to cure a damaged, neurotic, and mute woman. The novel was peopled with a sprawling cast of doctors and louche politicians, drawing the reader into a lush, dissecting mixture of cerebral scrutiny and emotional desire.Rubenfeld's second and very ambitious novel also weaves fact and fiction, with extensive scope, while adopting some of the motifs and themes from his debut work. This time the author is tacitly paralleling events in the novel to the economic depression of contemporary times, as well as the 9/11 tragedies.The year is now 1920, the eve of the roaring twenties, women's suffrage, and the transition from Wilson to Harding. Nobel Prize winner (twice) Madame Curie is about to tour the United States to raise funds for her research on radium. Radium is already being used in industry to paint luminous watch dials, poisoning the working women at a factory in Manhattan. Many factory workers are out of work altogether. Prohibition starts and gives rise to speakeasies, Babe Ruth has been traded to the Yankees (1919), and Freud has advanced his theory of human drives in his essay, ""Beyond the Pleasure Principle,"" which expounds on the theory of the death instinct. The Mexican Revolution is officially over, but tensions are not.The Treaty of Versailles had severed many of Germany's provinces from its territories (1919). J.P. Morgan & Company is the titanic leader of finance. Moreover, a billion dollars in gold is being transferred from the old Sub-Treasury to the adjacent Assay Office via overhead bridge. The author incorporates all these historical events, (and more) into a multi-faceted, sometimes brilliant, not quite numinous, but intriguing and educating story.Stratham Younger, now a veteran of the Great War and an ex-psychiatrist and ex-husband, is standing on Wall Street when a bomb explodes, killing and maiming many civilians. It was at that time the biggest terrorist attack ever executed on American soil. Unsolved to this day, there is insubstantial conjecture that Italian anarchists were behind it. This leaves it wide open for Rubenfeld to create a capital, confabulated truth from historical, anecdotal, documented, and apocryphal background and a florid imagination. He does it superbly, with an expansive cast that includes authentic politicians and businessmen, the FBI and Treasury kingpins, as well as fictional characters. It also alludes, by comparison, that a proper criminal investigation was never conducted for 9/11.(Fictional) Detective Littlemore, of the New York Police Department and Younger's best friend (present in Rubenfeld's first novel), comes on board to help him try to solve the case. Accompanying Younger during the explosion are Littlemore, and an enigmatic and beautiful French scientist and student of Madame Curie, Colette Rousseau. Her relationship with Younger has a fiery chemistry with lots of obstacles. And, using a motif from his former novel, we are introduced to another mute, this time Colette's young brother, Luc.Rubenfeld straddles the investigation into the Wall Street attack with the story of Younger's relationship with Colette and Luc via a well-paced balancing act. Freud's presence will be included to help unravel the origin of Luc's muteness and try to cure it. Someone(s) is after Colette, it seems, and she is very close to not escaping dangerous villains. She is on a serious mission to explore the medical benefits of radium and raise money for Madame Curie's research, as well as find employment as a scientist again. Prior to WW1, she was at the Sorbonne. And--love story? We have a fetching love story, too.I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, but with a bit of a caveat. Rubenfeld pulls off this byzantine plot handily, but with some sacrifice of character and some crowd-pleasing tidiness where I would have liked it messy. (I liked the messier first novel.) Younger, who is no longer the narrator in this omniscient perspective, comes across as a White Knight and brooding, taciturn hottie. That was quite a switch from his younger and more self-effacing and uncertain days. The war and maturation may have had an effect, certainly, but he was too predictable here.Jimmy Littlemore was also a caped crusader of sorts, a committed family man with flawless scruples. No equivocations to his character, as he always took the moral high ground. The villains and white hats were often too clearly delineated, except where Rubenfeld decided to bait and switch. There were more obvious contrivances at work in this novel, which lent a more mainstream adjustment. And there were some hokey types used to drive the narrative action and plot tension.The language occasionally felt too modern and anachronistic, speaking too closely in the verse of today. The author generally pulled back before going too far with it, but it did peal at times. For example,""Germany hates us because we beat them. England and France hate us because we saved them. Russia hates us because we're capitalist. The rest of the world hates us because we're imperialist.""Finally, the ambiguities were conspicuously ambiguous and not sufficiently nettling or beguiling. Rubenfeld did most of the work for us, although it was impressive work. It was a dazzling ride through most of the story--a little boggy in the middle, but fine and tight at the end, and worth the investment. I'd like to see Rubenfled aim his concept just a little bit smaller the next time, furthering story lines about psychiatry--his forte--and give us some main characters with a bit more incertitude and mystique. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jan 05, 2011","Feb 16, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8536672-the-death-instinct

In the case of Urban Waite's contemporary, reflective and rousing cat-and-mouse debut, I was glued to the pages of perilous pursuit and quickened by the torn and haunted rogue heroes--Deputy Bobby Drake, and ex-convict and owner of a struggling horse farm, Phil Hunt.There's the law (Drake), the lawless (Grady), and then there is that equivocal and tarnished outlaw, Hunt--the name brimming with metaphor--whose reckoning is tethered to Drake's by plaited doubts and dark obstacles reaching back to a coiled and inextricable past. In short, they are each other's nemesis. The wives in this story are resolute and strong, providing a mirror for the reader to reflect on their moody tormented husbands. The northwest territory of Washington State becomes its own penetrating and terrifying, living character.In the mountain wilderness passes between Washington and Canada, drug smuggling is a lot more challenging than it used to be, now that boundary crossing between Canada and the U.S. requires a passport and the roads are policed. Bricks of cocaine dropped from planes in the blue-black night below the high treetops and picked up by horseback, as well as human ""mules"" carrying condoms full of heroin implanted by ingestion, are the methods used to foil the law.In the near-opening pages, newly married Deputy Drake, on his day off, sights Hunt's abandoned horse trailer on the logging roads of Silver Lake and suspects an imminent transaction. He camps out and waits, haunted by memories, by the ghost of family history. Drake's father, a once formidable sheriff, is serving time in prison. He supplemented his earnings as a drug courier, as Hunt is doing now. Hunt's wife, Nora, is not too keen on her husband's extracurricular activities, but their love is a firm and unalloyed bedrock that never diminishes. Hunt's curled past as a convict is something for the reader to discover, a piece of information that is teased out and explored over the course of the novel, magnifying the psychological heft of this better-than-genre story. Hunt's demons correlate Drake's, and propel them and the story.The plot mobilizes early on when Drake comes face to face with Hunt and Hunt's young rookie in the midst of collecting the goods. Phil is a skilled horseman who escapes, but the ""kid"" is apprehended and suffers a gruesome fate in jail. The chase proceeds with a measured pace, hypnotic and bracing. The dead bodies pile up, thanks to the main supplier's lackey, Grady, a former chef and sociopathic killer on the trail of Hunt and Drake alike.Rounding out the cast are DEA agent and straight shooter, Driscoll, working with Drake; ""the lawyer"" (nameless) and drug deal maker; Hunt's long time friend, Eddie; Bobby Drake's perceptive wife, Sheri; and an array of cold-blooded, one-dimensional thugs. Then there's the female mule, Thu, a Vietnamese women who lives in Seattle. The thugs and mule are necessary to the plot, but the theme is amply filled by the invisible relationship between Drake and Hunt.I was additionally impressed by the nuanced juxtaposition of Sheri and Nora, and how they counterpoint Drake and Hunt. Phil is used to Nora's capacity to know his essential nature. Drake, a newlywed, still grapples with Sheri's tacit understanding of his confused motives. The counterpoint between the two marriages was lightly but substantively rendered, endowing the book with weighty subtext that accumulates as the story progresses. This was a testosterone-infused novel, and yet, in the final assessment, it is the women who impel their men.Waite may not have broken the mold in this somber thriller, but he deftly contributed his own achievement. The spiritual struggle between good and bad is a conventional theme that the author probed with a fresh eye. There were a few scene contrivances to advance the plot, but they did not distract from this taut, intense story.The prose is stark and shadowy, lambent and sensuous, weaving in the geography of the northwest so ably that I heard the wind like a susurrus whisper--and sometimes a howl--through the trees, and I lurched through the snaking roads. There are tendrils of Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men, but less antediluvian, and Waite, at this juncture, is not as seasoned. But I did relish at some of the turns of event that will inevitably be compared to McCarthy's work, and I suspect that Waite deliberately paid a nodding homage--as evidenced by the character (although minor) identified as ""the kid"" (viz. Blood Meridian, but with a lower-case ""k""). Some readers may decry it as essentially formulaic, but that would be a limited view. What makes this novel stand out is the ethereal prose and the ever-strengthening bond between Hunt and Drake.The events in this book are graphic, explicit and occasionally disturbing, but with a controlled restraint. There's also a choice twist on the Mexican standoff. For squeamish readers, this is a fair warning that the novel isn't for the faint of heart or for readers who abhor violence in literature. This was executed like a noir-western-opera-suspense-drama-slash-thriller fusion, with a harmonic equipoise of physical action and interior torment. The story is a hybrid brew of nihilism and romanticism, summoning a cauldron of terror and stirring it with an ache and longing for tranquility....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jan 24, 2011","Feb 16, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8666759-the-terror-of-living

After their divorce, Hemingway goes on to have three more wives, each one standing in the shadows, waiting for him to dissolve his present vows. This is the story of the woman that loved him before he was famous.Paula McLain researched their biographies, letters, and Hemingway's novels, culling the material to imagine a credible story of their charmed and battered marriage in Paris, from 1921-1926. The tortured life and tragically foreshadowed suicide of Ernest Hemingway is public knowledge, as was his legendary womanizing. McLain's novel dodges the palaver, blending the facts that are known together with credible inference, creating a plausible, informed depiction of Hemingway and Hadley's marriage--the quotidian, the famed, the halcyon, the harsh.The author writes from Hadley's point of view, inviting the reader inside their most tender and demolishing moments. A few choice sections belong to Hemingway's perspective, urgent and telling. The narrative deftly folds in their histories--the years before they met--artfully revealing early and private woes, which ripple and sometimes hiss beneath the ardor. We get the back stories without muddled exposition; by the time it arrives at the failure of their union, readers have acquired a fluency of Hadley's nature and Hemingway's core.Hadley sustained several painful childhood experiences--that eerily parallel Hemingway's--and was a recluse and ""spinster"" at twenty-eight, when she met and was courted by the twenty-one-year-old Hemingway. He was a struggling, ambitious writer, home after the shock and agonies of the Great War, where he endured trauma and its aftereffects, described today as PTSD (Post-traumatic stress disorder). He couldn't sleep without a light. His mother was an insufferable controller, and he didn't want to marry a woman like that.The pliable and decidedly not progressive Hadley was a sound match for the needy, talented, and egocentric Ernest. He required a woman who would unshakably support his career. Hadley was a generous lover and devoted supporter who sacrificed her personal ambitions for Ernest. She was also playful and warm and smart, but not savvy and edgy like the emerging modern women of the 1920's.In prose that reflects the style of the era, McLain illustrates a glittering world of élan expatriates and literati. Hadley and Ernest (and their baby, Bumby) lived in the (then) modest Latin Quarter, and soon became a vibrant part of the Left Bank artists, such as Gertrude Stein, Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, Ford Maddox Ford, Jean Rhys, and many others. Open marriage, and mistresses living in the same house with wives, were not unheard of in this set.Blithe talk, bottomless glasses of whiskey, and bottle after bottle of wine was the norm in their active social lives. In the mornings, the hair of the dog was the cure for the night on the town. Jaunts to Pamplona to see the bullfights were illustrated by McClain in all their gory splendor.During this time, Hemingway wrote copiously and tirelessly, jealous of some of his peers who were already established. The germination and completion of The Sun Also Rises is covered, as well as his ruthless parody of Sherwood Anderson's work, The TORRENTS OF SPRING. Hadley loved him utterly, propped him up buoyantly, and assured him of his inevitable success. Eventually, Ernest acquired more expansive needs, and Hadley needed less, but got more than she bargained for. McClain limns their marriage as more than just a cautionary tale.""To keep you from thinking, there was liquor, an ocean's worth at least, all the usual vices and plenty of rope to hang yourself with. But some of us, a very few in the end, bet on marriage against the odds.""This isn't standard ""chick-lit"" fare, nor is it cloying. I recommend this to anyone interested in the psyche of Hemingway, his first marriage, and his genesis as one of the greatest American authors of our time--from a wife's perspective....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"Feb 02, 2011","Feb 16, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8683812-the-paris-wife

She offers an intimate glimpse of the spouses and children left behind to cope when the men in the fictional infantry battalion of 1-7 Cav are deployed to Iraq.We've seen media pictures proffering the stalwart strength and Mona Lisa smiles of army wives, but we haven't been host to their private trials--of farewells, homecomings, and transitions. Fallon captures their mixed emotions and fears with a gritty realism, and reveals critical, vital moments in their insular and marginal lives. She glances sharply into the tearful deployment, the lonely absence, and the stirring homecoming. How the wives cope with these changes is a recurring theme.This is fiction, but Fallon writes with authority: her husband, a major, was deployed in Iraq for two tours of duty while she lived in Fort Hood. She knows the depth of the cookie-cutter, thin-walled houses--they are occupied by courageous and terrified women with thick skins, empty beds, and tentative thoughts.The wives in this book form a proxy family together, the FRG (Family Readiness group), where, for better or worse, they convene and connect. They bond in this dry and desolate patch of Central Texas, support each other, and wait for news of the front. Mingling with civilians off base is distressing. It's painful to watch a dad knock around a ball with his son, or a couple dining out and dancing cheek to cheek. Some of these wives have babies who haven't yet met their daddies. How they endure the complex emotions of separation drives the narrative and compels the reader.As Fallon shows us, the time in limbo is often marked with dread and confusion. It can be a powerful change agent, mushroom their fear, or injure self-esteem, to name a few effects. It can dash a formerly positive body image, especially if anxiety and loneliness create eye bags and a gaunt complexion. The women in her stories often have sleep disturbances and eat erratically. One woman quells her insomnia by listening to her neighbor's routines through the permeable walls.In the first story, Meg goes to the Commissary, eyes a raw slab of steak--the rivulets of fat, the sanguinary juices, the protruding bone--and imagines a mortal battle wound. The women wake up every morning and scan the Internet news for reports of ambushes and roadside bombs, wondering if their husbands are safe in their quarters or unrecognizably shattered in numberless pieces. Meanwhile, they have individual, separate concerns. Fallon kicks it up a notch with her story about a wife in remission from breast cancer, waiting to see the latest reports of her medical tests. In the meantime, her kids did not show up for school, and she has to deal with the embarrassment of soldiers on base assisting, investigating, and scrutinizing her actions that day.And, what is it like to communicate with your loved one only through technology, to feel the unbearable absence of touch? To wait, and wait, time folding in on itself, or rolling out, while you cleave, living on emails, snail mail, and the rare skype. And, even when they return, the complex dynamics of adjustment and role reversal are stunning; the wives have been independent for so long that sharing a life again can be raw and awkward. Instead of joyful and warm, it may be glacial and fraught with erosion. All that alone time carves out multiple reflections and haunting desires. At least one wife has some lacerating news for her returning and wounded husband.And, what is it like for the men, the soldiers and officers who have bravely committed this time to the safety and well being of their fellow infantrymen? They didn't sign up to divide their loyalties, to betray their families, but the quixotic beast of war invades the frontier of domestic life, too. Some of them sneak cell phones into their camp. One of the soldiers becomes enchanted with a comely foreign interpreter while on a mission to search for IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices). Another soldier isn't sure if he is just paranoid or failed to perceive his wife's change of heart, and acts frantically on his fears. And some of them don't make it home. For those wives, it is the pain of the unknown, the moment of death that is now gone, that took their husband away. That image, the memories, and the disfigurement of grief remain.Imagine, all alone, with a flashlight, tiptoeing in the dark inside a squat, yellow, dusty rectangular building, suddenly bumping up against a life. You emit a startled gasp. That's what these stories are like. Fallon's prose is stark and incandescent. There are no frills or filler necessary to embellish these candid characters and situations, and I have only hinted at a few. The passages are powerful and lean, the nuances chilling and urgent, and the dénouements radiate with ambiguity. These are bracing mini-portraits with mega-wattage. When you hear Fort Hood mentioned in the news again, it will palpate with familiarity. You'll feel a jolt. It will never again be just that abstract military post in Texas.

No, this isn't an LSAT logic problem or a torrid soap opera.

It's packed with contagious quotes that you want to spread:""Everyone should have analysis. It should be compulsory, like military service used to be.""Or, let's say you are jealous of a woman and want to share a canny reproach with a friend:""She sees herself as slim, lives being slim as synonymous with being rigorous. Gaining weight, she is convinced, is always a lapse.""Lots of light, saucy bon mots flash through this story, but there are small earthquakes that convulse now and then. At 228 pages and 51 short chapters (and an epilogue), most chapters are structured in pairs, such as ""Thomas and Louise"" and ""Anna and Yves,"" alluding to couples, as well as Abkhazian dominoes, a game that is close to Yves' heart. ""He is a writer who has readers, but not a true readership."" He may obscure himself further by titling his next novel after that titular game.Throughout the wry novel, the coupling and uncoupling of husbands, wives, and lovers overlap and cross, and sometimes meet. The themes and ideas may be common but the characters are genuine and close. The dialog is inspired, not prepared or clichéd. The prose slides creamily off the tongue, like a filled croissant, and is peppered with paradox and the double entendre, pointed aphorisms and learned allusions. And life can be turned into aphorisms, instructs Thomas to his patient, Anna, as a way of fixing life into words.""...what attracts us about another person has had more to do with what makes them fragile...Love is kindled by the weakness we perceive, the flaw we get in through, wouldn't you say?""There's a gravitas that manifests subtly, an accretion of observations and details that examine love from every curve and angle. You can visualize this dialog-heavy book as a film, or a play. There is no way not to compare Le Tellier to the best of Woody Allen--a little bit Lubitsch, a little bit Jewish, some Annie Hall, some Stardust Memories, a profusion of Freud. But this is French, and you will imagine that you are walking through Jardin du Luxembourg or running across the Quai des Grands Augustins on a grey, Paris day. It's eclectic, though, with American as well as other infusions. The savvy prose serves up a savory atmosphere, drifting through outdoor cafés and public squares. Some of the time, though, you are indoors, near a bookcase, and often a bed...Cultural icons, such as François Truffaut, are included, not just as a reference, but as meaning to the story at hand. Thomas emails Louise, after they first meet, that doesn't a scene in Stolen Kisses anticipate the future of email? But the scene he shares, in detail, is the buttering of his desires.There is even a postmodernish, double-column chapter; on one side is Yves' dry, but increasingly inventive lecture of the word ""foreign,"" with emphasis on the fact that the French have only one word for it, l'etranger. Juxtaposed on the other side is the cuckolded Stan, seated in the back row, agonized in a stream of invective consciousness. The linguistic stunt work by the author is more than a showcase; it concludes in a probing, poignant place of alarm and discovery.The characters in these triangular love affairs share universal elements-- sex and death, guilt and virtue, grief and ecstasy, illusion and certainty, passion and ennui. And, of course, love.

Interlacing two primary periods of violent upheaval, author Aminatta Forna renders a scarred nation of people with astonishing grace and poise--an unforgettable portrait of open wounds and closed mouths, of broken hearts and fractured spirits, woven into a stunning evocation of recurrence and redemption, loss and tender reconciliation. Forna mines a filament of hope from resigned fatalism, from the devastation of a civil war that claimed 50,000 lives and displaced 2.5 million people. Those that survived felt hollowed out, living with an uneasy peace.Over 99% of people suffered from unrelieved post-traumatic stress disorder, and those that survived often hid shameful secrets of forced betrayal.

The story goes through seamless temporal shifts--from 1969, a period of unrest following a military coup--to 2001, following ten years of civil war begun in 1991.Adrian Lockheart is a British psychologist on sabbatical from his failing marriage to accept a (second) post in Freetown. He is compassionate and dogged in his pursuit to treat the population of mentally disturbed and traumatized citizens, to help them find hope and resolve, yet he feels emotionally dislocated from his own family at home.""The truth is that since arriving here his life has seemed more charged with meaning than it ever had in London. Here the boundaries are limitless, no horizon, no sky. He can feel his emotions, solid and weighty, like stones in the palm of his hands.""Adrian treats tortured men and women in the fallout of war, finding a particularly poignant interest in Agnes, a woman who is suffering from a fugue disorder. He contends that the endless miles she compulsively roams on foot (and subsequently forgets) indicate a search for something meaningful from the ruins of war. He believes she is going toward somewhere, a place he determines to find out.Adrian's most prominent patient is the unreliable narrator, Elias Cole, an elderly, retired history professor dying of pulmonary disease. In this city of silence, Elias is compelled to tell his story, his confession, to Adrian. It begins in 1969, when Elias first laid eyes on Saffia Kamara, a charming and comely botanist married to the gregarious, fearless Julius, an academic at the university.""People are wrong when they talk of love at first sight. It is neither love nor lust. No. As she walks away from you, what you feel is loss. A premonition of loss.""Julius, Elias, and Saffia embark on a friendship that inextricably points to the destiny of the next generation. The military coups of the late 60's followed Sierra Leon's hard-won independence from the British colonial rule. Political unrest led to widespread paranoia, which in turn led to wobbly allegiances. Elias's confession to Adrian is the rallying point, which heightens all the other narratives. Adrian's probing of Elias reaches to encounters outside of the hospital, and will alter the course of his life, and too of the story.Lastly, there is Kai Manseray, a talented, young orthopedic surgeon, a tireless and tormented man plagued by chronic insomnia and a suppressed and devastating history. Kai chose to stay and help the damaged and impoverished, rather than abscond two years ago with his best friend, Tejani. He is torn between his loyalties in Sierra Leone and his desire for a more elite station in the States. The woman he loved has gone, the city ravaged, the people embattled, but his little cousin, Abass, and the patients who need him keep him anchored. He has secrets that he won't share with anyone, that threaten to undo him in the operating theater.As the story highlights the contrast of their professions, Kai and Adrian form a tenuous bond of friendship. Kai's achievements are measurable--stitching, sewing, patching, cutting, and saving lives. Adrian, however, can't measure his patients' success with an X-ray or point to approximated edges of a wound. Psychotherapy is a process of encounters, wending your way through the dark channels of a person's interior and facilitating change through conversation. Kai and Adrian's bond is ultimately the most hypnotic, with consequences encroaching on the dark side of hope.Forna constructs a mesmerizing collision of forces and people that slowly propel the reader toward a towering climax. This story is for the committed reader, the patient literature lover who will undertake many hours of dedication for the inevitable reward. Think of a blank canvas, and every sentence as a mindful brushstroke, a bloom on the page. It takes a while for the picture to materialize. The writing is carefully crafted, and yet imperceptibly so, not in the least self-conscious. She is steadily augmenting, fuller and deeper, contrasting the light and the darkness, capturing nature and sound. Even her secondary and tertiary characters are wrought with polish and care.The story's leisurely pace builds its emotional cathedral one stone at a time; at about the halfway point, it becomes riveting and impossible to turn away.This is a personal and natal undertaking for Forna, whose father, Dr. Mohamed Forna, was a dissident in Sierra Leona and was killed on trumped up charges when she was only eleven-years-old. Her non-fiction book, The Devil That Danced on the Water: A Daughter's Quest, is the story of her search for the truth of that harrowing time. She continues her exploration of healing and recovery in this deeply researched and ambitious book.There are coincidences in this novel that nevertheless do not disturb the beauty or the impact of the story. In lesser hands, this may have come across as artifice. However, Forna's characters and themes are ultimately grounded, and the patterns that emerge from the disparate stories--the unguarded moments, the link of love that ties all the characters together--transcend her intention. The potency of storytelling and the refrain of love in the aftermath of tragedy is evident and sublime in her fluent prose.""There exists, somewhere, a scale for love invented by one of his [Adrian's] profession...And there are others still who say love is but a beautiful form of madness.""The injured voices of her characters mesh into a voice of hope and holding on, to a startling story of redemption. At various intervals, the lyrics of Jimmy Cliff's ""The Harder They Come"" drift onto the page. It sang, I sang.""Well, they tell me there's a pie up in the sky, waiting for you when you die...The harder they come, the harder they fall.""Love endures.

Like Faulkner and McCarthy, he exposes the underbelly of the dispossessed with a nihilistic, gothic, and poetic style. Like Steinbeck, he portrays the marginal class pedigrees with compassion and wry social observance.Finn, the author's first novel, was a fictional biography of Huck Finn's father--a savage, twisted man who bears no similarities to Twain's Pap. I was hooked from the merciless opening sentence to its ruthless last pages.Clinch's new novel shares some of the same themes, characters, and features, such as a disenfranchised cast of people, a whiskey still, a house with a broken spine, a blind man, and a riverine terrain. This story is inspired by the true history of the Ward brothers of Munnsville, New York and the subsequent documentary, ""My Brother's Keeper."" Researching it on Wikipedia after I read the novel was a helpful complement to the story.Three elderly brothers--Vernon, Audie, and Creed Proctor--live together on a dilapidated (that's an understatement) farm in upstate New York. One morning, on arising, Vernon is found dead in the bed he shares with his brothers. The investigation of his death in 1990 is the central subject matter of the story, which spans from 1932-1990.Told in a chorus of voices in short chapters (sometimes one sentence, sometimes a few pages), the narrative alternates from one character to another, like a non-linear chronicle. The title of each chapter or heading is a character's name. These include the three brothers; their parents, Lester and Ruth; their sister, Donna; her husband DeAlton, and son, Tom; their neighbors Margaret and Preston; and law enforcement officer, Del Graham, as well as a smattering of others. Unlike the strictly third person POV used in Finn, the voices fluctuate between first and third person here. The reader is given back story and secondary plot through the eyes of the various voices, and the tension builds gradually as the links connect between past and present, between neighbor and kin, and between outsiders and inhabitants.Clinch evokes an earthy, bleak sense of place in the farm settlement of Carversville, with its convoluted web of sinister and complex family dynamics. The grime-encrusted film that covers every skin and surface is so convincing that I could fairly smell the reek of filth saturating the story. He also provides some graphic scenes of the Proctors' agrarian life, including a mishap of ice fishing and the slaughter of a pig, scenes that made me dizzy from its ferocity and immediacy. He strikes a taut equipoise between brutal and beautiful, lashing and lyrical.There are conspicuous blemishes with the alternating viewpoints--the voices are not entirely consistent to character. The three brothers are illiterate, atavistic, and largely inchoate to others, especially Audie. When referred to by other characters, the reader perceives correctly their boorish and uncouth traits. However, when they spoke, they articulated with too much range, reflection, and harmony, which contradicted what we already knew about their natures and did not successfully differentiate them from other narrators.In a pointillist construction, it is detracting when several narrators lack distinction. It created a static energy, particularly in the first half of the novel, when the reader is getting acquainted with the cast. The ensemble ran together despite the chapter identification. But when Clinch uses third person narration, it is impeccable. He isn't trying to be colloquial. That is when his prose soars and I felt the immediacy of events and surroundings.Despite these structural flaws, I recommend this novel for its powerful atmospherics and compelling story. I look forward to Clinch's third novel. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 08, 2010","May 24, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7493646-kings-of-the-earth
