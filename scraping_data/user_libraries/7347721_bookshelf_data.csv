So...I was surprised to find that ""book binding"" here isn't really book binding but something else entirely, with magic involved. And that is not a bad thing at all! The book is a slow burn (to those who have read it: don't laugh at this bad pun, please). Part 1 frustrated me to no end..we have no idea why Emmet (the main character and the story is told largely from his POV) is suffering so much and why everyone thinks and behaves the way they are (prejudiced, suspicious, alert, secretive).

Then the story started to reveal itself layer by layer, halfway through Part 1 the practice of book binding is revealed and Part 2 answered a lot of questions I had through a series of flashbacks -- the shoe dropped in this chapter -- and you will experience something akin to a heartbreak, trust me. Part 3 largely dealt with the aftermath and it climaxes in an explosive event that made me want to get in there and intervene. #protectEmmetI hope there is a sequel to this!  ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 26, 2019","Jan 27, 2019","Jan 20, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39964740-the-binding

I am sharing it here in case he doesn’t have access to his Goodreads inbox.Hi Colum, I want to tell you my story.‪GI sent this below letter to Colum. I am sharing it here in case he doesn’t have access to his Goodreads inbox.Hi Colum, I want to tell you my story.‪Growing up, my parents put me on private tutorials for English, Japanese, math, classical piano and science. From elementary to high school, my days lasted from 5:30am - 9pm for 12 years. I started to feel an enormous pressure when I had to do my university entrance exam. I tried to flunk math but by sheer luck ended up in top 6% and got accepted in a prestigious university.For 6 semesters I maintained at least 3.5/4 GPA and even got a scholarship for a dual degree abroad.‬ ‪On my 7th semester my grandfather died (he killed himself) and I failed an exam, for the first time in my life.I didn’t know how to recover. I was burnt-out, alone, depressed, and filled with anxiety. For 6-7 months I wandered around aimlessly thinking maybe it’s better to go away and drown in darkness forever. Safer. It was too much.‬ I couldn’t get out of bed most days.‪One day I decided to do kill myself. I had practice harming myself and I thought I could do it a step further, easy. I walked so many miles my feet literally burnt (this was summer in Australia, on the hottest day of the month so far). I somehow ended up in the library. I sat down and I told myself, “Pick up a book. Any book. Read it until the end. Last a book and decide if you still feel worthless and hopeless by then.” I read Let The Great World Spin. After I finished the last page, I broke down and cried. The beauty of each life no matter how short or ordinary. Corrigan’s whole journey. I realized then I didn’t really want to die. I want to live. I want to feel. Everything. The pain, the love, the loss, the hope. Life is enough. I don’t need to be perfect to live. To stumble through life is living. That’s enough.‪I chose to drop out of college because I was afraid of losing my will to live. I started to pour out my passion in football (am a huge football fan). I started to be active in communities and learning new skills like design, marketing, and about football industry. Within a year I ended up getting hired by a sports media company. ‬Eight years has passed and here I am. ‪This time working for my own company. I’m working on the World Cup, Champions League, the big tickets. The darkness sometimes reappears on the edges of my mind — I don’t think they ever disappeared completely, but this time I’m better equipped because I know I’m more than grades on paper. ‬I know, thanks to you, that being flawed and struggling through ugliness is part of being alive. Thank you. You saved my life....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jan 2010,"Jan 05, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin
