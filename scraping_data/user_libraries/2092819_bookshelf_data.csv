There are many direct references to other books, and I can feel the indirect references (I capture the castle) too, but this one feels like it's not just derivative. One of the ways I can tell this was written in 2023 instead of some earlier time is the societal/emotional commentary. None of it is subtle, but I don't think its meant to be. (view spoiler)[ Biddy carefully names, reflects on and deals with emotions rather than immediately forgiving or giving in to outbursts. This feels didactic, and like an overt, gentle but firm correction to traditional less healthy dramatics. The commentary about working within a system to dismantle it or outside of it felt more awkward or unfinished? I'm both glad that everyone Biddy cares about lived, but also continue to be ambivalent about 'everybody lives!' syndrome.

Three tThis one is more even than They Can't Kill Us Till They Kill Us, but I kind of like the rollercoaster-y unevenness of They Can't Kill Us more? Three thoughts: 1) I've been contemplating feelings a lot lately. in ""Board Up the Doors, Tear Down the Walls"" Hanif touches on rage as a form of love. and how rollercoasteryness is sometimes better than being numb and centered. (this essay also feels like an extension of one in They Can't Kill Us.. which I can't reference by name because that book is in a box in a building I can't acces)2) I think the thing I like so much about Hanif Abdurraqib's work, unsurprisingly, is how he manages to be so damn soft and optimistic. Beef, and anger, and death are all opportunities for connection and love and turning into cgi bees. How and when can I see the world as he sees it?3) Early on in the whole book, in ""On Marathons and Tunnels"", an essay about Soul Train and Dance Marathons, Hanif puts together the best written description I've seen about partner dancing. It'll have better impact with the build up of the whole essay. and it's too unwieldy to block quote here. but you can't stop me. He starts this last image by saying that in the early days of Soul Train, there were few coordinated partners. and so often people in the Line would just have to figure it out on the spot together, as partners. He says, (view spoiler)[ “In these scenarios, there was no time to figure out choreography with someone, just those brief moments to lock eyes before being at the mercy of each other's movements. Then it was just the two of you, moving through a narrow tunnel of music and shouts urging you forward. ...And so the dancers must rely on what they know of the body to figure themselves —and each other —out of the hot, pulsating room, with nothing but noise and instinct to guide them before they reach the end of the line and part, maybe forever. “And I think this is how I would most like to imagine romance, friends, or should I say lovers. In praise of all my body can and cannot do, I wish to figure out how it can best sing with all of yours for a moment in a room where the walls sweat. I wish to lock eyes across a dance floor from you while something our mothers sang in the kitchen plays over speakers. I want us to find each other among the forest of writhing and make a deal. “Okay, lover. It is just us now The only way out is through.”  (hide spoiler)]...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 08, 2023","Jun 12, 2023","Jun 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49247757-a-little-devil-in-america

Given tI think it's necessary to go into this knowing that it's a fictional account of a family separated during the Korean war rather than a memoir. Given that Grass is a memoir, and given the narrative structure here, it feels memoir-ish even though it's not. 3 things: 1) Gendry-Kim perfectly captures the stiffness and the movement of the halmoni in this comic- hunching over, getting up, scowling, walking. it's perfect. 2) Gendry-Kim also is still great at using brushwork and landscape and physical space to create a sense of interior space on the page. 3) This comic makes this story personal. I've heard and thought about families separated by the 38th parallel. My uncle even got his US citizenship so he could visit North Korea and find his older brother. But I've always thought about the Korean war on a historic scale rather than a individual one. My last grandparent refused to talk about what she did during the war to survive with 2 small children and a third on the way. It's a shame that I don't know the story of what happened in my own family better. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Feb 23, 2023","Feb 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56269286-the-waiting

(Hi, that’s me) I take that to mean this is Novik’s take on an updated or reimagined version of Hogwarts built on nigh a quarter century’s worth of fan fiction. It does read like Harry Potter fan fiction—we could easily swap in Draco for El and Harry for Orion. The static characters are very static and could essentially be Cho Chang and Parvati Patil and Blaise Zambini. But things Novik does well: pacing- never do I feel like she’s holding back because she’s waiting to reveal something: she creates problems, solves them and keeps it moving. She also hints at (and I want more of it) the system being rotten and hopefully we get to some dismantling rather than entrenching systems of power in books 2/3.
