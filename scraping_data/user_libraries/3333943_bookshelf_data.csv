Her first, A Is For Alibi came out in 1982. I read it in 2004, then read the second one, B Is For Burglar before the year was over. I thought her PI, Kinsey Millhone, was pretty cool and I liked that the books were set in a fictional Santa Barbara, since by then I was living in Los Angeles. But then I discovered Janet Evanovitch and her Stephanie Plum series, set in New Jersey. Stephanie rocks! I grew up in New Jersey and could just see it all.Like many readers of literary fiction, I use mystery/crime fiction as a palate cleanser. Sometimes you just need a book you can read in one or two days! Then again, sometimes a literary reading group can lead me to mysteries. That happened to me in 2005, when one of my groups read Fire Sale by Sara Paretsky. Now her PI, V I Warshawski, is the baddest of all female main characters. I stuck with her and have read all her books in order. She stole me away completely!But in 2017, Sue Grafton died before she could write her 26th book: Z Is For Zero. So tragic to me. I resolved to get back to her and I finally did. C Is For Corpse finds Kinsey Millhone investigating an attempted murder when the victim is actually murdered before she has found the culprit. Bobby Callahan lost much of his memory after the first attempt on his life, but he still managed to charm Kinsey plus he had already paid her a good retainer. She powers on and finds out all about his twisted rich family and the secret for which he was killed.What I most admire about all these female mystery writers is their portrayal of smart, tough women who risk dismemberment and death themselves as they pursue justice. (Another two I follow are Laura Lippman (Baltimore) and Nevada Barr who wrote all those great thrillers set in National Parks.) Paretsky and Grafton started publishing in 1982, Evanovitch created Stephanie Plum in 1993. Women born in mid-20th century America, who came of age during the wild times of 1970s feminism; each one set out to challenge the masculine domination of crime fiction and have done so with great panache, sly humor, and plenty of imbedded commentary on late 20th and early 21st century inequality, politics and patriarchy. I would argue that they also raised the bar on writing quality in the mystery genre.Who are your favorite female mystery writers?...more",Notes are private!,2,2,1,"Apr 09, 2024","Apr 11, 2024","Apr 09, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89656.C_is_for_Corpse

Told from nine different points of view, I learned the ways and troubles of a small town, Mohave, in the southern California desert. This is a composite story: a family saga, a murder mystery, and a love story. The main character is Nora, daughter of the dead man, jazz composer, who always wanted to get out of Mohave and pursue her musical dreams. Her chapters tell how and why her parents emigrated from Morocco, how much she loved her father but could not get along with her mother. The other characters have their own chapters revealing the PTSD of a former soldier and cop, the fears of an undocumented Mexican family, the regrets of Maryam the widow, and the Black female police detective who tries to solve the hit and run incident, plus a few more.By rotating through these viewpoints, the lives of these people are revealed with all their very human emotions, conflicts, and dreams. I became so involved with all of them and marveled at the exposition of tensions that run like fault lines through the lives of these people. They are all Americans, but they are all from somewhere else originally. Thus, it is a quintessential American tale. I live in a fairly diverse neighborhood of Los Angeles, which changes every year as people move away or in. I have spent time in the Mohave area, years ago when I used to play at a coffee house there. I have had dreams of musical success.

I finally read it for a reading group, though in resonance with the story we never met because a key member had a death in the family.Once I got used to the second person voice (first paragraph: “You wake up with the answer to the questions that everyone asks. The answer to the question is Yes, and the answer is Just Like Here But Worse. That’s all the insight you’ll ever get. So you might as well go back to sleep.” Maali Almeida woke up dead. He was a “Photographer. Gambler.

I admit I knew exactly nothing about Sri Lanka when I started the book. I finally admitted that I needed to look stuff up. Where is Colombo anyway? Let me tell you it was not a good place to live in the late 1980s.Maali is a complex character you want to love but you sometimes hate. Sri Lanka has been violated in numerous ways since the first European traders landed on its shores. The usual suspects that now loom in almost every country on Earth are corrupted grasping rich guys who have no interest in human rights.

It was my least favorite and I got quite aggravated trying to get though itWith this novel I finished reading the list of top 10 bestsellers of 1966. It was my least favorite and I got quite aggravated trying to get though it. It is a Christian story with a twist. It is melodramatic, wordy, repetitive but at least not fully predictable.Set in the early 1960s in Chicago and then a southern California beach town, it follows a married couple through all their difficulties. The husband left a successful job in finance after having a vision of Christ shown to him on a dark night of soul-searching. He went into training to be a Protestant minister and became a pastor at the beach town church. He wanted to bring the message of Jesus into reality in the 20th century by making the members of his congregation perform acts of faith in the town. His wife was part of the wealthy set in Chicago but also an atheist and strongly resisted following him as a minister’s wife. Thus, a huge challenge to the marriage though they loved each other with passion. The top elder of the church was a wealthy real estate guy who wanted to build a new church in the suburbs while the minister wanted to stay in the town and perform miracles.It was all too much of a “can this marriage be saved” plus religious belief and Bible passages plus the rich vs the poor kind of story for me. I was raised in a deeply religious family who spent so much time at church. I stopped going to church during my junior year in college. I believe in working for peace and social justice and just plain kindness but not exactly God or even a Supreme Being. I confess I have never read The Bible all the way through, but I am doing so now. Stay tuned! I also believe in respecting the religious beliefs of others. While reading the bestsellers of 26 years so far, from 1940 to 1966, I have noticed that there are usually one or two Christian themed books on the list. Tell No Man took the #7 spot for 1966.As promised in an earlier , here is the 1966 list of bestsellers.

From Mexico to the Texas hill country where she grew up to various cities, she is concerned with human interaction and its effect on children. One of her recurring characters is clearly based on herself.Ms Porter published only one novel: Ship of Fools, in 1962 was the #1 bestseller that year.

Because from time to time I read other writers’ memoirs to help get me out of the writer’s block I often fall into in my own. You have heard of reluctant readers? I am a reluctant writer.

If it was shown on TV later, it would have been the kind of thing approved by our parents. In any case, the book uses the lyrics from the Scottish folksong based on the folktale, the illustrations are pen and ink with washes of color, and the folksong is included at the end with the musical notation.

Then his older stuff began to get accepted by publishers. Jack wrote Visions of Gerard in 1956 but it was not published until 1963.Reading Kerouac, for me, is always like going through a portal to another world. His style is so intense, so unique to him, and his world is full of memories, struggles and dream states. I have come to see that all of his fiction is autobiographical. I have read enough of his books now to recognize his particular brand of stream-of-consciousness and to feel comfortable with it.Gerard was his older brother, who died at nine years old when Jack was only four. It was a defining death for Jack who adored his brother. In looking back, he perceives Gerard as an almost supernatural being. I once read A Death in the Family by James Agee. Unbelievably it was published one year after Kerouac wrote Visions of Gerard. In both books, a man looks back at himself experiencing the death and funeral of a loved one from a child’s point of view. As Jack observed the rituals of death among the adults, he made what he could of it. His writing is therefore somewhat unreliable as far as memories go but I found Visions of Gerard a testament to memory, love, and shattered innocence. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 03, 2024","Mar 05, 2024","Mar 03, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12521.Visions_of_Gerard

Each reread has brought a deeper understanding of her meanings and of the complexity of life and love. I first read Love in 2004, the year after it was published. I have lived through a lot of permutations of love in the last twenty years. As we all know, rereading unveils different aspects of books and life because we are both the same and changed as the decades go by.My reading log from 2004 tells me I loved Love. I got that two women who were close friends as children were forced apart by certain adults which caused their love for each other to become hate. In a fashion which has become normal today but was less so two decades ago, the story jumps about between the present and the past as it gradually reveals the events that drove these females apart and then brought them back together. I said in my remarks that it was probably her way of telling the story that brought Ms Morrison so many lousy s. As I age, I find that my understanding of my life and my past changes regularly as I write about it and as I read/learn more and more about life and the world. Some days I don’t know if I am getting more clarity or more confusion. Life is messy. Kids have virtually no knowledge about why the adults around them do what they do and very much less control over events. The novel makes that clear and shows the tragedy of it all. It is a theme in Morrison’s writing. She combines the racism, the dubious effects of integration on Black lives, economic changes, political disputes, to present a scene that is rich in complexity.Bill Cosey was a successful and wealthy owner of a famous hotel and resort for the colored people of the East Coast, with the best food, the best music, the best accommodations. He was also crazy for women of all types and slightly crooked with money. When he dies, the two women of this story are left to fight over a large inheritance.Having written this much, I am suddenly struck by how much these conflicts sound like white people conflicts. Is that partly what Toni Morrison is getting at? It could be. Human beings, no matter the color of their skin or their places in society, are all caught in the complications of life. If we could truly understand this, we might have a different world.In any case, we love at our own risk.

Nell and Fay are high school students at a Quaker private school in New YThis is an amazing novel but while I was reading it, I barely understood it. Nell and Fay are high school students at a Quaker private school in New York City. They are such close friends that they feel like one person. In fact, they call themselves “we the F&N unit.”It is 2002 and the 9/11 attacks were just a year ago. Each student was present as that went down. Each student and many of the teachers were traumatized. But Fay and Nell are both more obsessed with lesbians and gays (though for different reasons) than they are with terrorism. They are also theater kids. Enough emoting going on in their school to blow the place up!The story follows their adventures and misadventures through to two decades later, when they are estranged but still obsessed with each other in their memories. The subject of the novel is sexual identity, preference, and confusion. When I was a kid, I mostly wished I was a boy, because boys seemed to have so much more freedom than girls. Well, not seemed to, they did! I had a best friend in high school. We were not quite as close to being one person as Nell and Fay, but we shared almost everything. I have lost track of her and no amount of internet searching has led me back to her. As soon as I got a steady boyfriend our friendship began to fade and when we went to different colleges it finally disappeared. Also, I am pretty sure we were both straight, sexually.That was in the mid-1960s. I never knew a gay person until the early 1970s. Feminism was just becoming a thing and tolerance of differences was embraced. It all felt pretty natural. But we were adults by then. I had not realized that being gay or lesbian or bisexual was still so torturous for teens in 2000, but according to the novel it was.I finished the book feeling quite confused myself. I had had trouble keeping all the characters straight (no pun intended) and I also felt quite unsettled. I listened to the author’s interview on Otherppl. That helped a bit. This morning I reread the first and last chapters and finally it all fell into place. I even remembered the characters clearly.Presently in our society these issues are hotly asserted and attacked. Books are banned. Even politics has gotten involved. Yet it feels like a certain amount of clarity is emerging. I have friends and relatives now who are observing their teen grandchildren navigating sexual identity, preference, and confusion. But the difference is these teens are not hiding it from their parents or grandparents. In fact, it seems they are dealing with it pretty well.

What a surprise to find myself reading the 1966 version of Trust, Hernan Diaz’s co-winning Pulitzer Prize of 2023! Both deal with players in the banking/stock market world of New York City in the 20th century. The Embezzler was a good read, in fact a much better read than any of the earlier bestsellers by Auchincloss which I have read. Guy Prime came of age in the 1930s, the time period of the main character in Trust. It is just after the 1929 stock market crash but Guy’s extended family did not lose that much of their wealth because that kind of wealth can be a cushion against disaster, just as it is to this day among financial giants. But Guy is from the slightly less wealthy and successful branch of a banking family. The novel tells the story of how he became an embezzler and how it affected his life and his marriage and his offspring. Another parallel to Trust was the telling of the story from three different viewpoints. I wonder if Hernan Diaz read The Embezzler as part of his research.Banking, investing, stock markets, extreme wealth accrued from rapacious business practices, have all been around for a long, long time. It is not a morally correct sort of thing, but it has brought incredible wealth to a small proportion of the world’s population while failing to change a thing for the levels of poverty among mankind. However, the so-called middle class has seen benefits despite the losses incurred during crashes, embezzling, and Ponzi schemes, etc. Most American families that have achieved some portion of the American Dream, have investments, including my own and my partner’s families. I have never been good at making money, for various reasons which I will not go into here, but my partner has been, and we live in relative financial security. I have conflicted feelings about that which I assuage somewhat by the way I choose to live. I also enjoy reading about this whole segment of life in fiction. In fact, I found a list of novels about Wall Street/the stock market etc, right here on Goodreads: a list of 126 such novels. I have only read 6 of those but many other novels over the past 100 years or so include the subject. My preference would be a more equitable society and I do also read about such attempts. Utopia is another long dream some of us have had. The financial practices of Earth have led us to the crises we face now regarding climate disaster, immigration cruelties, racial tension, crime and imprisonment rates, etc, etc. In one of his interviews, Hernan Diaz spoke of endeavoring to “change the narrative” in Trust. I like reading about the topic in novels because they tend to expose the disgusting details beneath the wealth in a way that informs me more than the news of the day does.A List of Wall Street/stock market fiction I have read:Bonfire of the Vanities, Tom WolfeThe Coffee Trader, David LissTrust, Hernan DiazThe Sot Weed Factor, John BarthLake Success, Gary ShteyngartFree Food For Millionaires, Min Jin Lee...more",Notes are private!,2,3,1,"Jan 29, 2024","Jan 31, 2024","Jan 29, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1790930.The_Embezzler

The theme was abuse of gifted women: a healer viewed as a witch, a seeker after knowledge viewed as a marriage partner to a man who could inherit her family’s wealth, and a modern woman carrying guilt to the point of doubting her self-worth. Though such stories are not new and though women finding their strengths and worth by overcoming oppression and abuse litter the world of fiction, something quite special began to emerge in Weyward.

Some readers had issues with his style but I found it worked perfectly for me.As the mother of a family of four deals with the breakdown of everything she has known, my heart went out to her. She is filled with fear but battles on trying to believe that she will somehow see her husband again, that she can protect her father and her kids. Even when it becomes clear that she might not be able to accomplish any of this she keeps going. Her name is Eilish, she is a resident of Dublin, she is smart and brave and never breaks. I thought it was excellent that the author made his main character a woman!Ultimately this book scared the heck out of me. ...more",Notes are private!,4,12,1,"Jan 25, 2024","Jan 27, 2024","Jan 25, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/158875813-prophet-song

The Narrows is the Negro section of MonmoI enjoyed this third and last novel by Ann Petry as much as I did her earlier two novels, perhaps even more. The Narrows is the Negro section of Monmouth, a small New England town. It lies right on the river. Link Williams, the adopted son of a genteel Black widow, happens to meet Camilo Treadway Sheffield one night down by the docks. It is dark. As Link saves Camilo from a man who is pursuing her, he and she have no idea that Link is Black and Camilo is White.Link is a college educated young man while Camilo is the daughter of a wealthy family. They fall in love, but the reader knows that they are most likely doomed. Meanwhile much is going on among the Blacks in Monmouth and tensions are also building in Camilo’s family. Ann Petry shows an increased skill as she whirls around and around through the viewpoints of her characters, revealing their back stories and their aspirations. The story mesmerized me as well as left me feeling unsettled. Each of the many main characters is fully drawn but so is the inevitable tension that underlies all relations between Black and White people in America, whether it is the 1950s or 2024. The tortured emotions of these people was just short of unbearable because that is the way it is.I found many parallels between Ms Petry and James Baldwin in terms of the deep intelligence behind their portrayals of racism in America. Unfortunately, Ann Petry declined to publish any more novels due to the invasions of her privacy after the great success she had as an author. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jan 19, 2024","Jan 25, 2024","Jan 19, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60838171-the-narrows

If the cover does not make you want to pick it up, I feel sorry for you. But the entire book is a work of art filled with illustrations by the author’s sister Cori, painted in gouache and watercolor, combining the yokai (Japanese ghosts, demons, monsters, shapeshifters, tricksters, and other kinds of supernatural beings and mysterious phenomena) with contemporary Japanese anime. That last paragraph is my attempt to prepare you for entrance into the state of foreign and confusing reality I found myself in when I started reading. Apparently, I am drawn to such states as evidenced by the number of books I read that induce them. However, this is what the author calls a speculative memoir and is very much a Japanese/American tale. Best of all, it works.Jami Nakamura Lin suffered from bi-polar disorder but no one, including her doctor father, knew what was the trouble. He thought it might be depression. In fact, he proscribed anti-depressants for her in her troubled teens, but those medications did nothing for the periods of extreme rage which preceded the depression. It is to her parents’ credit that she was in no way punished or berated but always had their care and concern.To calm herself or cheer herself up she began to study Japanese folklore. Eventually that became her main educational route and rewarded her with fellowships and entrance into writer’s conferences. When she was finally properly diagnosed and proscribed the proper medications and counselling, she met and fell in love with a Jewish man who became her husband and helpmeet. I was delighted to find that the deeply Christian Jami and her Jewish husband lived in perfect harmony, had a daughter, and found healthy ways to deal with her bipolar episodes.In writing the memoir, Jami chose a mix of incident, folklore, emotion and even a bit of lightheartedness that began to grow on me and work on me. I thank her for ridding me of fixed ideas I had about mental illness. I have always been fearful of people with this affliction and was raised to think people should just get over it and pull their weight.

The first time the band broke up, Geoff was adrift and fell into heroin. He never shot up, he just inhaled. He was already dependent on opioids. But it was a lot and when he got to the point of spending $300 a day, about to lose his girlfriend and maybe everything else, a “friend” gave him a flier for Crossroads Mexico Ibogaine Clinic, an experimental drug treatment program. Reader, after things get much worse, he goes!As I learned during his interview on Otherppl, this is not a memoir. It is a novel created out of his experiences with music, drugs, and recovery. It took him years to write, years after he went straight and recovered and even got the band back together. The writing is good in the ways of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and other writers about the offbeat life. He details the trip on Ibogaine, the trip on DMT, and the entire trip of getting to, being in, and returning from the Ibogaine clinic.In fact, the writing is hallucinogenic throughout. In my misspent but influential youth I took almost all the drugs except heroin. I recognized the truth of Geoff Rickly’s trips, though mine were not quite that horrifying. Such drugs do change one’s understanding of oneself and life. As edifying as this story is in terms of addiction and recovery, what struck me the most is that a deep involvement in art of any kind, in creating or playing music, brings about an ecstasy. After such ecstasy one will do almost anything to get back to that state. Some become addicted to drugs and it is all downhill from there.

Boring!Ever since college I have wanted to learn history but was foiled by the history books assigned in school and by the teaching in the classroom. Boring! Dates, rulers and wars. Where were the people?Sometime near the end of the 20th century I became aware of Will Durant. I read his Story of Philosophy and revived another path of inquiry. I had dropped a philosophy course in college, lest I fail, because I could not make head nor tail of the assignments. Then, at a going out of business sale at a used bookstore I found the entire eleven books of his Story of Civilization series and got the whole set for $40!The Reformation is the sixth book in the series. I have been reading them in order since 2002. My process is to read 5 pages a day. Is the reading dry? Sometimes. Do I need maps? Absolutely: the ones on the end pages, a globe and the internet. The wonder of his method is that he intertwines the politics, the rulers, the wars, the science, the art, the philosophies and the social milieu from rich to poor. I found The Reformation especially relevant to my life since I was raised in the Lutheran church. Luther, I learned, was quite a complex person, not particularly admirable, a dedicated antisemite and so patriarchal. But he did break the spell of the hold the Roman Catholic Church had over Western Europe. I had not realized how much the Renaissance overlapped the Reformation. Not to mention the whole Henry VIII influence.It took me a year and some months to get through The Reformation. I am taking a short break. Next up is The Age of Reason. The next five books, if I do manage to get through them, will take me through the Age of Napoleon.I am amazed how much reading these books has deepened my understanding of historical fiction, a genre I have mostly relied on to learn history.

The writing is lovely, the setting is exotic, the characters so well-drawn. It packs a lot of story, with the special guest being none other than W Somerset Maugham!It was not known to me before, nor was it widely known in his lifetime, that Maugham was gay. The times when he lived made it actually dangerous for a man in the public eye to come out. In fact, the usual practice was for the man to marry, produce a child or two, and keep his sexuality a secret. The author explicates all this well and carries it over into the plot of the book.Then there are the insights into Maugham’s practices as a writer: how he found his topics, how he rearranged truth into his stories, and how dedicated he was to his writing. Set in Malaysia in the early 1920s, the complex interactions between the British who lived there and the various other cultures mingling among them were shown in numerous vignettes. Chinese history, politics, rebellion added another strong flavor to the story. Then there is the intermingling of a court case involving attempted rape, murder and conviction of a woman.All of this was as elegantly arranged as Maugham himself might have done.Excellent read!...more",Notes are private!,4,13,1,Jan 2024,"Jan 06, 2024","Jan 01, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65215270-the-house-of-doors

She is in love with a dashing horseman but lost her virginity to another local guy during the celebration of her sister’s wedding. Nefer is caught in a web of family and the Catholic Church. This novella, originally published in Spanish in 1958, captures the loneliness and fear of Nefer as her pregnancy becomes obvious, as her mother and Godmother grapple with what to do. It is a story as old as the hills, but as urgent as the present. The first missed period, the indecision, the secretive needs of a 16 year old young woman, the inability of anyone to talk straight sense, and the sorrow of a thwarted love.

Most often this amazing author is mocked for her productivity, as if she could not possibly write so many books and have them all be worthy. I am a dedicated fan because in her long career she has consistently plumbed the depths of American life both historically and psychologically. She lives to write!Solstice is short compared to many of her novels but it still managed to pierce my heart and soul. Monica Jensen is recently divorced and now has a job teaching at a private high school for boys. She meets Sheila Trask, an eccentric artist who lives in the small Pennsylvania town. They become fast and tortured friends.Monica lacks personality and Sheila has too much. Monica is about as normal as a woman could be in the 1980s and Sheila is about as weird as a woman could be in the 1980s. In the cloistered worlds of private schools and art, they are not examples of that decade as it is usually portrayed in movies and fiction. They each have personal anguish though. Monica’s failed marriage left her feeling insecure. Sheila’s deceased husband was a world- famous sculptor in whose shadow she lived. Now her dominating personality and restless needs have made her an infamous character in the town.The psychology of the story is its strongest attribute: shades of P K Dick, Shirley Jackson and even Stephen King. The horror of what these two women get up to made me queasy at times but Joyce Carol Oates’s books are never for the faint of heart. Some readers and critics might say the novel is over the top. Others might say it is under the bottom. I say it is brilliant....more",Notes are private!,4,10,1,"Dec 16, 2023","Dec 18, 2023","Dec 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/303580.Solstice

It is a wild stoI was going away for Thanksgiving and didn’t want to bring a physical book, so I chose this book from my eBook libraries on the iPad. It is a wild story, and a mystery. It is also a recounting of his past lives, via letters to taxi driver Wang Jun in 21st century Beijing. The letters appear in Wang’s taxi, but the writer of the letters is unknown to both Wang and the reader.In alternating sections, we learn the backstory of Wang’s current life, which has been mostly terrible, and the stories of the many incarnations of Wang. Those lives of his began during the Tang Dynasty of 632 AD and proceed through four succeeding dynasties: 1213, 1542, and 1836. The last letter tells of his life during the People’s Republic of China, 1966.Meanwhile, in his current life Wang’s marriage falls apart, he loses contact with his daughter, and he fights against a romantic attraction to Zeng, a man he has known since their teens. Finally, the mystery is solved as the letter writer, also known as The Watcher, reveals her identity. I had not figured that out and it was as much a surprise to me as it was to Wang.The novel is partly a history lesson about China. That history is violent, human rights do not exist, and some of the incidents are gruesome to read about. According to an interview with Susan Barker, her research was massive. She was living in Beijing while writing the story, with an eye to present day conditions there. She also says that she is not sure she believes in reincarnation but used the concept as a narrative device, and to show the cyclical nature of history. In this way she grapples with the idea that “we are the sum of our experiences” whether in our present lives or as an explanation from past lives.I admired the novel and felt I learned, again, the lesson that mankind continues to repeat the mistakes of history without much benefit from knowing it. Still, I think it is important to know the past so as to feel at least a bit of causation when it comes to creating the future.

When books are challenging, when life events keep me busy, I don’t make that target and feel disgruntled. At such times I turn to the mystery/crime/thriller genre and pick up books by my favorite authors of that genre. Laura Lippman is one of those I have lately added to my lists and In Big Trouble, the 4th in her Tess Monaghan series, did it for me. It may speak negatively about me and my life, but getting away from it all in these books is better than any other pleasure I can think of.Tess is usually found in her hometown of Baltimore, MD. In Big Trouble takes her to Texas, from where a former boyfriend has let her know he is in big trouble. She arrives in Austin, then trails him to San Antonio. Naturally for Tess, she finds herself adrift and confused but determined to find Crow and get him out of trouble. If she can.I appreciate an author who does most of the heavy lifting for me in terms of style. I suppose it is fitting in a mystery because so much is unknown for both the reader and the PI for most of the book. Lippman’s sharp humor, snarky references to all things that deserve snark, and the breezy way she drops in cultural references, keep me tearing along in the story even when I know less about what’s happening than Tess does. How does the author do that? Another big plus is Tess herself: the dogged way she refuses to give up, the chances she takes, and her ability to bounce back from mistaken suppositions about the crime she is solving. Though Tess is much braver than I have ever been or will be, she also has her insecurities underneath her rebellious nature. One warning I would give about In Big Trouble is that it begins with a Prologue that had my head spinning right away. Though it certainly set the scene as it takes place in The Alamo. OK, I was placed in Texas and I felt lucky to get out at the end, when I finally understood the Prologue.Now I can happily go back to literary fiction, feeling refreshed!...more",Notes are private!,2,7,1,"Dec 13, 2023","Dec 14, 2023","Dec 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/351650.In_Big_Trouble

They form an attachment to Miss Koshi that lasts for two decades.(I have met several former teachers in my reading groups, so I know that this is a thing.

Also, I must say that the Presidential biographies I have read from the 20th century years are almost as lurid in some ways.The Adventurers, set in a fictional South American country, features Dax, the son and grandson of revolutionaries, who grows up to understand that the new leader of his country is as much of a dictator as the one he replaced. Such is the way of revolutions around the world. But this book was timely due to events in Cuba and due to the way the American government used its power and money in Central and South America to fight communism: the perceived big enemy to democracy. Robbins created a complicated hero in Dax and once I got to the half-way point, I suspected he might be doomed but I hoped he would prevail. Violence, sex, money, politics, and a few outright insane characters propelled me along for seven days and I had a good time. *My Big Fat Reading Project is my plan to read the top 10 bestsellers, the award winners and a select list of other authors from all the years that I have lived....more",Notes are private!,2,2,1,"Dec 08, 2023","Dec 10, 2023","Dec 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56649.The_Adventurers

The book has been described over and over as a survival story and it is, but it is so much more. The women in Groff’s novels are always fierce and always fighting for survival. That is appropriate because for most women, survival is the key to everything since we are still the second sex and have been seemingly forever. When a serving girl with a sad, sad history sees that the Jamestown colony of 1610 will not survive and that she could very well be eaten, she takes off into wilds with only her many skills to keep her from getting caught or from being eaten anyway. It turns out that survival is not the goal but an understanding of where any human being fits into all of life. When that understanding arrived it left me with such a sense of awe.

Since vows are often made to be broken, she went ahead and wrote one. I am glad she did because no one writes quite like Zadie, who is either revered or reviled.

Watching her come out of her constricted life and silenced thoughts into a wise woman of the world was captivating for me.I read the novel with one of my smaller reading groups and I was the only champion of it.

I always find them to be beautifully written and full of the idea that trauma in childhood can be understood and somewhat overcome in adulthood. What surprised me in The Wren, the Wren was how well she relayed the realities of life for 21st century young women, while still fleshing out the Irish ways of families.Another aspect of her books I always enjoy is the intimacy of family life she uses to show societal malfunction as it plays out in her characters. In this novel she covers three generations of women, the wife of a fictional famous Irish poet, the daughter and the granddaughter. At first the granddaughter, Nell, seems to be the main character and the one with the trauma. As it turns out, Carmel, the daughter, has enough trauma in her past to win the woman with the most trauma award. But when Carmel takes over the narrative, it becomes apparent that the chain of trauma began with the wife of the poet. As the poet would say about his failed marriage: “his wife got sick and the marriage did not survive.” In point of fact, he left his wife while she was sick. And the daughter Carmel was forever after working around that fact.There is abuse of many forms in the story. Some readers have found it excessive and even I found it disturbing. But, as always, in her beautiful sentences, even in the poems of the grandfather which must have been written by Anne herself, the story of how trauma is passed on and how a bright young woman named Nell works her way out of and through it becomes a beautiful thing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,2,"Nov 10, 2023not set","Nov 12, 2023not set","Nov 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/77265006-the-wren-the-wren

As with all the rereads I am doing, this was rewarding and gave me a deeper understanding. I have concluded that when I first read these novels I was lacking in my knowledge of Black lives and my ability to assimilate literary fiction. Toni Morrison won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1993, the first Black woman to win. Paradise was the novel she published after winning the prize. It made the top ten on the bestseller list that year. The last sentence I wrote in my reading log after finishing the book this time: “She goes everywhere, manipulating many stories, characters and issues like a top orchestra conductor and composer.” Yes, that is what she did!I was quite confused on my first reading of this novel. This time I paid more attention and found an immensely helpful character list on Wikipedia. Ruby is an all-black town in Oklahoma, founded by the sons of a man who had created an earlier all-black town called Haven. The history of these towns is revealed gradually throughout the novel. It is a history of the Reconstruction era, post-Civil War, when the emancipated slaves had a time of freedom until those freedoms were again severely restricted. It is now 1976 and the grandchildren of the original founders are questioning everything, as young people do. Turmoil reigns amid the rigid hierarchies and iron control of the town’s leaders. Then there is the Convent: another kind of haven for women who have had traumatic lives and are being protected by Connie, an adoptee of its former Mother Superior. The four young women whom Connie has accepted there are wild, broken, sometimes hysterical and fall into a mystical kind of coven. Of course, the male leaders of Ruby decide they must be eliminated.The novel opens with a gruesomely violent scene and concludes with the outcome of that violence. All the rest is revealed throughout the story. It is not a hopeful tale because even today, despite some more progress having been made concerning racism in America, Black lives are still at risk every day. As James Baldwin made clear, racism produces a kind of madness in both the discriminated against and the discriminator. This kind of oppression can be found around the world in every land where humans have perpetrated conquest, colonialism, and genocide. Is it beneficial to confront, to study, to understand this madness? I suppose that depends on who you ask, who can find hope in an increased understanding of the human condition. I am not sure that even Toni Morrison found hope, but she certainly did add to the exposition of our human condition. She also paved the way for many Black voices in American literature to come into print. Apparently, she had strong religious beliefs and I hope that means she is now a saint....more",Notes are private!,6,11,1,"Nov 08, 2023","Nov 10, 2023","Nov 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5198.Paradise

Astonishingly, he is as good as he gets in even this second one.Fred Bogus Trumper, whose friends call him Bogus, has been a graduate student at Iowa for longer than he should be. He has a wife, a son, and a girlfriend. He also has a birth defect in his urinary tract. So there you have pretty much all the Irving ingredients: family, marriage, friends and medical issues. Bogus is as weird as Owen Meany, as anxious as Garp. He bumbles though daily life with less than optimum results but as a reader I never thought of giving up on him.Another aspect of John Irving’s novels that pleases me is the way his main characters manage by the end of each tale, to turn their weaknesses into a livable life. I like that idea because usually we are taught that we must overcome our weaknesses if we want to be happy, rich, successful, etc. Fred Bogus Trumper just keeps on with his life, his aspirations, and his talents and comes out fine, though neither he nor the reader nor his wife nor his girlfriend thought he ever could....more",Notes are private!,2,3,1,"Nov 02, 2023","Nov 08, 2023","Nov 02, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4657.The_Water_Method_Man

It was only translated into English in 2021, though it was first published in 1943. The publishing history is quite a tale. Duras wrote the book in 1941 and submitted it to Gallimard, the major French publishing house both then and now. They declined the manuscript though Raymond Queneau was a reader there and found it good. He later became a great friend of Marguerite. Finally another house, Plon, published the novel in 1943. Marguerite was strongly influenced by Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, also by George Sand and Zola, 19th century writers. She wrote the book in that style thinking it was what was required for a literary novel. The rest of her novels have more of her unique voice but The Impudent Ones was, like most of her novels, taken from the experiences of her life: the unsettled existence in Indochina, her domineering mother, her brothers both bad and beloved, and her search for her own personality amid all of that.For many years the author disclaimed this first book but near the end of her life she agreed to allow Gallimard to republish it in French in 1992.I have now read 10 of Duras’s novels and have come to love her writing. At first I read them all out of order and now am filling in the ones I missed. Her themes of troubled family life, an almost crazy mother, a cruel and dissolute brother, and the awakening of her female characters as they come of age, are all evident in this first novel. Her sensitive and vibrant descriptions of the natural world are enough to put the reader right in the story’s location in a French village. The inner turmoil of her main character feels so real that I seemed to going through it with her.				I found The Impudent Ones to be as wonderful as all the others I have read. Though she hued so closely to those earlier writers, her unique qualities as a novelist come through entirely....more",Notes are private!,3,3,1,"Oct 25, 2023","Nov 02, 2023","Oct 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55948365-the-impudent-ones

One, it is a novella/long short story so I read it in no time. Two, a woman is looking back on her youth when she lived in Paris with several friends. They were all desperately poor and it was always cold. Now the woman is reaching out to one of those friends in letters and pondering the choices she made later. In the paperback edition I read, both the English and Spanish versions are combined. If you read from the front it is English. If you flip the book over and read from the back it is in Spanish. I, of course read the English. The author is living in Chicago, trying to renovate her apartment. She digs out letters from Martita and falls into remembering the Paris adventure. It is so bittersweet, trying to reconnect with an earlier self and earlier friends. Who was that young woman so full of hope for an adventurous life? Who is this grown woman with a husband who is almost OK, with children and unfulfilled dreams? The difficulties of reigniting a connection with friends from another long-gone part of one’s life was so real to me.The writing is fragmentary but evocative of that portion of life, of dreams, of stubbornness, of willing to go through almost anything to achieve a goal, of first sexual encounters (not love), and finally of the sweet confusion when facing what she has now.

In 1952, Jack Kerouac traveled to Mexico City and lived with William S Burroughs, one of his buddies. Over a number of days, possibly the same number of days it took me to read it, he wrote feverishly until Dr Sax was done. After Kerouac published his first novel in 1950, The Town and the City, which got positive s, he felt a need to break out of the narrative style of 1950s literary fiction. He wrote several books that he was not able to get published until after the wild success of On the Road in 1957. Thus, Dr Sax was not published until 1959.In a paradox that perhaps defined the man, the books he had poured his new freer style into were suddenly seeing publication, but the public attention drove him deeper into an elusive search for spiritual understanding and finally into depression and despair.In any case, Dr Sax tells the underside of his childhood only somewhat covered in The Town and the City. As I read as much as I could absorb each day, I became accustomed to his voice and style to the point that I fell under his spell. Just about everything I have read by Kerouac so far has had that effect on me.He is remembering his childhood from that child’s point of view with all the influences of his family, the Catholic Church, his friends, his reading, his dreams and nightmares. He had imaginary heroes of which Dr Sax was the most mythical. Scenes of baseball games, wild romps through the town where he grew up in New Hampshire, a major flood on the Merrimac River that ran through Lowell, and most of all encounters with Dr Sax, fill the pages in Kerouac’s unique style. That style is a cousin to stream of consciousness with the rhythms of jazz, almost like a scat at times. Was this all a dream of Jack’s? Was it a battle of good versus evil? In the end Dr Sax says “The Universe disposes of its own.” For Jack, the book was a step to finding his own voice. Having read the Tao Te Ching numerous times, I felt this book was an American version in some mysterious way. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 08, 2023","Oct 11, 2023","Oct 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/311712.Dr_Sax

I read them because I have always enjoyed reading science fiction. I read them because despite all the claims that he was weird, perhaps mentally ill, he is revered by many writers I admire, particularly Jonathan Lethem. Martian Time-Slip takes place on Mars but is not much like Ray Bradbury’s. I have not read many other books set on Mars though I will be doing so. I don’t have a clear view of why Mars is so attractive to sci fi writers but I plan to find out. PKD uses the planet as a setting to explore quite a few topics such as colonization, politics, capitalism, mental health, indigenous peoples, and marriage. Except for religion, he put most of his obsessions into Martian Time-Slip.I also found a big leap in the quality of his writing. Some of his earlier books were just too much like slapstick for me though still entertaining. The Man in the High Castle was his first effort to enter the fray of mainstream fiction. He could not find a mainstream publisher for that one, but it did win a Hugo in 1963. When Martian Time-Slip was finally published by Ballantine, he was still in the sci fi ghetto, as he put it.But his Mars, with its severe lack of water and sandy surface, with Jack Bohlen who is a former schizophrenic, with the autistic kid Manfred and Dr Glaub the psychiatrist, with Arnie Kott the head of the water workers union, has many of the elements of life on Earth including a money making scam to build a major apartment complex in the Martian mountains. That scam, by the way involves using the autistic kid to tell them the future. Then the Indigenous Bleekmen get involved and the tale veers into almost horror, as they and Manfred produce visions of destruction and chaos.

I fell in love with Rosacoke's voice. In fact, in my reading journal I wrote that Reynolds Price writes the way my sister and I talk.A Generous Man features Rosacoke's brother Milo and Rato. It also includes a mad dog, a python and Milo's first love, Lois.In a tale as convoluted as the lineages of cousins in the Mustian family, Milo undergoes his first sexual experiences, the mystery of an inheritance is finally worked out, and so much goes on over a few days that I felt my head fairly spinning.The wonder to me was how this middle-class, Oxford educated author could have created the characters and travails of the Mustian family. So I read his Preface to the collection in which he fully answered my question.Now I wonder if in the mid-20th century South, despite the well-defined class system and the systemic racism, there was a way of life in which all these differences mingled side by side. So different from the world today where socio-economic levels, race, nationality, religious views are so compartmented. Not that there were not terrible conflicts then, but somehow a man like Reynolds Price could interact with the brothers of another family in a hospital, as they all stood watch over dying parents, to the degree that those brothers remained in his imagination until he wrote them into his own stories....more",Notes are private!,1,8,1,"Sep 03, 2023","Sep 07, 2023","Sep 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6089473-a-generous-man

However, A Trip to the Stars was a mixed experience for me. It took me over a week to read its 500 pages. For some reason (small print, about a million characters, a strange tone to the writing?) I could rarely get through more than 30 pages a day though I would read for a couple hours. I finally came to the end after a long, circuitous adventure that almost rewarded the time spent.In the opening chapter, a 10-year-old adopted orphan is kidnapped from a planetarium in 1965. As he grows up in an exclusive and unusual hotel outside Las Vegas, owned by an uncle who orchestrated the kidnapping, Loren gets a new name, an amazing education and finally learns the complicated story of his identity. The tale was reminiscent for me of The Shadow of the Wind, The Count of Monte Cristo, Winter's Tale, Cloud Cuckoo Land. It should have entranced me as much as those epics did but the writing never quite lives up to that of those other authors. It does live up to its title as the final scene involves a space ship launch that will carry one of the main characters beyond the dark side of the moon.As I read about the many characters losing and finding each other again, I sometimes lost and found them again myself while I struggled to recall who some of them were. Not one had an easy or even remotely normal life, leaving me hopelessly entangled in their passions, enmities, achievements and failures.

She was mostly well-known as a literary critic and short story writer in the mid to late 20th century. She was a co-founder of The New York Review of Books in 1962. But she also wrote a few novels.

Marion grew up in her grandmother's home with her brother. Her parents were largely absent, running around living some kind of nomadic existence, as her father could not seem to find success anywhere.Everyone in the story is off-balance or weird in different ways which Hardwick uses to create tension, similar to characters in Faulkner, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor and Thomas Wolfe.

Not untrue, as those states did secede from the nation and caused our only civil war, so far.Marian Coleman is a fascinating character, one of those that get into my heart and psyche, because she is seeking independence but also love.

Helena’s poems are composed of compelling emotions, trauma and intensity. She was conceived in postwar Warsaw, Poland by Jewish parents. Still in her mother’s womb she participated in a harrowing escape to Berlin, Germany and as a young child she was brought by her parents to America. Her father’s strongest command was that she NEVER return to Poland.However, after her parents’ deaths she decided to go. She wanted to find the land of her people and she wanted to find out if it were possible for some reconciliation in Poland between Christians and Jews. Our Dark and Radiant Land is the result of that quest. The poems are interspersed with personal essays. Even in prose she is poetic! The effect of this collection on me was enormous. Though I have been a regular reader of poetry since meeting Helena, only some of the poems I have read have had such an effect on me. I have always had Jewish friends, ever since childhood.

Dictionary definition: a person having a strong interest in or concern for human welfare, values, and dignity. Also, according to the American Humanist Association, humanists ""stand for the building of a more humane, just, compassionate, and democratic society using pragmatic ethics based on human reason, experience and reliable knowledge-an ethics that judges the consequences of human actions by the well-being of all life on Earth.""This all sounds pretty woke to me. The ideas though first came about during the Renaissance in 13th and 14th century Italy, based on far earlier ideas.[I wrote all this here so I could have it in one place where I could refer to it again. It pretty much defines my belief system.]More Than Human centers around various main characters who have certain gifts: Lone, Janie, Baby, Gerry and a set of twins who can teleport. Naturally not one of them fit well in society but once they find each other they join into an almost single cooperative organism that may create a further step in human evolution.

Some call it the first modern psychological thriller. I liked it a great deal more than his other famous novel, The Magus. For a debut novel, as it was in 1963, it is impressive due to a unique plot structure, deeply interesting characters, and a sharp sense of the author's disagreements with British society.A young man, raise by an aunt after his father died and his mother ran off, becomes obsessed with Miranda, a beautiful art student. After winning a huge sum of money in ""the polls,"" a kind of lottery, he gives up his job as a lowly clerk, buys a huge house and abducts Miranda. To him, she is like one of the butterflies in his collection.John Fowles gives the reader full insight into both the man's and Miranda's psychological makeup.

It is 1960 and Cold War tension is high. In fact, the whole novel is filled with tension.Rita is training to be a teacher but is also working in one of the many factories that fill the city with smoke. Bernard is an intellectual and academic. The issue in East Germany is the large number of people leaving to live in West Germany for a better standard of living and more freedom from socialist pressures.I found it interesting that the East German city was not named nor did the word communism ever occur, because the defining event was the Wall, put up in August, 1961 to stop citizens from leaving. So, I just pictured it as East and West Berlin. That Wall was the cause of separations between families, friends and lovers for 30 years.The story shows how such political conflicts affected one couple in a way so harmful that Rita suffered an accident after Bernard went west to explore his options. Much of it is told through her recollections and flashbacks as she recuperates in a hospital.Because of Rita's scrambled memories and because it was hard to tell when she was in the present or the recent past, it was hard to follow the plot. Eventually it mostly became clear what had happened. As a literary device, this did show the confusion and disruption in peoples' lives at the time.

The money, the conglomerates, the businessmen and the lawyers. What he also gets very well are the moral quandaries. This man from another planet has some of his own. The longer he is on Earth, the more complex they become, until he begins to lose his way. It would all be too sad except for some delightfully and fully realized quirky supporting characters.

I did read Walk Me to the Distance, thinking it was his first book. Turned out it was his second. Then Telephone entered the picture because it was the featured book of the Alta California Book Club in May. I have been following and very much enjoying this event for many months, especially because I live in Los Angeles and all the featured authors are California residents as well.Telephone has echos of Walk Me to the Distance. The main characters in both books are Black men who suffer from a disconnect regarding other people, who are loners with a soft spot for children and who tend to get dangerously involved with righting injustices. I wonder if that is Percival Everett's general approach in his fiction. Based on the three I have read so far, it would seem so.Telephone is quite a dour story, as the MC is losing his beloved daughter to an incurable illness and that is eroding an already shaky marriage. A known issue in life, for sure. So what does this man do? He throws all caution aside and walks straight into danger. Wow, it was hard for me to look at all that but impossible to look away.I guess, in keeping with the author's WTF approach to writing and publishing, which I do admire, he put out three different versions of Telephone. It seems hard to find out which one I read. I decided I don't care. I will take the one I read, an eBook purchased from Barnes & Noble.

Somehow I have only read on Murakami novel before: Kafka on the Shore, read in 2015. I loved it and always meant to read more from this author. What happened? Well there seem to be many more books I want to read than I do read.The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a great novel, possibly one of the greatest ever published. At over 600 pages, it contains many stories. Toru Okada is an intriguing main character, seemingly passive but deeply concerned with the meaning of life, yet only mildly interested in his own. Some of my reading group members found him just too frustrating. I found him somehow familiar.The titular bird, who sounds like a spring being wound, flits through the tale like a talisman. There are numerous odd characters and several unremittingly evil ones. All of them surround Toru Okada and either help him or mess with his head, sometimes both. In America we have our own unique understanding of World War II. Now I have another understanding through the survivors of that conflict in Japan. I was struck by how different it was for the Japanese, not just because of being hit by two atomic bombs but also because of their own brand of warfare in those years and their devastating defeat. The book includes long sections set during the years of the war, though Toru's story takes place in the 1980s. I felt that Murakami was telling a morality tale about his country as well as showing how these great wars leave aftershocks through the centuries that follow. I was sorry to leave Toru. He is one version of the Japanese soul and I grew very fond of him....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 31, 2023","Jun 02, 2023","May 31, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11275.The_Wind_Up_Bird_Chronicle

I have not done as well on that this year but Every month my goal is to read at least one book from another country translated from another language. I have not done as well on that this year but I keep plugging away.Dawn is set in Turkey during the 1970s. The author had always written about women's lives in her country. She had lived as freely as possible writing novels, journalism, translating plays, working in radio and TV. She married three times. She also spent time in prison. She died in 1976 from breast cancer at age 40.Dawn was first published in Turkey in 1975. It is a novel based on the author's eight months spent in prison, charged with spreading communist propaganda and with obscenity. Then she spent a period in exile from her home city.Turkey had a ""modern"" period from 1923 to 1971. Women could vote and run for office, sharia law was ended, and it felt like equality. 1971 marked the end of such freedoms when the military seized control and instituted martial law.Oya, the journalist protagonist in Dawn is serving out her exile in a small city in southern Turkey after a year in prison. She is lonely in her hotel, followed by police whenever she leaves it, and shunned. A young man befriends her and invites her to a gathering at his uncle's home. She goes with trepidation. Sure enough, the door is broken down by police and all the men at the gathering are taken to jail, as is Oya.Though the story takes place over only 24 hours, we are introduced to the characters and their personal histories, to the long-suffering women in the household with all their sorrows and discontents. During a night and day in jail we are made aware of the tensions and inconsistencies between various levels of police.This is a harrowing portrait of a society under repression. The prison and jail scenes include both torture of and solidarity among the prisoners, including the women. Though the translation is easy to read, the story is not.Freedom is such a precious condition constantly challenged around the world. Reading Dawn made me value the freedoms we have in America. At the same time it heightened my awareness of how important it is to protect those freedoms and especially to protect women....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"May 10, 2023","May 12, 2023","May 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61953651-dawn

She is a prolific Black poet, author and professor. Now I have finally read one of her books.Citizen is a book one needs to take a brief introductory tour through before beginning to read. It is a hybrid of words and pictures composed of essays written in lyrical prose: a kind of hybrid writing. Each piece is followed by photos and works of art by other Black Americans.Another quirk I had to parse is that she writes mainly in the second person, though sometimes she is talking to herself, sometimes to others, sometimes to the reader.

She makes that so clear that I began to feel a sympathetic PTSD. I could only read a short section each day and then ponder it. The impact is visceral.I came to Citizen thanks to a San Francisco based on-line magazine called Alta. It has its own book club, the California Book Club, that features books either written by California authors or set in the state.

One of our members is a friend of the author, a Los Angeles resident, and we invited her to our meeting.The first book in her Kate Matthews Mystery Series features a Santa Barbara, CA, retired lawyer. It was a great read. Kate is as worthy a character as V I Warshawski in Sara Paretsky's series or Anna Pigeon in Nevada Barr's. Smart, tough, and fearless. She is also married to the mother of the two children they have raised together.When Kate, who is innocently practicing as a masseuse, becomes a person of interest in the murder of one of her clients, she realizes she is going to have to find the actual murderer or face a prison term for a crime she did not commit.Since we all have affection for the beach town called Santa Barbara, just an hour north of LA, and have visited there often, we could picture the location exactly. Aside from the excellent plotting, Jane DiLucchio lovingly recreates life in a long term same sex relationship and includes an informative look at the inner workings of the California Coastal Commission. That group rules on new buildings, oil drilling and environmental issues on our state's coast. The murder victim was its leader.During our meeting we got to ask questions of the author about her writing process and career.

The hardcover edition is 531 pages of fairly small type. After two false starts, I spent a full week of what felt like a forced march until I finished.It is the third of his four volume Advise and Consent series. All three were top 10 bestsellers in their day. Advise and Consent came first and also won the Pulitzer Prize as well as the National Book Award. A Shade of Difference came second and brought the United Nations and the Civil Rights movement into the story. All three books focus on conflicts in 1960s society and within the federal government.I am not sorry for having taken the time to read these hefty tomes because I learned so much about the inner workings of democracy in the Executive and Legislative branches.However, in Capable of Honor, I was for the first time uncomfortable with Drury's fictionalized account of events so close to the time in which they took place. I have been pondering that for days now. I understand that fiction cannot use the actual names of Presidents, Vice Presidents, Congressmen, etc. Yet I can't help relating the story to the history.Capable of Honor is the story of a sitting President and his decision to run for another term. He took office mid the previous President's term after that one died. Sound familiar for the 1960s? LBJ became President after JFK was assassinated. The President in the novel however, is not much like the Johnson I have gotten to know through having lived through his tenure and through reading biography and history.I truly cannot figure out why that worried me so much when I did not have that problem with the earlier two books. Allen Drury spent years as a news correspondent covering mainly the Senate. In this book he takes on the subject of how much the press can influence public opinion and thus the decisions making processes in government. The major issue in the 1960s was the threat of postwar communism in the ""free world."" Drury comes across as a proponent of the use of military force to counteract that threat as opposed to the stand taken in the liberal press to use the United Nations and diplomacy to bring about harmony and prevent war. Of course, this is still a divisive issue today, fanned by the media.In the book, during the National Convention to nominate the next Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates these differing approaches come to a head, exacerbated by the views of the liberal press. That was the most exciting part of the story yet Drury never makes clear whether it is the Democratic or Republican Convention. I wonder why not?If you have read this far, I thank you for your time.

It was my suggestion.My best descriptive word for the novel is ""prickly."" Also intelligent. Also modern, dense and requiring close attention. When Bodie Kane, a film professor and True Crime podcaster, returns to the boarding school she attended to teach a short-term seminar, she is thrust back into the early half of her life. None of that life was happy for her, so many of her memories have been suppressed. These memories include the murder of her former roommate and the possibly wrong conviction of the school's athletic trainer.The brilliance of the story for me was the way it put me smack into the rat's nest of memory. There is no way through that mess for anyone except to tease at the strands of one's memory until the whole process of growing from ignorance to awareness, from denial and irresponsibility to confronting and owning, becomes available to one's thinking in the present.If that sounds hard and uncomfortable, it is. Perhaps this book is not for everyone. But if we are going to make headway in the area of how women are treated, this is the kind of stuff we need to think about.

I have grown quite fond of her though at first I read these books in no particular order. I also have a copy of a biography about her and am now reading that bit by bit, concurrently with reading her books in order of publication: a successful way for me to acquire a deep understanding of an author I admire.The Little Horses of Tarquinia was her third novel, published in 1953. Her subject is love, always viewed from a many faceted approach. She is also focused on the life of women in relation to men, children, personal freedom, as well as a search for some unnamed satisfaction.In Little Horses, Sara is on holiday with her husband Jacques and her 4 year old son. They are on the coast of some ocean, perhaps the Mediterranean but she doesn't say. The heat blazes, the accommodations are shoddy, there is little to do. Everyday they swim, sit at a restaurant with friends, drink Campari on ice.These people talk incessantly but not about much. Sara is not liking Jacques much on this holiday. Another couple, who lives there year round, argue but swear they would never leave each other. One other single female friend is known for her many affairs with men.This could all be as boring as Sara's holiday. An undercurrent of possible infidelity on the parts of both Sara and Jacques rumbles behind the scenes but you feel it will probably not happen.Still, I liked the book. I felt I could hear the endless conversations, know the heat and torpor. In America we don't go ""on holiday."" We go ""on vacation"" and we cram as much as we can into every hour. As an adult I find being on vacation a bit boring myself.The other main idea here is marriage/long term relationships and how often people tire of each other, not just sexually but as personalities. What to do? How to go on? The anticipation of an affair relieves that for a while but life does go on, people hoping and dreaming, some even striving, even finding success.In the end we are all just people but Marguerite Duras does something magical with her prose and gets into my head as though she were a friend. I wonder if she always had the same translator. I must look into that.

The ""dolls"" were the pills they took to sleep, to get energy and lose weight, to quell anxiety. Their anxieties were their working lives and income, their relationships with men and rivals, their sex live and reproductive lives. Included were abortions, face lifts and a constant search for true love.In 1966, I was in college, breaking up with my high school steady boyfriend, wanting to but avoiding ""going all the way"" with any boy due to fear of pregnancy, and searching for who I wanted to be.

I read it for a reading group and found it so moving and full of truths for women and mothers.Eight females from three generations of two families, part of a fundamentalist/cult-like Mennonite community in Bolivia, have gathered in the hayloft of a barn to determine their future. The grandmothers have discovered that both women and female children have been being drugged and molested in the night, resulting in unwanted pregnancies and physical damage. If this sounds horrific, it is. Somehow Miriam Toews transformed the outrage into a testament to women caring for each other and their children. They talk and talk, they sputter and argue. These women cannot even read but must learn their religion and the Bible from the male leader of the community. Finally they find their way to a decision, to a plan, to a possibility of freedom from abuse.Our reading group discussion was good though I didn't feel we went as deep as we could have. Of course, it is a tough subject and we were sitting around some tables pushed together in the cafe of our local Barnes & Noble Bookstore.Personally, while reading the novel I was reminded of my years as a young mother when I felt trapped at home with a nursing baby. It was 1972. Ms Magazine had just hit the newsstands and a group of my women friends began gathering at my house to discuss our various plights as females, wives, mothers or girlfriends. We were not sexually abused nor were our children but we knew we were trapped in something we did not know how to deal with.That was my beginning as a feminist and set me on a long and rocky road, filled with mistakes and triumphs. Women Talking brought back that confusing time when so many women were seeking to free our minds, our souls, our bodies, from the patriarchal nature of the world.Now I am a senior citizen and am aware that I and my friends were white, mostly of middle-class backgrounds, and compared to women of color, Indigenous women or immigrant women, had in many ways a much easier road to travel. It was still rough though.A deeper question in the book is how do women bring up sons to be good human beings who do not mistreat women? Sometimes I just get angry about that question. Why does that have to be another one of our duties? Oh well, it just is.I thank Miriam Toews from the depths of my being for her wondrous writing, her brave characters and especially for her sense of humor.Now to see the movie....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 02, 2023","Feb 05, 2023","Feb 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40046077-women-talking

We chose Midnight's Children, his second novel and winner of the Booker Prize in 1981.I had tired twice to read the book over the years and found it too confusing. This time I had a good reason to power on and get it read. The story hinges on a man who was born on the stroke of midnight, August 15, 1947 just as India finally achieved independence from Great Britain. I was born three days later in that same year and have spent my life creating my own independence, so I feel a special connection with Midnight's Children.The novel covers the next tumultuous years as the huge country struggles to become a nation in the modern world, including the Partition which created East and West Pakistan, the strife between Muslims and Hindus, and the major developments that led to modern India.It is a challenging book and impressive for a second novel. By paying attention to its form (which weaves back and forth and around like an Indian raga), by looking up maps and historical events in the country, by keeping track of the vast array of characters, I found an amazing tale of history. But make no mistake, it was not easy.My reading group members had varying reactions ranging from not finishing, to finishing but feeling put upon, to finding it fantastic. Rushdie parallels the social and political history with the individual antics and fortunes of its characters. His main character Saleem Sinai looms large as he relates his life tale.I found it a fantastic tale on many levels including the mystical beliefs of the Indian people.

The author was well loved in the 1970s and 1980s of Brazil, when a military dictatorship began to censor his writing and put him on a wanted list. His stories in Moldy Strawberries feature the alienation, indecision and insecurity experienced by gay men in those years. I was reading these stories concurrently with John Irving's latest novel, The Last Chairlift, finding plenty of parallels with those times of danger to gays, including AIDS.The prose of Caio Fernando Abrue, at least in translation, is beautifully descriptive of both the inner and outer landscapes of his characters. His somewhat stream of consciousness style drew me into these people lives, evoking their loneliness, hopelessness and suppressed longings. I felt a distinct Jorge Luis Borges influence and was also reminded of Clarice Lispector's writing. That might just be because of the cultural exigencies of South America in the 20th century.

I used to read a poem a day but often felt I had not really grasped each poem. So instead, I read one poem a week, once everyday. It was amazing how much more deeply I got into every poem's meanings, language, rhythms, etc. I did indeed fall in love with Anne Sexton, with her honesty and openness about herself. These poems demanded that I look more curiously at my self, other women in my life, in literature and in the creative arts. Anne had as many troubles as Marilyn Monroe, the creative woman I read about in the book before this one. They were of the same generation, born in the late 1920s and coming of age in the 1940s, achieving recognition in the 1950s. Both of them died young, though Anne lived for 46 years, Marilyn only 36.

She MUST be defeated! A great deal of political, sexual and racial subtext infuses these stories and I was entranced by all of it in both books.

So, after two years, I have finally finished that list. (If you want to see the books that I read published in 1965, click on the ""books-from-1965"" in the bookshelves/tags link above this .)White Lotus was an extremely challenging read for me. In fact, when I finally finished it, I could hardly read at all for a few days.John Hersey takes on slavery and racism in a speculative story. He posits that America lost a war with China and in his very long story, the Chinese (the Yellows) capture American white people and take them off to China in ships to be slaves.Then he loosely parallels the Civil Rights movement as it played out up to the mid-1960s in America. The main character, a fifteen-year-old girl from a village in Arizona, narrates the story over many years. She is named White Lotus by her first Chinese master's wife.Hersey goes deeply into her psyche, meticulously following her every thought. She is rebellious and consistently falls for strong but unreliable men. Her sufferings as a slave and then as a free white in various Chinese cities, stand in for the stages of rising out of the degradation of being a slave (all brutally described) to regaining a sense of self and developing concepts of rebellion and non-violent protest. Interestingly, it is Chinese Buddhists who are against slavery.This is a long book and the 667 pages felt like 2000 pages. Reading it was a process of pushing through unremitting barriers. I suppose Hersey did indeed create in me, the reader, the confusions and sufferings and hopelessness of the conditions of slavery. I was just a bit suspicious about his method because he was reporting on an experience he never lived through as a white American.He was a reporter first and foremost who came to recognition with his report made into a book, Hiroshima, after it was published in The New Yorker in 1946. Then he turned to fiction. I have read all seven of his previous novels and I will probably read the rest because I admire his inquisitive and imaginative writing about the human condition....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 28, 2022","Dec 29, 2022","Dec 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1495461.White_Lotus

I bought it in paperback last August while visiting my family in Michigan, at my favorite indie bookstore in Ann Arbor: Literati Bookstore. I read 99 pages that very day, immediately pulled in to Black lives that matter and the history of their struggle in America. Then I put it aside until December, when I started again from the beginning.Thanks to books like The 1619 Project, The Things She Carried, The Warmth of Other Suns, thanks to Toni Morrison, Jessmyn Ward and many others I have read over the years, it has been gradually dawning on me how complex Black history in America is. Certainly it is not black and white, though those are the apparent sides of the struggle.The wonder of The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois is the intricate braiding the author does between the past and the present, intermingling Native Americans, enslaved Africans, the mixed races as well as colonialism and capitalism, while showing the abuse of women, children and men by others (mostly men.) She evokes the strange alchemy of skin color, trauma, religion and customs that all of us must reckon with but especially the victims of greed and oppression.Ailey, the heroine of this book, wrangles her way through all of this with intelligence, determination, and a large ability to penetrate the story of her family's past. She manages to attain a PhD in History. Her journey through the thickets of her people's history stands as an example of that old 1960s song, We Shall Overcome. Her mentor is W.E.B. Du Bois who wrote many books about the race problem in America.Big words like epic, towering, consuming, scholarship and love apply to Honoree Fannone Jeffers's achievement.

Each book is set in the earlier years of the 21st century though later than our current present.In 2065, a medium size community has a strong Green Party and has maintained a sustainable lifestyle for the most part. In contrast, its surrounding towns have constantly expanded the building of structures, financial gain and exploitation of the natural world.Now the charismatic Mayor of the town wants to develop the one remaining hilltop wilderness and build a complex for his medical company. The fight over this proposal takes place in the town council as well as in the hearts and minds of the town's residents.As in the earlier two books of the trilogy, The Wild Shore and The Gold Coast, the natural world is front and foremost, existing uneasily next to scientific and economic progress. The viewpoint shifts from book to book: a post-nuclear apocalypse, a dystopia and now an attempt at utopia. Hence the collection is called Three Californias Triptych. In each, Robinson balances action/adventure and human relations with technical and environmental issues.Though this was my least favorite of the three, it grew on me as I read and as it picked up in tempo and literary excitement.

Her brother, Arif, the ""bad"" child, has no job but his white lower middle class girlfriend is pregnant.On one level this story is about sex: sexual knowledge, experience, openness and even addiction. On another level it is about class distinctions. On its deepest level it is about mothers in all their wondrous and weird permutations.I found it a brilliant mix of topics written so well that I was desperately involved with every character. Though Yasmin made me crazy, the mothers made me laugh and cry. The men? Well, you know, they are men with all their unconscious weaknesses.A great read!...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Nov 26, 2022","Nov 29, 2022","Nov 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59366233-love-marriage

Amidst what feels like an unending party of casual sex and every drug you could think of, Jim McPherson emerges from his gang of young men and their ""allies"" (means girlfriends or wives) as a thoughtful, aspiring writer who wants to uncover the history of Orange County while engaging in destructive acts to counter the Military Industrial Complex's presence.As he did in The Wild Shore, his first book and in The Ministry For the Future, his latest, the author alternates between madly paced adventure and what I call his ""teaching moments.""

Crispin: The Cross of Lead took the prize in 2003.For me it was a timely read since I am currently reading The Reformation by Will Durant. Crispin is living in England during the early years of rebellion against both a corrupt, divided Catholic Church and the feudal power of wealthy nobles.Crispin is a 13 year old in 1377. He and his mother are poor in a way that almost no one is anymore. When the story opens, he does not even have a name but is just called Asta's son. His mother, Asta, will not say anything about his father or why they are outcasts in their small village. When she is killed, he knows he is in deep danger and takes to the road.By the end of the story, which moves at a breath stopping pace, he has learned who he is, what he is, and gone from thinking he was nothing to knowing his name, his mother's history and his place in the world as a member of the Guild of Free Men.The author captures so well the hold of religion at the time as well as the tension, the brutality and the passions that inhabit people's souls.

More than half the group could not get through it. I did and I am not sorry.The author is a professor of history and mostly she writes like a historian. Yet she mixes in a good deal of speculation and has a solid theme regarding the ways that Black women, both the enslaved and their descendants in America, pass on love and resilience down through the generations.In building her case for that theme, Tiya Miles centers her book on a sack given by an enslaved mother to her daughter just before the daughter is to be sold away. In that rough cotton bag she placed a tattered dress, three handfuls of pecans and a braid of her hair.By the time I finished the book I knew quite a bit about slavery in South Carolina, about pecans, about the significance of hair and textiles and crafts. I also finally got the point the author wanted to make.I felt I had seen more into the personal lives of Black women during slavery, the terrible history of Reconstruction, the Great Migration, and the racism that accompanied it all to the present day. Thus, it was a good companion read to The 1619 Project I read earlier this year.I had some realizations: One was why Black women are sometimes so intent on dressing well and doing their hair. The other was how objects carry history, especially when the actual records are scanty, which led me to focus more on objects in my own writing.Despite my struggles during the reading, I decided it was worth having read this book, every page. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 02, 2022","Nov 03, 2022","Nov 02, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56108283-all-that-she-carried

Anyone who follows this series knows that vacations for Anna are inevitably anything but. Destroyer Angel is no exception.Her companions are Heath, a paraplegic woman; Leah, a wealthy designer of outdoor equipment (who created Heath's super amazing wheel chair) and also on the spectrum; two teenage girls; and a really cool dog.Soon enough the villains arrive, intending to kidnap Leah for ransom. Anna is in a different position in this one, always hiding in the woods and secretly following the others while sabotaging the bad guys. The dog is her only ally.So, plenty of issues as always, but the women and the girls, despite much violence against them, are Nevada Barr's answer to men hurting women.Each book is this series gets more heart-pounding than the previous ones.

I learned about it from the excellent blog about all things historical, She Reads Novels.It is a tale of the Middle Ages, set in the midst of the Hundred Years War between France and England. An unusual translation history brought the novel originally written in Dutch in 1949 to publication in English in 1991.The story is centered around the French court with all its pageantry and intrigue. King Charles VI has spells of insanity while three royal houses vie for power, riches and influence. The Duke of Orleans, brother of King Charles, along with his lovely, pious but proud wife Valentine, are dashing figures who reminded me of Dorothy Dunnet's characters in The Game of Kings. When the Duke of Orleans is murdered, thanks to his arch enemy and uncle, the Duke of Burgundy, his young son Charles must take on the responsibility of avenging his father's death and serving the mad King.The younger Charles then becomes the main character. He is a peace-loving boy of 14 who prefers books to battles but must live out his life caught up in the political wrangling and wars between France and England, all the while fending off his great-uncles. Thus he is forever conflicted and feels he is a failure. I felt a strong sympathy for Charles.The novel also includes the English Kings Richard II, Henry V and Henry VI, all determined to bring France under English rule. Joan of Arc makes an appearance. Except for her, women are mainly tools to gain power, always being married off at a young age to the various Kings.Hella Haasse brings to life the royal characters, their wives and offspring, the influence of the Roman Catholic Church over the lives of both the royalty and the common people, who actually do all the work.In a Dark Wood Wandering is a stunning example of historical fiction that overshadows in every way most of our modern bestselling historical novels.

As I have observed in life, people who carry unresolved sadness sometimes enter dementia in their later years. I've never read this in any scientific study. Those studies seem to focus on the brain rather than psychology.Anyway, Julie Otsuka does sadness in poetical fiction and makes it approachable for people like myself who like to come up with their own weird theories. She is also a master of the collective voice. In The Swimmers she uses that voice to show us a group of people who have swum together for years in a community pool. They are a fairly tolerant bunch for the most part. It is all about the lanes. Alice is a swimmer who appears to be losing some mental capacity.Then the pool is closed because of structural damage and suddenly the story is all about Alice. She is not suffering from old age or Alzheimers but from a rare degenerative brain disease: Pick's Disease. The collective voice becomes that of the institution where Alice must now live, some of Alice's memories, and the daughter who comes back from their estrangement to witness for and aid Alice.The change from the swimmers to Alice only was a shock to me as a reader. I felt a bit tricked and not a little disoriented. Of course, that was brilliant on the author's part because it gave me a taste of what Alice was living through.I lost a mother-in-law and my father to Alzheimers. It is a truth that the loved ones and the victims are similarly lost in this experience. A long, slow loss of connection. A helpless and hopeless situation because there is no cure. There is no cure for Pick's Disease either.Julie Otsuka does not flinch from any of this but somehow renders it with more understanding and compassion than the medical or institutional community can seem to manage.

Awhile back I watched Lunara: A Yak in the Classroom, set in Bhutan and nominated for Best International Feature in the 2022 Oscars. I might have heard of Bhutan but really had no idea where it was. It is a landlocked country, just south of China, north of India, and east of Tibet, traditionally Buddhist, and tucked into the southern slope of the eastern Himalayas.

Her mother has borne twelve children, Tsomo being the third. Only seven lived. Tsomo wants more than anything to learn to read, but that is forbidden for females. She also wants to see the world and asks her mother where is the furthest she can travel. Her first journey is to a faraway village where she goes to light the ritual butter lamps in her mother's memory. Her mother had died while in labor with her 12th child, who also died. Life is, from the viewpoint of an American woman, almost unbelievably hard for women in Bhutan. Yet, that journey set Tsomo on a life journey both inside her being and across many towns and countries.I became deeply involved with Tsomo's inner and outer journeys, with the rituals and beliefs of Buddhism and with the ways that women assist each other through their many trials. I gained a look at Bhutan, Tibet, Nepal and India that is rarely seen in the news.Most of all, I got an understanding of the Buddhist belief in karma. Back in my misspent youth we all went around saying ""instant karma's going to get you"" thanks to John Lennon. We were reminding ourselves that our actions mattered.

That ill-conceived idea, created In the final volume of his Power of the Dog trilogy, Don Winslow wraps up his fictional account of the War on Drugs. That ill-conceived idea, created by Richard Nixon in 1971, has resulted in billions of taxpayer dollars spent, huge increases in incarceration brought about the the ""three strikes"" law, and the ever-growing flow of drugs from Mexico, Columbia, Guatemala, etc, into the United States, escalating from marijuana to cocaine to crack to heroine. It is a ""war"" we lost, big time.Arthur Keller, the troubled hero of the trilogy, still trying to stem this flood of heroine, during the years of the Obama administration, takes on being the head of the DEA. His methods have always been dodgy and that continues in this book. Finally he is caught in the crossfire between the new President (read Trump but given a different name), the criminal money dudes, and Congress.Keller is a great character, a true desperado. He is smart, fearless and committed to bringing down both drug lords and complicit Americans, but so haunted by the sheer numbers of lives lost and the debacle of his personal life.Though the violence is hard to read about, the numbers of characters hard to keep track of, I am glad I read the books. (Power of the Dog, 2005; The Cartel, 2015; The Border, 2019.) They are long but clearly meticulously researched. I saw Don Winslow speak at a Politics and Prose event some time ago. His conclusion is that the most direct way to combat the problem is to legalize all drugs.I wonder if that would work.

Just reading it was a project that took a month and a half. The book is an expansion of a New York Times Magazine special issue created by Nikole Hannah-Smith and published on August 18, 2019 to mark the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved Africans brought to Jamestown, VA: August 18, 1619.Subtitled A New Origin Story, the book traces slavery and Black history in America. It is composed of 19 essays by eminent historians and journalists, 36 poems and short works of fiction interspersed between the essays, and photos. Altogether these elements show how slavery in America was a fatal flaw in the founding of the country, its growth, and our enduring gnarly problem of racism.The essays trace the ways slavery has been integral to American history from 19 different viewpoints. I took it at approximately a chapter a day. The knowledge presented grew in my understanding like a crazy quilt. The cumulative effect on me was a combined sense of how wealth, politics, ignorance and downright evil have woven an almost inextricable pattern of abuse, lies, denial and discrimination that influences the lives of Black people to this day. Along with all that heavy and shameful information came an appreciation of how much these people have contributed to America and how tenacious they have been in insisting on the rights granted in our constitution.By the time I reached the end, I felt it was one of the most educational books I have ever read.

In Violeta, she tells the story of a woman from an unnamed South American country which seems to be Chile. Allende grew up there and began her writing career there as well.Violeta was born in 1920 and is telling her life story as she approaches death 100 years later. Born into privilege, her family lost all their wealth in the Great Depression. Over the years, Violeta was the kind of female character Allende does best. Fearless, passionate, independent and reckless. I read Violeta with a reading group. I loved it the most. Other members did not like Violeta as a person. I understand. She was more driven by lust than sense in her romantic adventures, she was not always an attentive mother, she liked being a business woman more than a homemaker. Of course, I can relate to all of that!Like Isabel herself, Violeta was passionate about women's rights and human rights, paid dearly for her mistakes as a mother, then gave all she had to try to help her daughter and son in their adult years, with varying degrees of success.My take away from the novel is that finding a satisfying romantic partner, managing one's reproduction and childrearing, while attending to one's own dreams and needs is a tricky proposition. I suspect that only a minuscule percentage of women get it right. And we should all just forgive ourselves and each other.

In Aurora, he turns for the second time to writing a novel.Two siblings with a complicated relationship find themselves forced to reconcile. Aubrey Wheeler lives in Aurora, Illinois, slightly above the poverty line. Her brother Tom is an ultra-wealthy Silicon Valley CEO who is sure he can survive the crisis in his family bunker in the California desert.This novel is a page turner, the characters just breathe in your face, and it all feels probable, sometimes laughable, sometimes horrific.

I've been reading it for quite a while, 5 pages a day. I read it for a month in April 2021; then steadily from February to July 2022.As I always do with his books, because he makes history enjoyable to read, I learned much I had not known about the Renaissance. He set the volume in Italy but due to political events in Europe and Great Britain, he also covers other aspects of Western Civilization from 1304-1576.All the great Renaissance painters, sculptors and architects make their appearances. Italy is still a collection of cities, kingdoms and duchies squabbling over power, territory and trade routes. The Catholic Popes are corrupt in most cases, defending their Papal States and the right to rule Europe religiously. Meanwhile Martin Luther and his guys are preparing the largest challenge so far in history to the Catholic Church.The artists are making breakthroughs while making their livings primarily from the Church and wealthy dukes. Morals and tenets that had held sway for the centuries of Medieval times are losing their hold. Science and medicine are making advances due to military needs and the ravages of the plague. Discoveries of riches in the Americas are another powerful influence. Over all this hangs a fear of the Turks.Durant's last sentence, written from the perspective of the mid 1950s, pretty well holds true today, I think.""Everywhere today in Europe and the Americas there are urbane and lusty spirits...who feed and live on this legacy of freedom, esthetic sensitivity, friendly and sympathetic understanding; forgiving life its tragedies, embracing its joys of sense, mind and soul; and hearing ever in their hearts, amid hymns of hate and above the cannon's roar, the song of the Renaissance.""The next volume will be The Reformation, set in approximately the same time period, but following what was going on outside of Italy.

Brown's experiences growing up in Harlem parallel Malcolm's years there as a young man.In the biography of James Baldwin by David Leeming, I read about Baldwin's relationship with Malcolm and about his efforts to get the screenplay made.Finally, in Pillar of Fire, Taylor Branch's second volume of his biography of Martin Luther King, I read about the scandal in the Nation of Islam which caused Malcolm X to leave that organization.The epilogue at the end of The Autobiography of Malcolm X, written by Alex Haley, covers the last days of Malcolm's life. Pursued by NOI assassins, working feverishly to get his message out, while trying to provide for his wife and daughters after he is gone, it presents a man who has grown into his true mission but who knows he will soon be dead.

During the 1990sI don't remember how I learned about this book, though a friend of mine (feminist, poet) recommended Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz to me. During the 1990s my friend was traveling in Mexico where a feminist journalist introduced her to the woman's poetry.Sor Juana was one of those females who could read by the age of three, who had an unquenchable urge to read and learn. She entered a convent to escape any need to marry and there she wrote poems, plays, essays, and religious commentary on the Scriptures. In 1690, she wrote a critique of a 40 year old sermon by a famed Portuguese Jesuit priest. A bishop in her own time had it published which led to a suggestion that Sor Juana give up any and all studies and reading except Scripture.The contents a A Woman of Genius is her answer to such a suggestion. It is a major declaration of women's intellectual freedom. Her confrontation with high Church authority resulted in her posthumous status as a folklore heroine of Latin America.This was not an easy read. I took it 5 pages at a time, meaning 8 days of close concentration to read 63 pages of the translator's introduction and the author's words. Sor Juana's sentences and her wide, deep knowledge rival Jorge Luis Borges. Her ideas about women's place in the Church and in life, however, are as exciting and inspirational as any of the best feminist writing I have read. She balances her temerity with sometimes genuine, sometimes ironic humility.As women, we all have experienced having a man in some position of power seek to cancel, defeat or obstruct us in our endeavors. The worst ones are when such an abuse of power threatens our security, position and/or reputation. It is a very hard battle to win, up to this very day.While reading Sor Juana's words, every one of my experiences with such discouraging treatment floated back to me. But it seemed I was liberated from any lasting regret or weakness I still carried. Possibly some of the best therapy ever.

I recently read Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys and I found many parallels in Tar Baby, not just because the opening setting was in the Caribbean but in subject matter and in the women of the two books.

I mourned for both Jadine and her wild lover Son when she made her final decisions about their love and her personal goals.There are many Black writers I admire and respect but in my opinion most of them owe much to both James Baldwin and Toni Morrison, both of whom understood the source, the particulars and the intricate web of racism in America better and wrote about it better than anyone else....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jul 12, 2022","Jul 13, 2022","Jul 12, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11359.Tar_Baby
