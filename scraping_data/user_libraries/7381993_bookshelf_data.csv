Also it is a book that you can give to a pre-teen or young teen in your life and they will enjoy it as well. When i was reading I was thinking it will be a popular book. Actually i did not need to think that much as it is already visibly popular, at least in some corners of this site. More specifically, it has reminded me of another popular book: Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Tokarczuk. She has won a Noble of course and wrote many other books. She also tends not to repeat the form of her novels. But while other her books trigger a variety of reactions this particular one seems to be almost universally liked, at least by the anglophone audience. I think even the title of “Drive your plow over the bones of the dead” might have been a suitable proposition as a substitute for “Verdigris” in English. It might have been an apt metafictional reference to some elements of the mystery in the book and of course also an intertextual signifier towards the Blake’s poem and Olga’s novel. (Is there an emoji for ""irony""?). The similarities between these two books do not end there: both are sort of ironic mysteries with quite a bit of gore, but also a lot of humour; both use an advantage of unreliable narration. Also both novels benefit from the power of unusual charismatic protagonists: a retired eccentric teacher in Tokarczuk’s case and a precocious young teen who befriends an old groundsman of his grandparents’ rural estate. The old chap is loosing his memory. The boy (Michelino) tries to help the chap (Felice) to discover his past. In the process, he is getting himself into many mysteries surrounding the man and the estate.What follows is page-turning, playful “investigation” mainly told through a dialogue and other interactions (including even a kind of a psychic communion (!)) between Michelino and Felice supplemented by Michelino’s “deductions”. The actions take place in 1968. For first quarter of the book, the memory loss as plot device allows the author to play with the language, to build up a basic mnemonic system of the words, signs and associations. The translator has made a significant effort to convey this element. And the effort was a successful one, to a large extent.Inspired by the mystery, some successful language puns and those aforementioned similarities, i was anticipating another key element to appear. In the novels like Drive your plow…”  or let’s go even closer “to home” and take The Name of the Rose, a specific genre (a mystery, a gothic tale etc.) is used or even subverted to approach serious abstract and social themes. (I believe Eco refers to this as a “double-coding”). For example, in the “Drive..” Tokarzhuk used the form of a mystery to talk about conservation and animal rights. “In The name of Rose” Eco dealt with a range of ethical issues as well as the process of interpretation and the relationship between signs and their meanings (semiotics). In these cases the novel works both as a page turner and on a higher level something less obvious and more profound. This novel does make an attempt to do that. The actual narrator is not the boy but fifty-year old Michelino looking back. This framing device of having a “grown up person in the room” might have been effectively used to bring up more serious issues the author seems to be interested in. For example, collective memory or rather collective amnesia of Italian post-war generation and how it has affected the future generations. There is a lot nuanced discussion one might have in the context of this novel. The phenomena of repressed memory is resurfacing as well. And again, it works on the level of a mystery with help of prompts and eventually certain psycho-medium experience between the boy and the old man. Respectively the issue loses the depth of consideration for a sake of gaining a genre’s effect. I do not imply by any means that Mari needed to write Austerlitz de W. G. Sebald instead of his novel. But it seems this potential to add one more layer to the text hidden behind the initial attraction of a mystery was hardly explored. The closest it gets to this “second layer” of the narrative is in the question of “double”: do we keep a continuous identity with our childhood selves? What is the relevance of our childhood self to our fifty-year old self? Here is the question that has finally brought out our narrator, the fifty-year old Michelino with the following observation:“That summer i was thirteen and a half. Now that i am fifty, I can say that nothing has changed since then because my condition has always been one of doubleness; although I have never succeeded in ascertaining whether this split is only psychological, or ontological too. According to Felice, inside of me lived both a dead person and a living person: must I consider myself a coward if I never wished to get to the bottom of the matter? The charm of that whole story, moreover, was bound up in the fact that it concerned another, not to mention those quintessential others who are monsters; but to discover that I, too, was a monster was not so amusing, especially if I had to trust what an old wine-guzzler told me.”What a great passage... But it was the only passage my grown up self properly appreciated in the whole book. Though I can easily admit that my nine year old self would be gripped by everything in this story apart from this passage and read it in one sitting (ignoring the assigned homework, if any).Brian Moore starts his wonderful translator’s note at the back of the book with the following:“When it comes to the pleasures of reading there is no such thing as growing up.” I was about to argue ferociously with this statement. But then he qualifies: “Or at least certain works of literature make it tempting to think so - as if there were always the same young reader buried inside us, one who comes back to life each time we lose ourselves in the beauty and mystery of a good book” But i still would argue: I do not need my nine year old self “come back to life” to lose “in a beauty of a book”. She is happy where she is at the moment. In fact the whole point of being older is actually to appreciate some nuance that my pre-teen self would not be able to as much as she tried. If there is any grace of getting older it is this, I would argue.As a result, i guess this philosophical difference in defining “the pleasure of reading” or “a beauty of the book” has made me feel somewhat empty-handed after finishing this particular novel. Whilst Tokarzhuk or Eco have managed to go much further with me in my sadly old reading age.I also cannot get rid of the feeling that I’ve missed in translation the “effective multilingualism” of the original (the term Brian Moore used in the note). Moore tells us that the characters essentially speak “in different languages”. Felice’s dialogue is written in Gallo-Italic and “thus presents considerable difficulty for Italian readers” unfamiliar with that language; he adds: “no Italian reader would fully recognise their language in Felice’s and many readers would encounter it as something inherently foreign.” According to the note, Moore tries to recreate the effect by assigning to Felice a type a “Irish-influenced voice” a specifically created dialect inspired by Irish vernacular. In the note he goes into the length to justify his choices. As a reader not very well familiar with different dialects of English, i can only say i did not have an impression at all I had “accounted something inherently foreign” like the readers in Italian. Maybe it is because I am not native English speaker. I am not sure. Here there are two random examples of the dialect:“Have me an idea I do, but I ain’t tellin’ ye.”or “To the cellar me arse, blast’d son ‘f a dog!”To me Felice’s voice has lost the uncanny and “the foreignness” (and probably the musicality between the languages as well) that was available to the Italian readers of the original. Of course, I am judging this only based upon the translator’s note itself. However, this voice in vernacular does not “present considerable difficulty”  to me as a reader in English; respectively it does not add to my perceived pleasure of struggling with something mysterious, beautiful, scary and unknown.However, I totally recognise the difficulty faced by the translator. Although there were possible alternatives, there were no easy options available. I am grateful to Mr. Moore for taking his time in explaining his choice in the note. And I am sure many readers would be more comfortable with how Felice’s voice has been conveyed.Someone blurbed this novel on the back: “One reads it quickly. in on go. but it stays to “breath” in one’s soul for days. as though it were a living thing..”I testify to the first two sentences of this beautiful tribute and I’ve enjoyed the company of these two characters while it lasted. But in my case, the impact on my “soul” is to be seen. Maybe it is because my “soul” is too old and too sceptical and asks for complexity in spite of me telling her to go alone with the adventure....more",Notes are private!,25,27,1,"Apr 05, 2024","Apr 09, 2024","Apr 05, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/125483077-verdigris

That is one reason why the rating here is even more pointless than usual. I liked some of them a lot and a few did not create any impression on me. Jezewska writes with erudition, self-deprecated humor and wit. I came to this collection because I enjoyed reading some of her essays on line. Here her ability to see an absurdity but also fragility and grace of every day moments shine through. I liked “The Party” the first story of the collection for this reason. There are two slightly dystopian tales: “Siberia” and “Rumpel”. But strangely they’ve created the opposite impression. I was moved by the understated tragedy of the former but the critique of techno-capitalism of the later didn’t do anything for me. I found the title story “Ghost pains” a well researched but little laboured. While the last story of the collection “A new Book of Grotesque” appeared to be both well researched, smart but also very poignant and quietly rebellious. “The letter to the Senator” contained the echos of Malina by Bachman (not in the scale and effect, but in the small but striking detail). “Dispatches from Berlin” reminded me somewhat of Benjamin’s One Way Street And Other Writings. And “Gettysburg” has appeared to be the most memorable. I cannot explain why, but the image of a girl’s dress in the hands of an older woman got stuck in my mind.

It is hardly a coincidence that the author of “The Box” lists his influence among others at the end of the book. This is a wonderfully special fictional object. But unlike the box featured in the novel, anyone can open it both literary and metaphorically and find in there a unique number of treasures limited only by the reader’s imagination.It is a shame I am again find myself in the situation that i do not have time to write ""a proper"" . So instead I would list what would i want to talk about in case I would have that time.I would talk about how rich is this novel in its philosophical underpinnings. One have a choice of either to go with aforementioned object-oriented paradigm; or think of much older panpsychism that is going through a renaissance in popularity due to new theories of consciousness. There is a beautiful and wonderfully succinct and idiosyncratic “theory” in the text:“Indoor gardener asked him what consciousness felt like to a mushroom, a door, a hotel. Mr Six said thinking about consciousness is groping in the dark knowing something you can’t name is groping in the dark beside you.”I would also develop the idea of “strangeness” of objects but also of people, even the most closed ones. “A thing isn’t for any of you; a thing is for itself. A thing’s real self is its secret self,” - says one character. “In a search for origins or meanings, the more you don’t find, the more certain you become of things’ strangeness.”. This and the situation with the box that cannot be opened has reminded me of my sad hero Wittgenstein with his beetle in a box that no-one else can see. That famous thought experiment of his showing the impossibility of private language; the limits of human ability to understand another human and even the wider world. I would definitely expand on this parallel.I would write about phenomenology of a box, its shape, its function and its role in the development of human society from the use of squarely-shaped objects in design and architecture since the time memorial and to the boosting of the late capitalism with containership used in international trade.I might continue like that and move to consumerism, its ecological impact, a possibility of a box becoming a status object (why not?)... Or I might leave it at that and come back to the fact that for me this all is not that much about the box: more striking is how to write such a brilliant fictional object of a novel.It seems to be designed as experiment with style. I’ve got a huge affinity for such books that challenge and intrigue in equal measure. Each of the six chapters is written differently. If i would write a ""proper"" , i would analyse the differences, would try to trace the influences or find the possible comparisons like the objects in Pond or deliciously self-conscious, neurotic narrator in Panthers and the Museum of Fire and in the first chapter here. I would express an awe how the author has managed the unreliability of narration. It is not simply someone recounts someone’s else story. It is at least two levels removed: someone is having a conversation with someone else who recounts a story she heard outside the frame; rumours; second-hand accounts. Also each chapter introduces the new narrator with the voice previously unfamiliar. This and the constant snow on the background is deliciously disorienting (if not quite that sinister as it might have intended).I would talk about the writing. I could possibly detect a bit of exercise in style. But some results were quite dazzling:Is it Joyce or even earlier something English Joyce himself absorbed:“Behold the Bend. Where the mighty river makes a shifty little wiggle like a card shimmying up a sleeve before the sootiest, slinkiest, slimiest, squintiest bridge in the city. … Shutting up her ship and making certain of the door’s abundant locks, slooshing thenceforth though the snow as it sprinkles us with obstinacy, is Antique-Furniture specialist”And is it an echo of Macbeth's: “Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...”:“But she says each day that brings no change piles on her heart atop the other days that’s all alike and piled up there already. It sneaks into your mind, the snow. Like a noise that’s too far off but trembles the air for miles around. For even in the obstinate self-containment of each thing, things reverberate one another.""“Things reverberate one another” indeed! I would expand on this if I would be writing “the proper” .I would write how i’ve loved a whole chapter written in a dialogue, never properly attributed, between the two antique booksellers; how much I've enjoyed another chapter, “Remainder”, an affectionate monologue of a hotel worker conversing with her hotel as if the latter is a conscious being. I would also note that the last two chapters were a bit less successful in spite of keeping with inventiveness in style.And I would end my  that as an object, a fictional object, this book was a sheer gift....more",Notes are private!,31,34,1,"Mar 11, 2024","Mar 20, 2024","Mar 11, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/65215671-the-box

Another big thing, it seems, is autofiction. Yes, it is at minimum that old. With their obsession with “self” as a philosophical object they’ve brought this into the literature as well. Not always but sometimes it was on the level bordering self-obsession. So next time if one complains about “navel gazing” in a book, we all know whom to blame:-)Another take from this book for me was additional appreciation for the development of medicine in the last 200 years or so. The child mortality and the life span of those people were horrible, even if all of them stem from a privileged background in case of this story. The exception were though notable: Goethe lived until 83 and Schlegel and Schelling - almost to 80. The book is devoted to so-called Jena’s circle. The author uses the word “set” to compare and contrast with Bloomsbury set and alike. A few women, including Caroline Schelling played a very significant role in the intellectual development of the set and they are duly presented in the book. It is a narrative non-fiction and i personally did not appreciate the style of writing: all historical figures are presented as if they are characters in fiction with passages referring what they were thinking during their walks, talks and travels in carriages etc. For example:“Each would remember the next four days as some of the most extraordinary and creative of their lives.”And there are numerous instances like this. I’d rather avoid such intimacy and pathos in a historical writing unless “each of them” subsequently have written a testimony to this fact. However, the style might amplify the book’s appeal for the wider audience. And the book is certainly an easy digestible read on a difficult topic. ...more",Notes are private!,8,22,1,"Feb 06, 2024","Feb 15, 2024","Feb 06, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59883428-magnificent-rebels

I've been meaning to read it since Siri Hustvedt recommended it in the one of her interviews ages ago. The book is devoted to two centuries' argument that broadly comes down to the question ""what is life?"" One side of the argument is that alive creatures are not different from other mechanisms, just more sophisticated ones - no ""ghost within machine"" so to speak . On another - that there is a certain ""vitality"" force, the purposeness from within (the author uses the word ""agency': that differentiate alive world. If the second side of the argument seems obvious, it is not. The majority of scientific and philosophic community actually supports the first side. But the book is the history of the development of those ideas. The debate is still unfinished starting from Descartes and the automata of the 17th century, through Darwin vs Lamarck to Turing and Schrödinger and many others in between. I would need to read it at least one more time to be able to summarise the debate in more meaningful way. For now, I've just touch upon two ideas. First, Schrödinger's view:""Schrödinger proposed that the essence of life was a form of agency. “What is the characteristic feature of life?” he asked. “When is a piece of matter said to be alive? When it goes on ‘doing something,’ moving, exchanging material with its environment and so forth.” Specifically, the most salient “something” that organisms characteristically did, Schrödinger proposed, was to resist entropy, to avoid decay into equilibrium. They achieved this feat by means of their various metabolic functions: eating, drinking, breathing, photosynthesizing. In a world that tended toward disorder and decay, these functions enabled a living thing to maintain its order and energy, “continually sucking orderliness from its environment,” “drinking orderliness,” and “concentrating a ‘stream of order’” upon itself.""I think, this ability of a system to self-organise is actually becoming the one of the recognised features defining what it means to be alive; (and the ability of a system to be ""self-evidenced"" - monitor itself with awareness - would define a conscious system). All of it becomes even more fascinating when it comes to the field of artificial intelligence. I was extremely amazed by the far-sight of Turing's ideas (not the first time of course). Mainly that ""thinking machine"" should be able to learn itself. And also it should be fallible in a sense should be able to make mistakes. He wrote in 1947 ""if a machine is not fallible it cannot also be Intelligent"". That sounds so counterintuitive at first glance, but than it is a genial insight. He also contemplated teaching a machine through a contrast of ""pleasure"" and ""pain"" in its mechanical sense:""Turing urged, it made better sense to try to simulate a child’s mind. He imagined building, to begin, what he called an “unorganised machine,” that is, a bunch of neuron-like components connected “in a relatively unsystematic way” through “connection modifiers,” their configuration subject to some random variation. He thus laid out a blueprint for an approach to artificial intelligence that a decade and a half later would be called “connectionism.” The machine would become organized by means of an education, consisting of systematic “interference” that altered, fixed, or disrupted the connections among the components.Turing imagined two sorts of “interfering” input, “one for ‘pleasure’ or ‘reward’ (R) and the other for ‘pain’ or ‘punishment’ (P).” Pleasure interference would work to fix in place the current configuration of the machine while pain interference would disrupt it, causing previously fixed features to change or to vary randomly. You might then simply allow the machine “to wander at random through a sequence of situations, applying pain stimuli when the wrong choice is made, pleasure stimuli when the right one is made,” acting as the machine’s trainer in just the way that Ashby described training the Homeostat. One could even program the “teaching policies” right into the machine, Turing suggested, so that it would learn all on its own and direct its own process of organization.""It is amazing that it has been written in 1947 before any real computer has been designed. The first point does not need any commentary after Chat GPT. But the second is even more fascinating. I've read recently a very interesting book investigating the origins of consciousness The Hidden Spring: A Journey to the Source of Consciousness. I have not ed it yet even here as it is absolutely packed with knowledge and ideas supporting its main argument. And I feel overwhelmed so far how to present it in a coherent way. However, its author has got very interesting and strong hypothesis how Consciousness arises. According to him, its main function is to feel as this helps an organism to make quick decisions in uncertain situations. And on the very basic level, it is to feel exactly those two things: pleasure and pain. So Turing was basically mentally conceiving a machine that if realised, might eventually become conscious. Well, I leave it on this note I guess for now. This book would be of interest to those who are fascinated by philosophy of mind and history of biology and psychology. But is quite an academic writing, so might require some perseverance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Feb 02, 2024","Feb 29, 2024","Feb 02, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24998642-the-restless-clock

Amazingly, both of them referred to the man and his work. As a result, I’ve decided it was a time to read Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. I've grabbed a new translation and took it with me on a city break. It was a mistake. I was reading it during museums’ visits; I was reading it in a Metro’s train and in a hotel bed. For many times, I was re-reading the passages trying to get to the meaning. I was trying to unlock them with my mind, but the page after page, it was more like an austere poem full of symbols. It was like some cosmic code or a prayer: “the limits of language (of that language which alone I understand) mean the limits of my world""I was intrigued. I was taken not that much by the concepts, but by the enigma: who would wright like this? Who would put at the core of his philosophical argument an image of a man climbing the ladder only to tip it off from the top (as not anymore required)? Who would use this metaphor of a discarded ladder for his own work that i’ve just read? A snake biting its tale...It is almost equally ironic that his later self did indeed “discarded” a big part of his earlier thinking. Fichte said: “What sort of philosophy one chooses depends…on what sort of man one is; for a philosophical system is not a dead piece of furniture that we can reject or accept as we wish; it is rather a thing animated by the soul of the person who holds it.”And this astonishing biography has given me some access to that “soul. Wittgenstein of course is a “rewarding character”. Still this book reads like a thriller. I was especially impressed how much space Monk has left for Wittgenstein and people of his time to speak directly (through the quotes of correspondence and other sources).So who was the man? I recommend Monk’s narrative to find out more. But when i think about his life, i do not think of a narrative. I think of a list of seven “propositions” instead.1. Wittgenstein tried to live a good life.1.1 “The way to solve the problem you see in life is to live in a way that will make what is problematic disappear”. (Wittgenstein,1937)1.1.2. He went to fight for his country (Austria) in WWI though he did not have to. 1.1.3. He gave up his part of huge fortune back to his family and never let them help him with money or with anything else. 1.1.4. After the WWI, he went to teach children in a variety of primary schools in the poorest Alpine villages of Austria. 1.1.5 He went to stalinist Russia to see whether he and his then partner could emigrate there and work as manual labourers helping to build communism. He came back and never mentioned that again.1.1.6 During WWII, he resigned from Cambridge and helped the war effort by working in a hospital. 1.1.7 He always advised his student to give up on academic career and do something useful like doctors, mechanics or manual labour do. Some of them have followed his advice.1.1.8 According to Lettice Ramsey, “He made a moral issue out of everything”1.2 “Fear in face of death is the best sign of a false, i.e. a bad, life.” (Wittgenstein, Diaries 1914-16)1.2.1 He had to face death of people close to him since early age. 1.2.1.1 Three of his four brothers committed suicide. 1.2.1.1.1 The oldest brother was a very talented musician but needed to subdue his talent to the father’s will. He rebelled and escaped, but did not hold it together.1.2.1.1.2 Another brother killed himself publicly in a bar leaving a note about his homosexual inclinations. 1.2.1.1.3 The third brother killed himself during the WW1 facing his soldiers disobedience and a need to surrender.1.2.1.2 David Pinsent, his best friend in 1910s and possibly a platonic love, has died in a plane crash aged 27. Wittgenstein devoted [Tractatus] to his memory.1.2.1.3 Francis Skinner, his friend and possibly lover, has died on his hands aged 28 in a Cambridge Hospital in 1941, neglected while all medical attention was on the war’s victims.1.2.2 It seems, he went to war to overcome fear of death. He looked in abyss and came back with ""Tractatus"". 1.2.2.1 He was initially sent to perform duties far from the frontline. But he begged to be send onto the battlefield. He was decorated for bravery.1.2.2.2 During this time, he was profoundly influenced by Tolstoy’s “The Gospel in Brief.” He has come across it by chance. But it has become his “talisman”, “a magnificent work”. He has become known as a “man with the Gospels” between the soldiers. He wrote: “this book virtually kept me alive”.2. Genius: high stakes and high bar for himself and everyone else.2.1 For Otto Weininger, the philosopher who influenced young Wittgenstein, it was genius or death. Wittgenstein was doubting his genius and vocation. “He was ashamed for 9 years he did not dare to kill himself. His feeling was overcome only when “he had convinced Russell that he possessed philosophic genius” (Monk). 2.1.1. He was “perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate, profound, intense, and dominating.” (Russel)2.2 Since then, he was considered “a genius” by all Cambridge philosophers and was gaining much wider reputation, the following and fame. Even now he is widely considered the best philosopher of the 20th century. His impact on the wider culture is even greater including in the 21st century.2.3 However, Wittgenstein said: “Inner process stands in need for outward criteria”. And it seemed through his life and starting with Russel, his genius was often “in a need for outward criteria”. He often relied on others for validation, intellectual and practical help. And he did not make it easy for people around him. 3. “God may say to me: “I am judging you out of your own mouth. Your own actions have made you shudder with disgust when you have seen other people do them.” (Wittgenstein, 1951)3.1 Fighting pride and vanity but losing the fight.3.1.1 In the 30s, he had made a number of closed friends to sit through the “confessions of his sins”. The reason he did it was that he believed the main objection to good philosophy is pride. He did not ask whether these people would be comfortable to be his confessors.3.1.2 On the front he despised “slavic soldiers” as a “bunch of delinquents” (In Austro-Hungarian army slavic ethnicity was prevailing between the soldiers while the officers were predominantly of a germanic or Hungarian heritage). 3.1.3. When teaching in village schools he did not quite warm up to the locals. At one place he wrote ‘these people are not people at all but loathsome worms”. They did not trust him either and called him “baron”.3.1.4 Gilbert Ryle, an Oxford philosopher, thought: “W not only properly distinguished philosophical from exegetic problems but also, less properly, gave the impression first that he himself was proud not to have studied other philosophers - which he had done, though not much - and second that he thought that people who did study them were academic and therefore unauthentic philosophers.”3.1.4.1 “What Ryle says about Wittgenstein attitude towards reading the great works of the past is correct.” (Monk). In his own words: “As little philosophy as I read I have certainly not read too little, rather too much. I see that whenever I read a philosophical book: it doesn’t improve my thoughts at all, it makes them worse.” (Wittgenstein diaries).3.1.4.2 In spite of this self-professed “view”, many scholars agree that the influence of Schopenhauer on Tractatus is obvious and very substantial. He also read Kant.3.1.5 “Freud surely errs very frequently & as far as his character is concerned is probably a swine or something similar, but in what he says there is a great deal. And the same is true of me. There is a lot in what I say.” (Wittgenstein’s Diaries). 3.2 Feeling guilt in a Raskolnikov’s way 3.2.1 During his days as a teacher, he had all the time in the world for clever students, mainly boys. Less able, especially girls but not exclusively, were the subject of physical punishment. He boxed their ears, pulled hairs. Sometimes it has caused bleeding. He felt very guilty after that. But it seems to be a repeating pattern.3.2.1.1 Just before the end of his teaching career, he knocked a boy on a head in such a way that the boy has lost consciousness. He carried him to the teaching room. But in the process has been seen by the father of a girl whom he made physically suffer as well. The police was called and tribunal ensued. However, he was cleared. Possibly it was a cover up by his family. For years he experienced a tremendous guilt. Ten years later, while working at Cambridge, he returned to the village, to ask for the children's forgiveness. The reception was understandably mixed. The incident here is referred as Haidbauer incident (wiki).3.2.2 Francis Skinner, Cambridge student, was his long-term on/off partner, friend and collaborator in the second half of the 30s. Francis was a very soft, kind and extremely devoted person. However, Wittgenstein did not always payed him due respect. Though Francis might have become a solid academic, Wittgenstein convinced him to leave the academic life and to start working as a mechanic in a garage. At the same time Wittgenstein left for Norway to do ‘his work’ in solitude. Francis felt very lonely and out of place. However, he blamed only himself for any disagreements and for Wittgenstein’s cold treatment. Only after Francis untimely death, Wittgenstein appreciated him more and felt some very much delayed guilt. 3. 3 Strong views often reflecting the worst prejudices of his time. 3.3.1 Otto Weininger and later Oswald Spengler have had a forming and lasting influence on the his views. 3.3.1.1 In 1903, Otto Weininger has committed suicide aged 23 in the house where Beethoven has died. Otto has become a cult figure with a few copy-cats suicides, possibly including Wittgenstein’s brother. Before that he, wrote a book “Sex and the Character”.3.3.1.2 “Sex and the Character” has become very popular after Weininger's death. The book was devoted to decay of the society. Weininger attributed this to the raise of science and decline of the art and music.3.3.1.3 Being a Jew, Otto has expressed severely anti-semitic and misogynistic views in the book. Due to this, llegedly he was “Hitler’s favourite Jew”.3.3.2 Wittgenstein considered the book “great” though did not agree with his views directly: ""It isn't necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great."" 3.3.3 However, Wittgenstein also considered the predominance of science very negatively: “What links his apocalyptic anxiety with his hostility to academic philosophy is his detestation of the power of science in our age, which on the one hand encourage philosopher craving for generality, and on the other produced atomic bomb. In a curious sense he even welcomed the bomb, if only the fear of it could so something to diminish the reverence with which society regarded scientific progress.” (Monk)3.3.4 Like many in his time, he looked at the tragic events of the century through the prism of “race” and “civilisations”. 3.3. 4.1 “I feel the terrible sadness of our - the German race’s -situation. The English-the best race in the world- cannot lose. We however can lose and will lose, of not this year then the next. The thought that our race will be defeated depresses me tremendously because i am German through and through.” (from the Diaries 1914)3.3.4.2 In 1947: “Cambridge grows more and more hateful to me. The disintegrating and putrefying English civilisation. A country in which politics alternates between an evil purpose and no purpose.” 3.3.5 He also has hold some anti-semitic views, at least for a period and often was not comfortable with women’s increasing role in the society.3.3.5.1. “Were they not written by W, many of his pronouncements on the nature of Jews in his autobiographical remarks in 1931 would be understood as nothing more than the rantings of a fascist anti-Semite.” (Monk) He adopted for Jews many metaphors of illness on a healthy body. 3.4. Intolerance of other opinions, people and any critique of his work.3.4.1 About Francis Skinner, his probable lover: “Thought: it would be good and right if he had died, and thereby taken my folly away. Althing again I only half mean it.” Francis, who was much young has died indeed in a few years. (The diary)3.4.2 About Ramsey, very talented colleague and a friend, the translator of “The Tractatus” just three months after his death:  “his mind repulsed me. He had an ugly mind but not an ugly soul. (The diary).3.4.3 Occasional silent treatments to his friends and colleagues for obscure reasons sometimes lasting years. In Ramsey’s case - four years. 3.4.5 Judging Russel, Moore and other colleagues harshly, being rude and intense in letters, sometimes unreasonably demanding, asking for favours all the time. “If a person tells me he has been to the worst places I have no right to judge him but if he tells it was his superior wisdoms that enabled him to go there, then I know he is a fraud.” (about Russel in the diary).3.4.6 “He tolerated no critical examination by others, once the insight had been gained by an act of inspiration...I sometimes had the impression that the deliberately rational and unemotional attitude of the scientist and likewise any ideas which had the flavour of “enlightenment” were repurgent to him. (Carnap said in the 20s)3.4.7 “Because if you doubt the truth of what he says he always thinks you can’t have understood it. This makes him rather tiring to talk to, but if I had more time I think I should learn a lot from discussing with him.” (Ramsey in the 20s).4. Solipsism both in philosophy and in personal life4.1 “what the solipsist means is quite correct; only it cannot be said, but makes itself manifest.” (The Tractatus). 4.1.1 At least in his early philosophy he seemed to reject the existence of other minds. It has got impact on his relationships with people and even later philosophy as well.4.2 Otto Weininger has got the following to say about love:“In love, man is only loving himself. Not his empirical self, bit the weakness and vulgarities, not the failings and smallnesses which he outwardly exhibits; but all that he wants to be, all that he ought to be, his truest, deepest, intelligible nature, free from all fetters of necessity, from all taint of earth.”4.2.1. This is almost too perfect a description of Wittgenstein’s romantic life.He wanted to be very selfless but often ended up extremely selfish. Francis Skinner, his the most established partner, has got the worst treatment. In his only known relationship with a woman he has totally ignored her feelings or intentions. Respectively he totally misread them. 5. He lived and thought more like a Sage. 5.1 Early Wittgenstein views has got strong mystical elements:5.1.1 “When my conscience upsets my equilibrium, then I am not in agreement with Something. But what is this? Is it the world? Certainly it is correct to say: Conscience is the voice of God.” (The Diaries 1914-16)5.1.2 Ethics: “if there is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so.” (Tractatus 6.41)5.1.3 “There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.” Again like Weil about beauty in literature. (Tractatus 6.521)5.2 Even later in life his insights came to him more like a result of “divine inspiration”:“His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientists; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer. When he started to formulate his view on some specific philosophic problem we often felt the internal struggle by which he tried to penetrate from darkness to light under an intense and painful strain, which was even visible on his most expressive face. When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answer came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or divine revelation. Not that he asserted his views dogmatically... But the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through a divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that nay sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.” (Carnap in the 20s)5.4 Keynes called him “God” even if he probably was ironic.5.5 He developed almost a cult following.5.6 Like a hermit, he always tried to run away to remote places (house in Norway or cottage in Ireland) to devote himself to work. However, he always came back to the “world” after that.5.7 Zosima, a monk from The Brothers Karamazov was the one of his favourite characters. He said one could be a person like Zosima in real life. Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy who preached the ethic of spiritual sacrifice were the writers he respected the most.  6. He has started with solving all philosophical problems and ended by pointing that there were no problems as such, just confusions.(due to the lack of space in the  box, the further points on 6. are in the first comment below) 7. “His disposition is that of an artist...”7.1“His disposition is that of an artist, intuitive and moody. He says every morning he begins his work with hope, and every evening he ends in despair.” (Russel)(see further points on 7. in the 2nd comment)7.4 In my view, he was he was the best judge of himself:“Among Jews “genius” is found only in the holy man. Even the greatest of Jewish thinkers is no more than talented. (Myself for instance). I think there is some truth in my idea that I really only think reproductively.

But also it manages to present the subject as very fascinating. It is also an important, relatively unusual perspective on history and even maybe psychology. This is not really a proper  as I rely heavily on including significant chunks of the text from the book. But i thought it would be useful to share some of the assertions and facts that i found fascinating.The subject is quite new and still controversial. There is a camp of specialists that claim the basic emotions are the same from primordial days. Therefore they cannot really have history. Also the impact of emotional states on historic events cannot be objectively studied. I am very much simplifying the debate, but this is the idea. However, there the opposite camp disagrees. And this book summarises where they are coming from. According to them: “The history of emotions shows us that any particular way of thinking about feelings, past or present, is the product of contingent historical processes. This helps to unsettle the belief that any such picture is inevitable, natural, or universal. One standard psychological approach is to ask what emotions ‘we’ have, or how ‘the brain’ works, as if there were a singular answer that would be true for all brains and all humans in all times and places. The history of emotions, by and large, rejects such universalism. And yet the discipline is founded on an assumption, whether explicitly stated or not, of some kind of shared connection between the historian and their subjects. Historians of emotion, in however imperfect a way, do usually hope to help us see inside the minds of the dead. The range of feelings available in the past, while often diverging markedly from our own, are generally part of a recognizable, albeit very large and only partially shared, human repertoire.”Somewhere in this book the emotions are compared with famous quantum physics wavefunction. According to this function, the electrons could be in many states at the same time until they interact with the environment. At this point the function “collapses” and the position of the electron could be described and defined. The same with an emotional state - it could be hidden inside and preferable, it could be indescribable and certainly unhistorical. However, at some point the emotions come out into the open and face with other people, society etc. - emotional “function collapses” to something that can be studied and put into a historical context. The book briefly goes through different concepts with the subjects and some key individuals studying it. Then the author moves to some individual emotions (woe, happiness, rage and love) and shows how this work is done with the help of case studies. Below are a few examples that intrigued me. The book contains much more inspire of being such a short volume.Happiness“We can trace its origins back to the politics and culture of the 18th century, when emotions and politics were starting to take on their modern shape. The 18th-century pursuit of happiness brought with it new terrors and anxieties. Happiness was a foundational aim for revolutionaries in both North America and France. It was written into the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776, and echoed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man adopted by France’s new National Assembly in 1789. The shadow side of this aspiration was evident in the violence and bloodshed of the armed revolutions undertaken in its name. The waves of revolutionary ecstasy had an undertow of terror, and the pursuit of happiness was haunted by fear.”However, apparently the “happiness” included into 1776 US Declaration of Independence is a different phenomena compared to the emotional happiness we now refer to. It is referring more to “hap” which is luck and closer to “happenstance”. The confirmation of this is a “short essay, ‘On True Happiness’, written by Benjamin Franklin and published in the Pennsylvania Gazette some decades earlier.”“Franklin contrasted this sorry state (of emotional happiness) with ‘true, solid happiness’, which was grounded in ‘an indifference to the things of this world, an entire submission to the will of Providence here, and a well-grounded expectation of happiness hereafter’. For Franklin and those who thought like him, the pursuit of happiness was mainly about being good rather than feeling good.‘Happiness’ in 1776 was the ability to pursue prosperity through the solid and sober exercise of reason and virtue.”However, in French revolution whatever they mean by “happiness” was much closer to the emotional state according to the author. He also raises the question of putting happiness into the corner stone of modern social good. He notes that in the UK as well as in other western countries individual happiness is often monitored by the government and otherwise under a constant scrutiny of the society. But the other side of the coin of such approach is a growing anxiety of being somehow unhappy and especially in the relative terms: “This modern to-and-fro between happiness, anxiety, and the state can be identified as a ‘structure of feeling’—a recurring pattern of emotions made possible by social and cultural factors.”LoveNo comments from me on the one, just excepts:“So extensive was the remit of caritas as an ethical imperative that it was also used as the basis for activities which seem, to modern eyes, less obviously virtuous than being a good neighbour or respecting your elders. This is captured in the title of an article by the church historian Jonathan Riley-Smith—‘Crusading as an act of love’—which documents the ways that popes and preachers mobilized a language of fierce, zealous Christian charity in their crusading propaganda. In 1215, Pope Innocent III asked rhetorically how a man could claim to love his neighbour as himself if he learned that ‘his Christian brothers in faith.”“From the 17th century onwards, a ‘charity’ (caritas) was also the name for a foundation set up to receive donations and use them in the pursuit of worthy causes. Such organizations proliferated rapidly from the later 18th century, and were closely connected with the culture of sensibility, with its ideal of extravagant compassion. Sensitive and wealthy individuals learned to shed both tears and cash in order to demonstrate their admirable feelings of pity and sympathy for those less fortunate than themselves.:”“The 18th century saw the birth of what historians have termed a new ‘culture of sensibility’, in which educated ladies and gentlemen displayed their moral refinement and human sympathy by responding emotionally to sentimental plays, novels, and paintings. This culture was one in which sympathy for one’s fellow men and women, and public expressions of certain emotions, were newly valued alongside the powers of reason and intellect. Eighteenth-century sensibility found expression in religion and politics as well as in the art and literature of the age. Among the emotions most celebrated were love, compassion, and ecstasy as well as a delightful kind of aesthetic terror known as the ‘sublime’. An idea shared by many who adopted both the philosophy of sensibility and the ideals of the American and French Revolutions was that there was something universal about human nature, and that certain ‘rights’ flowed from that. All human beings had powers of reason, were linked by their powers of sympathetic feeling, and were owed dignity, liberty, and the protection of the state. The universality of this theory of rights and feelings, however, was not matched in practice. Whether understood as a political aspiration or as an emotional experience, ‘happiness’ was never equally available to all. There were many, including women and people of colour, who were forced to smile through their suffering in a show of cheerful submission, masking emotions of pain, despair, and terror, while being offered little of the sympathy and compassion lauded by the era’s moralists.”Rage (and revenge as a possible manifestation of it)It was interesting to find out that in legal definition of “loss of control” while acting under rage is currently broader remit (since 2009) as a defence compared with the old idea of “provocation”. Considering all debates and in the society and “me2” this seems almost counter-intutive, but here we go apparently:“English attitude persisted into the 20th century, with the example of Othello still a cultural reference point. In resisting a ‘provocation’ defence in 1946, a Court of Appeal judge stated that, ‘Even if Iago’s insinuations against Desdemona had been true, Othello’s crime was murder and nothing else.’ The judge commented further that ‘as society advances, it ought to call for a higher measure of self-control in a defendant’. However, the change has in fact been in the opposite direction since then. The ‘loss of control’ defence introduced in 2009 has a much wider remit than the idea of ‘provocation’ of which it is the descendant. Today in England or Wales, if a husband is merely told that his wife has been unfaithful, believes it (whether or not it is true), and is enraged to the extent that he loses control and kills her, then he has the chance to ask a jury to reduce his crime to manslaughter. The ‘loss of control’ defence has been used successfully in exactly this way. In the 21st century, then, unlike any time between the 17th and 20th centuries, a real-life Othello might actually have a chance of being acquitted of murder, on the grounds that he was unable to control his jealous anger.”Another interesting timely remark on “universal suppressed rage” that women allegedly feel for any reason: “Some other women, however, found it frustrating that whatever emotions they felt, they would be told by those who subscribed to this view that ‘really’, they were angry. The psychologist Carol Tavris, in a popular book on Anger: The Misunderstood Emotion (1982), reported overhearing a conversation between two women in a café around this time. The first woman was trying to explain that she was feeling sadness because her father had died, while her Freudian companion insisted this was in fact repressed anger. So insistent was the friend, that eventually the first woman lost her temper, providing yet more evidence for the theory of universal suppressed rage.”I’ve picked just a few cases but this little books is packed with interesting and relevant information. In my view, history of emotions has got some many interesting non-trivial applications for understanding the society, but also it is, to some extent, overlaps with literature. So i would recommend this book as a wonderful read which might open a new road for you....more",Notes are private!,13,22,1,"Jan 02, 2024","Jan 15, 2024","Jan 02, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63392986-the-history-of-emotions

But the way how each individual reader would engage with this work really depends on her/his expectations. I've picked it up as I was interested in her thoughts on Wittgenstein. She acknowledges his overwhelming influence on her views of language, self, the formation of identity. Also I wanted to find out more about some special linguistic features of Japanese language and her experience of grappling with them. Both of these elements are there. But predominantly it is appeared to be a type of a frank, confessional memoir of her expat experience in Japan; her personality-forming romantic relationships and her ambivalent, bordeline love-hate relationship towards the country. Onomatopoetic mimetic titles of each essay serve thematically and structurally more like a constraint to her narrative rather than a necessary description of individual linguistic phenomena. Unfortunately for me, Wittgenstein was also lost on the way, or rather blended in her own views.On the personal level, it seemed to me that to some extent she mistook her experience of living abroad with something specific to Japan and its people. When she describes some of her interactions with the locals or her mixed feelings during the visit of her Western friends and relatives who are aloof to the local social norms, her experience sounds very similar to many things I felt here in England in the first 10 years of my life here. So it might be either more universal expat experience or maybe the English and Japanese are not that contrastingly different. I suspect the former. On this note, I will quote a lengthy passage from the book, her feelings about the Japanese expressing unashamed pride (or maybe a simple boast?) for their country:""it’s safe, the food is delicious, and I can speak Japanese. And then they might say it again: In Japan, I feel ho’to. Or they’d ask me how to say it in English. From mouth after mouth, across different age groups and in different parts of the country, I had watched these sentiments emerge, dazzling in their uniformity, and when I was irritable I would think reflexively: fuck you. No really, fuck your stable national identity, your crimeless safe haven, your rich and unique culinary tradition. It felt like the smugness attached not just to the qualities of Japan, but also to the meta-activity of leaning back into and parroting the received narrative. And thus, over time, I’d come to associate the phrase ho’to with lazy patriots, uncritical, boring, scared people who lived oblivious to their own privilege, the kind of people who had never even considered what it meant, for example, for their country to accept so few asylum seekers, or why that could be seen as problematic for the third largest economy in the world. Speaking honestly, I can’t promise that if I were back in Japan teaching right now, I wouldn’t feel this exact same rage all over again; even in my calmest moments, I believe this phenomenon merits genuine concern. I see something inherently problematic about the patriotic messaging that pervades Japanese society, and however benign and apolitical its expressions might appear in the context of an English class, I feel it shares an ecosystem with phenomena which are anything but. I could go further and say that I think that when ‘Japan is number one!’ can pass as a simple expression of preference without calling for any unpacking, then that society is bound to have problems, and some of the shapes that those problems will take are nationalism and xenophobia.""Reading this passage, I could not help, but feel if I replace all words ""Japan/ Japanese"" with ""England/ English"", it would easily apply to my periodic feelings towards some ""over-patriotic"" people on these shores, especially after a certain referendum. It was almost uncanny. So i do not think this problem was necessary limited to some Japanese national peculiarity.Anyway, coming back to book, I enjoyed reading it in spite of certain reservations. She describes a very authentic, visceral human experience of reaching proper adulthood both emotionally and intellectually in a foreign country. And each such experience is unique, insightful and valuable. Her writing is also very elegant and her thoughts about bilingual identities were interesting and vividly expressed:What I find the most extraordinary, though, is reflecting that, as translators and therefore, to some extent, surely, also speakers, these people have most likely had to express themselves in multiple languages, which raises a point that feels even more fundamental: have they not wrestled with the brain-warping activity of having to translate themselves across different languages? Have these people not, as I have, watched their identity contort into rainbow fractals, vanish entirely, and then return as a pink-spotted dragon? I know that it’s unreasonable to expect everyone to have gone through existential crises over this – although part of me does really think that if they were sufficiently invested and sufficiently sensitive then they would have experienced at least minor ones...”Also I’ve recently developed an interest in how the translators imagine their task. And I loved how imaginatively she conveyed her experience of translating:Connected up with all of this, even though I might not always or almost ever be aware of such connections on a moment-by-moment basis, what I feel is groundedness. It’s strange, really, that such groundedness can exist here, in what seems objectively like an implausible place to find certainty: this in-between place which is translation, this space where you hover spectral between one language and another, where ideas routinely swim, and give way underfoot, and where there aren’t any right answers. It’s not the sort of place that you’re supposed to draw security from, or which is supposed to make you happy or prosperous.Therefore, for a certain reader having an affliction for a frank confessional memoir combined with stimulating intellectual insights this book might be a good discovery. ...more",Notes are private!,8,23,1,"Dec 25, 2023","Dec 31, 2023","Dec 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55856548-fifty-sounds

(The others are: Satantango, The Melancholy of Resistance and Baron Wenckheim's Homecoming). This is the first book in this cycle where Krasznahorkai sends his characters outside of Hungary. The main actions take play in New York. Later the novel moves to Switzerland. But interestingly the vast majority of the characters, especially the ones given their own voice, are the Hungarians. The story is focused on an existentially challenged, painfully imaginative, kind but powerless archivist, Korin. Unfortunately, he has got suicidal tendencies and occasional weakness for alcohol. The former is not surprising considering his disposition and the realities of his country. The later is even less surprising considering every other character is this book is suffering from this affliction. One of those days at work, Korin finds a manuscript between the old papers. Or so he says to everyone who will listen. The manuscript is appeared to have a very special meaning for him. Generally, this is quite an evocative symbolism of mystic nature such a job might entail: an archivist can often literally choose whom to bring out of oblivion. And Korin experiences a strong “calling” from the manuscript. Before his final act of self-destruction, he wants to do a deed and to save the text for posterity. This involves going to New York, “the centre of the world”, and type in the manuscript into an internet page. As readers, we never have a direct access to the manuscript (therefore i was experiencing a growing but possibly not fully warranted suspicion that Korin might in fact have been the author). However, we are very well aware about its content through Korin’s eyes. It describes the travels of four men thrown from one historical time and place to another who seemed to try to escape from a certain pending catastrophe. But each time they meet with a nefarious presence of the fifth man and realise that their attempt was doomed once more. At some stage, Korin is hit with realisation that it would not suffice for him to protect the manuscript: he wants now to safe those men who have become very real to him. But he also feels he would be unable to bring them out “war&war” into peace. It is a sort of powerful allegory with these men representing either eternal refugees or maybe angels who try to find their way back with the fifth man being the force of evil. And the character of Korin plays a role of a failed saviour or maybe just a story teller. It is designed to be a timeless, universal tale, but still it is striking how much it is symbolic of the current state of the world. The allegory has brought to mind The Master and Margarita with its idea of a Master telling the tale and the Devil’s calling the shots everywhere. But of course the style and the context of this novel cannot be more different from the Bulgakov’s. There is no place for lyricism, vague “happy” ending or any kind of soapy romantic notion (ie “power of love”) in Krasznahorkai’s world. Compared to his other two novels, I’ve found the story in this one even more cruel and occasionally borderline obscene in some details, especially in his depiction of males treating women. In terms of style, this novel is written with his trade mark very long, multi-clause, elegant sentences. But I’ve found it much easier to read compared to “Melancholy” where those sentences were packed to the brim with philosophic meaning. Here the ideas are more explicit, often simply spelled out.What seemed new to me was more pronounced meta-fictional element. The novel contains quite lengthy passages on the nature of writing. Here is the one (note that it is just the part of the sentence):“...for here language simply rebels and refuses to serve, will not do what it was created to do, for once a sentence begins it doesn’t want to stop, not because—let’s put it this way—because it is about to fall off the edge of the world, not in other words as a result of incompetence, but because it is driven by some crazy form of rigor, as if its antithesis—the short sentence—led straight to hell, as indeed it had tended to do with him, but not with the manuscript, for that was a matter of discipline, Korin explained to the woman,..”Also all the whole of the novel can pass for a Russian dole of nested manuscripts and failed saviours: - first: the original manuscript with its presumed unknown author trying to write a tale about saving four “angels”. But it does not look they’ve managed to escape;- then Korin’s retelling of the story and his doomed attempt of “saving” those characters;- finally, i felt that as the readers, we are guided to imagine that the book we are reading is Krasznahorkai’s attempt to “save"" Korin as well as some other of his characters from that “all out war” surrounding them. Needless to say, this attempt in its turn was also a failure. At the end of the novel, Krasznahorkai also uses a popular meta-trick by creating a physical reference to Korin in the real world. But this has failed to impress me. Though by the standard of the 90s when the book was written it should have been pretty cool. However, another post-modern element, the prequel story included into the book at the end was really great: like a Tarantino movie with Central European innuendo. The benefit of the relative ease of reading this story was that i spent more time noticing what makes his narrative construction so unique. Here the magic was how seamlessly he weaved together the perspectives of his multiple narrators.The story proceeds roughly in chronological order. However, we are presented with the multiple layers:1) It seems, there is an omnipresent narrator who rarely uses his voice, but orchestrates other voices and controls the coherence of a whole;2) Each chronological snippet is presented by the variety of characters; some of them are appearing in the book only for a short while, almost like to deliver their witness statement. This aspect has reminded me the famous story ""Rashomon"" by Akutagawa's in Rashōmon and Seventeen Other Stories. This technique makes reading experience akin watching a movie with its cinematic cuts between the characters. It might be disorienting at first, but makes the narrative very dynamic. Have I mentioned Tarantino already? But it is even more clever than that: in many cases, the character would not deliver his monologue directly, but through the conversation with someone else. For example, there is an episode when a cafe owner shares her encounter with Korin and with her telephone interlocutor. We never hear the other side of the conversation. But the nature of speech comes across as a very genuine dialogue almost as if we are the part of it.3) Another big part of narration is made as a feverish first person monologue by Korin periodically interrupted by the narrator’s remarks a-la “Korin said” , “Korin declared”, “Korin nodded”. In other context these remarks might be irritating but here they create a certain rhythm in otherwise practically breathless speech. Korin is a very talkative character. So often his interlocutors are practically silent, though they play a significant and very subtle role in the narrative. For example, his main listener is a woman who is in an abusive relationship with his landlord. So her silence is full of tragic subtext. 4) And the manuscript as such would constitute the final layer of narration. Though, as i’ve already mentioned, we are not sure how reliable the retelling is.In general, the potential unreliability of each step in this “ladder of testimonies” adds ambiguity and creates a possibility multiple interpretations. It also defines the pace of the novel and its atmosphere. For me this was the main attraction of this novel. I still prefer “The Melancholy of Resistance” to both Satantango and this one. But i can totally see what Krasznahorkai means when he says each of them is an attempt to write the same book. They brilliantly complement each other in more than one way.

The third part devoted to the totalitarianism per se was probably the most familiar to me in terms of ideas and the facts. But the first two were more revelatory. They were devoted to the origins of the modern antisemitism according to Arendt and the emergence of imperialism respectively. One might argue that Arendt talks about actually pretty mature late imperialism, not the emergence of the phenomena per se. But she has got a lot of interesting, not -trivial ideas to share on the atmosphere in Europe at the first half of the 20th century. I will briefly highlight only two of them which I under appreciated before: pan-movements as the origins of both Russian and German totalitarianism; the significance of post WW1 almost random division of Europe (especially post Habsburg and Post Ottoman) into so-called nation states and how it was done by a degree (or a ""peace -treaty""), the amount of stateless people in Europe it all caused. I knew how it has affected Germany, but did not pay sufficient attention how it has affected the rest of Europe. (And I am even not talking about the Middle East here). I would not go into the details of her arguments here. But I will add a few lengthy excepts from the book to demonstrate her style and to show the density and sophistication of her arguments.The read that unfortunately hasn't lost its relevance at all since it was written. ""…it is this pseudomysticism that is the stamp of bureaucracy when it becomes a form of government. Since the people it dominates never really know why something is happening, and a rational interpretation of laws does not exist, there remains only one thing that counts, the brutal naked event itself. What happens to one then becomes subject to an interpretation whose possibilities are endless, unlimited by reason and unhampered by knowledge. Within the framework of such endless interpretative speculation, so characteristic of all branches of Russian pre-revolutionary literature, the whole texture of life and world assume a mysterious secrecy and depth. There is a dangerous charm in this aura because of its seemingly inexhaustible richness; interpretation of suffering has a much larger range than that of action for the former goes on in the inwardness of the soul and releases all the possibilities of human imagination, whereas the latter is constantly checked, and possibly led into absurdity, by outward consequence and controllable experience. One of the most glaring differences between the old-fashioned rule by bureaucracy and the up-to-date totalitarian brand is that Russia’s and Austria’s pre-war rulers were content with an idle radiance of power and, satisfied to control its outward destinies, left the whole inner life of the soul intact. Totalitarian bureaucracy, with a more complete understanding of the meaning of absolute power, intruded upon the private individual and his inner life with equal brutality. The result of this radical efficiency has been that the inner spontaneity of people under its rule was killed along with their social and political activities, so that the merely political sterility under the older bureaucracies was followed by total sterility under totalitarian rule. The age which saw the rise of the pan-movements, however, was still happily ignorant of total sterilization. On the contrary, to an innocent observer (as most Westerners were) the so-called Eastern soul appeared to be incomparably richer, its psychology more profound, its literature more meaningful than that of the ‘shallow’ Western democracies.  This psychological and literary adventure into the ‘depths’ of suffering did not come to pass in Austria-Hungary because its literature was mainly German-language literature in general. Instead of inspiring profound humbug, Austrian bureaucracy rather caused its greatest modern writer to become the humorist and critic of the whole matter. Franz Kafka knew well enough the superstition of fate which possesses people who live under the perpetual rule of accidents, the inevitable tendency to read a special superhuman meaning into happenings whose rational significance is beyond the knowledge and understanding of the concerned. He was well aware of the weird attractiveness of such peoples, their melancholy and beautifully sad folk tales which seemed so superior to the lighter and brighter literature of more fortunate peoples. He exposed the pride in necessity as such, even the necessity of evil, and the nauseating conceit which identifies evil and misfortune with destiny. The miracle is only that he could do this in a world in which the main elements of this atmosphere were not fully articulated; he trusted his great powers of imagination to draw all the necessary conclusions and, as it were, to complete what reality had somehow neglected to bring into full focus (p 320)""""Their equality is an equality of rights only, that is, an equality of human purpose; yet behind this equality of human purpose lies, according to Jewish-Christian tradition, another equality, expressed in the concept of one common origin beyond human history, human nature, and human purpose – the common origin in the mythical, unidentifiable Man who alone is God’s creation. This divine origin is the metaphysical concept on which the political equality of purpose may be based, the purpose of establishing mankind on earth. Nineteenth-century positivism and progressivism perverted this purpose of human equality when they set out to demonstrate what cannot be demonstrated, namely, that men are equal by nature and different only by history and circumstances, so that they can be equalized not by rights, but by circumstances and education. Nationalism and its concept of a ‘national mission’ perverted the national concept of mankind as a family of nations into a hierarchical structure where differences of history and organization were misinterpreted as differences between men, residing in natural origin. Racism, which denied the common origin of man and repudiated the common purpose of establishing humanity, introduced the concept of the divine origin of one people as contrasted with all others, thereby covering the temporary and changeable product of human endeavor with a pseudomystical cloud of divine eternity and finality. This finality is what acts as the common denominator between the pan-movements’ philosophy and race concepts, and explains their inherent affinity in theoretical terms. Politically, it is not important whether God or nature is thought to be the origin of a people; in both cases, no matter how exalted the claim for one’s own people, peoples are transformed into animal species so that a Russian appears as different from a German as a wolf is from a fox. A ‘divine people’ lives in a world in which it is the born persecutor of all other weaker species, or the born victim of all other stronger species. Only the rules of the animal kingdom can possibly apply to its political destinies. The tribalism of the pan-movements with its concept of the ‘divine origin’ of one people owed part of its great appeal to its contempt for liberal individualism,fn40 the ideal of mankind and the dignity of man. No human dignity is left if the individual owes his value only to the fact that he happens to be born a German or a Russian; but there is, in its stead, a new coherence, a sense of mutual reliability among all members of the people which indeed was very apt to assuage the rightful apprehensions of modern men as to what might happen to them if, isolated individuals in an atomized society, they were not protected by sheer numbers and enforced uniform coherence. Similarly, the ‘belt of mixed populations,’ more exposed than other sections of Europe to the storms of history and less rooted in Western tradition, felt earlier than other European peoples the terror of the ideal of humanity and of the Judaeo-Christian faith in the common origin of man. They did not harbor any illusions about the ‘noble savage,’ because they knew something of the potentialities of evil without research into the habits of cannibals. The more peoples know about one another, the less they want to recognize other peoples as their equals, the more they recoil from the ideal of humanity. The appeal of tribal isolation and master race ambitions was partly due to an instinctive feeling that mankind, whether a religious or humanistic ideal, implies a common sharing of responsibility. The shrinking of geographic distances made this a political actuality of the first order.fn42 It also made idealistic talk about mankind and the dignity of man an affair of the past simply because all these fine and dreamlike notions, with their time-honored traditions, suddenly assumed a terrifying timeliness. Even insistence on the sinfulness of all men, of course absent from the phraseology of the liberal protagonists of ‘mankind,’ by no means suffices for an understanding of the fact – which the people understood only too well – that the idea of humanity, purged of all sentimentality, has the very serious consequence that in one form or another men must assume responsibility for all crimes committed by men, and that eventually all nations will be forced to answer for the evil committed by all others. Tribalism and racism are the very realistic, if very destructive, ways of escaping this predicament of common responsibility. Their metaphysical rootlessness, which matched so well the territorial uprootedness of the nationalities it first seized, was equally well suited to the needs of the shifting masses of modern cities and was therefore grasped at once by totalitarianism; even the fanatical adoption by the Bolsheviks of the greatest antinational doctrine, Marxism, was counteracted and Pan-Slav propaganda reintroduced in Soviet Russia because of the tremendous isolating value of these theories in themselves."" (P310)(the  bold is added above for empathises.""The inadequacy of the Peace Treaties has often been explained by the fact that the peacemakers belonged to a generation formed by experiences in the pre-war era, so that they never quite realized the full impact of the war whose peace they had to conclude. There is no better proof of this than their attempt to regulate the nationality problem in Eastern and Southern Europe through the establishment of nation-states and the introduction of minority treaties. If the wisdom of the extension of a form of government which even in countries with old and settled national tradition could not handle the new problems of world politics had become questionable, it was even more doubtful whether it could be imported into an area which lacked the very conditions for the rise of nation-states: homogeneity of population and rootedness in the soil. But to assume that nation-states could be established by the methods of the Peace Treaties was simply preposterous. Indeed: ‘One glance at the demographic map of Europe should be sufficient to show that the nation-state principle cannot be introduced into Eastern Europe.’fn3 The Treaties lumped together many peoples in single states, called some of them ‘state people’ and entrusted them with the government, silently assumed that others (such as the Slovaks in Czechoslovakia, or the Croats and Slovenes in Yugoslavia) were equal partners in the government, which of course they were not,fn4 and with equal arbitrariness created out of the remnant a third group of nationalities called ‘minorities,’ thereby adding to the many burdens of the new states the trouble of observing special regulations for part of the population."" (p352)""No paradox of contemporary politics is filled with a more poignant irony than the discrepancy between the efforts of well-meaning idealists who stubbornly insist on regarding as ‘inalienable’ those human rights, which are enjoyed only by citizens of the most prosperous and civilized countries, and the situation of the rightless themselves. Their situation has deteriorated just as stubbornly, until the internment camp – prior to the second World War the exception rather than the rule for the stateless – has become the routine solution for the problem of domicile of the ‘displaced persons.’ Even the terminology applied to the stateless has deteriorated. The term ‘stateless’ at least acknowledged the fact that these persons had lost the protection of their government and required international agreements for safeguarding their legal status. The postwar term ‘displaced persons’ was invented during the war for the express purpose of liquidating statelessness once and for all by ignoring its existence. Nonrecognition of statelessness always means repatriation, i.e., deportation to a country of origin, which either refuses to recognize the prospective repatriate as a citizen, or, on the contrary, urgently wants him back for punishment. (P 365)""""The greater the ratio of stateless and potentially stateless to the population at large – in prewar France it had reached 10 per cent of the total – the greater the danger of a gradual transformation into a police state. It goes without saying that the totalitarian regimes, where the police had risen to the peak of power, were especially eager to consolidate this power through the domination over vast groups of people, who, regardless of any offenses committed by individuals, found themselves anyway beyond the pale of the law.""""That the Nazis eventually met with so disgracefully little resistance from the police in the countries they occupied, and that they were able to organize terror as much as they did with the assistance of these local police forces, was due at least in part to the powerful position which the police had achieved over the years in their unrestricted and arbitrary domination of stateless and refugees.""(p 377)...more",Notes are private!,11,26,1,"Nov 20, 2023","Dec 16, 2023","Nov 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/396931.The_Origins_of_Totalitarianism

There is not much one could add to her unflinching and perfectly expressed position. The pity is that it was written 20 years ago and, if anything, her words seem sadly much more relevant.""Even in the era of cybermodels, what the mind feels like is still, as the ancients imagined it, an inner space – like a theatre – in which we picture, and it is these pictures that allow us to remember. The problem is not that people remember through photographs, but that they remember only the photographs. This remembering through photographs eclipses other forms of understanding, and remembering.""""Perhaps too much value is assigned to memory, not enough to thinking. Remembering is an ethical act, has ethical value in and of itself. Memory is, achingly, the only relation we can have with the dead. So the belief that remembering is an ethical act is deep in our natures as humans, who know we are going to die, and who mourn those who in the normal course of things die before us – grandparents, parents, teachers and older friends. Heartlessness and amnesia seem to go together. But history gives contradictory signals about the value of remembering in the much longer span of a collective history. There is simply too much injustice in the world. And too much remembering (of ancient grievances: Serbs, Irish) embitters. To make peace is to forget. To reconcile, it is necessary that memory be faulty and limited. If the goal is having some space in which to live one’s own life, then it is desirable that the account of specific injustices dissolve into a more general understanding that human beings everywhere do terrible things to one another.""""A stepped-up recognition of the monstrousness of the slave system that once existed, unquestioned by most, in the United States is a national project of recent decades that many Euro-Americans feel some tug of obligation to join. This ongoing project is a great achievement, a benchmark of civic virtue. The acknowledgment of the American use of disproportionate firepower in war (in violation of one of the cardinal laws of war) is very much not a national project. A museum devoted to the history of America’s wars that included the vicious war the United States fought against guerrillas in the Philippines from 1899 to 1902 (expertly excoriated by Mark Twain), and that fairly presented the arguments for and against using the atomic bomb in 1945 on the Japanese cities, with photographic evidence that showed what those weapons did, would be regarded – now more than ever – as a most unpatriotic endeavor.""""Compassion is an unstable emotion. It needs to be translated into action, or it withers. The question is what to do with the feelings that have been aroused, the knowledge that has been communicated. If one feels that there is nothing ‘we’ can do – but who is that ‘we’? – and nothing ‘they’ can do either – and who are ‘they’? – then one starts to get bored, cynical, apathetic. And it is not necessarily better to be moved. Sentimentality, notoriously, is entirely compatible with a taste for brutality and worse.People don’t become inured to what they are shown – if that’s the right way to describe what happens – because of the quantity of images dumped on them. It is passivity that dulls feeling. The states described as apathy, moral or emotional anesthesia, are full of feelings; the feelings are rage and frustration. But if we consider what emotions would be desirable, it seems too simple to elect sympathy. The imaginary proximity to the suffering inflicted on others that is granted by images suggests a link between the faraway sufferers – seen close-up on the television screen – and the privileged viewer that is simply untrue, that is yet one more mystification of our real relations to power. So far as we feel sympathy, we feel we are not accomplices to what caused the suffering. Our sympathy proclaims our innocence as well as our impotence. To that extent, it can be (for all our good intentions) an impertinent – if not an inappropriate – response. To set aside the sympathy we extend to others beset by war and murderous politics for a reflection on how our privileges are located on the same map as their suffering, and may – in ways we might prefer not to imagine – be linked to their suffering, as the wealth of some may imply the destitution of others, is a task for which the painful, stirring images supply only an initial spark.""""To speak of reality becoming a spectacle is a breathtaking provincialism. It universalizes the viewing habits of a small, educated population living in the rich part of the world, where news has been converted into entertainment – that mature style of viewing which is a prime acquisition of ‘the modern’, and a prerequisite for dismantling traditional forms of party-based politics that offer real disagreement and debate. It assumes that everyone is a spectator. It suggests, perversely, unseriously, that there is no real suffering in the world. But it is absurd to identify the world with those zones in the well-off countries where people have the dubious privilege of being spectators, or of declining to be spectators, of other people’s pain, just as it is absurd to generalize about the ability to respond to the sufferings of others on the basis of the mind-set of those consumers of news who know nothing at first hand about war and massive injustice and terror. There are hundreds of millions of television watchers who are far from inured to what they see on television. They do not have the luxury of patronizing reality.""...more",Notes are private!,6,24,1,"Nov 15, 2023","Nov 20, 2023","Nov 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52373.Regarding_the_Pain_of_Others

If it can it will be this novel. It has been at least a week since i’ve finished it but i still have these silent conversations in my head about it and hear the voices of its characters.Reading it was like having this almost physical sensation of something precious and gentle irrevocably slipping through your hands. Something you cannot quite firmly grasp and get hold off. But you are tangibly aware of its existence and that you might be losing it. In fact i’ve read the novel twice back to back: once purely for this sensation and the second time to come up with better idea what was actually happening between its covers. One thing I am totally sure of though: stylistically it is the most accomplished recent novel i’ve read for a long time.I wanted initially to come up with a single metaphor for this work: a Russian doll of stories? A hall of mirrors? A treasure chest? A curiosity museum? All of them might say something. But also they singlehandedly fall short. So i try to take it slowly.“Aliza had never liked endings. She thought they seemed artificial and false, unnecessary cuts in a flow that, like the colourful gorge they were now driving into, didn’t lead directly to any destination...”Aliza is the one of the main characters. And this book is that: stories without end, stories within the stories; stories beginning another stories; stories reverberating with each other like an echo between mountain gorges. This way of structuring the narrative is not unknown, especially in Latin America’s literature. But here it is so refined and done with such an economy. The novel is barely two hundred pages. Some characters appear literally for a half of page but leave a lasting presence. Far into the novel, Fonseca keeps introducing new layers. Half way through, I was wondering how he would be able close all the doors he has opened within the space left. But he succeeded; and not only that, he managed to introduce one more major character and major theme in the last fifty pages. And this is not all. I’ve read two previous novels by Fonseca. And he tends to bring different modes of writing into the whole. We are dealing with a manuscript, articles and a superb cryptic visual dictionary. Some pages from the dictionary were physically designed and presented in the book. It is very visually effective and adds additional poignancy to the story. It has reminded me something similar in Lost Children Archive in this respect. Also Fonseca seems to be fascinated with the idea of a museum either real or imaginary as a repository of objects that might have their own unique way of telling the story. This novel is not an exception: there is a museum containing audio recording of voices together with other physical and visual artefacts.And even that is not all. The novel also designed like a hall of mirrors. We are given a lot of hints in this respect. One character’s life is a “photographic negative’ of another; one manuscript is “the mirror image” of another; the project of one artist is reflected in the work of another. While reading the book, after a while you are inevitably aware and subconsciously start to search for the next “reflection”, to wonder where it would lead you next. And you are helped (or mislead) again by the mentioning of a “russian novel” where there was a set of peculiar toys. If one look of them, one would not make anything out of them. That is until one got hold of a mirror to see their reflections. This is especially apt as if Fonseca tells you to search for those reflections to be able to make some sense of the whole. It is disorienting in a good sense. The writing varies, changes its registers. Sometimes it slows down zooming into an image or a thought; sometimes it flows rapidly and carries you alone, almost struggling for a breath, like here:“They come in through the back right window, fly up to the vaulted ceiling of the palm roof, plunge down to the central table that is full to overflowing with architectural models, old magazines and photographic negatives, before passing along the sides of a room reminiscent of a forgotten laboratory, flanked as it is by two giant black blackboards on which are written, in impeccable handwriting, a dozen quotations that it would be good to read carefully right now, except that the sparrows, impatient and playful, return to their eager travels, soaring upwards and then flitting down to perch briefly on the floor covered in old newspapers, where coffee stains alternate with the droppings of those very birds that now fly back out through the window that saw them arrive, first flying over, in passing, a painting that hangs at the back of the room beside two identical black-and-white photographs of a village in ruins. Then, returning to its initial stillness, the space begins to take on a peculiar density that recalls the inside of a shipwreck, where time has been frozen for decades.”If i would have minor complaint about the style, i would say the dialogue was not very convincing but it was rarely used. Can you imagine this complexity working in a sleek and elegant novel of around 200 pages? But it does. In describing his style, Fonseca has quoted DeLillo who said that “writing is concentrated thinking”. The novel is packed but not overloaded with ideas from philosophy, art, history and anthropology.There is a plot, almost a mystery one might say. But i will not try describe it. This is also the novel that keeps its secrets pretty well. It lures you in, poses you with the questions and dilemmas, but never fully reveals the answers. Often the logic of the story suggests certain leads only to negate them later. When reading for the first time, i was attempting to understand that logic or, more accurately, i tried to apply my logic to its characters. And it did not work. Often it seemed impossible to come up with suggested motivations for some the characters and a logical interpretation what happened alluded me.But then i came across a character saying this:“No matter how much it told, even when the story seemed to bare itself the most and approach a truth, something in it withdrew. This isn’t about baring the secret, but about doing justice.”And I’ve understood then. The characters were not only “not baring” their secrets. On the contrary, they tended to “bury” them: they buried their secrets in each other texts, in the quotations from other writers or simply in the ground. But in this process they also revealed something about the human nature and “did justice” to something deep otherwise inexpressible with the words. This novel is not quite as hermetic like some of the work by Clarice Lispector. But it also strives to go beyond the language.On the other hand, this situation has reminded me a thought in the book I’ve recently read The Long Form that it was ok not to know everything about the characters. Even the writer does not necessary know more about them compared to what he has written between the covers. Sometimes, such “blind spots” (the term coined by Xavier Cercas) are left by the author for the reader to enrich the work with her own meaning.On the second reading, i’ve added one more realisation: this was a novel about quixotic struggles that bound to be defeated. A writer is fighting to complete her project while loosing ability to use language to aphasia. An anthropologist fights to preserve a disappearing language by trying to record its last speaker. That speaker struggles to reflect in his words the world that has already disappeared. A man creates a museum to preserve memory of the village sacked by genocide only to realise the majority of survivors want to move on from the tragedy. Another man who is sent on a journey is arriving at some destination only to find out that he is there for very different reasons. And like with the famous hidalgo, at first glance, many of those struggles seem unnecessary and eccentric, only later to be understood as being the most profound. Is defeat always equate to a failure? Or is it a struggle worth having in any case?There is one specific “defeat” strikingly conveyed in this book which has affected me the most. Imagine you are given a box with a thing inside. Let’s call it a beetle. But no-one can see your beetle apart from you. Everyone has got a similar box. But you are not allowed to see each other beetles. You can talk about them of course. But there is no way you can insure you talk about the same thing. That is apart from the case if you agree as a group what you mean by a word “beetle”. This is a thought experiment by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. So when we refer to that infamous beetle we refer “to the social act of imagining it, never to the beetle itself, which could very well not exist.”He made this argument in order reject the possibility of existence of the “private language”. And one could say: who cares whether something so abstract as a private language is logically possible? But now - imagine it is not a beetle anymore. It is pain.What does all of this story imply is that a human being can never fully express her pain, not through the language at least. One can’t share it with the others. Maybe that is the reason why being under emotional or physical stress often feels so alienating, lonely and misunderstood. But even more shockingly it also implies one cannot fully understand the pain of others either.Somewhere in the novel Fonseca brings up painting The Fall of Icarus by Pieter Brueghel and the related poem Musee des Beaux Artsby WH Auden where Icarus falling to his death while “the world continued blindly on its way, indifferent to other people’s suffering.”Rilke has made even a broader observation that haunted me since my youth:  “Ultimately, and precisely in the deepest and most important matters, we are unspeakably alone; and many things must happen, many things must go right, a whole constellation of events must be fulfilled, for one human being to successfully advise or help another.” But looking at this phrase now, it feels somehow more hopeful than a story about the beetle and the story of Icarus. In any attempt to understand the other, in any attempt to help, one faces this looming possibility of misunderstanding; the possibility of defeat. But does it imply we should give up trying, especially if “the whole constellation of favourable events” are still theoretically possible.One character of this novel acknowledges his limitations in these struggle:“he recognised himself in that you, ignorant and useless, incapable of crossing the border that separated his own pain from others...No matter how hard he tried, he would never be capable of shaking off that feeling of falsehood and hypocrisy.” Sounds familiar? It certainly does to me. Another character, Aliza, was braver but eventually she came to the conclusion that her photographs of the tragic events she witnessed would be useless. “But somehow I felt that the world was already full of images, and the photos would not be enough to do justice to what I’d seen. I took the rolls and gave them to a distant cousin in the city and told myself that from that day on, I would only write, like someone searching for the caption of an impossible photograph.”Generally, “the caption for an impossible photograph” is such a wonderful way of describing the writing process. But it is even more apt in this context. Later in her life, after experiencing war zones, Susan Sontag thought that the images might be useful to “haunt"" us. However, she insisted that the captions and longer narratives are more important as they made people slow down and think.So does language ever work in this situations? I came out with intuition from this novel that Fonseca believes it does. “language only worked if someone dared to cross that border (between his own suffering and someone else).” The possibility of defeat is very likely; however one should keep trying. There is no other option opened to us.Moreover, after seeing his friend’s fierce struggle with making her final piece of literary art, Fonseca’s character comes up with one more hope:""Literature was precisely what arose when language foundered.”This magically echos Simone Weil’s voice who wrote in the one of her last essay: “And it sometimes happens that a fragment of inexpresable truth is reflected in the words which although they cannot hold the truth that inspired them, have nevertheless so perfect a formal correspondence with it that every mind seeking that truth finds support in them. Whenever this happens a gleam of beauty illuminates the words.”------------------------------I would not be able to appreciate this novel if not for the absolutely gorgeous translation by Megan McDowell who translated all Fonseca’s novels.Reading list. It has become a recent fashion, at least I’ve noticed that the writers of fiction provide a reference of the works of others they’ve consulted at the back of their novel. Fonseca’s work is erudite and highly intertextual. However, he does not come up such attached notes and justifiably so. It might be an additional enjoyment for the reader to register (sometimes even to search for the relevant references). But i could not resist the urge to compile a small list myself. I was not diligent enough so it is not an exhaustible list.

Although gruesome in parts, it was hilariously funny in parts. Under all the playfulness, the book comments on very serious, sometimes grave social issues. It also successfully submerges its reader into the turbulent atmosphere of the mid-last century, especially the 5os and 60s. However, unfortunately it has kind of imploded under its own bulk. Pale Fire is a clear inspiration. And for those of us who has read it, it might seem kind of clear were it was all going. But it would not be a problem per se. The problem for me was that such an elegant conceit would not withstand the amount of material and plot twists Milward tried to pack into it.

For ages, I planed to read his The Delighted States which is still on my shelf unopened; and this novel has jumped the queue. But now i hope it won’t be long until I've got to that book.“The Future Future” is labeled a historical novel. However, it is far from what is normally categorised in this way. It is certainly inspired by a real episode predating the French revolution. But other than that it is quite a bit “wilder” than what this genre is known for. This book is shamelessly anachronistic in its language, sometimes demonstratively and absurdly counterfactual and ""quirky"" in a good sense of the word. It does not limit itself to the past. It even contains a cameo trip to the moon (a nod to Jules Verne?). I suspect it would puzzle the lovers the genre. In fact i’ve read this book back to back with Man-Eating Typewriter where the actions take place in the late 60s of the previous century. Both novel deal with history and an ability to envisage an utopia, the future to some extent; both are the works of experimental fiction. However, I caught myself thinking that “the Typewriter” was more focused on reflecting the atmosphere of its period compared to this one.If I would attempt to categorise it, I would call it “systems novel with a light touch”. Systems novels are normally associated with the works attempting to connect seemingly unconnected phenomena, times or places and reveal new patterns in the complex reality. I think that what Thirlwell is doing here: the scope of the novel is a globe; the timeframe: the future in the same way as the past, but arguably the most it is about the present; interconnectedness is the essence of the book. However, the “light touch” is because while talking about challenging ideas, Thirlwell, does not overburden the book with the scientific jargon or eager to demonstrate the evidence his potentially extensive research. In fact, the writing style of the novel is almost conversational. I was thinking: ""that is how you would tell a story to a precocious child"". And that helps him to get to the core of the ideas he cares about without unnecessary destructions. The writing seems almost deceptively simple, but in reality it is just very lucid, clear; and a pleasure to read. The novel is written from a female perspective. This is by itself is a rarity in our times when a male author dares to write purely from the female point of view. From the first pages, we are introduced to Celine, a very young lady of means in the 18th century Paris. The majority of ideas and observations in the book are presented through her eyes. We also meet with a number of her friends, some of them are real historical figures. I was pleased that the time frame of the novel was not narrowly defined. But at minimum, it was spanning Celine’s lifetime. A lot of recent experimental fiction i’ve read takes a form of an interior monologue lasting a day or so. This is not one of them. And it was refreshing to read a novel still attempting an individual subjectivity, but keeping a wide time span as well. As it sometimes happens, the best description of this novel’s ambition is actually within the text:“Beaumarchais was telling her all the time that he wanted a different kind of writing. All the scripts and novels he was seeing were the same. There must be more to life, said the cats and dogs of every village in every story – all of them keen to get to the neighbouring village, in which there would just be other cats and dogs lamenting that there must be more to life. It needed a bigger perspective. For instance, said Beaumarchais, he still did not understand how the universe began. There was no space and then there was space. Did this not seem a logical impossibility? And until a work could include this, he was not sure it was worth writing at all.”This novel indeed attempts a big scale of questions. Again, I find it refreshing in the current literary scene and worth encouraging. It even includes an attempt at suggesting a cosmology of universe, even if more poetic than convincing. By the way, the aforementioned Beaumarchais was very real 18th century dramatist and a diplomate or a fixer of some standing. The starting premise of this novel stems from Thirlwell’s observation that “graphomania” has penetrated all layers of contemporary society. His views are summarised in his article in the Guardian. According to him, everyone is a “writer” now. It is a “universal syndrome”. But the language that is dominating public sphere is of a very peculiar kind: it “is designed to provoke the most luridly moral emotions, such as contempt or self-congratulation.” It leads to polarisation and inability to have a minimal discussion. The language has been weaponised in many cases.Thirlwell notes the historical parallel: the 18th century pre-Revolutionary France. Something similar was taking place there. They did not have our technology, but apparently they’ve managed just fine to face a similar problem. Coincidently, his impression is confirmed by another article I was reading that quoted Louis-Sébastien Mercier’s Tableau de Paris writing in 1789:“Everyone wants to be an author or reader. Even the coachman reads the latest work on his perch. Every person down to domestic servants and water carriers is involved in the debating,”Some example of this radical writing were directed against the upper class women basically slurring and revealing the fictional “secrets” of their sexual life. Celine, Thirlwell’s protagonist is one of these women. But they have found the way of resisting using language. They did not use the same kind of hate speech and slur though. They did not try to denounce their tormentors directly or reject the accusations. Instead they’ve created separate networks of communications and played with the forms of linguistic expressions that were not “violent and brutal” but “tender media for the production of pleasure and more friendship”. In short, according to Thirlwell, they resisted with different types of discourse and linguistic forms. With hindsight, maybe they were not mega-successful, i have to add. But at least they’ve acted.Thirlwell’s diagnosis of the modern malady might not be not very original. But his historical parallel and the idea of resistance is interesting. It seems, that this novel might constitute an act of such linguistic resistance for our times. Inevitably considering her situation, Celine experiences are related to language. She is trying to understand what is the link between this world created by language and the real one: “At any moment, it turned out, the old world could disappear entirely and become little digital strings of symbols, vanishing into the white air”.She, and Thirlwell through her, poses even wider philosophical question: what is our experience of the world before it turns out in a linguistic expression or communication? She is not very impressed:“It’s really terrible how language modifies the world, she was thinking. So much of what’s important in a life happens incredibly rarely, sometimes only once, and therefore it’s distressing how quickly language has to take it over, our experience, and make it neater and more regular and less abstractly splurged.”It made me think: can we at all convey this unique experience without words? Is art, music, gesture occasionally is a better expressive medium? On the other hand, it has reminded me of Joan Didion’s The White Album where she talks about human tendency to make a smooth narrative out of sequential but potentially unrelated events. This is especially acute in the cases when such narratives help to justify one’s action, or the lack of it, or it helps to avoid facing certain facts. Famous: “We tell ourselves stories in order to live”, more specifically: to keep going as per usual, but to justify to ourselves why; to make ourselves look better in our own eyes; to obtain some meaning and move on. Didion expands:“We interpret what we see, select the most workable of the multiple choices. We live entirely, especially if we are writers, by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the “ideas” with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria which is our actual experience.”“Especially if we are writers”. But everyone is a writer in Celine’s world, and in ours as well, according to Thirlwell. Celine further observes “everyone wrote to each other every day, as if an experience were not an experience until it had acquired its own image in words”.Still with all this writing, we hardly possess a suitable language to imagine the future. Not what happens in a month or a day but “alien and incommunicable future, future” as one character calls it in the novel.It might be a scary thing considering what we know about our present. Probably it was a scary stuff for Celine as well. But it does not have to be. Maybe this is another message Thirlwell wants to convey. Maybe by trying hard at imagining better future we would make it nearer or at least have a word in shaping it. Celine certainly does try. And though I did not find her imaginings and her Moon’s dream, very original or very convincing I enjoyed her trying.Recently, a  by the one of my friends here on GR has drawn my attention to a phenomenon called “ontological turn in anthropology”. I've never heard of it before and i was intrigued. It turned out to be quite complex theory to define in a few worlds. But it is worth trying, bear with me.Traditionally, the anthropologists assume that there is a single object of study (ontologically - the natural world) but every group (of people) has got a different perspective on this single world. These perspectives were traditionally called “culture”. So cultural differences in this traditional view assume that there is such a phenomenon as “common humanity”, the integral part of this natural world. However, now there is a significant support for an anthropological theory that there is no such thing like the single natural world. According to this theory, there are many natural worlds instead. So as far as i understand this, a culture as perspective on one world is too narrow and won’t help us here. Instead, we need to endeavour to reconceptualise the object of our study, perhaps, another natural world, on its own terms. It might sound like just a play of words. But it is not apparently. This article Ontological turn provides a fabulous example how to grapple with this:“If you imagine multiculturalism in diagrammatic form as a circle of viewpoints from differing perspectives onto the same central object, multinaturalism would look the same, only the labels would be inverted: one central viewpoint onto multiple different objects. The point is perhaps best encapsulated in an anecdote from Levi-Strauss: when the Spanish were debating, at a series of now-infamous debates at Valladolid in the sixteenth century, whether or not Amerindians were human on the basis of whether or not they possessed souls, the inhabitants of the Antilles were drowning captured Spanish soldiers in order to answer the very same question, only their concern was whether or not the Spanish had bodies like them, or if they were ghosts.”In summary, traditional thinking was: many worldviews (or cultures), only one world. “The ontological turn, instead, proposes that worlds, as well as worldviews, may vary.” (a quote from the same article).It takes time to get one’s head around this. But I've decided to talk about it here as i’ve noticed that some writers seemingly incorporate those ideas into their work. I think i can feel the presence of this theory in this novel. It seems, Thirlwell probes this idea and attempts to reveal the presence of those different “natural worlds” in various conceptual settings. For example, this passage: The third legend of Toussaint was that he was simply monstrous. All of them were legends about a person who was ignored, or unknown, by what was assumed to be the world. ...A legend is a story about the way no world ever realises that it’s surrounded by another world, until it is too late.There are many such attempts to imagine these “other worlds” in the novel: the unknown ones, the imaginary ones or sadly - the destroyed by colonialism in different forms and irrevocably disappeared ones as a result. At one point, Celine interacts with the indigenous tribes in America; in another - she is on the Moon. Incidentally, Toussaint L’Ouverture, another historical personage appearing in the novel, was a former slave who has lead the Haitian revolution in the 18th century.In anthropology, the “ontological turn” attracts both strong proponents and strong critics. I am not in the position to judge the robustness of the theory, but it certainly forms the basis for interesting thought-provoking literature. Another tendency i’ve noticed, possibly under the influence of anthropology as well, that some writers are trying to write of human history in the context of much bigger narrative: the natural history, the power, the impermanency and complexity of it. For example, in this book: “All history including the history of words it turned out was really natural history.” In his last two novels, Carlos Fonseca, another talented contemporary writer, addresses a similar theme. For example, in Natural History, a character plans to write “a novel about the history of fire: a novel where fire was the true protagonist, a novel that would start with the chemical equation of combustion and then spread over all the continents and all the ages, a novel that would cross history like a field in flames.”In this book, Thirlwell picks up forrest in a similar role. A forrest grows and matures with Celine. In the forrest she first hears “the voices” that to become the key elements of Thirlwell’s cosmology in this novel: “The universe is a collection of voices that can echo each other and talk.” Forrest is also where (or how) the novel ends. In my view, Thirlwell has achieved something quite special here. He has managed to make a protagonist our of this forrest without visibly anthropomorphising it.Generally, it seems the “ontological turn” has spilled of anthropology and started to percolate a wider discourse. Respectively, another implication of this brings usinevitably back to language, or rather to the limits of human understanding of another human. In the same article i brought up above, there is a following illustration:“If your interlocutor tells you that the tree she is pointing to is in fact a spirit, do you, for example, describe this as a belief? You might, but to your interlocutor it is not of course any such thing: to her, it is a fact.” It reminded me a wonderful piece of fiction I’ve read recently Study for Obedience. In that novel, a protagonist faced the accusation that her dog has impregnated someone’s else dog even though he was surgically neutered:“What I knew about Bert’s sterility was a veterinary fact, perhaps even a biological one, but I acknowledged that this was only one way of seeing things. The woman had, doubtless, her own worldview, one that was evidently incompatible with mine but no less true, according to its own internal rules.”In the first situation with the tree (i hope no-one would find me ignorant for referring to it that way), “a “recursive” anthropologist, would ask what sort of adjustments to our conceptual schema have to be made in order for it to make sense to think of the tree as a spirit.” (as per the article). But the second situation with the dogs makes me feel a bit “stalemated” and a bit sad. I am not sure i would be able to go all the way to make “necessary adjustments” to my “conceptual schema” to meet this person even half way in her version of the dog-truth. Neither would she. But we should have to manage to live together in a society somehow. In case the “ontological turn” appeared to be correct, I personally would greatly miss an assumption that there is something that called “common humanity”. Or did we use to refer to this as “common human values”? Who are those ""we"" in any case?.. But still my ideal is that those old ""common values"" do exist. But then reluctantly, under the growing evidence of the contrary in the world around me, i seem to move away from that ideal.One would still hope together with another Thirlwell’s character, Izabela, that “truth could be made on this chaotic planet, even if it was always made of falsehoods.” And i believe but “truth made of falsehoods” Izabela meant the power of art, including literature._______________A few of many passages/ideas I liked:about conversations:""...inside true conversations there was always a moment when a voice emerged that belonged to none of the people who were in the conversation but was the voice of the conversation itself, and when that happened it was like a little lamp switched on, spreading warm light in a limited space. Other people thought of this as a god emerging or speaking through a person but Celine did not think like that. It was the voice of the conversation, she thought, that belonged to everyone and to no one and to let it emerge and give it space was maybe the most important thing you could do.""On America and politics there:""To only have a small vocabulary had a strange effect on reading, as if these articles or reports she was reading were hinting at a mystery that those who spoke the language more fluently might never notice. It was apparent that people here feared many things, they feared people from the North and East and West and South, they feared the black population, the people from the islands or those who had escaped from slavery in the South, they feared the Mohawks and the Sioux, and in reaction to this fear they seemed to propose a total violence against the people who made them afraid, which didn’t seem rational to Celine or in any way likeable, even though the people who thought these things could also, as she knew, be very caring and attentive in different ways.""Relevant and new:The Revolutionary Temper: Paris, 1748-1789...more",Notes are private!,15,40,1,"Oct 30, 2023","Nov 13, 2023","Oct 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63274130-the-future-future

And i knew i wanted to read anything she writes next. But that was before I’ve read Septology. Now, when Lori&Joe came out, it has found me in my post-Fossian reading period. (Or whatever adjective they'd attach to Fosse as they'd need one soon). Anyway, this sequence of events has definitely affected my reading experience of this novel. For the first half of the book, i felt really conflicted about the text. I felt Arnold’s style of writing was too close to the one i remembered from “Septology”:She’s got time, she thinks, before the sun comes up over the fell, yes, she’s got a bit of time, although she can feel it, the earth, slowly turning eastwards and well, no, she won’t go back inside just yet, she’ll stay here in the yard and watch the sun come up from behind the fell, yes, this is what she really wants to do, she thinks, and she lifts her arms, she spreads her arms and she sees that her arms hold so much more than this one fell, that, yes, she’s cradling the whole line of fells, from south to north, as far as Thorn-thwaite Crag, and further, she thinks, and she stretches and stretches and she sees that the darkness has almost left, she sees the fell fall inside another light and she understands how restless it is, yes, this feeling, something tightening then slackening, a huge thing, Lori thinks.Those tidal waves of repeating and modifying words, incantational rhyme so pertinent to Fosse’s prose and even the “verbal ticks” like “yes” and “she thinks” are all present here. ""The infamous tyranny of influence"", I thought. (Who has actually come up with this term? Harold Bloom? I will have to look it up later). However, the apparent metaphysical dimension and Fosse's game of mirrors with identities or something that would replace those elements were lacking in this book. So i often found myself distracted from what was actually here by such comparisons. However, when i’ve actually settled and have started to follow Arnold’s character, the text has come out on its own: uniquely throbbing and trembling. Unexpectedly, it reminded me of a protagonist in The Outsider by Albert Camus when the lack of his visible emotional reaction during his mother’s funeral and the related disapproval by the public arguably cost him life. Like Camus’s story, this novel made me think how unique is each experience of grief. How free it should be from a gaze by anyone else, especially the judgement of any group. This novel also made me think how much of a devastating drama is hidden in each quiet life...And she thinks, not tears now and she feels them pushing inside her head and she thinks, all day they’ve been threatening, ever since she stopped on the bridleway and looked up at the sky.

Maybe it was a rhetorical gift?:Hadn’t I been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together? That was not the point. The point was in his being a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that stood out preeminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence, was his ability to talk, his words—the gift of expression, the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness.But the language and the character of Marlow is both impressive and memorable:This simply because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see—you understand.

Respectively, I was looking forward to more of her work. It has come in a shape of this self-referential “The Long Form”. In my view, this novel is a logical continuation of ""This Little Art"", only more ambitious in scope. In the essay, Briggs was preoccupied with the translation as an art and a social phenomena - “thinking on reading, writing and living with the works of others” (from its blurb). This work tackles a similar area but a novel as a form has replaced translation as a focus of her investigation. Again, Briggs’s main interest, it seems, is co-existence, sharing a certain space and time. The co-existence in the broadest form: the interactions between human beings within these spacial and temporal limits or the interactions between a human and an a book, a “container” of other humans’ wisdom; or indeed - any object. She is very much interested how these interactive spaces are structured. And this has created the opportunity for an analogy between the structure of a novel, relationship between its different elements and a relationship between a mother and a new baby for obvious reasons situated in a shared space and time. “The principles of aesthetic composition extending and repeating – or were they prefiguring and re-grounding – the principles of social composition. The layout of a room. The form of a book. A novel: a source of suggestion (detailed speculation) as to how – in what kinds of real or invented spaces, and under what rhythmic conditions – it might be possible for live creatures, with their ages and energies and competing authorities, their interests and their needs, to co-exist, to live together.”If it is sounds complicated, it is. However, Briggs helps her readers by constructing a working space on her own for this investigation. She models her work on The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling by Henry Fielding. Similarly to ""Tom Jones"", the text is structured into relatively short, creatively named chapters intermingling mini-essays with the parts of a longer narrative. The majority of the essays are devoted to the different aspects of the theory of a novel; while the narrative is a day from life of Helen and Rose, new mother and her baby with all its routines, and highs, and lows. But also there are flashbacks into Helen’s prior life, her best-friendship, Rose’s birth and the pregnancy. The recursive loop is closed when on the day we spend with Helen she is actually starting to read “Tom Jones” (when Rose allows her to do so). It is a daring and peculiar organism of a book. I’ve learned a lot from the essayistic part. Briggs went through enormous research and read substantial volume of criticism in narratology from Bakhtin and E M Foster to much more contemporary writers (all referenced and explained in the last 20 pages of the book). I couldn't help but feel that i save a lot of time by reading her book rather than all this vastness of primary analysis myself. She touches upon many interesting theoretical issues. For example, the role of the names of the characters or the usefulness of certain steady expressions which are often called “cliches”: “eyes sparkled” or rain (‘pitter-patter’)”. She comes to the conclusion:“it’s what familiarity with these phrasings (their patterns and their pictures) allows us collectively to feel: let’s meet in the commonplace. Say it this way and there’s a chance I’ll know how you feel”.Incidentally, I recently was reading The Melancholy of Resistance where the author is actually playing with this feature. He deliberately indicates these phrasings in his characters’ speech by “quotation marks”. Not unlike Briggs, he conveys their usefulness for effective communication. But unlike Briggs he also shows how this delivers the power to manipulate with people thoughts and intentions. I find this discussion fascinating and deserving more time by itself. But I raised it here just to illustrate the variety of literary arguments in this book. Also she introduced me to some professional voices writing on baby’s early development and care. Having been through the experience of having a baby (albeit only once), I’ve never heard of Donald Winnicott, for example. And there is apparently a whole theory how one is supposed to hold a baby! A bit too late for me on this one.Compared to the essays, I was a little less enthused by the mother-baby part. Through this hyperreal narrative, Briggs is conveying the minute details of this unique experience: being a new first-time mother and also being a new baby in this world. Reading it made me think that this search for the ways of the new co-exiting is not unlike a dance of two new partners who are not able to communicate otherwise. I think the baby’s perspective was actually quite strong feature here. A 6 weeks baby does not let one to be too creative in her depiction - she does what babies are good at: cries, eats, sleeps or does not sleep. And it should be very difficult to convey her interiority without too much speculation. But Briggs has just about managed to reveal something unique about this particular baby. Helen’s experience on the other hand was too relatable for me to be engaged on the page. It might sound paradoxical, but I was hoping Briggs would manage to defamiliarise it enough for me to see a new side of this experience. But Helen’s day sounded painfully familiar to me: sleepless night, crying in the park while baby is finally asleep and no-one can see you; open doors to the showers and loos not to leave the baby alone. Baby’s constant, unconditional and unpredictable demand on my time, all of it - yes. And even a moment that might be considered a gentle culmination of the narrative in “A little chapter, in which is contained a very great incident” was easily anticipatable from the beginning as soon as i’ve realised that the baby is 6 weeks old. One remembers those milestones long time one does not need them anymore. Strangely, this part of the book has reminded me the second instalment A Man in Love of “My struggle”, the famous autofiction by Knausgaard. In that instalment it was an episode when he took care of his two small children. It might seem the most unlikely comparison: this one is totally fictional narrative while “My struggle” is auto fictional; here we have a mum while it was a dad there; tea getting cold here; coffee and cigarets there. But the hyperreal level of details, the depiction of the very loving, but by default a bit unpredictable, a bit dysfunctional and very demanding relationship validates the comparison. In general i wonder how the people without children would read this part. I think they might find it more revealing and effective than i did. However, another similarity that, in spite of this familiarity, at the end I found “The Long Form” quite addictive reading experience, both in terms of profundity and density of essays and the poignancy of predictable routines with the baby.Needless to say, I’ve enjoyed the novel. I also cannot wait to find out which literary genre Briggs would investigate next. I only wish for this work that together with the structure Briggs also inherited from “Tom Jones” its playfulness and maybe even bring a bit of humour. When she does play (like with the chapters’ headings or in an episode when Helen is crashing on E. M. Foster’s lecture) it works brilliantly. Also spending a day with a small baby in a small apartment without a bit of self-deprecating laugh might be too hard even with a good novel in hand. A few Quotes:""On the contrary, what these patches say is this: that what the novel narrates (what it writes) is precisely all it knows. This – gapped and roving – is the fullness of what it knows. A form of knowledge not assignable to a given subject (for example – the narrator), because it is contingent upon, which is to say it is produced by, the interplay of the whole composition. Its intention may always be to intend more than its own limit-views. But that expansion will happen with the reader, the other mind in the different environment it was written for, with which it is intended to interact.""""Reading Fielding’s essay on contrast, Robert L. Chibka shows how the composite form repeatedly rephrases and unsettles the question: Which is the more authoritative? Which is the more essential – the most powerful and important? Which of the parts, really, can be skipped over, and dismissed? Background or foreground? Day or night? Essay (thesis) or narration (fiction)? Large general statements or the smaller situated actions? Supporter or supported – Helen or Rose? When the point is: they are all so sensitive to each other. They have been conceived and set in relation to each other. They have been made to turn about each other. To think about and redescribe each other. When they live in such proximity to each other. In the same living space, if not always in exactly the same rooms.""""The part-novel, the novel-essay, its compound-form based on the conviction that: ‘There is never any problem, ever, which can be confined within a single framework.’""...more",Notes are private!,22,38,1,"Oct 16, 2023","Oct 31, 2023","Oct 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61889841-the-long-form

I cannot agree with many conclusions she is making or the program of actions she comes up with. But there is a lot to take from this essay. I’ve made a lot of highlights on GR while reading it. Her view on personality, and what now we call “identity” is almost a Buddhist one. As far as I understood she considers it not essential to our humanity; and almost harmful for science and politics. She considers that inside of all of us there is the same something that ask “why I got hurt?”. But equally does not matter how many times a human being got hurt he expect not to be hurt next time. And this is the core. That is a very primitive summary of her argument. They essay is rich, multidimensional and beautiful as well. This is my favourite almost metaphysical passage about the language’s (usually very limited) ability to reach truth and beauty:""And it sometimes happens that a fragment of inexpresable truth is reflected in the words which although that cannot hold the truth that inspired them, have nevertheless so perfect a formal correspondence with it that every mind seeking that truth finds support in them.

I do not read a lot of the recently published fiction as I agree with Martin Amis that “it’s just an uneconomical way of dividing your reading time”. However, in my very limited sample I’ve noticed certain patterns in recent “experimental” works. These patterns might be totally determined by my subjective selection of course. But it seems, the fashion of pure autofiction and fictionalised biographies is fading. It has been replaced by a number of more daring and generally more interesting forms. Those forms by itself are not necessary that new. In fact they’ve been used for centuries. But they are still a rare drop in a sea of traditionally told plot or character driven driven “stories”. And it is refreshing to see the younger authors trying to play with something more challenging than that.The one these forms is a fragmentary text comprising mini-essays, research notes, poems in prose and personal memories mixed in, centred on a certain theme, place or even another work of literature. The recent examples I’ve read:, The Baudelaire FractalOut of the Sugar Factory After Sappho]. In these works, the relationships between the fragments are often more important that any single fragment. And the reader is actively engaged establishing these links. Another modification of this is a fragmentary oral history, factual or a counter-factual. The examples: Kick the Latch, ROAR: American Master, The Oral Biography of Roger Orr, Osebol). A different form is a book-length interior monologue of the main character who is often (but not always) the narrator as well (and not always a reliable one). The text would be focused on a relatively short period of time be it an hour, a duration of a journey, or possibly - a season or a year at maximum. The text would be structured into two levels. The one would be a framing narrative that positions the narrator inside the external world. While thinking, often the narrator would be travelling, walking, smoking or doing something similarly monotonous. So this activity would serve as a skeleton of the whole novel and periodically would anchor the narrator’s thoughts. In other cases, this framing narrative would be some simple situation or a rudimentary but atmospheric plot. But the main core of such works is the second level - the narrator’s interiority. The beauty of this form is that the narrator is free to digress on any theme, observe, travel the memory lane or express opinions without the author’s obligation to labour some artificial plot to incorporate all of this. Respectively, the variety of these thoughts are a welcome and the coherence is not an overwhelming requirement. Another distinguishing feature of these works is that the reader is bound by a single perspective of the narrator. This could be a unique experience, but could be boring depending on one’s connection with the narrator’s voice and her preoccupations. It seems a whole plethora of the novels like this were recently published. A few from the ones I’ve read: Panthers and the Museum of Fire and Wall, A Passage North, The Logos.""Study for obedience"" is an addition to this list. The book is exactly what the title says - a study. The author conducts her study of obedience as a concept; what does it mean to be obedient and which consequences it might bear. But she does it through the eyes of her character, the unnamed woman who is also the narrator and very likely the unreliable one. It is unclear whether the woman just remembers her past year or she is writing some report about it. I would think the second is more likely due to her style of expressing herself. The main pleasure of reading this book was that it was written in a long, elliptical and beautifully crafted sentences. There is no dialogue, not even much of reported speech. But though this statement is technically true, it cannot be further from reality: the text is full of dialogue with other texts, other authors and very likely - with the readers as well.The framing narrative in this case: the woman moves in into a small town in a strange country to live with her recently divorced brother. The dynamics of this relationship is obscure by design. But she seems to be initially satisfied to be his companion and almost a servant. He seems to be relatively assimilated in the place. While she is clearly alienating the locals. Strange accidents with domestic animals and the pets coincide with her arrival. Might that be the reason for their hostile reaction to her presence. Or is it deeper in a mythology of the place and her origins? The brother is absent on business for the big chunk of the book while she is familiarising herself with surrounding nature and people. This external framing creates almost gothic atmosphere or a timelessness of a fable. The core of the text is her interior abstract thoughts and ideas, perceptions and observations. She of course is puzzled by her situation, but apart from this, she thinks about many different things. And it took me long time to figure how to focus my  without basically repeating a half of the book. (I am not sure I’ve actually succeeded in this btw). Two epigraphs to the work have eventually helped me.The one of the epigraphs is taken from Malina and it is about language. The narrator (very likely - the author as well) is seriously preoccupied with the notion of language, its functions and its limitations. Through her eyes, we observe an illustration how effective mastery of language could be an instrument of power in a society. Her brother is very vocal both in their native language and in the local lingo. It is evident he uses this to exercise his influence, to persuade, to impose his will on the others. “My brother knew how to interpret, to impute, to notate, knew in other words how to wield power. ""She, in contrast, being very articulate in her thoughts, seem to unable to exercise any power in communication and uses the language only in a way prescribed by others. She also cannot master the local language at all. So it is much easier for the locals to ignore her or the worse. It is symbolic that while the narrative progresses the situation seems to be getting reversed in parallel with changes in power dynamics: her ability to express herself whether with language or otherwise seem to be growing while her brother linguistic powers seem to fade. He first act of “disobedience”, even if subconscious, has also taken place through the use of language. Her job was to transcribe the audio recording into the text. I cannot restrain myself from quoting at length as the passage is very elegant. She comments with such a cerebral wit on the subject of business style of writing. The one that nips any creativity in the bud: “Up to then, writing had been an exercise in fidelity: transcribing exactly what I heard within the parameters of a strict grammatical framework. Semicolons were to be used sparingly and to separate two independent clauses joined by a conjunctive adverb or else to separate items in a list where those items themselves contained commas. All other uses were to be avoided. Such was the house style. I had prided myself on a well-placed comma, a clarifying colon. It had always been a delight to me to take the vocalisations of my colleagues and organise them according to the immutable laws of grammar, turn them into the purest, most crystalline utterances. And yet, and gradually, my adherence to these rules dropped off. I became more interested in the sound of my colleagues’ sentences, the shape of their words, the occasional and probably unintended sibilance, the repetitions and elisions, the hesitations or pauses where the grammar did not mandate them. I found new ways to mark these idiosyncrasies, making use of space on the page. It seemed to me a truer notation of the language than how I had proceeded up to that point.”So her first act of disobedience is actually an attempt to deviate from the standard, to find the truer language through empty spaces on a pages. In other words, to give more weight to the pauses, to silence as a way of expression.The narrator also thinks about any language’s ability to express truth. The most memorable illustration of this potential impossibility is an episode when a local woman blames the narrator’s dog, Bert, for the pregnancy of her dog. But Bert is in fact snipped. However:“What I knew about Bert’s sterility was a veterinary fact, perhaps even a biological one, but I acknowledged that this was only one way of seeing things. The woman had, doubtless, her own worldview, one that was evidently incompatible with mine but no less true, according to its own internal rules.”I think we all nowadays can relate to the piercing absurdity of this situation while two incompatible “world views” make the notion of truth close to meaningless and the language to express it - powerless. How would you explain a biological fact to a person who does not consider science as a valid proof?There is a theory about language that it has evolved as a tool of persuasion rather than a tool for distinguishing true and false. This book is about it: Language vs. Reality: Why Language Is Good for Lawyers and Bad for Scientists. Language allows to create narratives which often simply connect certain assertions in a convenient way or allow some “inconvenient” events simply to be dropped and forgotten. The resulting narrative does not suffer from the omission, in fact it often improves and it becomes much tidier. A narrative is often used both individually and by a collective in order to create a certain, more palatable picture. In this book, the narrator experiences the result on her own skin. Apart from being a stranger, she is also a Jew, many of her people perished in this land in the past:“My presence violated some crucial and unspoken rule, which I thought now had to do with narrative, the right of a people to preserve the stories they told about themselves and their own history. My silence was a reproach to them, something pressing at the edges of their consciousness, a terrible knowledge they did not want to own and which I made them look at day after day. In silence, yes, for words have more than once led us away from truth.”These people needed the stories: “stories one told oneself in order to live, to go on living with oneself, knowing what one was capable of, knowing the things one had witnessed, the things one had done.” This echoes a well-known phrase by Joan Didion.In seems, on one hand, a language makes life more palatable; but on the other hand, the same language helps to obfuscate something essential, the truth. The narratives are overrated, “words have more then once lead us away from the truth”, so the narrator is often choosing silence. I am not sure whether it is an act of resistance; very likely - not. But it is an act of disobedience by default.I also admired how the narrator has started to doubt other nuggets of acquired, previously unquestionable “wisdom”: “It’s true, I thought, ...that imagination may be a moral faculty, as some writers have maintained, but how to understand its workings? ...If imagination was to be understood primarily in terms of morality, I needed to know how to cultivate it, I needed to understand the terms and structures of goodness and its pursuit. (in another part: “I wanted to be good in the terrible world.”) ...the charge of a lack of imagination was one I took seriously. Had I not spent my life imagining myself in the shoes of the other?”Such questioning has made this work very engaging for me as a reader. I’ve almost screamed: “you are confusing imagination with empathy”; and “i do not believe imagination is moral otherwise all artists would be saints and the art would never be used to inspire evil acts.”The second epigraph is by Paula Rego: “I can make women stronger. I can make them obedient and murderous at the same time.”. It is interesting to speculate whether this is a message on behalf of the author or the narrator. I would prefer the former as creates another meta-fictional layer. The narrator, in my view is not quite there to become both at the same time: murderous and obedient.The analysis of obedience as a concept is quite nuanced. Also it allows the narrator to observe many connected phenomena like historical memory, surviver’s guilt and power dynamics. Sometimes, the narrator feels her obedience is rewarded. But those moments are fleeting. Predominantly, the narrator comes to the conclusion that obedience often borderlines complicity; and meekness or deference are “the swiftest route to one’s own eradication”. I find the two brilliant passages below almost ruthless in their effectiveness:“...meekness brings out the sadist in people, the atavistic desire to bite at the heels of the runt of the litter. As one writer put it, it’s not the meek who inherit the earth. The meek get kicked in the teeth.”“As I cycled across town, to the dump, to the farm, as I cycled back up the hill to my brother’s house, I thought often about life and its chance encounters, the inexorable question of complicity, about how not one of us could claim to be innocent any longer. I thought that naivety, though it had long proven useful in protecting one from facing facts more squarely than it suited, was more inexcusable, more repugnant than ever. No more padding between the word and the world. I read once that ours was a century of half measures, and I thought even then that nothing could be further from the truth. Every single one of us on this ruined earth exhibited a perfect obedience to our local forces of gravity, daily choosing the path of least resistance, which while entirely and understandably human was at the same time the most barbaric, the most abominable course of action. So, listen. I am not blameless. I played my part.”Interesting that in The Need for Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties towards Mankind Simone Weil, (in the list of references to this text) considered obedience as a necessary condition of coherence of a society. She defined obedience as the consent given by an individual to be governed by someone else. This side does not to seem to be resurfaced in this book.To conclude, in my favourite essay “Intertextual irony and levels of reading”, Umberto Eco specifies 4 qualities of a novel: 1) meta-fictional - a commentary of the text on itself; 2) double-coding - at least two possible levels of reading; 3) dialogism - dialogues with other texts; 4) intertextual irony - it is a concept, similar to dialogism, but more subtle - the reference to another text is either not obvious or ironic. The text would make sense without it, but the experience of reading is enriched by it. Since i’ve read the essay, i’ve somehow adopted this list as a kind of a personal checklist of qualities i like in a novel.Needless to say, this one worked for me. All four elements were seamlessly there making my reading a rewarding experience. I cannot resist sharing an example of “intertextual irony”. The narrator’s brother made her read Montaigne at the morning. (This particular example resonates as, like the narrator, I also try to read some Montaigne on some mornings with a mixed record of success:-):“As I struggled through Montaigne each morning, I felt the greatness of his intellect, its expansiveness, and, in spite of this, and truth be told, I felt slightly ashamed on his behalf. Was it that I felt, instinctively, that it was improper to use one’s mind in public, in so public a way? Was it, in the final analysis, a disgraceful, even obscene thing to think out loud, still worse to have one’s thoughts outlive oneself, to travel through the centuries in no straight line, surviving only because of the vagaries of taste, the accidents of translation, to make it through so much only to end up in the hands of some person like me, so ill equipped to receive them?”I found this passage not only witty but also quite funny in terms of her perception of Montaigne. It is ironic of course as this novel does a similar thing to Montaigne - a study of a concept through someone’s subjectivity and knowledge. Moreover, he paid quite significant attention to obedience in particular. I’ve counted 47 mentions of this notion across his different essays.The last chapter was the only part of the novel that left me a bit underwhelmed. I am not quite sure what the author wanted to achieve by it. It seems she was looking for a resolution for her framing plot or for a culmination of the absurdity of the situation of her narrator. But i personally did not find it convincing or necessary. The fact that the narrator has made a very stylised speech and starts to use an academic jargon such as “adjection” and “structures” was a bit puzzling as it went against the perceived absence of the common language with the villagers. The eloquence of the speech, though a wonderful exercise in style did not add anything new for me. Was silence supposed to be a better weapon?I also wish the narrator act more decisively or “murderously” in the sense of Rego’s phrase. That is, if the author’s intention was to get gothic elements of the plot from the background to the main stage. However, these reservations about the last chapter have not spoiled the pleasure of reading and thinking about this book: this might also be obvious from the length of this !...more",Notes are private!,4,49,1,"Aug 23, 2023","Aug 31, 2023","Aug 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123636870-study-for-obedience

I’ve read it probably 5 times in total in three different translations which made my experience a meta fictioGorgeous, difficult and rewarding essay. I’ve read it probably 5 times in total in three different translations which made my experience a meta fictional journey - reading in translation about translation- in its true sense.There are so much layers in this essay. It would require a proper essay on its own to touch upon its insights. Even more interestingly, to talk a bit how Benjamin uses the language in conversation about the language. In one word - beautifully if a little cryptic. I wish I had time to expand on this. But for now, maybe as a preparation, I just leave the excepts here which I liked the most. Also I leave a separate quote from Nabokov that I find relevant:Nabokov:I know more than I can express in words, and the little I can express would not have been expressed, had I not known more.”And Benjamin about the same: “The language is not only the communication of the communicable. It is at the same time a symbol of what is impossible to communicate.” Excepts:“Certainly not in the similarity between works of literature or words. Rather, all suprahistorical kinship of languages rests in the intention underlying each language as a whole – an intention, however, which no single language can attain by itself but which is realized only by the totality of their intentions supplementing each other: pure language.these languages supplement one another in their intentions.The words Brot and pain ‘intend’ the same object, but the modes of this intention are not the same. It is owing to these modes that the word Brot means something different to a German than the word pain to a Frenchman, that these words are not interchangeable for them, that, in fact, they strive to exclude each other. As to the intended object, however, the two words mean the very same thing.Translation keeps putting the hallowed growth of languages to the test: How far removed is their hidden meaning from revelation, how close can it be brought by the knowledge of this remoteness?The task of the translator consists in finding that intended effect [Intention] upon the language into which he is translating which produces in it the echo of the original.Unlike a work of literature, translation does not find itself in the centre of the language forest but on the outside facing the wooded ridge; it calls into it without entering, aiming at that single spot where the echo is able to give, in its own language, the reverberation of the work in the alien one.For the great motif of integrating many tongues into one true language is at work. This language is one in which the independent sentences, works of literature, critical judgments, will never communicate – for they remain dependent on translation; but in it the languages themselves, supplemented and reconciled in their mode of signification, harmonize. If there is such a thing as a language of truth, the tensionless and even silent depository of the ultimate truth which all thought strives for, then this language of truth is – the true language….. concealed in concentrated fashion in translations.Meaning is served far better – and literature and language far worse – by the unrestrained licence of bad translators. Of necessity, therefore, the demand for literalness, whose justification is obvious, whose legitimate ground is quite obscure, must be understood in a more meaningful context. Fragments of a vessel which are to be glued together must match one another in the smallest details, although they need not be like one another. In the same way a translation, instead of resembling the meaning of the original, must lovingly and in detail incorporate the original’s mode of signification, thus making both the original and the translation recognizable as fragments of a greater language, just as fragments are part of a vessel. For this very reason translation must in large measure refrain from wanting to communicate something, from rendering the sense, and in this the original is important to it only insofar as it has already relieved the translator and his translation of the effort of assembling and expressing what is to be conveyed.Therefore it is not the highest praise of a translation, particularly in the age of its origin, to say that it reads as if it had originally been written in that language.real translation is transparent; it does not cover the original, does not block its light, but allows the pure language, as though reinforced by its own medium, to shine upon the original all the more fully.It is the task of the translator to release in his own language that pure language which is under the spell of another, to liberate the language imprisoned in a work in his re-creation of that work.And what of the sense in its importance for the relationship between translation and original? A simile may help here. Just as a tangent touches a circle lightly and at but one point, with this touch rather than with the point setting the law according to which it is to continue on its straight path to infinity, a translation touches the original lightly and only at the infinitely small point of the sense, thereupon pursuing its own course according to the laws of fidelity in the freedom of linguistic flux.He must expand and deepen his language by means of the foreign language.Pannwitz writes: ‘Our translations, even the best ones, proceed from a wrong premise. They want to turn Hindi, Greek, English into German instead of turning German into Hindi, Greek, English. Our translators have a far greater reverence for the usage of their own language than for the spirit of the foreign works. … The basic error of the translator is that he preserves the state in which his own language happens to be instead of allowing his language to be powerfully affected by the foreign tongue. Particularly when translating from a language very remote from his own he must go back to the primal elements of language itself and penetrate to the point where work, image, and tone converge.The higher the level of a work, the more does it remain translatable even if its meaning is touched upon only fleetingly.For this very reason Hölderlin’s translations in particular are subject to the enormous danger inherent in all translations: the gates of a language thus expanded and modified may slam shut and enclose the translator with silence. Hölderlin’s translations from Sophocles were his last work;For to some degree all great texts contain their potential translation between the lines.”...more",Notes are private!,1,30,1,"May 06, 2023","May 31, 2023","May 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30110783-the-task-of-the-translator

Why doesn’t he hide it from me? Everything is a mystery, such a deep mystery … I feel the fragility of things in time. From the bottom of my heart, I feel we should cling to nothing. Everything slips through our fingers. All that we seek to hold on to dissolves. Everything vanishes, like mist and dreams … Time is a strange thing. When we don’t need it, it is nothing.

He is a brilliant stylist. I wish I was able to read his work in original. But even in translation, his constant experiment with style is shining through. It is another case when assigning any rating to such a work might be totally misleading. Reading this novel, especially the first part of it, requires patience and perseverance. So I would guess not many people would find a way to enjoy it. And it is a shame. It has reminded me my struggles with the later novels by Henry James. But in both cases it was a very rewarding experience at the end. Shimoni is very different from James in terms of his experiments. While James was more interested in the architecture of his sentences, Shimoni plays with the structure of the whole text, how different parts of it come together; even how these parts look on the page, mixing fonts; but also the interiority of his characters, mixing narative voices. The book consist of three parts. More exactly they are three pieces of the work under one roof: a novel, a novella and a fable. They are not connected in terms of the plot or even the style of writing. There is a thematic connection transcending all three parts. In very general terms, it is all about the process of creating a work of art: a short film, a painting, a sculpture. The works barely figure itself in the book, they are never actually finished. But the process does figure and how this process interacts and contrasts with the life ""right out there"". The first part, ""The Lamp"", is the longest and it was the the hardest to get through. I would call it a big Israel novel in a sense we use it for a big American novel. It is a sort of state of the nation novel but seen through the eyes of the ordinary people. And I think it was hard for me as I did not have a context to add to the situation. A film crew is gathered on an army base in the desert to shoot a short film for the army. Some of them are in the active service and some of them in reserve. There are eight people together. And the main part of the text is actually eight interior monologues of these characters. Shimoni uses (brackets) to indicate these monologues within the rest of the text. if you take away all this bracketed text, you would end up with probably 10% of the initial volume of this part of the novel. Their thoughts are more like memories, flashbacks and sometimes trivia that I not related to the current shoot. It is a very disorientating and enriching experience to follow all those different voices. Again I think in Hebrew those voices are probably even more distinctive in terms of language. Apart from the brackets, Shimoni also uses different fonts for different cameo appearances. There is also a framing narrative, a sort of miserable detective having his last chance. There is much more worth discussing in this part. But I will stop here as I would need a lot of time, skill and effort to present the complexity of what he does there. I just leave you with the piece of gorgeous writing (this is a memory from the interior monologue of a man who, after the breakdown of his marriage, has escaped to an island in the South Pacific):""...before completing even one step, he slipped on a broken branch and fell. From the ground onto which he was thrown he saw before him a minute hollow filed with smooth pure water, in which blue sky was reflected with the white of a cloud, and a mosquito landed on it: with absolute clarity he saw its slender heartwarming legs standing on the water left by the storm, indenting the purity of the cloud with minuscule delicate indentations, and he cried.""The second part under ""the roof"", ""The Drawer"", has simply won my heart. A young art student in Paris with a newly broken heart needs to deliver a project on imitating a renaissance painting. (Sorry for too many ""hearts"" in two sentences). He picks up Lamentation of Christ by Mantegna. To stage it, he employs three clochards for a few bottles of wine and a prostitute to help him getting into a hospital morgue at night where he wants to paint. What follows is extremely moving and breathtakingly told story. The style is very different from ""The Lamp"". The main perspective is the second singular ""you"". It works brilliantly here. But the key to this narrative is a rapid shift between the perspectives and the voices often within the sentence. With this technique, he reminded me Jon Fosse or Lobo Antunes. ""You"" still possesses the interiority. The rest of the characters are dealt with through dialogues and the longer exterior monologues - they just tell stories about themselves to each other. They all have a very distinctive voices. And the stories - they are so moving. There is so much loneliness and longing; dignity, faith, fate and broken dreams in them. And this constant shift between the narrative voices adds even more poignancy. For example, there is an episode when the clochard posing as Christ tells the story about a muslim holy man being exiled by the French, who was not allowed to pray on a board of the ship:""On the deck of that ship, moving further away from the coast of Africa,  the way you both moved further away from the city, from its streets and from its avenues, from its cafes in which you no longer sat with her and from its cinemas and apartment blocks in which men and women still made love and the vapour of their breath misted the windowpanes, on the deck filled with soldiers the holy man was forbidden to pray. ""So what did he do, he asked to be lowered to the water so that he could pray from there, from the water."" And the French on the boat, which you could not picture, neither the decks nor the cabins, without the damp floral wallpaper and a night lamp casting a honey colour on naked skin, all mocked the Arab and didn't even aim their rifles at him.I put in ""bold"" the narrative stream from the perspective of ""you"" so it is easier to see how Shimoni weaves two streams together in this passage. The whole text works in a similar way.There is also the ending... In one word, this novella was a jewell on its own as well as within the whole big book. I would argue it is possible to read it independently from the rest of the book. In fact it has been published in French translation as a stand alone novel : Les Figurants. Had I possess more time and skill, I would compare it with Septology. Maybe it would be a project after a potential re-read of both books.I need to mention the third part ""The Throne"" . It is a very short fable written in an form of a scholarly article. It makes one think what is more important an actual artefact that remains or an idea of its conception. It is probably even more profound than that. But after ""the Drawer"" my mental bandwidth could not quite take it all. The poetic and devastating effect of the previous piece has slightly overshadowed it for me, unjustifiably so.Ok. It was supposed to be a short .

Therefore, there are a lot of ink being spilt writing about this book. I will just briefly comment on some of my personal impressions without getting into philosophy or the ""big picture"". I've greatly enjoyed the economy of Camus's prose and his ability to conjure so much with with so few words. It made me think again about the power of language in terms of framing the beliefs, convictions and ideas. I am not talking about Camus here, though of course it applies to him as well. But here specifically I am talking about the language in the court. Rhetorics literally has the power to deprive a person of his life. Mersault effectively receives his condemnation not so much for his murder, but for his perceived lack of empathy during his mother's funeral as presented by the prosecutor. Another point related to this is how deep certain preconceptions on expressing feelings are imbedded within a society. How they penetrate and ritualise inherently very private painful spheres such as grief; create expectations and destroy authenticity. When I was reading the novella, I was thinking that the only person who presented the facts coldly and objectively in the story was Mersault himself. It is intentionally so of course, but it did not make it less striking how detailed, relevant and accurate his observations were. At the same time this clarity did not give him any insights into his motivations. In general by the standard of our modern sensibilities, doesn't he come across as a neuro-divergent person? I thought it would be an interesting angle to consider. That of course would not justify anything that he did or didn't do.And the last thing: how vivid are those moment of joy and sadness when they are depicted through such a distorted but unsentimental perspective....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Mar 27, 2023","Mar 27, 2023","Mar 27, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15686.The_Outsider

This is my one book.Knowing this, it is difficult to think of “Melancholy” separately from the other three books. And I’ve read only Satantango yet. This one is an important and very distinctive improvisation on a theme within a bigger piece. It also seems to me, that this theme is entropy, the tendency to disorder in all its manifestations: the physical, biological and social as well as a possibility of resistance to it or the lack of such possibility. In this book, the nature of this entropy is presented more like a force beyond human control. In Santatango it was more about the fight of good and evil. I look forward to the next two books to see where Krasznahorkai would take this. Maybe because of that, I found this novel little less emotionally charged compared to Satantango (though it still contains a several very poignant moments). However without the doubts, this work is literary more crafty, philosophically more sophisticated and definitely more brutal in terms of exposing the weaknesses of human nature. I also found both novels were funny, mercilessly satiric. It seems maybe with one exception, Krasznahorkai does not spare his characters from his dark laugh.In terms of ideas it is essentially a 19th century novel. I thought Dostoyevsky’s The Possessed was a strong inspiration. The plot, as thin as it is here, is almost identical: a possible conspiracy is covertly instigating the mob towards destructive actions. The civil society mainly represented by petite bourgeoisie and toothless liberal intellectuals is ineffectual and pathetic against violence; so “a strong hand”, boosted by the conspiracy ends up snatching the power. All of this leads to the universal question what is good and does it stand a chance against such an evil? So what is Krasznahorkai’s contribution to this debate? What is new? Maybe, and only maybe he wants to show that chaos is neither good nor bad. It does not care about us. Maybe he wants to shift the emphasis from good vs bad towards order vs chaos. I am not sure. But the novel has definitely provoked me to think once again about all these binaries. I am not even sure whether he is truly so pessimistic as some of his characters. He might be. He certainly goes into depth analysing the relevant thinking through their eyes. Alternatively, he might be satirising this pessimism in the same manner he is mocking fake intellectual profundity, material aspirations or other human flaws. And he certainly does not underestimate the power of brutality.In any case, the main thing he is an artist. And one would not refuse him the power, the craft and imagination in bringing all these tensions closer the surface. This novel is first and foremost a very elegant work of literature. Krasznahorkai creates layers upon layers upon layers. And it is not only the length of sentences and the amount of clauses in them. It is also the whole architecture of the book. The core of the novel is the moments of epiphany of the two main characters on the background of the violent riot. This is the most dramatic and moving in one case and the most intellectually demanding in another part of the novel. It also contains an imbedded short text - the diary of a rioter. a few pages of the diary come across as an authentic document; as an absorbingly shocking factual evidence.This core is framed by two ruthlessly satirical narratives. At the centre of the first one is a petite bourgeoisie lady on a rough train journey; the second one at the end of the novel is told from the perspective of an emerging female dictator. She appears in the first narrative as well. I did not find her very convincing as a dictator. But maybe that was exactly the point. Lenin said that he would make a kitchen maid to govern the state. She might be the one of those. Both of these framing narratives are merciless in terms of their satirical impact. I found it almost absurdly funny. Even the violence in the first narrative and the funeral in the last were more grotesque than poignant or terrifying. It is a special skill by the author to produce such emotional dissonance. The conclusive chapter is an example of mixing very different linguistic styles for with a powerful, unexpected effect. The chapter is called Sermo Super Sepulchrum (from Latin: “A Speech over grave”). This speech is given by the female dictator and appears to be another short embedded text in the novel. In spite of the chapter’s title, this speech is far from a typical Roman eulogy in its eloquence. It is sad for all wrong reasons: it is plainly grotesque, full of cliches and euphemisms. It is also sad as being so grotesque it seems so realistic. The speaker ends this miserable performance with the statement that “the unchained workers of decay” would not be able to destroy “the real presence” of the departed in the memory of the living. Straight after that, the perspective is changed and it seems as an imaginary microphone is passed exactly to those “workers of decay” otherwise known as maggots. And the rest of the novel is written from their point of view while they commence their usual work, or more broadly, from the point of view of this faceless objective power that feeds “indifferent and unstoppable traffic between things”, the entropy.In this last bit, Krasznahorkai rightly does not attempt any zoomorphisms, personifications, metaphors or alike. On the contrary, he switches to the scientific language with impressive level of terminology pertinent to the related biological process; for example: “adenozintriphosphatase enzymes continued their assault on the central fortress of the general energy level, the ATP, and this resulted in the energy of the torn cell tissue..”. And this language, its cold objectivity somehow swallows all the narrative preceding it into the vortex it creates making this final scene counterintuitively the one of the most emotionally intense in the book. Symbolically, the language becomes performative as the novel resolves into itself in parallel with the body.Overall, this ability of Krasznahorkai to squeeze the most out of what a language is cable of is the strongest feature of this novel.He also investigates how a language plays a role in shaping a person’s worldview. How people thoughts often come almost prepackaged in phrases like ready made meals. It takes time for a certain new phenomena, ideas and actions to find their reflection in language, get polished in use like pebbles in the river and eventually appear as steady phrases or expressions internalised by many. They often become speech markers of a social group the person belongs to. With their help, people might recognise each other belonging to this group. In harmless way they become idioms. But more alarmingly, often these idioms often become stubbornly imbedded in our heads and stop us to think afresh. Naturally, people do not even notice how they use those phrases even introspectively. In the novel, Krasznahorkai deliberately indicates these phrases with ‘quotation marks’. He satirises their use of course, he shows how much these things play role in forming certain stereotypes and cliches. A petit bourgeois woman thinks of her fellow train travellers as “‘common peasants’ producing noise ‘so calculated to offend all one’s finer feelings’” but in her opinion this noise is “‘perfectly common among common people’ of munching and crunching”.A would-be dictator, the woman presumably of somewhat lower origins, is waxing lyrical about ‘the first and final notice of a victim in full realization of her rights’, ‘suffers from BO’, considers herself ‘eagled-eyed’ and uses a ‘trusty rat poison’.Here is probably the right time to pay a tribute to the translator of this novel. One need to be creative with all this idiomatic use.But the intellectuals are the worst. By definition, their language is more rich and metaphoric. They produce and utilise much more of those steady expressions. Sometimes they might be effective in persuasion. But often the resulting language obscures rather than reveals the reality it should reflect. And even more often it leads to passivity and lazy thinking by the speaker. Krasznahorkai mocks this mercilessly. He gives these words to the colonel addressing the ineffectual establishment of the town: “Because you don’t talk, you “whisper” or “expostulate”; you don’t walk down the street but “proceed feverishly”; you don’t enter a place but “cross its threshold”, you don’t feel cold or hot, but “find yourselves shivering” or “feeling the sweat pour down you”!””Apart from the obvious, I think he is getting at something even more profound. Since I’ve read this book, I’ve started noticing how often i use these phrases, concepts preconceived by someone else, even simple cliches in my head without really stopping to reflect how appropriate they are. On the one hand it is inevitable as this is how any language operates. But on another hand, doesn’t it kill the originality of thoughts, affects how one sees the reality and herself? It might also encourage biases and tribalism.But let’s come back to the core of this book. It is sort of a double epiphany by two main characters. The one of these characters is a retired intellectual, Eszter, and another one, Valuska, is seemingly a simpleton who, in spite of the surrounding decay, sees the world as a place of wonder and admires remote cosmos. Needless to say, he is rarely taken seriously, but used by everyone for chores, entertainment and help. From the beginning, these two characters are connected by a sort of friendship. However, when the riots start, they are in very different places both physically and emotionally. That night, simultaneously and independent from each other, they both experience the moments of revelation. “blind man suddenly able to see”Eszner’s interior monologue was the most difficult part of the book for me; it was a lot to take and it took a lot of time. It made me grapple with Eszter’s ideas and Krasznahorkai’s intentions of having Eszter experiencing this sort of epiphany in the middle of the chaos and decay. At the end, I think i’ve forgotten that i was dealing with a piece of fiction. It felt as if I was reading a work of existential philosophy. It is not surprising as in these twenty pages or so Eszter was trying to rethink all those main philosophical questions such as metaphysics - what is out there; the theory of mind - what is our mind for; plus some moral philosophy and politics: how should we live as human beings.I am still not sure how fruitful was this struggle of mine with his ideas. But after hours and hours of going through those long sentences I think I’ve understood enough. Eszter’s moment of revelation comes after he was trying to learn how to use a hammer. He realised that the less he thought about this process, the easier it became. This fact has appeared to be a trigger for his lengthy train of thoughts and has lead to the moment of his epiphany: ""nor could what he then felt be described as either disillusionment or wonder, it was more like being the recipient of a bequest, an acceptance of the fact that the nature of the vision far transcended him, a kind of patience, a kind of resignation to the will of the special grace which allowed him to comprehend only as much as he was capable of comprehending!”Effectively, he has had a moment of grace without believing in God which has lead to his newly developed scepticism about the role of human intelligence and reason. As a result, “he understood that there was nothing to be understood”. Eszter’s ideas were more nuanced than this last sentence. It seemed, in many respects, they echoed Kant and Hegel as well as some form of the evolutionary theory. More details and thoughts about this, Ive put under spoiler in the 2nd comment.Eventually, he has come to the conclusion to reject his previous ways to “of tireless questioning” and focus on “real” objects surrounding him and “steadfast love” instead of abstract concepts and the world of imagination:“...at that moment he had to recognize that his existence – hitherto based on the twin values of ‘intelligence and good taste’, on his so-called independent and clear thinking and on the ability of his spirit to soar, as he had always secretly believed, above the mundane – was not worth a fly’s fart: it was the moment he had to admit that nothing interested him any more but the steadfast love of his friend (Valuska).”I am not sure what to make out of this revelation. Intelligence complicates things; it does not bring happiness. Intelligent people indeed tend to focus on what Eszter calls “the significance of things”, the symbolic meaning rather than “things themselves”. We’ve discussed some of this earlier. Often it comes at the expense of something more concrete, more specific, more individual. It indeed complicate matters, it can be even harmful. It is true as well that human societies are organic and usually not created by someone’s personal intellectual design. But do these drawbacks and limits of the human intelligence make it so useless? Can they justify a form of social passivity? It is wonderful to realise the value in simplicity and the ability to accept another human being or a chair for that matter as “they are”. But does it go that far to imply that one should not actively use his mind to search for the reasons (rational or otherwise) why the plies of rubbish stay uncollected on the streets? And then use the same mind to try to find the way of making these streets clean?It could be just an attempt to rein in his previous intellectual vanity, but I think Eszner makes another mistake by trying to juxtapose the world of life “right here” with abstract imaginary world of the mind. I’ve recently read a few books by a wonderful writer, Gerard Murnane. And his worldview is much closer to me: for him both of these worlds are “real” - just two manifestations of the same whole. I am not sure to which extent i should take the character of Eszter as a representation of solid pessimistic argument against rationality. Could it be another example of subversive dark irony by Krasznahorkai. My intuition is that he himself is not that keen on Eszner. But I am not sure whom he is mocking more: Eszner in the past or post-epiphany Eszner, or the tragedy of both of them. a man who has lived his entire life with his eyes closedThe story of Valuska’s revelation is simpler but more cruel, raw and sad.Initially Valuska was full of wonder. He was convinced that the force “driving cosmos was ultimately joy” and somewhere out there there is “some secret core, a central point, not precisely a meaning but some kind of substance or mass, lighter, more delicate than a single breath”. He was telling it to anyone who would listen and that is exactly what so much enchanted Eszner. However he was of course mocked by the others. It did not stopped him though until the night of the riot. Krasznahorkai makes Valuska’s language the most eclectic. His speech and thoughts are full ‘quotation marks’ we’ve discussed earlier. It is as if he does not need his own language as anything really important to him he just simply sees. It cannot be verbalised. So he borrows those steady expressions, idioms and cliches from different people just for simple communication; to be understood. He does not even try to fully comprehend the meaning of the words as it would not add anything new to his precious knowledge. That is before the riot.But on the night he was dragged into participation in the bloody violence, even if in a relatively passive way. He has seen that brutal uncontrollable destructive power close enough, being borderline complacent in it. And that has transformed him. Can we call his revelation “an epiphany”? I think yes, even if what was “revealed” to him is so devastatingly sad. His thoughts has become like bullets:-“He ‘could now declare himself to be ‘just like the others’.”- “He ‘had learned to stand on his own two feet and understood everything’: he no longer believed the world was ‘an enchanted place’ for the only power that really existed was ‘that declared by force of arms’; and while he couldn’t deny that they had terrified him at first, he now felt himself capable of adjusting to their ways and was ‘grateful for the privilege of being offered a glance into their lives’.”-“There is a war going on out there, and it’s only worth waking to the dying night if you are prepared to be utterly ruthless”“You should imagine me, he would say, as a man who has lived his entire life with his eyes closed, and when I opened them, those millions of stars and planets, that universe of delight, simply disappeared.”That last bit of Valuska’s “awakening” mirrors the moment of Eszner’s opening his previously “closed” eyes. And it is deeply ironic as Eszner has just seen a glimpse of Valuska’s truth at the moment when it has disappeared for Valushka. In his turn, Valuska opens his eyes into the darkness and chaos. The darkness so well described to him but Eszner earlier but never comprehended by him before.In his thoughts, he also mirrors Eszner’s pessimism about the power of intelligence. But he goes further and, following Hume, rejects any possibility of predictive knowledge (or causation) :“it’s as pointless to predict as to judge, since even the words ‘chaos’ and ‘outcome’ are entirely redundant, there being nothing one can posit as their antitheses, which further implies that the very act of naming is enough to put paid to them, for ‘there is simply one damned thing after another’”At this point however, his voice stops in any way to resemble the voice of Valuska, the simple person, and start to resembles the bitter rumination of much more educated Bertrand Russell who said: ‘The law of causality … is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm.’ to be continued in the second comment under this ...more",Notes are private!,1,64,1,"Mar 22, 2023","Mar 31, 2023","Mar 22, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28488649-the-melancholy-of-resistance

We first meet Rugendas while he is crossing from Chile to Argentina through the mountains and pampas. However, a dramatic accident takes place and makes Rugendas to turn back. I do not want to go further into the plot. Let’s just say that physiognomy of nature, an idea spelled out by Humboldt as a method of seing the world, plays a cruel but ironic joke with Rugendas’s appearance and makes him to revaluate understanding of his art. Respectively, for us there is an obvious symbolism to unpack. On this level, the story reads like a mixture of an adventure novel with an essay by an art historian. It is pretty dramatic and stylish, but follows the logic of this type of an adventure story. I am convinced Aira uses this form of historical fiction to subvert it, not only in relation to the fact/fiction ratio but also to make fun over the naivety of this genre. Symptomatically, the degree of irony bordering absurd grows with degree of tension in the plot. At the end i was not even sure whether i am reading the “reality” of the story or some form of a hallucinatory dream by the one of its protagonists. In any case, that was exciting.This is just one level. On another level, i suspect the novel is an insight into the relationship between Humboldt’s aesthetic, the philosophy surrounding its development and later 20th century surrealism as well as the commentary on the nature of art and the process of its creation. And, on this level, I found this work a bit illusive. There were a several half-page passages which on the first reading were kind of very profound and enigmatic. Using the heavily overused phrase, it made me “deeply engage with the text”. On the second reading, I would start to think how much meaning i personally add into the text by reading it as opposed to Aira’s words. And sometimes, on the third reading, I would understand his thought but I would struggle to agree with his analogies.The example of my “struggle” is presented in the next few paragraphs, (and you can skip them unless you are interested in this peculiar puzzle of the book related to philosophic transgressions). Let’s look at this passage:The Germans continued with their work (sketching the raid by the Indians). New impressions of the raid replaced the old ones. Over the course of the day, there was a progression - though it remained incomplete- towards unmediated knowledge. It is important to remember that their point of departure was a particularly laborious kind of mediation. Humboldt’s procedure was in fact a system of mediations: physiognomic representation came between the artist and nature. Direct perception was eliminated by definition. And yet, at some point, the mediation had to give way, not so much by breaking down as by building up to the point where it became a world of its own, in whose signs it was possible to apprehend the world itself, in its primal nakedness. This is something that happens in everyday life, after all. When we strike the conversation, we are often trying to work out what our interlocutor is thinking. And it seems impossible to ascertain those thoughts except by a long series of inferences. What could be more closed off and mediated than someone else’s mental activity? And yet this activity is expressed in language, words resounding in air, simply waiting to be heard. We come up against the words, and before we know it, we are already emerging on the other side, grappling with the thought of another mind. Mutatis mutandis, the same thing happens with a painter and the visible world. It was happening to Rugendas what the world was saying was the world. I think i understand what Aira means in the first half of the passage: the painter is painting the world; and by this process he adds to the world as well - his person and his picture is the part of what this world is. Incidentally, in another book, I’ve come across the views of Schelling, a German idealistic philosopher and Humboldt’s contemporary. He believed that “the area of human life in which the highest self-awareness are reached, including the understanding of the essential oneness of human being with the rest of what is, is creative art. Thus the ultimate aim of existence of everything is realised in the creation of great art, and great artists are the incarnation of that part of total reality that reveals to itself the reasons for its own existence.” * This would chime nicely with the idea of the first part of the passage.However, I cannot fully appreciate the analogy between the painter and someone “grappling with the thought of another mind.” The thoughts of another mind in this example are necessary mediated by language. These are not “unmediated knowledge”. One can argue that the art of the painter would always be mediated by his sight as well of course. But even if we consider the sight providing the painter with “unmediated” knowledge, it would still not be comparable with the situation when the language is used for mediation between the two people. The situation when a person expresses his thoughts in language is closer to the one when a painter expresses his vision through his own painting.There is another way how to approach this analogy: if we assume that nature is silent for the painter like the person is silent for his interlocutor initially presenting an enigma. But then the person start talking; in a similar way, the nature opens up to the painter and he can see it more clearly over-sudden. At this case, the analogy would work. But it would not correspond to the accretion of art into the world: “a mediation gives way by building up to the point where it became the world itself”.This is how hard the certain Aira’s passages made me argue with myself (or was it with him?). Another and easier example: “Reality was becoming immediate like a novel.”. It is a very beautiful simile. But does it work when one describes a raid by Indians? Yes, it is subversive enough as one would expect reality in general more immediate than any novel. And yes, for some of us a novel could be more immediate. But only to the point until we want to refill our cup of tea. In combination, these two layers of the cinematic imagery with a “historical” plot and philosophic transgressions work together to create a subversive, colourful and masterfully told novella. But the one which probably still perplexes me with some of its philosophic passages. And I bet it perplexes me more than Aira himself who long has moved on to writing his other fictions.*A passage about Schelling is taken from Confessions of a Philosopher: A Personal Journey Through Western Philosophy from Plato to Popper....more",Notes are private!,5,43,1,"Mar 20, 2023","Mar 20, 2023","Mar 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/152809.An_Episode_in_the_Life_of_a_Landscape_Painter

They’re ­trying to get away from psychological individualism and to get at the way that complex systems – astrophysics, economics, climate, digital technology or what have you – interact to create the spaces in which individual lives (AKA the stuff of the old-fashioned novel) are lived. Where a traditional novel would typically major on a character’s memories, feelings and human relationships, a systems novel might be more interested in the character’s ­moment-by-moment perceptions of the sense-world around them and the way larger forces act on that world.""*I would not necessary agree that all of these novels lack a psychological depth, but we have to start somewhere with the definition. We talk here about the writers like Gaddis, Pynchon, Bolano, DFW, Helen deWitt. And I am always on a look out for a woman to add to this list. Last year, Tomb of Sand: WINNER OF THE INTERNATION BOOKER PRIZE 2022's got pretty close to this intersection of the novels (but in its very special gentle and exuberant way). So when I've seen this book nominated for the IB this year, I've decided I'll read it. It has also attracted my attention that it was about triplets. Twins, orphans and doppelgängers are well represented in fiction. While triplets used to be a rare fish. But I've recently listened with my family to the audio version of The Latecomer, a novel about upper-middle class Jewish family dynamics and in general a social commentary on modern America. We as a family enjoyed it greatly. The triplets were at the core of that story and it was psychologically astute and very moving at the end. So maybe subconsciously I was looking for some continuation of that story.After I've spent three paragraphs explaining my choice, I have to move on to a sort of anti-climax. I've read this book. It was an easy read. But it is not what I was looking for. Instead, it is a type of global commercial novel pushing a set of necessary buttons: -Take Big Themes: climate change, neuroscience, mental illness and trauma here; -Add Characters: neurotic, educated mid-twenties;-Add Settings (preferably more than one): a global city (London here) and an ""exotic"" location (Easter Island here but it practically does not mention any locals -only the colony of eco-tourists of a sort); -Add a bit of confusion, a possible conspiracy theory or a secret. That would make people turn the pages; -Pepper with a few culturally significant names, occasionally with a tragic fate but not necessary for a mix;-Add occasionally mysterious but more often simply convoluted dialogue with a lot of foreshadowing. And you might have something appealing to the ""broad global audience"". You might even get a streaming company to buy the rights eventually to produce a show. Who knows. Though I think as a show it might work marginally better. I am sure some people call this novel ""playful"" and ""quirky"". It is a well meaning and kind story even if not very plausible (who cares if it is ""playful""). I've had an impression the book aspired to some philosophical depth. But it comes across on the level that everything is connected to everything which is hardly a profound new thought, especially if it helped by the plot's numerous coincidences.

I've met him first when I've read the book based The Great Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy on those forecasts. I was astonished by the lucidity and clarity of his explanations and discussions with other philosophers. Unfortunately, I do not think of anyone of the similar statue who replaced him in our time. This book is his intellectual autobiography. It is a sheer delight to read. He talks about the big questions he grappled with since his childhood and how he came to philosophy to help him with those. He also talks about his discoveries of Kant and Schopenhauer, the two of his major influences. His discussion of Kant's philosophy is especially enlightening. He also talks at length about his friendships with Russel and Karl Popper. He tells anecdotes from their life as well and ideas of those two. He considers the perceived lack of status of Popper in the modern pantheon as very discouraging. In general, the book is another great excurse into philosophy, especially its state in the 20th century. But this time it is coloured by his subjectivity and great wit. He does not consider analytic philosophy and philosophy of language as the main way forward. He is convinced analytic philosophy does not pose questions fundamental enough. But equally he is not impressed by contemporary continental philosophy as lacking the rigour. At the time of his writing, the middle 90s, he was convinced that there was noone who would move our understanding of metaphysics significantly forward. But he was not very upset: there were 2000 years between Plato and Kant.Apart from philosophy, he was a big music lover. He especially loved Wagner and Mahler. He has written at least two books about Wagner, both of them are still in print.Reading this book felt like having a lengthy elucidating conversation with a very wise older person. Due to him, I think I finally have a wide-angle picture how different parts are connected in the Western philosophy.

After having read the first novel included into this book, i only knew one thing for sure: I wanted At first, reading Aira was a puzzling experience. After having read the first novel included into this book, i only knew one thing for sure: I wanted to sample more of his work. And after finishing five of them, I think I’ve finally created some overall impression. Aira’s books are very different from each other. Reading him is an exhilarating experience, but it might be a frustrating one as well. It feels sometimes like buying a lottery ticket (with a higher chance of a win though). However, the quality of a “win” is very high.He has developed “a procedure” of how he writes. He calls it ""Flight Forward"" ((fuga hacia adelante). In his novel “Birthday” he describes it as follows:“What has been written one day must be affirmed the next, not by going back to correct it (which is futile) but by pressing on, supplying the sense that was lacking by advancing resolutely. “In practice, he does not try to prioritise the overall internal coherence of his story. Instead everyday he adds incrementally to his novel in progress and goes into the direction, the work takes him. As a result, his novels are often a mixture of stories within the stories, surreal symbols, short philosophical digressions, meta-fictional or personal observations. Irony is the one of his best tools. Even in the middle of the most serious, dramatic episodes, i was never sure whether he meant it or he would pull a rabbit out of his hat in the next sentence. In any case, he has made me wondering how a text could be densely packed with ideas and relatively accessible and funny at the same time. The procedure” tends to deliver. However, “the procedure” is inherently prone to the game of chance. Also it is impossible to pay too much attention to the overall meaning of the work while one creates it in such a way. Therefore, these texts in many cases are wide open to interpretation, and it is up to the reader what to make out of them. They are also very different from each other in this sense. Some of them are more surreal, the others are more personal; some are even subversions of genre fiction such as a historical novel, for example.Nothing of course is new under the Sun. And I believe his approach to writing was strongly influenced by the avant-garde surrealism movement of the beginning of the 20th century. Breton came up with the procedure for creating visual art ""Surrealist automatism"": “method in which the artist suppresses conscious control over the making process, allowing the unconscious mind to have great sway.” (Wiki). In Aira’s case, “the procedure” is similar, though probably without the subconscious bit.In his essay “The New Writing” published in the “The White Review” Aira says:Constructivism, automatic writing, the ready-made, dodecaphonism, cut-ups, chance, indeterminacy: the great artists of the twentieth century are not those who created works, but those who created procedures through which works could be made alone, or indeed, not made. He went alone and created his procedure as well. This approach explains the quantity and variety of his output. I was reading an article another day and came across the expression  “spontaneity is kind of revelation"". I think this is exactly what i appreciate in Aira’s work.On the other hand, his novels have reminded me a form of traditional oral storytelling performed in style, however. Something akin ""1001 nights"" when each time the teller has to start a new story to keep going. The difference is though that Aira always manages to finish promptly if relatively unexpectedly.I think three novels included into this book is a good starting point into his oeuvre. I would stress again - they are different books. I would hardly believe they are written by the same author. Ghosts - It is a gentle subversion of the magical realism's tropes and of the social realism for that matter, that ends up in a quite a moving story. Power of imagination, architecture, family, emigration and dreams are all here in a mix on the top floor of a building still under construction.An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter - I gather it is considered Aira’s masterpiece. And, it is probably the most linearly told story I’ve read from him. But i’ve found it the hardest to understand. It is layered. And on the one level it can be read like a historical novel with another deeper layer is a commentary on the process of art creation. This second layer made me grapple with the novel. While the first was subversive, darkly funny romp. I plan to write a little separate  of it.The Literary Conference - subjectively, the least successful of the three in this book but the most humorous. He creates a moral fable using surreal tools driven into the fifth gear. However, the moral of this fable is too obvious and the symbolism a bit too crude even if colourful. My experience of reading Aira has created an impression that each of his novels is really a snapshot of his mind during the time of writing. I found it fascinating. But it also meant that reading just one of his novel would not be sufficient as putting those snapshots together is producing even more interesting unpredictable combinations just like in a kaleidoscope, but intellectually more appealing.PSAira's essay ""The New Writing"":https://www.thewhite.org/featur......more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Feb 19, 2023","Feb 27, 2023","Feb 19, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18343452-three-novels

When I read his novel I often have this Déjà vu effect: have I read this particular one before? But it is a good feeling. It is a bit like looking at an old photo and each time being able to pick up a new detail in the smudged and blurred parts that seemed to be totally ineligible before. I think that feeling is also very familiar to his protagonists. They often suddenly remember things from the past that they hardly could explain or put together. In other times they are desperately looking for some missing piece just to see how it slips away from their hands:""It's like in the morning when you try to recall your dream from the night before, but all that's left are scrapes that dissolve before you can put them together. I knew that woman in another life and I'm doing best to remember. Maybe someday I'll manage to break through that layer of silence and amnesia"".This book contains three novels. And all of them were delightful additions to my little box. I've got only a little insecurity related to the translation. Straightaway after this book, I've read an extended essay by Mark Polizzotti Sympathy for the Traitor: A Translation Manifesto on translation. Mark is Modiano's translator into English. And after reading the essay, I am not anymore sure whether I've read Modiano's novels or the novels by Mark closely inspired by Modiano. I realise that when I read a book in translation I read the text not written by the other, but by the translator. But still my intention generally to get an access to the author's thoughts, words etc as close as I can. There is of course the whole spectrum of opinions between fidelity vs beauty. Mark seems to be much closer to the beauty's side of things. I might pick this debate up if/when I write my thoughts about his essay. But here I will show how it was relevant. I wanted to write a point about the title of first novel in this book ""Afterimage"". It is a very poignant choice per se. Afterimage is a trace of the image when we close our eyes after looking at something vivid. I am not sure whether Mark was thinking about this particular effect of the word, the one I find the most exciting. But he writes in the intro:""Ultimately I decided to forgo the original (only the title I hope) altogether and concentrate on what this novella seemed most to be about: a retrospective attempt to see, an exercise in hindsight, an afterimage"".That is good, but the original title in French was ""Chien de printemps"" which as Mark has pointed out was totally forgone together with whatever connotation it might have created. There was a note about this. But then how many other images created by the author were replaced by the totally different images created by the translator? This is probably not the right place to discuss this issue at length, and I try not to doubt too much my faith in the translation. But it just reminded me again how good to know a lot of languages so one can read Modiano without such type of doubts. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Feb 10, 2023","Feb 27, 2023","Feb 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22859597-suspended-sentences

I did not know anything about the book. But Aug 9 is my birthday. So the motivation of getting it was a sort of vanity I guess. But I was so deeply moved when I understood what I've bought. Many years ago, Kathryn found a stranger's diary at an antique auction. The diary was written by an eighty-six old woman. After 15 years Kathryn worked with it arranging the text, maybe doing some edits. But she gave voice to that unknown elderly woman. What came out is like the most astute, the most poignant poetry. I set a few times to write a  of it. But it is just too immediate, to bare to pile more words on it.

Horse raising plays a very significant role in his work and his life. I do not know anything about horse raising at all. So when I saw a book about a horse trainer, I wanted to read it because of Murnane.It is actually not ""about"" a horse trainer. Sonia, the horse trainer, tells her story herself. The book is the result of a number of interviews with her. It is presented as a series of short vignettes taken from her monologue. It seems that so called ""oral histories"" are currently on the rise. I've come across Osebol that seem to be another example of ""oral history"" I want to read at some stage. But whether a trend or not, ""Kick the Latch"" is a little gem. Sonia is a wonderful person. Or is she a character? Or both? Her voice is unique and her story is unique as well. I've heard somewhere that this book gives voice to ""an ordinary life"". But I do not see anything ordinary in Sonia's life. It is pretty much extraordinary. Also the ability of Kathryn Scanlan to give up her authorial presence, ability to listen is outstanding feature of the way how this story is told.

This is an interior monologue of a woman trapped in Paris Metro; ""trapped"" does a lot of symbolic heavy-lifting respectively. I found the structure of the book is successful. The periodic sign-posting and repetition in the narrative worked effectively. Though sign-posting was often related to different food in different places. But the voice did not work for me and I did not feel any desire or curiosity to stay in the narrator's head as soon as I could escape. I was searching for the deeper layers, for something which would crystallise behind the direct meaning of the words and would add the second dimension to the story. But it never happened: the words meant exactly what they meant. I've read it was an intention by the author which is fair enough. But it did not work for me. I prefer more ambiguous, multilayered interior monologues. I am surprised noone so far compared her to Bernhard. She does not do long sentences, quite the opposite. But her consistency with a few of her main preoccupations bordering obsession deserves a mention.The author is very good though when she sketches in the social observations of different cultures and satirises them: pushy parents; racial prejudice; cultural stereotypes; corruption of the socialist states. Also what I found interesting is how the book reflects the time it was written - 2005. The globalisation is palpable, and the world has just gone through the dismantling of the socialist camp: the narrator is a Vietnamese; she was educated in the Soviet Union; but now she teaches English in Paris; and many of her students are Muslims either the recent refugees or the next generation of ex-colonial arrivals. Also the rise of China is very present. This growth looked rapid and unstoppable in mid noughties. All of this looks very different from the perspective of 2023. That leads to the interesting question: does this change of the context make the book stronger or vice-versa. I sincerely do not know the answer.

When i was reading this novel, especially the first half, i felt this persistent, a bit eery feeling of being inside of someone’s else consciousness. Not the characters’ but of Emily Bronte herself. This is not the best way to describe this feeling as i was not in any way identified with her. But it was as if I was able to see with my mind eye what she thought while she was writing this book, almost like in real time. It seems for her Heathcliff, Catherine and Edgar weren’t people, even imaginary. They were just parts of her own self fighting each other. I’ve had that palpable feeling how she does not want to be overcome by Heathcliff - powerful irrational dark force of destruction (and of destruction of other parts of her own self in that). But how attractive it was for her to succumb to him. How the protection of Edgar inside of her: moral, culture, manners - falls far short of this strong dark pull of the other. And how many times Catherine has to die inside her causing her pain in inability to firmly put herself into the one camp or another. Therefore, I’ve almost jumped when I’ve reached to point in the novel when Catherine said: ""I am Heathcliff"" and then: ""he's more myself than I am”. And Heathcliff also calls Catherine “his soul and his life.” This idea that Catherine and Heathcliff are just the forces inside Emily’s self probably explains why there is no sex between them - they are just the parts of a struggling whole. I have to admit my almost full ignorance about Emily or any of Brontes before this novel. I still do not know much. But reading the novel I felt i was talking to someone feeling torn inside between her own nature and the desire to conform to some externally imposed demands. After finishing the book, I’ve read the introduction, learned some basic facts. But also found out that she was a very dreamy, impressionable person. When she was sixteen she wrote the following about the moment in their household:“Papa opened the parlour door and gave Branswell a letter saying Here Branswell read this and show it to your Aunt and Charlotte. The Gondals are discovering the interior of Gaaldine. Sally Mosely is washing in the back of the kitchen.”It would be a very ordinary observation apart from facts that the Gondals were totally imaginary. The intro’s writer summarises this very well: “Goldal epic is inserted into the account of the ordinary household affairs indicates the degree to which the events of this imaginary world were taken for granted by Emily as an integral part of the world she lived in.”And I could hardly imagine how real Heathcliff was for her; how strong his pool might have been inside her, so only ability to write about this internal struggle would help her to survive. Normally during my reading a novel, i never think of the writer. The characters exit in my mind as independent people and who has created them is not that important. But it was the opposite way with this book. I could not care that much for any of those characters, even for those which I thought were more like psychological forces. But i did care a lot for the author, the girl who has briefly visited this world a few centuries ago. Just when i’ve finished writing the paragraph above, it has occurred to me that surely someone was already thinking alone the similar lines about psychology presented in this novel. I’ve looked up and found out of a number of the existing psychological interpretations. The closest to my thoughts is appeared to be the Freudian one:“Typical of Freudian readings of the novel is Linda Gold's interpretation. She sees in the symbiosis of Catherine, Heathcliff, and Edgar the relationship of Freud's id, ego, and superego. At a psychological level, they merge into one personality with Heathcliff's image of the three of them buried (the unconscious) in what is essentially one coffin.""However, my distinctive impression was that it was not an abstract imaginary story simply coming of a writer’s mind. It was far from theoretical in this case. It was a true survival struggle between different contradictory and overwhelming emotions of the very concret person - Emily. Now, after 2 centuries we would never find out whether it was the case.In many respects, the first part of this novel has reminded me a modern work Malina. In that book, the narrator shares an apartment with enigmatic Malina. The narrator is a tormented soul trying to find solace in writing and in a relationship with another man; while Malina seems to be the person who understands her almost perfectly and wordlessly. This triangle, the fragility of the main heroine and her creative power, ambiguity of what is real and who is Malina have connected these two novels closely in my mind. Of course there is the second part in the “Wuthering Heights” describing the troubles of the second generation of the families. But after the first part, that bit seemed much more like an ordinary novel to me. The novel that a writer sits down to write as opposed to the one when a person is trying to escape from internal torment through writing. Bronte has put an amazing craft in the novel. How it is written is very modern: two unreliable narrators, atmosphere, suspense, reflections and warped mirrors between the two generations. But thinking of Emily while reading this book would probably stay with me for longest.PSArticle Psychological Interpretations of ""Wuthering Heights:http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/eng......more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,"Jan 24, 2023","Jan 31, 2023","Jan 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/348914.Wuthering_Heights

In the preface to his Paris Spleen or “Petits Poèmes en prose” addressed to Arsene Houssaye he says the following:“I send you a little work of which no one can say, without doing it an injustice, that it has neither head nor tail, since, on the contrary, everything in it is both head and tail, alternately and reciprocally. …Chop it into numerous pieces and you will see that each one can get along alone.”He has written it in the middle of the 19th century. But it perfectly sums up my impression about “The Baudelaire Fractal” written somewhere in the second decade of the 21st. It is not a coincidence of course as this book is in constant conversation with Baudelaire’s work. Still, it is impressively apt.“The Baudelaire Fractal” is a sort of Künstlerroman consisting of a number of chapters - mini-essays. They, in my view, can be read in any order though they are loosely connected. The double coding described in “Intertextual irony and level of reading” by Umberto Eco once again comes to mind. It talks that there is often more than one layer to appreciate in a work or art depending the needs or experience of the reader. This work operates at least on two levels:First level: A drifter in ParisA young woman is alone in Paris learning how to write, walking the streets, meeting up young men for sex, drifting from one place to another. Later, in the middle of her life she describes her experiences in writing this book. Her personal memories are intervened with cultural and biographical fragments about the 19th century Paris, Baudelaire and his circle especially. As a result, we are presented with her unique dynamic view:“Garments, rooms, paintings, desire: in each of these perceptual frames, there is the feeling of the movement of time as an inner experience made available to sensing and wilderness of interpretation by way of material borders or limits.”Interestingly, the protagonist includes fashion as the one of her perceptual frames. I am used to discussions of historical personalities, books and paintings in this type of work. But the fashion was quite a new way for me to look at the world: “Fashion had initiated me into the untimeliness within the timely; after a period of forgetting, garments describe garments, unfurling secretive negation wishing apparent semblance.”Apart from Jean Rhys, we usually read about male drifters. Therefore to have a young female protagonist is wonderfully refreshing. Her experiments with desire, living in someone else rooms, working for random jobs for living seem to be well-trodden subjects. But she managed to reveal a lot of new, distinctive angles of her experience: “Very line of memory twists back on itself, branches off, contracts and expands and reproduces like a form of life.”Her excursions into history and theory of culture were smart and poignant. For example, she devoted a substantial space to Jeanne Duval, Baudelaire’s lover of 20 years. Duval was a mixed race actress, a courtesan and generally a popular figure of that time and circle. However, Courbet has washed her out from his painting “The Artist Studio”. It is a mystery why he has done it. Some say on Baudelaire’s request. Some say the latter has nothing to do with that. Nevertheless, the painting was first exhibited without her. But nowadays her silhouette is apparently visible on the canvas in the Musée d’Orsay.The way how she combined all these threads into an organism, the prose and philosophic depth is really what made this book to stand out for me.Second level: Transformation As the second possible layer, the author uses her protagonist’s relationship with Baudelaire’s oeuvre to explore the concept of authorship. What is that? Can it belong to one individual? What is that a writer/poet/artist actually does?“Latin root of the word author was actor - to augment. … The augmenter is the one who inserts extra folds into the woven substance of language. Extra to what? Certainly extra to the compact of the sign as a dual bearer of meaning. This will always leave something out of the description of the language dark work. The augmenter includes the displaced parts, because they are pleasurable, because they are moody, lazy, slutty, mannered, frivolous, unprincipled, because they are monstrous, because they are necessary, because they are angry, because history needs them without knowing it yet, because without them, the world gets grindingly thinner and more cruel, becomes a parody of the sign.”Her heroine is waking up one day to feel that he possess all the works of the poet:“What happened was this: I smashed up against a violent and completely formed recognition that entered through my sleepy hands. The poems were my poems. The words as I read them were words I know deeply because they were my own, the way my skin was physiologically my own. I’d muttered these words as I walked. I crossed them out after several years to replace them with other words and then changed them back. I was completely inside the poem I was reading, and also within its gradual, discontinuous making, which was both skin and breath, and too, sheer wit..” Even after Borges’s famous story of Pierre Menard, autor del Quijote, this confession still might come across as a bit gimmicky. But I believe it is made for good reason. I believe a talented, creative person can literally feel something like that while facing with a work of art. Let’s call it intangible inheritance for the absence of better word. I was reminded of a similar sentiment sublimely expressed by Luise Bennett in Checkout 19:“Sometimes all it takes is just one sentence. Just one sentence, there you are, part of something that has been part of you since the beginning, whenever that might rightly be. The source, yes, you can feel in thrumming and surging, and it’s such a relief, to feel you are made of much more that just yourself, that you are only a rind really, a rind you should take care of yet mustn’t get too attached to, that you mustn’t be afraid to let melt away now and then.”After reading this passage, I do not think anyone would be able to doubt that the feeling is real. To emphasise this transformational experience of her narrator, the author has named each chapter of this book after a poem in prose from Paris Spleen. I’ve read each chapter alongside with its namesake from Baudelaire and I did not find any superficial textual echoes. It was gentler than this. But this experience of reading the two works together has certainly adds to the appreciation of both of them - this subtle sense of accretion of the newer one on the older.The author calls the book a fictional novel. If anything it is the one of those genre-defying books which are quite numerous nowadays. However, not many are memorable for the brilliant prose, interesting concept and original point of view. This one does hit the right buttons for me. It would go into my personal canon of such works together with Checkout 19 and Optic Nerve. I tried to avoid the dreaded word “autofiction” in describing this book and I would let Baudelaire again help me with this:“You might ask me: “Are you sure that this story is the real one?” What does it matter what reality dwells outside of me, if the story helps me live, helps me feel that I am and what I am?”...more",Notes are private!,-1,35,1,"Jan 18, 2023","Jan 31, 2023","Jan 18, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45010931-the-baudelaire-fractal

The one of the memories, I am afraid, would be the moment when in the middle of a certain story I felt that if I would not start to read it aloud to myself, Murnane would lose me. It was the one, particularly long story. But when I’ve started reading it aloud, the rhythm, the sound of the words have brought the magic back. It was a weird feeling: I was providing a soundtrack to a visual sequence in my head.What also have stayed with me so far was an image of “green grass and dark blue forrest”. Can I describe this image in words? Is it what he tries to do in his prose: to describe in words what he sees in his mind? Well, for what it’s worth, I imagine a painting rather than a real landscape. When I look closer, I can see the grass is taller than some trees. I can see that the green is merging with dark-blue and becoming black at the edges. Maybe, I am very small and look upwards from the ground… Are you still with me?That is the image in my head when I think of “Stream System”. Of course I would lie if I say I do not recall any ideas or details from the book. I do; at least for now. But the truth is also that I remember only three stories out of a dozen as a coherent and elegant textual constructions. The rest is this green-blue-black image and a tangle of associations. The preceding few paragraphs are about all you would learn of this Murnane’s story collection from reading this piece of mine. What follows is what it brought up. It made me thinking which kind of images are kept in my mind in relation to which kind of books of my reading life. And it was difficult to stop since I've started.So very likely, the main memory that would stay with me from Murnane’s collection would be a recollection of a museum of images created by the books in my mind. The memory of a memory…The first book I remember vividly is Two Captains, a popular soviet epic. I’ve read it at the summer of my 8th birthday. I remember being told that it was a book for the grown ups. But I’ve read it and loved it. When at the first lesson of my second year at school the teacher asked what we’ve read that summer, I've raised my hand and named the title. She did not believe me at first. So I still remember the feeling of bitterness and pride in equal measure. The biggest impression on me was a description of the first kiss between the main characters. I do not remember the context at all, but it was something like “we’ve kissed once and then again many more times”. And I understood that the kiss was something very important, something much more than a simple touch of lips. It was a connection, totally unknown to me which I wanted to experience one day. It was somehow a true symbol of closeness and sacrifice. I’ve taken also from that book is to try not to betray and not to give up. The book was very heavy, around 600 pages and it did not have pictures. I did not allow anyone to move it from my room for a long time. It made me feel suddenly old and and wise, especially compared to my six year old brother.Image: My little raised hand with a blackboard as a background (for ""Two Captains"").Later, when I was in my mid-teens, I do not recall the specific books, but the combination of Pushkin, Turgenev and other 19th century classics we’ve been spoon-fed in school has led me away from that warmness and trust of the first kiss towards almost opposite. I was imagining that if a boy would dare to kiss me without asking for permission first, I would slap him hard on the cheek in return. I am actually glad it did not happen that way in real life.Image: A blushed, hot cheek (for the 19th century school's curriculum)I remember the first book I’ve read myself when I was about four. It was a tiny fairytale made threadbare due to repetitive use. I’ve been used to be read. My grandmother was reading to me during the day and the parents - often at bed times. (Another memory jumped in - it is dark in my bedroom and my father reads to me Robinson Crusoe under the light from the corridor. I hardly understand much, but the colourful parrot is the final image I see before falling asleep.) On that day however, my grandma said that I should read myself as she needed to cook for all of us. I’ve already learned how to read well by that time. But I was very offended. I remember the tears. It was a lot of them. She left for the kitchen anyway. And after a long time crying, al least it seemed like a long time, I understood I have no other way but read myself. I still remember the salt of tears and the abstract patterns of the grey wallpaper I was looking at as I was stubbornly facing the wall for a while. But also I remember forgetting about all my surroundings when I got into the fairytale. Can one remember forgetting?Image: White geometric patterns on a grey wallpaper (for the fairytale)I remember earlier my grandma, the same one, reciting me from her memory a piece of prose in Ukrainian. I remember the feeling of hiding behind her warmth in her bed listening. The piece was about a cold autumn fog and a man, or was it a boy, who was looking outside through a small dirty window. I still see the image of that window in my mind. I still can recite the words. It took me more than a few decades to check where the passage came from. I’ve found it. It is from here Fata morgana and other stories. Almost every day now when I wake up to the news of the war ravaging Ukraine, those lines come back to me. I still haven’t read the whole novella though. Image: Small smudged half-broken window (for Fata Morgana)I remember arguing with my then best friend when I was fourteen. It was something very important in a way everything was life or death when you were fourteen. She ran off down the staircase from my place and I thought we've stopped being friends. It was a winter break I grabbed Crime and Punishment from the shelf for the first time. I felt I was getting ill and the combination of fever, winter bleakness and the hurt of loss - that is all that stayed with me when I think of that novel.Image: Empty stairs (for Crime and Punishment).I do not remember what was the first book I’ve read in English. But I remember the first song I’ve consciously translated, the words of which I understood. It was the first year of my university and I liked a boy. The boy spoke very good English. Did I like him because of that? Maybe, a bit. But I asked him to help to translate “Show must go on”. I cannot believe it now. But it was the case. It was the beginning of spring, it felt like spring for the first time that day. The icicles have started to melt. I remember those drops and we are standing outside our university’s building and he writes the translation for me on the back of a rail ticket and I’ve suddenly have this thought that everything in future will work out as I wish.Image: Melting icicles (for Freddie Mercury) It was a very cold and hungry first year at university. Early 90s in Saint-Petersburg. There were no money to buy food, but there were no food to buy either. The one of my professors suggested I come to his home so we can brainstorm how I can find some paid work. I was eighteen. When I came he was not at home. But I’ve met with his girlfriend whose existence I did not suspect. She was about thirty at the time, at least 20 years younger than the professor. She was an artist, little sad and a chain smoker. The apartment was full of books, even the long dark corridor was covered in bursting bookshelves. She made me some tea and we talked about age and art. She said I won’t notice before I would be 25 and everything in my life that I consider now impossible, both good and bad and cringy, would have already happen by then. I did not believe her: seven years seemed to be a huge distance. I know now she was right. I liked her very much. She seemed to be wise and understanding. The professor did not show up but called to rearrange the meeting. When I was leaving, his girlfriend gave me The Letters of Vincent van Gogh to read. I came back another day. It was 10 am; the girlfriend was nowhere to be seen, but the professor has opened the door covered just in a whitish sheet; an opened bottle of “Absolute” vodka was next to the bed missing that sheet. I understood that I would need to reject pretty urgently at least this “job opportunity”. I was not sure how though; I did not have enough courage to be angry; I mumbled something about my jealous boyfriend and managed to escape from that flat. I still have those van Gogh's letters; I’ve never come back to return it. Image: More than one (for the Letters of Van Gogh)I remember one summer. Just a few years passed but many things have changed indeed. I’ve got to the stage when I could buy books without thinking too much of the cost. I remember walking out with my friend, who is still my best friend, from a book shop carrying two huge plastic bags of books - 7 volumes of Joseph Brodsky. It was literally hard to carry so we stopped at a bar, got some beers, got a volume out of a bag and start reading random poems to each other:Evolving backward, a riverbecomes a tear, the realbecomes memory whichcan, like fingertips, pinchjust the tail of a lizard…Never-ending summer day it was; never-starting night - the sun practically does not set in June in that city. And two bags of books. We moved from a place to a place. I am surprised I haven’t lost those bags somewhere. I still have these books on my shelves with beer stains on some of the pages. It was so sad a while ago to read a certain political poem by Brodsky that made me feel confused and betrayed by him. But then this was still to come. And it is a totally different story. Image: Two plastic bags dark-red leather volumes (for Brodsky).Some more years and countries. And I remember managing to escape from duties after a sleepless night leaving my then baby-son with his grandma. I went to read Anna Karenina in a cafe, but on a way back I was caught by a proper May thunderstorm. I was running, but until I’ve managed to find some cover both the book and I were totally soaked. I remember standing under a tree, with a wall of rain in front of me, clutching the soaking Anna but feeling somehow totally free - just the smell of new rain, thunder, new fresh-green tree-leaves and me… It took Anna some time to dry out before I could get back to her next day.Image: The wall of rain (for Anna Karenina)I remember reading The Little Prince to my son when he was about five. And I could not hide my tears. I do not think he realised I was able cry at all before that moment. It was his discovery of the moment - he was amazed and little afraid. For him crying was a sad thing. And he did not think the story was sad. But I could not hold it. Being with my little boy and seeing how the Little Prince was attending the flower made me realise how early in our life we meet with loneliness; also what it means: “You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.”. It is an idea which we find natural during the childhood. But somehow later, it becomes almost impossible to follow.Image: A blue dot on a yellow wall (for The Little Prince).Is it time to come back to Murnane?During much of his life, whenever he heard or read another person’s account of his or her having read one or another book of fiction, he supposed that he was the only person who remembered having read fiction in a way he remembered it. Whenever he remembered his having read one or another passage in one or another book, he remembered not the words of the passage but the weather during the hour when he had read. The passage, the sights or sounds that he had seen or heard around him from time to time while he read, the textures of the cushions or curtains or walls or grasses or leaves that he had reached for and had touched from time to time while he read, the look of the cover of the book contains the passage and of the page or pages where the passage had been printed, and especially the images that had appeared in his mind while he had read the passage and the feelings that he felt while he had read.In this beautiful passage, Murnane has made a mistake, however: he was certainly not the “only person who remembered having read fiction in a way he remembered it.”...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Jan 11, 2023","Jan 24, 2023","Jan 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35259553-stream-system

Very gifted, he has started his contribution to maths and physics in the age of 15 in the early 20s of the last century until his untimely death in 1957. The majority of his career was in Princeton Institute of Advance Studies. Based upon this book, I've made the conclusion that he was a bit like an intellectual magpie finding a cut-age areas of science that interested him and making his startling contribution. Later, the area would be taken over by someone else and would be properly developed. Was he a visionary? The book's answer is firm ""yes"". Both intellectually and organisationally, he has contributed into establishing such phenomena like a computer, an atomic bomb and a theory of games and many others. Still, reading has left me with a bit of reservation whether his personality and energy was not slightly over-emphasising the impact of his unique scientific contribution. In any case, the science is a collective effort. And this book is really good in discussing scientific ideas and the context:-the interpretations of quantum physics;-Gilbert and his maths program;- Manhattan project;-Games theory;-Computer and automata (machine replication). We've meet the usual suspects such as Godel, Turing, Oppenheimer and all the usual quantum guys but including Dirac this time. It also mentioned the politicians and especially the US military big wigs of the period. But also I've learned of a few new personages. The most striking discoveries were:- Grete Hermann - a woman mathematician and philosopher who found a gap with Neumann justification for Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. She was totally ignored in her time and the interpretation has become prevalent for about 50 years. - George Price - an evolutionary biologist who discovered that an act of altruism could be rationally explained in evolution. But then he was still bothered that the altruism might be triggered by the biological selfishness. He dropped his job and started to make a lot of deliberate selfless acts. It did not help that he has become mentally ill. Nevertheless, sadly in his case it has all ended in a suicide. I am personally still sceptical that an altruism, a concept as we understand it, might be connected to evolution. And I know famous ants example. The book has helped me to find out a lot about the intellectual atmosphere of that time. However, on the basis of this book, I do not think I can create an impression who was von Neumann as a person. But is it at all possible to recreate a human in a biography like that? Hard to say. He was controversial. He participated in the decisions like where exactly to drop an atomic bomb in Japan. And many others, that with hindsight, have put a humanity at a risk of distinction. But who was he? Even his wife of many years struggled with this question. Not long after his death, she remarried. But soon walked into the Pacific after filling ""her elegant cocktail dress with 15 pounds of wet sand."" In her unfinished memoirs, she wrote:""I would like to tell about the man, the strange contradictory and controversial person; childish and good-humoured, sophisticated and savage, brilliantly clever yet with a very limited, almost primitive lack of ability to handle his emotions - an enigma of nature that will have to remain unresolved.""...more",Notes are private!,2,44,1,"Jan 04, 2023","Jan 11, 2023","Jan 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61089520-the-man-from-the-future

When I was reading it I’ve had this mental image of a plant growing organically, but chaotically and changing direction ofThis is a fascinating book. When I was reading it I’ve had this mental image of a plant growing organically, but chaotically and changing direction of growth with the change of light. I remember the phenomenon is called “tropism”. I would not know what was “the source of light” for the novel, but it seems to be a very alive creature. The plants, seeds and trees naturally play a big role in this text. At one point, to protect Yalivitz, a little imaginary resort town in the Carpathians, the people plant a wild, fast growing creepers around it. They would cover it, hide it and made it invisible for any passing armies. The stories within the novel not simply grow, they sometimes “break through a soil” from where they’ve been buried before.The novel attempts to uncover stories with the sense of the place and its people. “The plots are not getting created, they do not disappear either. They are and they exist. They are only might be forgotten”. Through this colourful patchy bundle of “plots’, myths and stories, the book puts this place firmly on the map. Geographically, it is somewhere in the mountains of the Central Europe. But it has also being carved somewhere on the invisible mental map of each reader. “To find the place is to start a history”. The characters drink coffee accompanied with grapefruit juice, gin; they dream and hallucinate; they learn each other’s past; make films, design buildings, climb mountains and write letters. They also travel, love and die or get brutally killed. They try to find an accommodation with the UnSimple (NeProsti from the title). No one knows who are those for sure; they might be just people all the same or they might be gods. In any case they possess the power. The power to create and control a narrative and the power to change someone fate for better or for worse. It seems this work among other things is an attempt in foundational myth-making. This includes a sort of variation of an ancient creation myth. At least that is how I’ve interpreted it: a possible reincarnation of the same woman in four generations runs through the book; in three of them she is in a relationship with the same man being his daughter and later as a lover. A creation that ironically in this case does not untimely lead to a new world; neither it stops the destruction of the old. “To find the place is to start a history”. There is however another history. The one these people have not started but the one they’ve made a part of.“Why there is always a war?”. A young girl asks her father. He does not answer directly. But then there is this passage in the book:“when the South is fighting the North, and The East fighting the West, they do it predominantly in the center of Europe, in the Carpathians and between their rivers. And the worse that could happen is for people to perform a role of civilians living there or of their place to be a strategically important point on a topographical map.”It is especially painful to read this now when there is a war again or the continuation of the same old endless one. The fight has moved further East but it has not ended. It makes the reading experience very immediate and poignant in this context:“A swamp under boots. Movement in columns. The crossings in cold water. Pussy wounds are cleaned with the dirty fingers… Rain and mud in the trenches… Explosions nearby. We have to lie low… Their deserters. People hanged in their gardens. To crawl on the snow… Burned hands. Pain, insomnia, cold…”When was it? Was it WWI? Was it yesterday? Is it tomorrow?But it is not a war novel. It is a poetic, dense by parts, philosophical organism. It plays with the storytelling and of course with the language. The vocabulary is so reach. The author uses so many words and names that are plain delicious often being out of the daily usage in Ukrainian. The text might even contain the beginnings of a peculiar theory of language. It also plays with Wittgenstein when a character is so enchanted with “Tractatus” that at the end he forgets where he knows all those maximums from and believes they are all his very own ideas. In its own turn, the book inadvertently asks to be parsed and quoted:“Each person is able make a book during her life… Each person, but only one book. Those who think they’ve written many books are mistaken - all of this is a continuous making of a single book. Whatever one is trying to change in the text, one cannot jump out of her own book. It is possible to improve it but not to create another. Your single book is limited by your voice, intonation, articulation. A fate is a way to speak.” Written in the 00s, the novel belongs to the earlier post-modern tradition of the 80s but with a distinctive Mitteleuropean flavour. It reflects a melancholy of Central European identity. It also conveys a distinctive experience of being rooted to a place, and at the same time, being made to feel strangers in their own land by the bigger powers. The book has reminded me of other books: Milorad Pavić, Primeval and Other Times by Tokarzchuk, or less directly The Good Soldier Schweik. Also there is nothing post-Soviet about this novel and I found it very refreshing. “Everything I’ve learned and remembered from my life were a few landscapes that meant a joy of thinking; a few scents that were feelings; a few movements that entailed sensations; a few things, objects that epitomised culture, history and suffering; a lot of plants that were our access to beauty, and wisdom, and everything else compared to which we simply do not matter in this world. And lots and lots of intonations. Unrepeatable similar intonations I do not know about - what they did mean. Maybe with their help, we would be recognisable in that place where there is nothing left except from the voice.”______________________For the purposes of this , I’ve translated the quoted passages.

We are writing in different ways, but I can tell that there’s a similar way of seeing that’s behind it.""The quote is from Fosse's recent conversation with Merve Emre .)Jorge Luis Borges with the libraries and books in libraries containing everything about any possible book; the first part of “The Plains” is a piece of non-fiction about a fictional country imagined for this.Marcel Proust, the writer who takes “private labyrinths of Time as the settings for their … works.”ArchitectureGeometry of his written sentences is a geometry of his thoughts - an array of the mirrors arranged in a way to make a message to come back to the starting point after bouncing against them for a while:“I see not solid land but a wavering haze that conceals a certain mansion in whose dim library a young woman stares at a picture of another young woman who sits over a book that sets her wondering about some plain now lost from sight.” Time: Is it a game?“People here conceive of a lifetime as one more sort of plain. .. they allude constantly to a Time that converges on them or recedes from them like some familiar but formidable plain.” So observes the narrator. And he seems joining the game when a woman personage seems to be the same age with him, but at the beginning it is the daughter of his patron, then - his wife. And later, there is a granddaughter of his patron as a younger girl. It certainly adds to the impression that Time is not linear in this place. “self defeating proposition that Time can have no agreed meaning for any two people;… all our statements about it are designed to fill up an awesome nullity in our plains…”The sentence above would be perfect in relation to Language as well as Time. Everyone perceives time differently. But with the language is even harder: so much potential of being misunderstood using the same words. For example, what is “the plains”?“Some men dedicated to prove that the plains are not what many plainsman take them for. They are not, that is, a vast theatre that adds significance to the events enacted within it. Nor are they an immense field for explorers of every kind. They are simply a convenient source of metaphors for those who know that men invent their own meanings.”Time=Plain=Metaphor=Language=Meaning? A chase. A post-modern elusiveness at its best for those who like such games. Is there a deeper level here? I am not sure apart from the message that it won’t be sufficient to travel on the surface with big themes.“So I keep away nowadays from the volumes in which Time itself is made to appear as one more sort of plain. I have no wish to be seen, even by that silent woman among those lengthening vistas of provocative titles:as a man in sight of Time, the invisible Plain,or approaching Time, the Plain beyond reach,or finding his way back from Time, the Pathless Plain,or even surrounded by Time, the Boundless Plain. I split the sentence over the lines to make it easier to see. Is it irony? Does he talk here about an abstract metaphors or he refers literally to the titles of those volumes and his physical spatial movements between the shelves of those volumes? I think the latter. And It works and it is a cool play here. However, there is yet another profound idea in this novel about Time. It is connected to our understanding what memory is. Pablo Neruda, in The Book of Questions, asks:""Where is the child I was, still inside me or gone? Does he know that I never loved him and that he never loved me? Why did we spend so much time growing up only to separate? Why did we both not die when my childhood died? Those questions fascinates Murnane's narrator as well. A personage in ""The Plains"" believes that his younger self is somewhere our there at the same Time as he is. It is just that their plains can barely touch each other. They are still connected but through this zone that cannot be penetrated easily from both ends. It seems Murnane was fascinated all his creative life with this question expressed by Neruda so poetically. And, in his final work ""Last Letter to a Reader he seemed to resolved it for himself more directly than in ""The Plains"":I was reassured yet again of the truth of the claim that no such thing as ‘Time’ exists; that we experience only place after place; that remembering, as we call it, is no sort of rediscovery or recollection but an act performed for the very first time somewhere in the endless place known as the present.I can so much relate to this statement. Also, it has reminded me a theory about the existence of 'Episodic' and 'Diachronic' (narrative) self-experience and the article about it Against Narrativity. Murnane seems to be an ""episodic"" type. But I'd better stop here for now before I digress too far.PossibilitiesA possibility vs reality (“actuality” in his language) is the heart of this book. On the one level it is a possibility of love. Especially the phenomenon that a possibility of a romance is often more powerful than what follows. The author masterfully intervenes three love stories. And none of them actually happened. The narrator fells for the wife of his patron. He sees her often in the library but they never exchanged a word. She, in her case spent a half-life with her husband who has “never explained” himself:“The woman might therefore have considered the chief advantage of so many years spent among unlocked-for plains,with a man who had still not explained himself,to be that it has once allowed her to postulate the existence of a woman whose future included even the unlikely prospect of half a lifetime spent among unlocked-for plainswith a man who would never explain himself. “Before even diving for the meaning it worthwhile looking the architecture of this sentence. I’ve spliced it into seven lines - it is easier to see this geometry of mirrors again. And the meaning - isn’t it a high price to spend a half-life with someone to imagine an unlikely possibility of such life?The wife and the patron was the love story number one.Also, “She would surely have read at least one of those accounts of a man and a woman who met only once and accepted that so much was promised to them by the decorous looks and words they exchanged that they should not meet again.”That would be the second love story. I’ve recognised from my reading Murnane’s “The history of books”, that she might have read a book called Isopel Berners The History of certain doings in a Staffordshire Dingle, July, 1825 by George Borrow. And the third story - the narrator and the same woman. In her experience:Years of disquiet is only sequel appropriate to the moment when a young woman saw as he might never appear again a man who saw as he might never appear again.” And in his:“When I entertained even the vaguest thoughts of the two of us as a man and wife I had to allow that even such people could not have existed without a possible world to counterbalance what was for them the actual. And in that possible world were a couple who sat silently in separate bays of a library. “So nothing happens between them or, on the contrary everything takes place in the one of those possible worlds. Many people will find it ironic. But I actually found it very poignant and a little sad. Without the defence of irony, one can find so many cases in one’s life when a beautiful possibility of a romance has become its opposite when realised.That is love; but Murnane goes wider in his search. His imaginary thinkers “disregard the question whether a possibility… may seem one day to correspond to some meagre arrangements of events. They give all the attention to the possibility itself and esteem it according to its amplitude and to the length of time for which it survives just beyond reach of the haphazard disposition of sights and sounds which is called, in careless speech, actuality, and has been considered, perhaps even by a few plains men to represent the extinction of all possibilities.”I do not know whether Murnane was familiar with quantum physics when he was writing it, but if not, his scholars have reinvented it in this passage. Nowadays everyone knows about suffering Schrödinger's cat. The animal physically exists in the world of possibilities. He might be dead and alive at the same time. That is until the point when someone observes him. At this point, he jumps into the actuality and takes one state.But it does not need to happen in the world of our imagination. It does not need to happen in the world of a novel either.In the The Art of the Novel, Kundera said: A novel examines not reality but existence. And existence is not what has occurred, existence is the realm of human possibilities, everything that man* can become, everything he’s capable of. Novelists draw up the map of existence by discovering this or that human possibility. But… to exist means “being-in-the-world.” Thus both the character and his world must be understood as possibilities…Therefore, in a good novel the possibilities, even the contradictory ones, do not have to be resolved into “actuality”. They can happily exist there in the multiple dimensions of the plains. A love story that never happened but exist somewhere on the plains. A film that never was scripted or shot but exist somewhere on the plains too… And an observer, otherwise known as a reader could approach this box of a book multiple times, open the cover and, each time find a new cat in a new state....more",Notes are private!,1,38,1,"Dec 15, 2022","Dec 19, 2022","Dec 15, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1593668.The_Plains

This book provides a relatively comprehensive world coverage history of money with more of a focus on the UK and the US as history moves along. The rest of the world including Europe and China is covered less comprehensively. But this is understandable considering the author's need to establish the priorities to cover more than a thousand years. The unique feature of the book for me was the formulation of a concept that the author calls “meta-theory of money”. In other words, it is the author’s proposition which type of current thinking on money would prevail depending on the state of economy in the certain time period or just before. He calls his meta-theory “The quality-to-quantity pendulum”. He also explains the reasons for relatively dramatic oscillations in public support of contradictory theories with time.Briefly, it all comes down to the contradiction between the interest of net debtors and net creditors in the society. Usually the net debtors are “much poorer and always more numerous than the normally more powerful and less numerous creditors”. However, the net debtors often include the powerful politicians on their side and the state is often a net debtor in some form. The debtors naturally want to increase the quantity of money and try to find “acceptable substitutes”. While it is in the interest of the creditors to maintain the quality of money while limiting its supply and maintaining or increasing its value. The resulting dynamic in the historical perspective is as follows:1) quality of money comes first (respectively the interests of potential creditors) “for if whatever is intended to act as money is not desired strongly enough to be held, it will fail to be selected long enough to be imitated.”2) when something is accepted as a money “the quality faces competition from an increased quantity of substitutes;3) the quantity increases, the quality falls. “if the process is speed up, the currency may become completely discredited and useless, requiring replacement.”And here we go at it again. But it is an extreme case in our days in the developed world. Usually when the debtors prevail “the pendulum eventually swings towards depreciating the value of money and inflationary pressure. But at some point they are met by the net forces of creditors going other direction. Too much debtors pressure leads us to inflation. Too much of the creditors pressure leads us “to excessive emphasis on quality which severely restricts the growth of the economy”, and respectively the welfare of those debtors one way or another.It could be long periods of relative stability in this game, but nothing is guaranteed as this pendulum tends to overshoot. So far we were talking about the real economy pendulum as opposed to the pendulum of the meta-theory. But when it comes to the current theories trying to explain the current situation, unsurprisingly, there is a similar dynamic:“At any given time, especially after drastic changes in monetary affairs, a whole host of theories may arise to explain the existing value of money. Given a wider historical perspective these temporary theories group themselves with little distortion into either debtor-quantity or creditors- quality theories. The meta-theory brings this two apparently contradicting and divergent theories together under symbiotic union.' This idea explains why the prevailing one of these theories tend oscillate so widely and why the opposite theory tend “to follow each other in repeated alterations over the centuries”. He gives the example of the last big swing between the Keynesian “liquidity theory of money” (net debtors’ theory in his speak) that was followed by the monetarism of Milton Friedman. But even I can add a few more flux when the monetarism went out of fashion, New Keynesians including the MMT (Modern Money Theory) has started to get an ear of some policy makers. However, when the inflation resurfaced partly due to some of form of the increase of money supply influenced by that thinking, the tighter monetary controls has started to reduce the inflationary pressure.As with all good ideas, this meta-theory sounds almost obvious when one assimilates it. But it did not seem obvious to me before reading this book. The longer span of history he writes to illustrate this idea is amazing. It is much trickier to understand what is going on while being inside of your own time and seeing only a fragment of this pendulum: it has reminded me about the proverbial elephant and the blind men who each imagined a totally different creature based upon their separate observations. However, it makes sense. And the timing of these theories gaining popularity with the public makes sense as well. It would be impossible to convince a voter about the risk of inflation until he feels it in the shop. He would not just buy it so to speak.In general, this meta-theory probably illustrates that any set of ideas in public discourse are going through a similar cycle-pendulum. Again sounds almost obvious, but it is not that trivial. However, it looks I need to think about it a bit more to come up with something interesting to say. And the last but not least about this book - it is a great chronological history containing lots of interesting and relevant facts and personalities. Very careful reader might find a slight trace of the author's agenda (against international banking and pro-UK industrial development). But it is truly minimal within the huge scope of the book. The text is very informative and well written as well.

And I’ve been rapidly consumed by the swirl of its language, atmosphere and its characters. The bunch of desperados, all of them one buy one resurfacing from murky nothingness, sculptured by language trying to surround me and drag into the the opaque non-existence of their quite real world.And yet, though undeniably the characterisation of this novel is darkly-brilliant, what kept me turning the pages was the language and the stylistic variety of its registers. The author could play with his sentences; he could imbed a dreadful pathetic speech into the text that would still be meaningful; he could create a whole vignette contrasting a passionate figurative Volapük of the one of his characters with bureaucratic dry lingo of a state; and he would make it in a such a way that it is absurd, but it is perfectly credible at the same time and grotesquely funny.His prose is very cinematic. He changes the perspectives, swiftly moves between the scenes, zooms into details, then - out again; he uses noises and music for effect. I am not surprised that the film by Béla Tarr based on the novel has become iconic. And that is in spite of lasting 7 hours and been shot in black and white. One does not need colours in that world. The first few chapters are quite disorienting as you are going head first into the atmosphere and it is tricky to work out what is going on around you. So you have no choice but keep reading, almost watching. This is as well a good for cinema. As with any good book it would be quite reductive to talk about separate themes. You cannot split the whole into bits without losing something. But the main take for me was his rendering or power as a concept. It seems to be intrinsically important for the characters. It seems each of them consciously or subconsciously crave for it. For them the power is directly associated with the degree of freedom they have achieved. The power and freedom is almost equivalent. At the same time, it seems that they all accept the existence of a hierarchy without any challenge: they crave for some sort of authority which would relieve them from the responsibility to be free. Power brings some freedom to control the destiny of someone weaker; to decide whether to forgive or to punish; to be a saviour or a destroyer. But ultimately, in this system it would be always someone above you who would exercise his freedom on you not share it with you. In the most powerful episode of the book, a little girl deprived of any love and care exercises her freedom to deal with her cat as she pleased - just to see who is more powerful. Just to establish that she can. A doctor, in the name only though, desperately tries to fight the laws entropy: “the best he could do was to use his memory to fend off the sinister, underhanded process of decay, trusting in the fact that since all that mason might build, carpenter might construct, woman might stitch, indeed all that men and women had brought forth with bitter tears was bound to turn to an undifferentiated, runny, underground, mysteriously ordained mush, his memory would remain lively and clear.”He also carves out a tiny island of order through arranging a small number of physical objects on his table, but letting everything else in his house to decay. Eventually, he finds his unique way how to exercise a certain power over other people too: “I can control the flow of events around me using nothing more than the words.” Writing!Irimias, a swindler, or is he a saviour? In any case, he possesses almost unlimited power over the group of villagers. They would happily intrust him their lives. And they actually do so. But does this power makes him free or at least fearless? No. He is even more trapped than they are. He needs to serve the system above him. Moreover, in this system of hierarchies eventually it should be a something absolutely free with absolute power. Therefore, it should be God, but if not him? If “God was a mistake”, then this absolute is simply nothing. So according to Irimias, “We think we’re breaking free but all we’re doing is readjusting the locks. We’re trapped, end of story.”So any power is meaningless at the end in that world: “in truth he was as helpless as they were, he no longer hoped to lend meaning to the power that was strangling him as much as it was them, could not free himself from it.” Any power is indeed meaningless if it is distributed in such a way that it is used solely with purpose of grabbing more freedom at the expense of others.To some extent, this novel is an antithesis to Don Quixote. Like aforementioned Don, Irimias is almost always on a journey accompanied by the sidekick who is awkward, simple but more cautious and pragmatic character sincerely devoted to his lord. Cervantes’s knight of sad countenance imagines miracles where there are none, and by fighting for this imaginary reality he creates it for real. In contrast, Irimias, when faced with a proper miracle, rejects it. He explains it in a way that his imagination simply played a trick on him:“It’s only our imaginations, not our senses, that continually confront us with failure and the false belief that we can raise ourselves by our own bootstraps from the miserable pulp of decay. There’s no escaping that, stupid.”Don Quixote’s imagination would make a Dulcinea out of a peasant girl. Through his imagination he would find a way to love, almost worship ordinary people.The world of this book is on the contrary full of contempt for the folk. Well, at least for the characters presented in the novel. And yes, they are not the most likeable bunch. They are the ones left behind (does this expression remind you of something?) Left behind literally in their case on the remote ruined estate. They could not adapt as some other managed to. They did not leave and now they stuck with little opportunity apart from the bar and dreams of escape to the brighter future. Irimias does not mince his words in respect of them: “They are slaves who have lost their master but can’t live without what they call pride, honor and courage. That’s what keeps their souls in place even if at the back of their thick skulls they sense these qualities aren’t their own, that they’ve simply enjoyed living in the shadow of their masters . . .Then, wherever the shadow falls they follow, like a flock of sheep, because they can’t do without a shadow..”The Doctor gently refers to the same people as “these moronic nincompoops”. VS Naipaul starts his novel A Bend in the River with the phrase:“The world is what it is; men who are nothing allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it”. Reading Santatango, I was constantly coming back to this sentence in my mind. And if not anything else, this novel has again made me think about this. Is it actually true? To which extent Don Quixote is right? To which extent Naipaul or Irimias is right? And does the existence of these people, “nincompoops”, lead to the emergence of such Irimiases on the top of the social ladder, Irimiases who gain power, constantly hungry for more, ready to kill for it eventually if required? How do Don Quixote and Irimias co-exist?I wish to believe Don Quixote was somewhere on the right track. But the reality intervenes. And when I see Russian soldiers being summoned into the country by their master, gruesomely murder and rape civilians and run from Ukraine with stolen washing machines and toilet sits in their hands; when I see a man attacking the husband of an older female politician with a hammer to “make America great again”; when I see how young girls are met with the bullets on the street of Iran, fighting for their right to be free… Well, then I start reluctantly to side with Naipaul because those who are potentially “slaves who cannot do without a shadow to follow”, who “allowed themselves to become nothing” might suddenly become very dangerous. “The world is what it is”… But the remainder of an idealist in me still cries for hope. And compared to the reality this book even might be considered somewhat reassuring. At least, there is a big element of black humour that saves the day. There is element of perseverance as well even if redemption is not on the table.And I finished the book, and I thought about it for a few days, and I opened my laptop, and thought a bit more; and then I began to type: “One morning near the end of October not long before the first drops of the mercilessly long autumn rains began to fall…”...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Oct 26, 2022","Oct 31, 2022","Oct 26, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11455485-satantango

Both are autobiographical novels describing the first and second year in Harvard of her character, Celin. Inevitably,This is the sequel to The Idiot. Both are autobiographical novels describing the first and second year in Harvard of her character, Celin. Inevitably, I’ve compared between the two books. I enjoyed the self-deprecating humour, curiosity and precocious innocence of Celin Y1; there was a certain “sunniness” in her persona. Unfortunately it has disappeared. Celin Y2 has changed. It is very true to life I guess. We are of a comparable age with the author. Very different geographically and institutionally as well, but I remember my second year at university was a very different life experience from the first. In Celine case, it was dramatic and unfortunately traumatic. Maybe it was the case that I could closely relate to some of her problems; i could deeply empathise with her certain acts of desperation and self-destruction. But as a reading experience this book did not add anything substantial to my lived experience or different perspective to the memory of it. Of course it was my fault that in the sequel, I was looking forward meeting Celin Y1 while both Celin Y2 and the narrative about her have become significantly darker. Fortunately for me, she still read books - the highlights of her reading year were Either/Or: A Fragment of Life and Nadja. In the first case, she pondered about aesthetic vs ethic way of life. In the second - male gaze on a woman and mental illness. These brief discussions were stimulating. I wish she would have more of them. There were other books, but somehow less memorable for me.The new feature of this novel is its awareness of its auto-fictional nature. If in the first book it was more spontaneous, here it has become properly meta. The nature, the value and advantages of auto-bio novels (or more broader - the novels closely based on the author’s lived experiences) is discussed within the narrative. It is a good thing as the discussion is not trivial. Without a doubt, Elif (or Celin on her behalf) has something to contribute to this conversation. For example, this long passage:“It wasn’t until high school, when I took my first creative writing class, that I began to sense trouble. I realized, with shock, that I wasn’t good at creative writing. I was good at grammar and arguing, at remembering things people said, and at making stressful situations seem funny. But it turned out these weren’t the skills you needed in order to invent quirky people and give them arcs of desire. I already had my hands full writing about the people I actually knew, and all the things they said. That was what I needed writing for. Now I had to invent extra people and think of things for them to say? It turned out that writing what you were already thinking about wasn’t creative, or even writing. It was “navel-gazing.” To be obsessed by your own life experience was childish, egotistical, unartistic, and worthy of contempt. I tried to get around the problem by ascribing my own thoughts and observations to a fictional character—one with a neutral, universal name, because I didn’t want to seem like I was constantly harping on being Turkish. I didn’t like books where the whole point seemed to be that the person was from some country, and they kept going on about the food. And yet, the things I was writing about somehow didn’t make sense unless the people were from another country, and I didn’t know enough about any other countries besides Turkey. There was a creative writing workbook, with exercises. You had to fill out questionnaires about “your” characters, with their favorite food or color. I felt despair: what kind of person had a favorite color? Then I thought, OK: that was why you needed your imagination, to think of someone different from yourself. The words, “tacos, beige,” written on a piece of looseleaf paper made me feel the foreclosing of every possibility of anything exciting ever happening to me in the rest of my life.In this mini-essay, there is a lot of ideas one can reflect on. For example, what is “creative writing” and who defines it? What is the difference between writing about yourself and writing a novel using your own life experience? Why characters have to be named and receive certain physical attributesBut I wanted to raise maybe little less obvious issue in this context: the way how writing is taught in schools in America and in the UK. This idea that writing should be creative in a very narrow sense of telling an imaginary story is introduced to children at a very young age. In my very limited sample, the first thing children are taught to write is a model of an imaginary story with beginning-build up- conflict-resolution-the end. I always found this as a very counter-intuitive approach: the majority of writing, even if it is a creative writing does not come in a shape of such stories. For a child it should be quite difficult concept to grasp as our day-to-day life, especially when we are young does not have a -build up-resolution- etc. arc, at least not while we are living it. Feeling happy about meeting a new friend on a playground or sad for being told off for not brushing teeth hardly qualifies as a conflict with the resolution. It is relatively easy to learn this arc as a model of writing, but it does not lead to enhanced creativity. In fact I suspect the opposite. The result of such training is the dissatisfaction raised by Elif in the passage above. It might put some young people off any writing; or alternatively, the ones who still write would rather repeat a similar internalised model of a story again and again. It is more natural to start teaching to write about yourself and the world, moving to essays, articles, discussions about the books read… and the stories would come naturally and without an arc.Coming back to Celin and her author, now I think it is obvious why I found those essayistic fragments (there are few of them) interesting and thought-provoking.The thread of auto-fiction vs an imagined novel by a professional writer of fiction is going through the whole book. Overall, it feels like an eternal topic. But it definitely has its place, especially in the case auto-fiction vs a traditional realistic novel. What Batuman brings to it is a kind of spirit of liberation and self-awareness. The novel concludes by Celine reading the foreword to The Portrait of a Lady and pondering that while James’s heroine did not want to write her own story, Celine would be different. She would like to write herself about her life and she would not want a Henry James imagining anything on her behalf. I guess in the case of “Portrait of a Lady”, the question which would remain open for me, if a prototype of a heroine indeed wanted to write that novel, would it be a better book as a result? Fortunately, we would never find out....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Oct 16, 2022","Oct 31, 2022","Oct 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58757675-either-or

A few months ago, I’ve come across this essay: “Distant VisionsAs it often happens, my first introduction to Mark De Silva happened purely by chance. A few months ago, I’ve come across this essay: “Distant Visions: Putdownable Prose and the State of the Art-Novel” by him. It’s immediately pulled me in in spite of being long and I’ve read it at the beginning to the end and re-read it again since. He was very persuasive in that essay and his view of the current state of literature has deeply resonated with me.Among other matters in the essay, Mark contemplates of two broad types within fiction - “the leisure” novels and the works of art. He defines the latter as the works with “the vision"". And here is getting more interesting how he defines “the vision”:“Vision” calls to mind such a range of things: thought, sense experience, first principles, imagination, discernment, invention, prescience, revelation. It’s this cluster of valences that explains the alchemical effects visionary works, fully appreciated, can have on us. Put simply—and I mean this as a retrieval of a critical ideal, not a novel proposition—such works are capable of reshaping our basic ways of experiencing and conceptualizing the world, ourselves, and the relation between the two. They don’t merely present us with new objects of experience or new information, offering fresh fodder for the mind, but extend and refine our experiential capacities themselves, whatever objects we train them upon.It is such an illusive and ungrateful game to try to define what constitutes a literary work of art. And, I think this ability “ to extend and refine our experimental capacities themselves” is the one of the best definitions I’ve seen.I really recommend reading this essay in full. So, being sufficiently impressed, I’ve decided to check what else Mark has written. And it’s appeared that he has just published his second novel. I knew I wanted to read it in spite of it being very hefty volume.I did read and enjoyed it. But by defining the “visionary” fiction so aptly, Mark has set up quite a bar for me to judge his work against. The book is a thousand pages first person account of the subjectivity of an artist. The protagonist stays unnamed throughout the novel. The word “artist” is probably the angle of his identity which defines him the most. But of course he is many other things as well: He is a thinker, young man, New Yorker, a relative loner, etc., etc. The novel starts when his girlfriend leaves him. Shortly he is approached by a businessman with the offer to cooperate. And he accepts the offer. Through this project he meets with two very different personalities, a young white actress and a black baseball player. They become the subjects of his art and potential faces of an advertising campaign using the art.This is more or less all that takes place in this novel in terms of the events. But the plot is not the main focus of this work, at least not until much later in the book. The novel starts very slowly and develops through an accretion of ideas, observations and thoughts of the main protagonist. My overwhelming impression of reading the first three quarters of this novel was of unhurried perception. Perception is what this artist is mainly doing and, respectively, I ended up doing through his eyes. For the big chunk of the book, its temporarity is slower than the events in real life would be. The protagonist would be contemplating a public notice in a train’s carriage, the quality of a certain art medium or for example the peculiarities of a taste of a certain drink. There are of course flashbacks of events; plenty of ideas and controversial opinions in his head to bite on. But the most interesting dimension for me was this heightened sense of observation of the world around. As an artist, it was not surprising that he has got very acute eye for unusual details. Also throughout the novel, the protaginist indulged himself in all sorts of visual spectacles from an art house movie to a few baseball games (the one was a video recording which took a few dozens of pages), a boxing match, a modern art exhibition. Respectively, as a readers we would witness all of this through his very unhurried, perceptive gaze. I have to admit that the baseball bit was the hardest for me to focus on. I know a few American writers who have included the game in their “state of the nation” novels. This one is not an exception. But the big chunk of it was waisted on me. Though I think I appreciate the reason it was the part of this novel’s context.The text might be challenging in terms of its lexicon - I’ve learned quite a few new words and terms. But otherwise, the language is pleasurably fluent, the sentences are well formed, descriptive, pensive, but without flourish or drudgery. I’ve heard in his interview, that the author wanted to write a 19th century novel in terms of style. He has achieved a certain fluency of the language and linearity of the plot. I am not sure the depth of characterisation expected from those novels is fully here. But I personally did not miss it. The main protagonist is certainly a voice and other characters possess sharpness and elusiveness that might compensate for the lack of psychological depth. Somewhere in the middle of the book, I’ve started to suspect that the narrator would fall into the category of “unlikable narrators”. The term is quite widely used and applied in the s. And indeed, I’ve recently come across a  using exactly this term in relation to the protagonist in this book. I personally struggle with the term in general as I find it quite lazy. There are of course the characters who are specifically designed by the author to be “unlikable” - sort of villains in a horror maybe. But in majority of cases, the characters are created by the author to be complex personalities with a nuanced set of views. Nabokov’s protagonists often are branded “unlikable”. But it so much simplifies the matter. Especially I find it confusing when this perceived “unlikability” of the character is the basis of the negative opinion for the whole work. The narrator of this novel has made me think again about this. Yes, I might not want to chose this narrator with his controversial opinions and often pathetic personality to be my friend. But he is not there for me to like him; and I do not feel compelled to find him “relatable”. He is there to think, to create new art and contemplate his creations. He is there to express a string of his opinions about the people he knows, the city and the country he lives in. As a reader, I might agree, disagree silently argue with him if I wish. But I am a guest in his subjectivity. So I look at the world through that specific prism which I would not normally use. And, coming back to the concept of “visionary” works, it might actually help me to understand better a new point of view behind all this “unlikabilty” of his persona.I do not know for sure the author’s intention. But my reading of the book was that by creating this personality for his narrator the author has found the way to touch upon the hypocrisy that often hides behind a certain well defined set of values; he would like us to look at the mirror, even if it might be not totally pleasant exercise.For example, the one of the key questions of the whole novel, in my view: would our world be better if it is more fair and neutral, more impartial? According to the narrator, since the Enlightenment, the prevailing progressive thinking was “that there were more neutral or universal ways of imagining people and things”. But he then asks: “to whom did we owe this search for neutrality? The longer I worked with Antral, the less interest I had in any sort of disinterest. More and more, Garrett and I both suspected that, deep in our hearts, most of us didn’t either, even when we knew in some way that impartiality might be more pleasant, more fair, for some people, that a greater number of their choices might be realized through it. Was fairness the prime good toward which all other aims must be bent? Was the fairest world the worthiest? Did getting what you want ipso facto better your life? Were our desires and our wills at all the best guides to our wellbeing? …Ultimately, it seemed to me that the exact depth of our interest in justice, as well as the value of happiness itself, was thrown into doubt by so much of how we comported ourselves. The world was as unjust and unhappy as it was precisely because we didn’t think such values trumped all else. No, they were just a couple of the many competing aims that guided a meaningful life.” I guess here by collective “we” he implies his group of progressive friends, artists, intellectuals, generally well educated and well do to left-leaning westerners. I would appropriate this collective identity for a time being as it is quite meaningful in this context. So he comes to the conclusion that we do not spend sufficient efforts to understand why the world the way it is. Moreover, we do not want to map this state of the world to our very individual actions and acknowledge that we, good people, might be partially complicit in this state. Rather, we prefer to feel good by appealing to the abstract general sense of justice somewhere out there. At maximum, we create art, write an article or very occasionally - march outside. So his question is if every single one of us is happy individually to drive our own car and to send our children to private schools to get them better education better start in life why do we expect some fundamental abstract justice to prevail?I can see a slight breakdown in logic in terms of the equivalence between the neutrality, disinterest and then justice in his analysis. But I certainly see that he has got a point in spite of it. The narrator claims that when he asked his friends a similar question, they become aloof and avoid serious discussion. He calls this problem “secular theodecy” as opposed to the religious theodicy of evil. Those hard questions are the core of this novel. And the perspective of this guy is often unpleasant but worthwhile thinking about.There are other interesting questions which he tries to approach a new. For example, what constitutes private vs public art: should a successful piece of art always be so ambiguous that it is impossible to get some common public message out of it? Do we not exaggerate a benefit of the uniqueness of individual interpretation?“It’s hard to find much agreement in contemporary art, but the value of ambiguity, or mystery, seems more or less universally celebrated. It’s democratic, letting the viewer fill in the gaps, supply his own meanings and make the work his own. How can this not be a good thing, overcoming the tyranny of intersubjective significance?”Coming back to “unlikability”, however, some more personal attitudes of this guy are plain gross - relationships with women, thoughts about friends and models. But it does not make his character less credible unfortunately. I did not “like” any of the other characters either. But there are quite a few vividly portrayed ones. And this is more entertaining. Only character I liked in this novel was New York. Yes, it is a very much New York novel. We see a lot of the city and its variety through the narrator’s eyes from Bronx to Long Island and everything in between. Those observations I found properly enjoyable and almost sweet. But be warned that it is another New York novel. The novel pace and temporarity speeds up quite a bit towards the end. Also the plot is resurfacing and starts to play a significant role in a whole. I personally did not welcome it. I’ve settled into my unhurried contemplation mood and even reconciled myself with an odd baseball game. Also “the resolution” as far as the plot is concerned did not take my breath away either. But there is a plot and it might encourage some other readers to take the plunge of reading a thick volume.The obvious parallel is with the masterpiece by Gaddis The Recognitions. I thought the author has intended a conversation with that work in terms of the place of commerce in art. I am not sure this conversation was particularly fruitful at the end as the relationship in “The Logos” between the main protagonist and his client seems to be quite pragmatic and might be intentionally unresolved within the novel. While Gaddis targets the higher spheres and Faustian bargains.From the essay, I gathered the author valued Javier Marías very highly. Reading this novel I thought I felt a strong Marias’s influence in constructing the narrator's personality and in the discursive style the novel cherishes. The same essay is quite critical of Karl Ove Knausgård:“For anyone with a good university education and an introspective bent, it’s hard to argue there is much that is deeply revelatory in My Struggle‘s ruminations.""I find hard to disagree having read all 6 volumes of it in spite of occasional rare moments of brilliance. However, in spite of this criticism, I felt the influence of Knausgaard on “The Logos” in terms of drinks, cigarettes and other minute occasional mundane details. Though it is nowhere near Knausgaard's level of repetition and it is not a book about the mundane in its substance. At the end, is it a visionary novel using Mark’s definition? It certainly thrives for it. I think it is almost there, but maybe next his novel would hit that bar more strongly. It gave me a lot of food for thoughts nevertheless and I plan to read his first novel Square Wave which is supposed to be quite different....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Oct 02, 2022","Oct 31, 2022","Oct 02, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60916369-the-logos

His writing style is unique - very precise and dense text, long sentences. Reading him requires a substantial concentration, but at the same time I find it mediative and unexpectedly addictive. I gathered his most famous novel is The Plains. But I came to his oeuvre sideways - so happened I’ve started with the A History of Books. Then I’ve read a story “In far fields” from Stream System: The Collected Short Fiction of Gerald Murnane. And now - I finished this book. I’ve started with his late, more abstract work. But I do not regret it.Murnane’s genius is that he reveals the way how he approaches writing explicitly within his fictions. It is all there for you to see how he composes. The reader is given access to his subject matter and, at the same time how he works with that. By doing it, he manages to create an illusion that the reader and the writer are doing their work simultaneously - he writes and you read. Or so it seems to me at least.I also think that Murnane fiction stems from the system he has created to understand reality. Many philosophers comprised their own systems to describe the universe including metaphysical part. This systematic view has unfortunately ended circa after Kant as it has become too confusing and contradictory. But Murnane’s system works for Murnane at minimum. And it certainly leads to very original writing.The following is how I understood Murnane’s system (he doesn’t use the word “system”, but it is easier for me to describe it this way):There are two worlds: visible world of people of “flesh and blood”, objects plus nature and invisible world existing in his mind. It is worth underlying that invisible world is as real to him as visible and it is populated by “images” he can see in his mind and feelings or other connections between some of those images. Images are certain clusters of objects and “personages” - those could be either totally out of his imagination or memories from his encounters or characters from the books he has read in his life. He does not like the word “characters” or “memories” as for him all those persons are simply “personages” of the same nature. In his story “In far fields”, he visualises this invisible world as a big green-grass space with the clusters of settlements (images) sometimes connected with the roads (feelings, associations). In his mind, he sees an image (in his sense of the word); he starts describing it by writing or he might see a totally different image straightaway. At some stage, he might realise how those images are connected or it might not happen. So when he writes he just moves around this mental map. But obviously he does not always manage to write the stuff down before it changes. That is why for him, the writing is not totally the same as the subject matter and the characters (or personages) are impossible to control almost in the same sense it would be impossible to control any “flash and blood” human. It is not the stream of consciousness as he does not associate his ego with what he sees. Ego’s role is just to write the stuff down. Consequently, he calls this type of writing “reporting” and the resulting work is “true fiction’. In this book, “A Million windows” he writes:I have never seemed able to do whatever it is that other persons seem to do whenever they think or claim to be thinking. I am capable only of seeing and feeling, although I can see and feel, of course, in both the visible and the invisible worlds … Only I can do is to select. This is no easy task, but I am mostly able, while struggling to keep in mind what I can only call an instinctive desire on my part to arrange the densest possible concentration of meaning on the fewest possible pages – I am mostly able to confine myself to reporting what I, whether as implied author or narrator, see fit to report.I find it all very fascinating both from purely fictional literary perspective and also from the insight how someone’s mind works. If you want an entry point into his later texts, I would recommend this short story “In far fields” from Stream System: The Collected Short Fiction of Gerald Murnane. It might be a gentle introduction into the intersection of his two worlds.""A Million Windows"" has been inspired by Henry James quote “The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million”.On the very superficial level, the action (or the lack of it) takes place in an imaginary house populated by imaginary writers each with the window of his/her own (not a room in this case). But it would not be Murnane I’ve described above if it would be just as simple as that. This is the one of the first paragraphs of this work:I have to admit that authors were withholding information from readers long before the first film-scripts were written. Long before cameras could record such scenes, solitary characters were reported as sitting in quiet rooms or trudging across lonely landscapes at the beginnings of works of fiction while the readers of those works looked forward to learning, all in good time, the names of those characters, their histories, and even their motives and deepest feelings. The narrator of this work of fiction wants no reader of the previous paragraph to look forward to learning any such details in connection with the personage mentioned there.And from there on, “the narrator of this work” starts to subvert any conventions or challenge our expectations what we think we know of fiction. I put “the narrator” in the quotation marks because again in Murnane’s world the narrator could never fully stand up for the author. But equally he does not like unreliable narrators either. He is also not a big fan of the fiction without any narrator’s voice. He finds it unconvincing. He deserves a special attention for the books with multiple narrators or the characters taking the storytelling in their hands. On this, he is especially difficult to impress I have to say. In this work, the narrator reminisces about reading a certain book: “I surely understood at the time that a close study of events and places and persons referred to in each monologue could have told me who was the presumed speaker of each and when, in the time-sequence of the whole work, each speaker could have been presumed to have delivered his or her outpouring. But I was just as surely hindered from doing so by the fact that each of the monologues, as I call them, was made up of the same unrelenting prose. Authors of fiction purporting to come from a medley of voices are seldom skilful enough to compose a distinctive prose for each supposed speaker.”You wouldn't probably guess that he is talking about One Hundred Years of Solitude. He does not mention the title. But from the description of the book it is more or less evident. His opinion might upset the numerous fans of that book and they might disagree. I personally do not remember it well enough. But his view has definitely reminded me of the highly praised novel published this year I’ve recently read. In that novel, four characters were giving an interior voice by the author. But three of them sounded exactly the same as each other in terms of their language. One might differentiate them by the context of course. But then what was the purpose of giving them that interiority if it did not create a voice unique for each individually? In ‘A Million Windows” Murnane often switches between single first person and the plural one narrators. Respectively he himself has managed to create a bit of a “medley”. Though, in his case, they are “reporters” of course, not the voices.“The word plot is seldom heard in the sporadic discussions that take place in this upper corridor of this remote wing of this building that remains largely unfamiliar to most of us. Many of us claim to find the word not only irrelevant but scarcely comprehensible.”Consequently, Dickens is admired but not as an example to follow. The writers in this “upper corridor” cannot comprehend how he managed to control his characters and neatly plan their lives. While these writers do not even try. Instead they ask the question: “why most fictional personages seem to behave unpredictably and not even as foreseen by those called, for convenience, their authors?”But Henry James receives a big firm “yes” from the crowd from the upper corridor in this house with million windows. especially for The Golden Bowl.However, this book is not an essay or literary criticism. All these literary musings are intertwined with “the images” and the stories describing them. The result might be read as many times as the amount of windows in the house of fiction. And each time you might find something new.I want to end this  with the little episode from ""In Far Fields"". First of all, it underlines once more this distinction Murnane makes between the subject matter existing in his “invisible world” and what comes out of it as his writing. Secondly, I am convinced all of us would be able to relate to this little story (maybe not to the last sentence though).More than thirty years ago, before I become a writer of books, I used to seek out persons who might talk with me about books. Whenever I was reading a book those days, I would hear in my mind the sound of myself talking in the future to someone about the book…. After I had become a writer of books, I was more wary of talking about books. I understood by then that each book I had written was not the book I had read in my mind before I had begun to write. …After I had begun to suspect these things, I seldom talked about books. .. I would point out a book to a person or would place a book in the hands of a person or would leave it where a person might come across it, but I would seldom talk about any of these books. Nowadays, I am more likely to hide books rather than put them in the way of people…...more",Notes are private!,2,50,1,"Sep 05, 2022","Sep 14, 2022","Sep 05, 2022",,Paperback with flaps,view (with text),/book/show/28542495-a-million-windows

Effortless reflections on language, words’ meaning, reimagining of the concepts such as boarders, old age and storytelling, all with humour, freshness and wonderful colours. And a moving love story at the end.Huge respect to the translator of this. ReviewI hope by all the theorising that follows I would not put off anyone from reading the book. It is a warm, humorous and moving novel and a pleasure to read. But below in more details what I found remarkable to add to this:LanguageIf in a few years someone would ask what I remember about this novel, I would likely to say - its language. I would say it was fresh and it was free to roam. This freedom is palpable on every page - the author plays with the words’ music, and their meaning. The structure of the narrative seems to be driven by free associations from people to ideas, from ideas to stories nested within the text, to things and back to people again. There are no preconceptions who can and cannot be a character, a narrator or even how long these personages are supposed to stay in the book. And all of this seems so effortless as if the pages are full of air. In fact in my copy there is a lot of empty space left between the individual chapters. And, I think it might be a deliberate choice.Even the syntax is fresh:The mark - or spot- which could be a bug, has appeared on the wall, and its legs - whisper-thin shadows- are digging a tunnel through the brick and mortar. Heat shines from its eyes and emanates faintly from the tunnel, and the meaning of emanates here is the way steam rises gently, and just the faintest trace of a low breath can hang suspended from it.I do not recall seeing such playful use of punctuation in English writing: dash, comma and hyphen - in one sentence. It is also remarkable how the author creates and image with the explanation for the“emanates”. The writing in each page of more than 700 pages this novel seems effortless. This made me think was it just spontaneous or so masterfully controlled? After finishing the novel and straightway re-reading the first chapter, I would think it was the latter. The author managed to condense in the first chapter the whole novel, but in away that one would probably not get until reading the whole thing. Such subtle craft to manage to control such a sprawling work in such a way that this practically seamless and weightless is even bigger achievement. A maximalist novel by a woman?Relatively recently, I’ve come across an umbrella term for a certain type of a lengthy novel - a “maximalist” novel. I think, the term is predominantly used in America. Sometimes, but not always it is a synonym with “systems” novel. I suspect it was created to describe the works by Gaddis, Pynchon, Foster-Wallace but also it might be applied to Perec or Bolano, for example. I could argue that Tristan Shady, Moby Dick or even Magic Mountain and Middlemarch might qualify under the definition below. Stefano Ercolino who wrote a book The Maximalist Novel: From Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow to Roberto Bolano's 2666 has identified the following among key features of these books: encyclopedism, exuberance, polyphony (and related to this - a multitude of characters), narratorial omniscience, imagination *, ethical commitment, hybrid realism and, as result - length. It is easy to guess that I admire this sub-genre, not only for its complexity. I would summarise it in a simpler way - each of these books create a fictional self-sufficient universe. There is a chaos within which the reader starts seeing patterns forming between ideas, knowledge, people and things. It is like inhabiting a big collective consciousness.Is ""The Tomb of Sand"" maximalist novel in this sense? I think so. It is not only a maximalist novel, it is the one with an octogenarian lady as a main character! I do not know many women who write this type of work. It might be just my ignorance of course. But in the 20th century I know only of Marguerite Young’s Miss MacIntosh, My Darling. So to read such a novel written by a woman from South East Asia is a real treat. There is also a difference - this work does not take itself as seriously as some other maximalist novels. Even philosophic commentary and the discourses such as feminism are presented with is a lot of self-deprecating humour: “But where is Ma ji? She was just here. A feminist soul might say that she wasn’t there before, either, hadn’t been for years, taking care of the house and children she was a wandering show whose self was, in reality missing. But a philosopher might get entangled in questions like who is real and who is the shadow, and has anyone ever known that? Can separate authentic life mot exist in every shade? Wittgenstein once said, I am happy to live at the foot of a mountain without ever aspiring to climb to the peak. But Ma’s children were not Wittgenstein the they would about quietly and wait, nor were they aforementioned feminists that they would say was missing before. Their belief was that Ma was physically here up till now, and since she’s no longer to be found in her bed, she’s gone missing.”That it is not to say that this novel lacks profundity. On the contrary - it manages to deal with difficult, sometimes tragic subject matter, but it does it in its unique way. The author also enriches the text with vibrant storytelling based on the millenniums-old local oral tradition.And the characters - there are a lot of them as in other maximalist novels. But not all of them are human:“All of these are characters in this story: the bug, the elephant, the compassion, the door, Ma, the cane, the bundle, Bade, Beti, the Reeboks that Bahu wore…” The one of the most lovable characters is a craw. It has also reminded me Pond in this aspect and the general admirable philosophical idea that any object possess a bit of a sentience. In terms of the formal structure, the Tomb of Sands consists of three parts. Each of this part has its own logic and its own distinctive pace, like changing tempo in a longer piece of music. But it is definitely the case when these parts belong to a single whole bigger than a sum of its parts. Interestingly, after finishing the book, I’ve looked back at the titles of each part and put them together. That gave me an additional “bulb” moment. Coincidentally, I was reading a piece fiction by Murnane where he mentioned that a title “ought to come from deep inside the piece; should have several meanings, and the reader should not learn these meanings almost until the whole of the piece has been read”. That was exactly the case with me with the titles of the parts, but also with the title of the book as whole. I am still thinking about the meaning of “The Tomb of Sand” (“Ret Samadhi” in the original) in relation to the novel.It looks like in the 21th century more women have started writing maximalist novels. Olga Tokarzhuk’s The Books of Jacob and but also Lucy’s Lucy Ellman’s Ducks, Newburyport come to mind. They bring in the lightness of touch, humour and female perspective into this sub-genre that used to be considered too cerebral or even boring by some readers before.PhenomenaIn this novel, the author is interested to examine certain phenomena of our experience. Inevitably, we define them in a language. For example, she asks what is customs, understanding, literature, a family or a story. And she provides us with a few paragraphs of mini-essay as an answer. But she is not simply inquires about the meanings. She reinvent them. She shows that the “definitions” we accept directly affect the way we live. And we should not take them for granted. It is indeed in our power to redefine meanings through language or at least to stop and think what a word actually might mean and why. Another writer from quite a different culture who was interested in this type of phenomenology was Milan Kundera. It might sound very strange to compare them. And one might come up with a lot of caveats for such a comparison. But when I did, I had this uncanny feeling that they do converse and complement each other: Border Shree: “Do you know what a border is? What is a border? It’s something that surrounds an existence, it is a personal perimeter. No matter how large, no matter how small. The edge of a handkerchief, the border of a tablecloth, beds of flowers in this yard. A picture frame. Everything has a border…It is meant to illuminate both sides. …A border does not enclose, it opens out. It creates shape. It adorns the edge. This side of the edging blossoms, as does that…. What is a border? It enhances a personality. It gives strength. It does not tear apart. A border increases recognition. Where two sides meet and both flourish…”Kundera: ""It takes so little, so infinitely little, for a person to cross the border beyond which everything loses meaning: love, convictions, faith, history. Human life—and herein lies its secret—takes place in the immediate proximity of that border, even in direct contact with it; it is not miles away, but a fraction of an inch"" (The Book of Laughter and Forgetting).Forgetting:Shree:  “That’s how forgetting works. You can forget whatever you wish to. Even that you had wished to forget. A border is drawn all-around that memory and no method remains to reach it any longer, provided that you don’t stagger across. On purpose or not. And even if you do stagger, that initial memory doesn’t remain, it’s a reinvented memory.“Kundera: “Before it becomes a political issue, the will to forget is an anthropological one: man has always harbored the desire to rewrite his own biography, to change the past, to wipe out tracks, both his own and others'. The will to forget is very different from a simple temptation to deceive…Forgetting: absolute injustice and absolute solace at the same time.” (Unbearable lightness of being).One could go deeper to understand why such different writers from different time and place pick up the same words to reflect on and come up with such a complementary views. It is a question worth thinking about. Border and the need to redefine it as something unifying as opposed to something separating is the key gravitational point of “The Tomb of Sand”. The book deals with many dimensions of this phenomenon. In 1947 Indian continent has been partitioned between what is now India and Pakistan. This new physical border has resulted in a tragedy, displacement and death of the millions. This is still a wound for many people on both sides. The tragedy gave rise to the whole body of so-called Partition literature. This novel can be considered as a part of it. It also refers to other older texts, the powerful works that are classics now. There is wonderful, phantasmagorical chapter where the authors and some characters from these texts become minor characters in this novel. It is an inspiration and a potential reading list for people like me.However, apart from the meaning of the border in a historical context, the novel points on the other dimension. Bound by her culture, tradition, her native language one inevitably “create a border in her mind” around certain concepts, meanings or even values. It is important to be aware that it is just a certain framing. This framing is affected by the context we are in. And what this novel is very good at - it takes some of those concepts one by one and tries to look at it a fresh. And often it works - the book “loosens the borders with which we frame the world”**.Translation.I need to mention once more my admiration for the translator of this book, Daisy Rockwell. Roberto Calasso, once said: The mark of a good translation is not its fluency but rather all those unusual and original formulations that the translator has been bold enough to preserve and defend.” I believe Daisy has done all of that and more. She managed to convey the vibrancy of the language, the verbal play, the syntax and even the multilingual aspect of the original work.She has also made a brilliant, very apt artwork for the cover of the Indian edition which I’ve selected for this .And now: “The crux of the matter is that those who haven’t cared to read this far are advised not to read ahead either. But for those who relish colours and paths, why should they stop? Like musical notes that go several directions in a single rage. Such pleasure, such pain in them. Another raga meanders to join the first. The new line makes one sway, so that the first becomes a sweet memory. Echoes and reverberations of melodies cross every border. Melodies change, music remains. Death comes, life goes on. A story is created, changes, flows. Free. From this side to that.”————————*He used the term “paranoid imagination” - I certainly think that imagination does not to have the paranoid one, so I extended his definition a bit **The quote belongs to someone I’ve read on-line talking about this book. But I cannot now find.Additional info:Prominent South Asian writers referred in the novel. I believe it would be a part of my future reading list.

The passage from the book I admired:""…there was a painter, Bhupen Khakkar. He told stories with brush…He knew that a story cannot be locked into a box, or a canvas, or a gaze. So he never tried. On the contrary, he always left a small window, an empty space, so the story could move on at will and take another path if it so desired. Because stories never end. They jump through windows and cracks…or create them by shaking, causing the earth to quake""I’ve looked up his paintings and they did not disappoint. He has had an exhibition in Tate Modern, London in 2016. Here is fascinating essay about him by Amit Chaudhuri:https://www.theguardian.com/artanddes...More Quotes from ""The Tomb of Sand"":Every part of the body has a border. So does heart. A border surrounds heart. A border but it also binds it to the other parts. It doesn’t wrench the heart from the rest. Fools! If you cut border through heart, you don’t call it a border, you call it a wound…Sometimes when we read literature as literature, we realise that stories and tales and lore don’t always seek to blend themselves with the world. Sometimes they march to their own blend. They don’t have to be contemporary or complementary or congruent or connubial which the real world. Literature has a scent, a soupçon, a je ne sais quoi, all its own.But this is the world, it never lets up. The world is in dire need of literature because literature is a source of hope and life. So the world finds a way to dissolve into literature via harum-scarum hidden-open paths. It quietly ends up soaked in the stuff. It tiptoes into literatureCustoms fit memory. So that no one remembers what had happened, they may not even know, but the heart feels fear thereafter, century after century… The customs carries on even when the rational has ended… Machismo is hidden in the layers of nearly every custom, and its repulsiveness makes it not less macho… Joyousness grew fearful, the dance collapsed, happiness faded and from this mixture the next generation was born, which does not know the reason for the mixture but has already acquired its nature.Each person is a reflection of their own time, but also separate from it. A mirror has many angles and bends and corners, so many unthinkable, one has no idea whose reflection one sees and how it came to appear there; if you don’t know how to look at it crooked, you’ll never guess. In the silver of a mirror shines a sliver of time, and it a snap of the fingers there’s another snippet, another wrinkle, another baggy bit. The twisty-turns cradle of the glass it also time. Very speed is also time, even if it’s swinging swaying slipping spinning soaring swimming, and women: what to say of them?

But it seems to me, it is an example how to imaginatively recycle the cast offs of an academic research (the bits that might not pass a test of vigour) into a creative piece of writing. And i mean it is a compliment in this particular case.As a novel, it is hardly groundbreaking - it consist of small fragments devoted to a prominent woman of culture or a group of them during roughly the first three decades of the 20th century. Each fragment is either in a form of a factoid (we do not know fictional or not) or an observation. Together, they do not necessary aggregate into a bigger common picture as it is often the case with this type of a novel. In fact, the author is ambivalent to assign her work to any particular genre like some of her protagonists. But I found the writing luminous and rhythmic; the observations quite special and the facts curious. So it kept me turning the pages. Here is an example - a randomly chosen passage I’ve just picked up by opening the book:“Eleonora Duse has been so many women that she could understand and sorrow: an actress is someone who carries ghosts for a living. Even if she is tired and ill, she remains a prism of other selves” (p 144)Implicitly or explicitly, Sappho plays an important role in the lives of these women. The book is peppered with the surviving fragments of her poetry. Another literary device chosen to echo the ancients is that the narrator’s voice is presented as “we” (second person plural). On one level, it is the obvious reference to the greek chorus. On another level, I found it a bit more confusing. It is relatively rare to see “We” as the main narrative voice. In my recent reading history, I remember it only two cases when it was successful. Once it was in The Years Ernaux where it represented the collective voice of the generation. It was very effective and relevant. Another time in Checkout 19. There, it was used only in a few parts just to add an additional dimension to the internal voice of the main protagonist. Here, it took me a while to understand who were those “We”. It was obvious pretty quickly it was a collective voice. But whom it belonged to? The prominent women each had their own third person voice. “We” were not the voice of the generation, not the voice of all the women of the generation, not even the voice of all the lesbian women of that generation. “We” was important though as it gave the main point of view of the whole book. Slowly, it was becoming clearer and clearer who were they (or “we”). And only in the last chapter I’ve read the following:“While we would admit to being vain, naive, spoiled, romantic, and arrogant, we were not lost souls. We had been fighting for decades, sometimes desperately, for the rights to our own lives. …It was 1928 and we insisted to Natalie, it was time for books where we could poetically be everyone at once. “It actually characterises this group of women very accurately. The novel was written on behalf of well-off, educated, creative and sensual women (but also “vain, arrogant and spoiled”) who were opening up to a queer side of their identity and started to reflect this in their imaginative creative work (paintings, writing, dance etc). The prominent individual women featured in this book were their role-models in these endeavours. I am not totally sure this “we” voice has added anything to my personal enjoyment of the text. But at least it defined at the end the scope this work actually explores.This leads me to the next point - there are many potential angles here which this book does not attempt to consider. It is sometimes a very deliberate choice to make a point. On other occasions, it seems just not within the scope of the authorial intention. This book does not explore working class lesbians; it does not explore working class woman who helped our “we”- women in their daily life. In fact there is one maid mentioned and her memoirs brought about. But it seems she is used just to share her memories about the habits of her ladies.The passage below has brought a smile to my face. I really hope it was ironic. But this wasn't totally clear. In any case, it definitely characterises the other features of these “we”-women apart from their creative talents:“After an acquisition of another building Eva things of course it was not right Eva told herself as she looked out to sea, to expect all Greeks to revere the ancient verses. Some part of populace would want cheap modern things, ragtime and motion pictures and mail order stockings. … The woman of lesbos did not recite in dactylic pentameter and the girls were not nymphs mumbling in violets. As far as Eva could tell, these Lesbians were utterly ordinary, with no fragment of Sappho flickering anywhere in them. This was the lament that Eva tried to still in her heart.”And men. They are deliberately excluded it seems. In the bibliography, the author says: “Man like d’Annunzio who swaggers pre-potently through every account ever written of Duse and Brooks - do not merit even a footnote about who they married and how they died. Vita Sackville-West said: “Only revenge one could take on a certain man to brazenly rewrite them”However, some of the historical figures featuring were at minimum bisexual. Therefore men have played a big role in their lives including their creative life. So to exclude them all together it actually to exclude a significant dimension from the source of their creativity, and, respectively - the depiction of their personality. It brings up the old question how one should judge the work of fiction: by what is there or by what is not there? I am bit conflicted in this case. But the fairer part of me goes for the first option. The author set out the scope of her novel as it was. I think she has affectively reached her goal to celebrate a specific group of people. To some extent, it takes the depth out of the narrative. But I think the pathos and the element of the literary history in this work was more important to her than the depth.The general thread of this narrative is Sappho-Cassandra-Lina Poletti. The first two do not need an introduction. The third is “violent, luminous wave”. And you can read the book or look up who she was. This trio bears the main symbolism of this work as far as I can see it - a fearless feminine creative spirit is getting reincarnated through the centuries. (Orlando of course got a mention as well as a half of Woolf’s oeuvre. ). This spirit inspires other people, breaks new boundaries and help in the fight to make this world better place (let’s hope). That is as soon as these women are timely listened to (unlike Cassandra).Overall I enjoyed reading this book but I cannot say it was an event of the year for me.

By the way, I've just noticed that Henry James has got a book with that title. Kundera muses about his favourite writers, the destiny of his native country and the Eastern and Central Europe in general under the Soviet control and compares the perception on writing of his French colleagues with his own.The writers he thinks very highly off and discuss here is Rabelais, Cervantes, Flaubert, Kafka, Musel and Broch. He also compares Central European Baroque and its historical roots with Latin American one. According to him, both have grown from the combination of the cruelty and search for idealism in different forms. ""Mysterious combination of evil and beauty"". He finds the continuity between central European writers of the 20-30s and Latins American ones in the 60-70s.He also shows that the European novel was developed like a rally with the button passed from one writer to another notwithstanding the different languages. Roughly from Rabelais to Cervantes to Stern to Flaubert to Joyce. (I am writing from the memory, so highly likely I've missed many. The main point was that the different languages were not the issue; moreover the remoteness from the national context has helped to develop the craft and boost cross-fertilisation and inventiveness.He also remembers the existential feeling when the Russians have invaded in 1968 and he thought that his country would not exist anymore at all.

My little pocket paperback with garish pink cover has fallen into pieces as I was flipping the pages back to the characters’s cast at the beginning and re-reading the passages or the whole chapters.It is a magnificent novel. A phantasmagoria that tells its truth better than any realism. The text that could be a bit frustrating at times with its sheer baroque excess, but then it shines at you with all its dark beauty causing physical goosebumps. In his essay “Intertextual irony and level of reading”, Umberto Eco dwells on “certain characteristics of socalled post-modern novel”. He is not totally happy with this label, so later he refers simply to the books he tends to write. It has been quite a while since the essay was written and I would agree with him - the label “post-modern” is much too narrow for the phenomena he describes. Let’s just say that I tend to enjoy the novels combining the elements he mentions. Eco names the following features: meta-narrative, dialogism, “double coding” and intertextual irony.Meta-narrative - “a reflection that the text carries out on itself and its own nature, or the intrusion of the authorial voice reflecting on what it is narrating.” Eco points that it has nothing to do with the label “post-modern”. The technique was used by Homer.Dialogism (“citationism” in its most direct form) - when the text conducts a dialogue with the other literary texts in any possible form. This is what we call now “intertextuality”. But again, according to Eco, it has nothing to do with “ the post-modern”. For example, dialogism can be found in The Divine Comedy in a passage when Dante was modelling a Provencal poet by writing in the respective style and language.Double coding - Apparently the term was coined by Charles Jencks for post-modern architecture that:“speaks on at least two levels at once: to other architects and a concerned minority who care about specifically architectural meanings, and to the public at large, who care about other issues concerned with comfort, traditional building and way of life. The “post-modern” building or a work of art addresses simultaneously a minority using “high” codes, and mass public using “popular” codes.”A work of literature can operate on those two levels as well: the popular code - a genre, plot or even social themes. The high code can be found as, Eco put it, in the “arty” stylistic devices such as leaping stylist registers, different narrative voices, stories nested within each other, the aforementioned intertextuality, etc. As a result the readers who are interested only in the popular code might still enjoy the book without appreciating that the high code even exists. I would think that at the same time the readers who can appreciate the high code might either admire the both levels or would not particularly care for the popular one. Often, an individual reading experience would be somewhere on this spectrum.I allowed myself such a lengthy digression because “Terra Nostra” seamlessly combines all of these features. There is plenty of meta-narrative but it does fit organically into the text. In some other novels meta-narratives are didactic and stick out like a thorn in the flesh. Not here. Let’s take for example this passage about the infinite game of stories perpetuating more stories. It starts with reference to 50 tales in Don Quixote:“Fifty accounts are accounts beyond count. For from each account came twenty others, inopportunetely, tempestuously, unseasonably, and each story contained as many others: the story told by the night, the story lived by the knight, the story told to the knight, the story the night read about himself in the press in Barcelona, the oral and anonymous version of the story told as pure verbal imminence before the knight existed, the version written in the papers of an Arabic chronicler, and based upon that, the version of a certain Cide Hamete, the version which to the knight’s anger a shameless wretch by the name of Avellaneda had written apocryphally; the version the Squire Panza endlessly recounts to his wife, thus filling her to bursting with both intangible illusions and everyday proverbs; … the story that from his particular point of view Merlin the magician tells about those same events, the story the giants challenged by the knight tell among themselves….; the story dreamed by Dulcinea imagined herself as a farm girl…and finally the story staged again and again, for the amusement of their court..”It starts simply and ends up as an amazing comment on the nature of story telling, even more generally - on the nature of truth.I am tired of the texts where intertextuality means broadly name-dropping. The author would stuff his work with phrases like “as Kafka would say…”or, slightly more subtly: “he felt like K. in a castle.” I feel frustrated with the novels where there are dozens of such occurrences. Intertextuality for me is something very different, a subtle allusion something that leads to a discovery; something that raises curiosity, requires a detective work, an urge to try to find out more. This brings a pure aesthetic pleasure. Recognising a name or a title on the page brings only the feeling of self-gratification.This novel is a wonder in this respect. It subverts the classical texts, it quotes without citation, it engages. It brings up not only the works of literature. The one of the central symbols of the novel is a painting “The garden of earthy delights” by Bosch. And the way how the painting is integrated into the main body of the novel, the description of it, is striking. I've also learned, for example, of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (12 November 1648 – 17 April 1695) a Mexican writer, philosopher, composer and poet of the Baroque period, and Hieronymite nun. Apparently, her contributions to the Spanish Golden Age gained her the nicknames of ""The Tenth Muse” (wiki). And she was not named at all, but there were a few lines of a poetry recited by the one of the characters with the reference to another character who has become a nun in the New World after the Conquest. This has sent me on a trail and I was very grateful to be on it.And the “double-coding” - yes, totally. There is a plot, there is a bunch of colourful characters and ideas. But the “high code” is that what made me thrilled: a masterful use of the second person on occasion, the stories nested within the stories, polyphony of voices, the masterful architecture of the whole novel and its symbolism - all of this was magical. I do not think Fuentes used a deliberate set of constraints like Oulipo, but the feature I found fascinating was he played with the numbers. 1001 and 33 play their role for example. But 3 was the one which was a key of a sort: 3 parts of the novel, a triplets playing a key role instead of the usually used doppelgängers, 3 people of Spain’s Golden age - the Christians, Muslims and Jews; 3 religions (Christianity, Kabbala and the Aztecs), the Bosch’s painting is a triptych. In addition, he has built the foundation of his novel on 3 main novels of Spanish Golden age. The two of the characters are named after La Celestina by Rojas and Don Juan from The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest by Tirso de Molina and of course there is Don Quixote who is also appears in the novel, but in the role of himself.Fuentes is a real master. But it would be a just another great novel if it did not move me to tears a few times. It is not a sad book but it is dark and beautiful. This mysterious combination made it for me. I was reading a chapter called “The Chronicler” and it hit me how the beauty and the meaning comes together, how gracious and harmonious it was. On another occasion, closer to the end, there was a chapter “Ashes” told from the second person, the intertwined, circular story of Mexico as a place and as a self-perpetuating fate. Part of it was told almost cinematically - like a scene shot by a camera from certain vintage point. It was dark, it was vertigoes and it was very profound. It made me think that there were the periods of history when people viscerally feel their lives is just the part of something larger, something worth fighting for even if this fight is desperate from their individual point and longer than a life.It is difficult to quote this book. The beauty in this case is the text, not a word or a sentence. But here is the passage from “The Chronicler”:Poverty: he who praises you had never seen you. A battered beetle, an insect lying overturned on its hard, armour-plated back, waving its numerous legs…A different scheme, to cease to exist and to begin to be; a different scheme, paper and pen. This is what he was thinking as he wrote an exemplary novel that had everything and nothing to do with what he was thinking; paper and pen in order - at any price - to be; to impose no more or no less than the reality of the fable. The incomparable solitary fable, for it resembles nothing and is related to nothing, unless it be the stokes of the pen upon the paper; a reality without precedents, without equal, destined to be destroyed with the papers upon which it exists. And nevertheless, because this fictitious reality is the only possibility for being, for ceasing merely to exist, one must struggle boldly, to the point of sacrifice, to death, as great heroes and the implausible knights-errant struggled, so that others believe in it, so that one may tell the world: this is my reality, the only true and unique reality, the reality of my words and their creations. Every person who would read this would see a different picture. Someone would pick up the allusion to ""Metamorphoses"" by Kafka. Another person would think of the social message of this passage. The third - about the writer’s calling. The list could continue indefinitely. But in my case, it reminded me of another book I’ve read recently, a memoir by a young man who survived a modern concentration camp in Donetsk The Torture Camp on Paradise Street. He was tortured, humiliated. They tried to deprive him of basic human dignity. But he was writing. He was writing a surreal play on a carton packaging boxes with a blunt pencil. He knew they would take his writing away from him before they move him and he probably would not see his written play even again. But for him his “fictitious reality was the only possibility for being”. And he has lived....more",Notes are private!,8,81,1,"Jul 08, 2022","Jul 27, 2022","Jul 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2469386.Terra_Nostra

Not quite modernist yet, more on the way towards existentialism, deeply psychological, honest, funny, and well written. It is also a hymn to the individualism and so unlike the contemporary Soviet literature that was toggling between the social realism and absurdism. It is such a tragedy that the life of this author was cut short so cruelly by the gulags. It is one of those novels where a city takes the role of an independent character. When I was reading it I was thinking it was not quite Ulysses, more like A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. And I felt so sad that this author would never write his “Ulysses”. Though he had it in him. It is almost palpable from this text.It is about Kyiv in the 20s. And the whole place feels on the pages of this book more like Weimar Republic rather than some place in the Soviet Union. The novel also has reminded me of The Gift by Nabokov written approximately at the same time in Berlin. Both main characters are ambitious young writers. Both quite unpleasant to put it mildly, but very talented. But while Nabokov’s character possess all the social capital possible, Stepan, the protagonist of Pidmohilny is a village orphan who comes to the big city for the first time. So the story even more intriguing from this perspective - he quickly obtains all necessary glamour anyway. When Nabokov goes into intertextuality, Pidmohylny is dwelling more on psychology of his character. Nabokov digs into the past, Pidmohylny looks into the future. However, both of those young men share their ambition and egocentrism as well as their lasting loyalty to literature only.The language is lyrical and rich. There is a music on the sentence level. This novel has been rediscovered in Ukraine after the end of the Soviet empire, I hope the book would be re-translated and republished soon.

It tries to find a connection through the 20th century from Eurasian movement of the emigrants in the 20s and to Lev Gumilev's pseudo-scientific paradigms of the 70-80s and to the modern day with Dugin and co. The author did not convince me all these ""theories"" are connected, never-mind begotten from each other. But the story is well told. The most interesting, shorter parts were about Trubetskoy, the linguist and the duke and about Gumilev-junior life. Gumilev, the son of Anna Akhmatova, an iconic Russian poetess and Nikolay Gumilev, another poet shot in the 20s. Lev has spent almost all his youth in gulag. He went there twice. He joked that once he went to pay who was his father and the second time - mother. He was released after Stalin death in the 50s. And since then he studied ancient tribes. Crudely He claimed that the Russians are ancestors from the Eastern hordes from the Steppe. And that is where Russia belongs to, not the West. He has become substantially anti-semitic in the second part of his life. He did not talk to Akhmatova for the last 6 years of her life. Counter-intuitively he was very saddened when the Soviet Union collapsed. I am not sure whether it was because a Stockholm syndrome or a nostalgy about the greatness of the Empire. Interesting, very tragic and quite odious character.But the big part is devoted to the later years, Dugin and other figures in the post-soviet Russia. He was an Nazi in his Soviet youth. Then decided to combine it with the orthodox christianity in some proportions, updated his views on the thinking of the post-war radical right like Julius Evola and some French of Belgium character. I do not remember his name, but cannot be bothered to check again. It has moved from the open aggressive racism to open aggressive nationalism combined with imperialism. Another defining feature of all of this is against so-called 'antlantism"". Dugin has branded himself as a scientist and has written a lot. The most famous is Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia: English Translation where he pondered about who is supposed to take it all eventually. It was not taken seriously initially but has become progressively more and more on demand as Russia moved back towards aggressive totalitarism (or whatever you want to call it). According to Dugin Russians are so special:“we are less pragmatic (the Russians), less calculating than representatives of other peoples, and we have bigger hearts. Maybe this is a reflection of the grandeur of our country and its boundless expanses. Our people have a more generous spirit."" Amplified by the mass media, the message was hammered home over and over again: Russia is unique, Russia is different, Russia is superior, Russia is under attack, Russia must defend itself [the comments from the author].”He was of course not the first who quipped such things. Apart from anything else it was all over some prominent writers since 19th century minimum. Dostoyevsky comes to mind as a first reference, but the list is frustratingly long. When I was reading this part about Dugin and co, my prevailing feeling was of a revulsion. Prevailing thought was that all this ""theory is a plethora of science but in essence the mixture of messianic exceptionalism with the right-wing rhetoric borrowed from you guessed the west radical right."" This is from this book. So ""all I've taken before for the mysterious enigmatic Russian soul, all that messianism is appeared to be an ordinary fascism"". Not sure where I've seen this sentence first. It is not mine. But indeed I totally agree with it based upon this book and the current events.Here is the one from Dugin on the subject:I cannot be bothered to write more about all of this. Just leave a few excepts from the book here.Excepts:According to Dugin:‘lunar Putin’ – a concept he seems to have concocted in the midst of his social-media rage: There are two identities to Putin – the patriotic, heroic (solar) and the one inclined toward liberalism and compromises of the West (lunar). Therefore it is impossible to rule out that the decision to dismiss me was taken by one half, obviously the lunar … The solar Putin is the saviour of Russia during the Second Chechen Campaign, liberator of Ossetia and Abkhazia, and hero of the Crimea. The lunar … Let everyone himself guess where the lunar is …course, we are less pragmatic, less calculating than representatives of other peoples, and we have bigger hearts. Maybe this is a reflection of the grandeur of our country and its boundless expanses. Our people have a more generous spirit.8 Amplified by the mass media, the message was hammered home over and over again: Russia is unique, Russia is different, Russia is superior, Russia is under attack, Russia must defend itself.Liberalism is ‘an updated version and continuation of a Western universalism that has been passed from the Roman Empire, Medieval Christianity, modernity in terms of the Enlightenment, and colonization, up to the present-day’, wrote Dugin in what was probably his most significant book since The Foundations of Geopolitics, entitled The Fourth Political Theory, published in 2009.19 Drawing on his readings of the European New Right, Dugin channelled the philosophy of as many ex-Nazis as he could lay his hands on – the political theories of Carl Schmitt, the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, the geopolitical theories of Karl Haushofer, and the traditionalism of Julius Evola – into a profoundly anti-liberal metaphysical project...In Dugin’s capable hands, Mackinder was transformed from an obscure Edwardian curiosity who never got tenure at Oxford, into a sort of Cardinal Richelieu of Whitehall, whose whispered counsels to the great men of state provided a sure hand on the tiller of British strategic thinking for half a century, and whose ideas continue to be the strategic imperatives for a new generation of secret mandarins. In addition to Mackinder, there were the opposing geopoliticians profiled by Dugin, mostly German, who argued from the same logic as Mackinder but in defence of continental land power rather than global sea power. These included Friedrich Ratzel, a late nineteenth-century German geographer who coined the term Lebensraum, or ‘living space’, which later was co-opted as an imperative by the Third Reich. The second generation of geopolitical writings earned the theory a lingering association with Nazism. Mackinder’s contemporary Karl Haushofer was a German army general and strategic theorist who was a strong proponent of a three-way alliance between Berlin, Moscow and Tokyo.Dugin’s main argument in Foundations came straight from Haushofer’s pages: the need to thwart the conspiracy of ‘Atlanticism’ led by the US and NATO and aimed at containing Russia within successive geographic rings of newly independent states. The plan was simple: first put the Soviet Union back together, counselled Dugin, and then use clever alliance diplomacy focused on partnerships with Japan, Iran and Germany to eject the United States and its Atlanticist minions from the continent. The key to creating ‘Eurasia’ is to reject a narrow nationalistic agenda which could alienate potential allies. He quoted New Right theorist Jean-François Thiriart, who said ‘the main mistake of Hitler was that he tried to make Europe German. Instead, he should have tried to make it European.’ Russia, it followed, would not be making a Russian Empire, but a Eurasian one.3 ‘The Eurasian Empire will be constructed on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, the strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us’, wrote Dugin.Foundations was premised on the notion – an easy sell to a conspiracy-mad reading public – that real politics took place behind a veil of intrigue, according to rules that the elites and regimes of the world had internalized for centuries behind their bastions of privilege, but were loath to demonstrate publicly. It came with all the esoteric trappings of an initiation to secret wisdom: runic inscriptions, arcane maps with all manner of arrows and cross-hatching, introductions to unheard-of grey cardinals of world diplomacy. But there were just enough actual facts in support of the fantastic conclusions for the reader (I must admit, I was one) to be instantly intrigued – just as players at a Ouija board are often most impressed when the planchette lands on some fact of which they are already aware.German-Russian alliance would reorient Europe away from Atlantic influence and towards Eurasia. France would be encouraged to orient towards Germany, which would cement the Eurasian vector of Europe around a ‘Moscow–Berlin–Paris’ axis: The tendency towards European unification around Germany [Dugin never uses the term ‘European Union’] will have positive significance only on one fundamental condition – the creation of a firm geopolitical and strategic Moscow–Berlin axis. By itself Central Europe does not have enough political and military potential to gain independence from the Atlantic United States.Why empire? The essence of a uniquely messianic nation. Outside empire Russians lose their identity and disappear as a nation. Author:Helped by large oil surpluses and the devaluation of the rouble in 1998, Russia’s economy began to boom. The elusive middle class that Western reformers hoped would be a bulwark of democracy and civil society was instead fashioned by an authoritarian, paternalistic system. Rising incomes were supposed to lead to greater acceptance of liberal values. But the opposite was happening. The new middle class thought they owed their better fortune to Putin and to the social compact they believed they had made with him – giving away their freedoms in exchange for rising incomes. Products of the 1990s, they associated democracy with social anarchy and impoverishment.According to one study [beginning of 00s], ‘A mood which was formerly concentrated in the Soviet Communist subculture and limited to those with poor education, low income, and non-urban groups, has started to penetrate the layers of society which until recently acted as the agents of modernization’.1 Some 79 per cent of Russians, for example, felt the end of the USSR to have been a mistake, compared with 69 per cent in 1992; 56 per cent saw NATO as a ‘bloc of aggression’ rather than a defensive alliance, an 18 percentage point rise since 1997. One of the largest subcategories to subscribe to this view included those with higher education (68 per cent). Increasingly, nationalism was becoming the centre of gravity in Russia’s domestic politics, and the Kremlin struggled to keep pace with this mood. The Kremlin’s efforts to centralize power were mirrored in the centralization of the production of images and symbols. Pavlovsky was the public face of the Kremlin’s efforts at political technology, and during Putin’s first term he and his Kremlin handlers oversaw a shift in politics and the media away from the liberal parties and voices of the Yeltsin era, and towards a preponderance of more conservative and nationalist figures, to which they recruited Dugin and his Eurasianists....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"May 31, 2022","Jun 30, 2022","May 31, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25074760-black-wind-white-snow

The author is currUpdate @April 2024The English translation of this book has been made a finalist of PEN America translation prize and deservedly so. The author is currently at the front fighting Russian full scale invasion. He has volunteered as a simple soldier. The book does not only tell what happens in the camps on the Russian controlled territories and what in store for the people if more would fall in Russian hands. It also shows what happens insight a human being subject to such a torturous environment on a philosophical level. It has to be read widely. The original :I am sitting here, in a spacious room with aroma of coffee and a grass after rain, with the window open into a green summer day, trying to write about something which i know I would not be able to comprehend; knowing that on this green summer day somewhere else the horrors described in this book are still taken place; knowing how pathetic would be anything i can say; knowing that for the young man who wrote the book this exact moment might be the moment when “You do not know when this thought will get into you, grabs your neck and put you head down into hopelessness: it could be a bath, a market, a metro. Any small thing can get you out of yourself and connect a moment of tiredness with what you’ve been through. And then everything is simple: like touching a rosary beads you go through possible options how to leave this world.If one tries to speak poetically, such minutes remind a summer garden in which suddenly all the birds fall completely quiet, the world around becomes completely silent and you are left absolutely alone.” It is almost meaningless to try to write about this book. It will be soon available in translation. It will be called: “The Torture Camp on Paradise Street”.Here is the link to a fragment:https://laofbooks.org/article/v...And I hope everyone would read it when it is available in full. But I’ve read the whole book already twice. And I’ve read the last essay many more times. And I keep thinking about it. So I write these words, maybe just for my own sake. I do not know. But I feel I need to do it.Aseyev, in his not full 30 years, is a great writer. But he also a philosopher. Maybe that is the reason why in his writing he is not only telling individual episodes and the stories. He also tries to contemplate why and how such a place could exist and function.What torture does to people. So happened that I’ve read recently read Amery""s At the Mind's Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor on Auschwitz and Its Realities also:“Whoever has succumbed to torture can no longer feel at home in the world. The shame of destruction cannot be erased. Trust in the world, which already collapsed in part at the first blow, but in the end, under torture, fully, will not be regained. That one’s fellow man was experienced as the anti man remains in the tortured person as accumulated horror. It blocks the view into the world in which the principle of hope rules. One who was martyred is a defenceless prisoner of fear. It is fear that henceforth reigns over him. Fear - and also what is called the resentments. They remain and have scarcely a chance to concentrate into a seething purifying thirst for revenge. “Aseyev, he was also thinking of revenge.“I talked to many prisoners and the majority agreed that if they would have a chance of revenge, they would not hesitate a single second. You see yourself in the faces of those people in balaclavas, in your understanding that in the moment of torture or simply their laughter, you are ready to do even more cruel things to them. It so happened that every new day of torture and humiliation was a stimulus to survive the next one.”But that was exactly the reason why he thought it is was not a good idea to succumb to revenge at the end. “Not the higher moral grounds, or God or the law, but the risk that glance (that ability to see this reflection) would disappear.” What helped him to survive is occasional ability to write even if not to keep his writing. All the stuff he has written in the captivity was confiscated before he was exchanged. What also helped, and maybe even more, was the thoughts about death. He was constantly coming back to the idea that they could totally dehumanise him, deprive him of everything. But they could not take away his last right - the right to die.  “The readiness to die was depriving me off its real necessity and brought me some peace of mind.” It was deeper than a suicide as even that was not an option. They were under the constant monitoring. But that existence of death he found comforting.He notes that the more intellectual, creative the person is the harder it is to deal with the camp. Amery as well talked about it. And probably for those people it is the hardest to adjust to life after the physical captivity is over.I think I was emotionally ready as much as one could be to read about the time inside this camp. But I do not think I was prepared to read about what happened when Aseyev found himself free again. That is why I’ve read this last essay “White nights” so many times. He wrote it in Prague when he was participating in some conference on human rights. It took place not long after he was released. And it is a stunning piece. Each sentence is more than a scream, is more than an utterance, a raw emotion or more than a pensive reflection. It is something above the words delivered with language in the absence of the other medium. Each sentence contains so much one can read one sentence a day and think about it for a whole that day. When someone says something like “the captivity does not end with the physical release” I think we all would find those words almost a truism. But can we really appreciate what it means? No we cannot. I just leave a passage from this essay here:“we should understand that life is not simply unjust - it is possible the situation is much worse. It is possible there is nobody out there to even address this question of justice and we are dealing with the raw facts without any hope of meaning. Yes, one day you are used to live in the frames of the set meanings well understood by the majority: your house, your family, your job. Then suddenly, one day you find yourself in a basement, naked with the wires of electric current attached to different places of your body. This is something one cannot really generalise about, there is no theory that would explain why this is so. Especially, what torments you is this hardly noticeable word “suddenly”. What does it mean? 40 years of your life did not give you any experience to answer this because they was no this day in these 40 years. You do not have neither your house nor your job, your closed ones are trying to leave your city not be at the same situation as you are… A few years pass by like that. And then - a bright light - the freedom. This is the situation that might be in some respects more difficult than yesterday’s basement. A human being who went through this is totally undervalued in time. He does not understand the past, but also the present - the one which he has been already deprived once and deprived in one day. So what? To start everything from the beginning again? What for? Especially if no-one could possibly imagine what you’ve gone through.”It is not only the text. Aseyev has written something which would help to narrow this unbridgeable gap at least a little bit. He tells how not “to help”, not to make more harm by some awkward well-meant nonsense. It is not useful to say to those people “we understand”. It humiliates them. It is not good to compare. It makes their individual experience less valuable in their eyes. It is not good to recommend to see something or other ‘in a positive light” or propose some other cliche. According to Aseyev, it is more helpful to agree with them and accept their extremely pessimistic view. Give them time to be.I have to admit I’ve never thought about such things properly before but this book helped me to see the destiny of Celan, Amerry and others. It indeed helped me to see many things in the light I’ve never contemplated. Also and, somewhat more unexpectedly, it helped me understand why some people would want to return the soviet union or the other form of empire. When they “came out” they as well faced a “bright light” of freedom they could not bear. Some of them have moved on if only through a huge trauma. But some others just want to come back to their atrocious captivity where their fear is not the fear of absurd and unknown meaningless. Their fear is regulated by some sort of authority and they do not need to deal with their own selves.ps The initial thought @29/06/2022:I did not think I would have to read the thoughts of a survivor of a concentration camp in 2022. And the camp would be in the middle of Europe; and the time of the survivor's release would be 2019. But here I am. And I cannot say how I am grateful that he found the strength to put it all on paper. I cannot write what I feel just yet as it is too raw.

And simply it is a great novel.https://www.thebookseller.com/rights/...The first half has been published in German already.Sophia is a serious thinker. The book or her recent essays has been published in France last month. Initial thoughts:Very ambitious, thought-provoking and complex novel, elegant in parts. It raises difficult questions that are not yet deeply processed by the Ukrainian society, such as Holocaust from the perspective of the Ukrainians, the relationship between historical memory and identity and some others. The author is daring and wonderful stylist. I was not totally convinced by some elements of the execution of the novel. But it is a book to read, think about and talk with the others. In one sentence - in spite of its length, it needs to be translated asap and it deserves a wide readership. ReviewThis novel belongs to the European tradition. It is the one of those novels, sprawling, fragmentary, combining fictional and essay parts and dealing with the themes both universal and very urgent. On the other hand, it is a very Ukrainian novel. In spite of its fragmentary nature, or maybe because of it, it attempts to create a continuous narrative out of the patches of Ukrainian history previously either deliberately hidden and destroyed or simply widely unknown. The common thread running through the book is the relationship between personal and historical memory. Inevitably this leads to the question of what is truth…Amadoka is a huge lake that existed on the territory of Ukraine according Herodotus or Ptolemy and the outlines of ancient maps. However, there is no any geological trace of its existence. Was it a real lake or was it a story specially constructed by the ancient historians with some purpose lost or forgotten since? The existence of this non-existent lake serves a big metaphor for the novel.The architecture of this novel is very ambitious. It is a daring mixture of genres that bears the risk to be unsuccessful in less able hands. Under a single roof, Andrukhovich manages to combine a thriller; a love story; a historical meditation; an account of the Holocaust told by several unreliable narrators and an essay, a book within the book, devoted to Ukrainian intellectuals perished in Stalin’s camps known as “the executed renaissance” in the 30s of the 20th century.A man (his name is Bohdan) has been severely wounded during the first stage of the current Russo-Ukrainian War in Donbas. As a result, he has completely lost his memory and his appearance is hardly recognisable. He has been picked up from the hospital by a women who claims to be his wife (Romana). This woman surrounds him by his personal belongings and tells him stories about him and his family. She believes these stories would help to return his memory. But he, in his current state, has no idea who she is.Romana becomes the main narrator of the novel. We do not know how reliable she is. We do not know who is the man. And this plot, by itself pretty intriguing, serves as the framing device for the two relatively independent texts within the novel. The first is a story of tragic events during the war in Buchach, a town in Western Ukraine. These events include Holocaust, Ukrainian freedom fighting and daily life during the Nazi occupation mainly through the focus on the tragic dynamic between the neighbours.Romana uses a box of the old photos as prompts for her stories. This gives this part a dreamy, meditative and fragmentary nature as each little episode is focused around a single image. I felt a strong Sebaldian influence over this part. But unlike Sebald, Andrukhovich has chosen not to include real images. Instead each image is described by the writer as a part of a story. It is unclear where the images exist beyond the page or she describes totally fictional stills composed by her own imagination. They could contain an object, a view of landscape or fragment of a body or a face. Their composition, always original and in each individual case, it serves as a window into the text that follows. And the sentences are often very beautiful. It is obviously goes beyond the wisdom of “show not tell’ well known to each English speaking child. But it very effective and elegant tool in the case of this text.Holocaust narratives is an established sub-genre of European literature. But what makes this one unique is a perspective and the place. She attempts to show these events from the perspective of Ukrainian population. Even in the West those narratives often either focused on the victims or on the Nazis, the direct perpetrators. They rarely look at the events through the eyes of the ordinary the French or Italians or Poles or Hungarians. In Ukraine, even more so, the discussion of the roles of the ordinary Ukrainians in this tragedy never properly took place in the society. It is not unique to Ukraine. All Eastern Europe immediately went into the sphere of influence of the Soviets. Therefore only one narrative was possible - the officially told one. I’ve recently come across the article by Linda Kinstler. She has just published her own book [ ]. Her relatives are appeared to be both on the victims and on the perpetrators’s side. Here is what she says:“It is not a coincidence that the same region where war crimes are currently being committed is also where the full story of the Holocaust is only now starting to be told. The nations of eastern Europe have had far less time to crack the “code” that can unleash the worst crimes. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the historians, writers, poets, prosecutors and artists who tried to uncover what had happened in their cities and villages had to make sure their findings did not challenge Soviet accounts of the atrocities. As far as Soviet authorities were concerned, it was “peaceful Soviet citizens” who the Germans murdered, a phrase that masked the particularity of the crime and its genocidal aim. It was this phrase that they inscribed upon monuments to the dead. Fearing that to honour the Jews who were killed would risk nurturing Jewish nationalism at the expense of Soviet collectivity, they ended up burying the true nature of the crime.”And in this part of the novel, Andrukohovich attempts to properly start this dialogue with the past; to help the new generation of Ukrainians to come to terms with the fact that some of their ancestors where not the victims or brave fighters of the resistance. Some of them were either at the service of the Nazis or simply perpetrators of the crimes against their neighbours, predominantly Jewish but also the Poles and even fellow Ukrainians. Andrukhovich does not try to escape into simple explanations:“To think they were mad means to justify. The mad do not need to be hold responsible. You knew that this is just non convincing round about that did not explain anything, cheap and dishonest trick. In reality, in many senses their mind was even sharper, made their ability to adapt to the situation in which all old systems of coordinates were torn or changed. He wanted to say “ adapt to survive”, but it was not always like that. Often it was to adapt to feel better and be better off. “There is a character who both works as a Nazi police but helps some Jews almost against his will. But I would be interested for the writer even to go further - to show a character, in the Nazi service or otherwise who would be convinced he was doing the right thing to the end, his underlying motivation And then - the perspective of the children and grandchildren of such an individual, their experience of living with the knowledge about the crime of their grandparent. But generally, the novel does poses this question: those who committed the crimes, horrific or even small, those who simply stood aside thinking of their own skin, their children and even their grandchildren - how they should remember? Even the survivors, and the others who where helping the victims?Personal memory is quite a peculiar thing. People often try to suppress a traumatic experience in order to continue their lives. Often they go even farther - they make up themselves a story. The story is much more palatable than the truth. But it becomes their truth:“You knew that they did not lie in many cases. They did truly believed in what they said. They “remembered” those things they believed in.“ tells Romana to Bohdan about his grandmothers. In one the interviews, Andrukhovich mentioned the story of a Belgium girl, Mishi Defonseca. I did not know about this story before. But it underlines how creative the memory could be in suppressing what one does not want to accept. Mishi, in her mature years wrote a book how she, being a Jewish girl escaped from the Nazis and survived with the wolves. The book has become an international bestseller. Only problem with all of this was that it was all a tale. Never really happened. In reality, her dad has betrayed his fellow partisans. And she was called a “traitor’s daughter”. So she escaped in her story which was totally made up. When all of it was revealed the author issued the statement:""The book is a story, it's my story. It's not the true reality, but it is my reality. There are times when I find it difficult to differentiate between reality and my inner world.”But here lies the rub: our collective memory, our perception of history and the truth is built of those individual little stories. And where lies the border when a bunch of these little stories becomes a collective amnesia or worse - sheer historical lie used to build up, let’s say, a national myth? “Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past” I often hear this sentence by Orwell nowadays in different contexts. There is also a deeper problem here. What constitutes the closure for certain tragic events? Does historical truth require the ancestors of the perpetrators accept some measure of collective guilt? Or is it better to ignore this question for the coherence of the present society? Is this coherence even possible without some kind of acknowledgement?Bohdan with his complete amnesia is a successful metaphor for this phenomena. In theory Romana, can construct his whole identity from scratch by carefully selecting which stories to feed to his consciousness. But is it at all possible to sustain this? Also to which extent a person’s identity is defined by his memory? This last question is a tangential consideration but the one this novel is dealing with as well. In this part of the novel, she also creates a bunch of wonderful, fully fledged and memorable characters. For me it was the most successful part.As this part ends with its tragic and not totally expected culmination, the novel is changing its gear again. The third part is an extended essay. It mostly focuses on the “executed renaissance”, but also contains meditation on the thinkers and the artists of the 18th century such as Skovoroda, Pinzel and Baal Shem Tov. “Executed renaissance” are Ukrainian intellectuals of the 20s and the 30s of the 20th century. The majority of them perished in gulags. Many of them were shoot in the period of just one week in 1937 in Sandarmokh. They say the killers were so physically tired from shooting they need to be replaced periodically.“The culmination of the actions of the Soviet repressive regime was the mass executions of the ""counter-revolutionaries"" committed on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the October coup. Almost three hundred representatives of the Ukrainian renaissance of the 1920s were shot between 27 October and 4 November at Sandarmokh, a massive killing field in Karelia (northwest Russia).” (Wikipedia)The essay is written in a form of a documentary novel by an imaginary scholar. In this part, it is evident how much research Andrukhovich has put into her work and how passionate she was about those perished writers. She wants to underline to her readers that behind each of those names there was an individual with a unique personal story. She wants to preserve every detail and make sure they do not disappear from our memory behind the sheer monstrosity of the crime. The intention is very honourable. However, it did not quite work for me within the frame of the novel as a whole. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the factual information. It would work better if she would make this part tighter and focus on a fewer personalities. It is clear that her main interest lies within the triangle of Zerov, Domontovych and the woman they both loved. This story by itself would take a whole novel to explore. Viktor Petrov (Domontovych) was a polymath, the writer, literary critic and the scientist. He was very talented. But the story of his life is surrounded by a mystery. He was not executed during the purges, he was collaborating with the Nazis in the occupied Ukraine. Later he lived in Munich, but then disappeared and resurfaced in Russia. He was allowed to come back to Kyiv only for the last decade of his life. He then married the wife of his friend, professor Zerov, who was executed 20 years before. No-one knows for sure what was Petrov. Was he a double agent? Very likely. But there are no facts available. What is known though that he was a very talented writer but stopped writing novels after the 30s. In the 20s he wrote a novel that by some of its themes echos “Lolita”. Being ethnologist, he also allegedly saved a whole people in Crimea from the genocide during the war testifying there were not the Semites to the Nazis.I totally understand why Andrukhovich would be attracted to his story. I appreciate her desire to stick to the known facts and live the gaps where there was no facts available. However, the story with Domontovych left me longing for some scenario, a speculation what kind of person he really was as the facts are so bare. I think Andrukhovych’s idea was to leave it to the imagination of the reader. Normally, I like this approach in fiction. But in this case, I would be interested in her doing a creative work, fleshing this man out of the darkness for me, even if it would be his fictional self. The novel ends at the present while we come back to the story of Bohdan and Romana. This last part speeds up substantially and turns into a twisty thriller. It also throws out a few additional questions into the matter of truth. For example, how social media changes our perception of certain facts and people. When we later meet these people in real life, we still often chose to believe in the story created in the virtual reality rather than our own eyes.It is always good feeling when the work of fiction makes a dialogue in your mind with other books you’ve read previously. It was the case for me with this book. First of all, The Museum of Abandoned Secrets the novel by Oxana Zabushko comes to mind. This is another grand Ukrainian novel written about 10 years ago. It is also quite daring and ambitious. There is a historical part in it dealing with the events of the war. I think there are even certain similarities in the plot. But Zabuzhko focuses more on the Ukrainian freedom fighting. While Andrukhovych is more interested in the events of Holocaust. Another book that comes to mind is The Books of Jacob Similar to Tokarzhuk, Andrukhovych is not afraid of the volume and of scaring her readers away by the number of pages. Both novels take place in approximately the same geographical territory but a few centuries apart. Moreover, Andrukhovych touches upon the thinkers of the 18th century in her novel. Those thinkers precede Frank, the main character of Tokarzhuk opus. Both novels investigate the untold, less known stories from the past in order to explain the present. But unlike Tokarzhuk who deals with the real historical figures, Andrukhovych creates the characters and the plot within the reality of the historical period in the Holocaust part. In the essay part, she is closer to Tokarzhuk's idea of preserving as many factual details as possible. But Olga then goes and fills the gaps for the areas where the facts are not available. Andrukhovych decides to leave those gaps empty. And the last comparison is more unlikely Malina by Ingeborg Bachman. I think Bachman’s generation of the Austrian writers were doing exactly what was left unprocessed in the Eastern European literature and what Andrukhovych now tries to achieve. Both Bachmann and her are dealing with the generational trauma. The situations, when the second generation either refuse to acknowledge the direct or passive participation of their parents in the terrific crimes or are becoming the victims of this knowledge, mentally destroyed. Overall I enjoyed the sprawling nature of this work and its stylistic variety. However, I think it would benefit if the edit would be tighter. This relates to the Holocaust part, but even more to essay’s part. The amount of names and factual material distracted my attention from the ideas and questions this part attempts to pose. This was especially pity as there were brilliant fragments in the essay, stylistically and intellectually perfect. Another more personal issue I’ve had with the novel is the plot. It is carefully crafted and sustains itself throughout. But I almost wished it would be less of it, less twists, less suspense and mystery. Andrukhovych mentioned somewhere that for her literature was often a hyperbola of reality. I would personally prefer an understatement in some situations. However, I appreciate that this is exactly what might be considered a strength by many other readers of the book.Until very late in the novel I was not sure how Andrukhovych would be able to connect all of this together. She did it. The novel itself could stand as metaphor for desire of continuity in the history of Ukraine while certain events and the whole historical epochs were deliberately and forcibly excluded from the memory of its people. We experience now again and in real time how the empire from the east tries to destroy the right of this nation to survive as free people with their own land, country, language and culture. The empire will not succeed.

Or at least in support of. the truth. There is a war going on, but those taking part continue to be officially described as no more than ""participants of an anti-terrorist operation. ...

It has not changed.The author is a sociologist. In this book, he tries I've read that a few months ago and my opinion of that book was underwhelming. It has not changed.The author is a sociologist. In this book, he tries to apply certain sociological theories to the development and collapse of the Soviet society in the 60s -90s. But his goal is even more ambitious than that - he is trying to synthesise micro-history with this big historical view on the society development. It seemed to me the latter is very much based on Marx rather that Weber. This is fair enough as he moves to the later theories of state and systems' theory. But I was not convinced by his application. As it eventually lead to the analyses of the classes in the Soviet Union. The biggest was casually called ""proletariat"" that includes everyone apart from nomenclature. I did not like the word ""proletariat"" in this context. Eventually we came to the phenomena of ""underclass"" which the author had to create to explain the process of the collapse of the USSR. Occasionally, I found this analysis borderline patronising. There is an argument in the book, but the supporting evidence did not fully work for me. Maybe someone else would find it helpful. In general I do not hold theoretical sociology at high esteem. So it might not be the book for me.Also ""the scientific"" language made it sometimes a bit less subtle than I would wish:""Two decades ago, arguing against simplistic theories of Third Word dependency, the French economist Lipietz suggested that it was not the West that was deliberately under developing the Third World. He rather pointed to the structural differential between the metropolis of capitalism and the peripheral outliers in the world of distribution of economic, military and cultural resources. This ""objectively existing"" situation tends to create the games in which the peripheral elites might rationally seek individual profit at the collectively irrational cost of underdeveloping their own countries. The post-Soviet counties provide many glaring examples.""   That is fantastic conclusion that rather misses the point why those ""outliers"" are on the ""periphery"" at the first place. Another extract is about Chechnya's ""underclass - sub-proletarian"":""The prospect of gaining new kinds of social, symbolic and economic capital motivated sib-proletarians to engage in nationalist activism. The toughness and cultural ""backwardness"" of those in this class, who primarily spoke native languages and often came from traditionally religious families, was suddenly to. there advantage in the new kind of nationalist mobilisation""By ""sub-proletrarians"" he means anyone who were not earning their income from the state employment. Somehow they've become culturally backward and that was the reason they've decided they do not want to be the part of post Soviet Russia and were ""mobilised"" by other ""socially backward"" nationalists. I am not sure I agree with this type of analysis put it mildly. My bigger issue was that his ""micro-history"" is was not revealing at all. It lacked details and turned a human life in a pretty generic case. And the promised syntheses did not fully take place. All in all, it has reminded me my university days when I needed to indure through the lectures on theoretical Marxism and its sources. Oh, and Bourdieu is hardly playing any role in this book apart from being mentioned. There are a few sociological theories, especially systems' theory that the author is applying in his analysis, but Bourdieu is more like an honorable mention because the main human object of that analysis was apparently reading it. The book has got a lot of fans though, so it might be just me and my background. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 21, 2022","May 26, 2022","Apr 21, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/264243.Bourdieu_s_Secret_Admirer_in_the_Caucasus

She was a Russian speaker, and aspiring journalist so she decided to go to ChYoung Asne was in Russia in 1994 when the first Chechen war has started. She was a Russian speaker, and aspiring journalist so she decided to go to Chechnya to find out what is going on and maybe to report. She has had a scary but eye-opening experience. Later, she came back in Russian in 2005 when Kadyrov was already responsible for Chechnya and the second war was in less active stage. She went back in Chechnya, first time - secretly; and another - as member of official tour organised for foreign journalists. This book is the result of her first-hand experience, her meetings with the Chechens of different backgrounds and ways of life; her interview with Kadyrov. On the other hand, in 2005 she talked to the ordinary Russians - the soldier left maimed by the war who admires Putin and does not consider Chechens human beings; The parents of Neo-Nazis in Moscow who were persecuted for the racially motivated assaults against the Chechens. But the parents blame the journalists who reported on the matter, the victims but not their sons saying that Russia should be for Russians. They conveniently forget that the Chechens are the citizens of Russia as well even if they tried to get out. Also she talks to the fellow travellers in a train - two maths professors and a nurse. The professors tell her that life was good during the Soviets as Russia respected in the world due to its ability to ""threaten everyone with the nuclear button."" Remember - maths professors in the ordinary train in 2005. All of this might explain better the situation we find observes now and the attitude of the ordinary Russians of certain garden variety.The main focus of the book is an orphanage set out by a simple Chechen family in Grozny to help many children orphaned by the war. Asne does not follow the path of an easy narrative and shows that some of those children are practically impossible to help so much that scarthed with their experiences.It is just a journalist non-fiction. It is not a monograph or a historic study. But in general, in spite of living in Russia in 1991-2001, I found this book quite an educational read. It brings up to light many issues and facts I did not know about, or maybe somehow did not notice. Where was I? I was 20. I've had a demanding job and good social life. I do not remember thinking that much of that war. I certainly did not feel it at all in my daily life. What if I did then? What if I could do something then to stop it? But I did not. It also explains quite a few things for me in the current war with Ukraine. One of the main takes - it is not only Putin to blame for the current situation. Putin was nowhere near Kremlin in 1994. And the same criminal acts like mass torture, killing civilians, blaming the other side for the atrocities done by the Russian army were happening in Chechnya that are carried out now in Ukraine on a much bigger scale. There are might be a difference in reasons for this war but the similarity in methods and cruelty is overwhelmingly there. It looks like this way of behaving is embedded deeply in the russian army and supported by the significant part of the russian population where this army stems from. Asne concludes the one of her stories:The trips to Chechnya changed me. When I went back to Moscow to recuperate, I became depressed, had lost my drive. I just wanted to go back again. Real life was in the mountains, where people were waging a life-and-death struggle. Little by little I became almost anti-Russian. From being captivated by the poetry, the music, in search of ‘the Russian soul’, I became aware of the racism, the nationalism, the corruption of senior government officials, the ignorance, the bleak history; as Anton Chekhov put it: Russian life is like a thousand-pound stone, it grinds a Russian down till there’s not even a wet patch left. (P55)And I think currently I understand her sentiment. A few quotes:I’d passed row after row of devastated buildings, demolished homes, gaping holes - the city lay in ruins. Already now, four or five months into the war, the destruction was worse than that suffered by Sarajevo in two or three years. People tramped over stone blocks and pieces of concrete, walked around deep holes, bent under wires and cables, balanced on planks laid across the bomb craters. After the catastrophic New Year invasion, the minister of defence had got rid of some generals; he remained, himself, but changed tactics and began high-altitude bombing. Hospitals, orphanages, waterworks and homes were demolished - despite the fact that Russia’s prime minister maintained that ‘the aerial attacks strike only military installations from which the enemy is shooting’, and the Security Council in the Kremlin declared ‘the Chechens simulated explosions in residential areas’. (P22)""Dec 94 - Pavel Grachev (the minister of defence), who had celebrated his forty-fourth birthday the evening before, had declared ‘a single paratroop regiment can solve all the problems within two hours’. After the first twenty-four hours, a thousand Russian soldiers had been killed. Calmly, without firing a shot, the tanks rumbled forward on huge caterpillar treads. They did not have orders to attack, just to ‘occupy the city’. They passed through the suburbs without encountering any resistance. The same was true of the apartment blocks on the outskirts of Grozny. The heavy columns rolled on until they reached the inner city. There they met the counterattack. The Chechens stood ready in Grozny’s forest of tall buildings. Tanks were set ablaze. The soldiers inside fled from the flames, only to be shot down, one by one, as they leaped out. Those who sought refuge in the buildings were attacked in the entrances, where the city’s defenders stood ready with knives, swords and kinzhals - daggers. How could the Russian army allow itself to be so humiliated? What kind of intelligence information was this? The minister of defence had himself said that bandits in the republic numbered in the tens of thousands. Bandits - that’s what he called the separatists. Had he imagined they would run away when they saw the tanks? According to highly placed military sources, it gradually came out that Grachev’s order to storm Grozny on New Year’s Eve was given almost on a whim during a drunken party at the military base in Mozdok. ‘A birthday blitz’, the idea was called. The troops had been sent in without maps, without firm orders, without knowing where they should go. The tank drivers had merely been told ‘Follow the tank ahead of you’. Many of the soldiers had never handled a weapon, and those who had had generally lain flat on the ground and fired at a target. None of them had received any training for urban warfare - the most difficult of all battlefields. The army had not yet adjusted from a Cold War strategy based on nuclear warfare. Most of the tanks were old and lacked communications equipment as well as protective armour. The Chechens could toss grenades from high-rise buildings and let the ammunition and fuel that exploded inside the vehicle do the rest. (P 12)‘We had an agreement with the Russians that they wouldn’t bomb the town if we didn’t shelter the fighters. We handed over all our weapons and posted guards to make sure no fighters came here,’ one man told us. ‘Every week the Council of Elders and the Russian troops held talks. We thought it was safe to stay here; because of the Russian promises, few people fled. When the bombardment started, all we could do was rush down into our cellars. ‘After twelve hours, the bombing stopped and we could go outside,’ the man continued. He had lived twenty years in Siberia in order to earn enough money to build a house for his family. Now everything was gone. ‘Until the very last day, they said we didn’t need to worry.’ ‘They call it war,’ said another. Some of the walls were still standing in the once stately house where he lived with his wife and five sons. ‘They said on TV that they had killed so many Chechen fighters. That’s a lie. There weren’t any fighters here, just peaceful villagers. They shoot as if they have a real enemy, but only civilians die."" (P38)""Yeltsin wanted to keep Russia’s borders intact at any cost and refused to accept secession. As a result, these two men who once had fought the same fight - against the Soviet Union - now became bitter enemies. And it is these two men who must bear the main responsibility for the Chechen tragedy. Dudayev began a war of words with Yeltsin. ‘Russianism is worse than Nazism’, ‘Boris Yeltsin heads a gang of murderers’ and his regime is the ‘diabolic heir to a totalitarian monster’. For its part, the Russian government introduced an amazingly ineffective trade embargo and cut important subsidies; the only thing the Russian state paid was pensions to help local Russians remain in Chechnya. The huge reduction in financial aid from Russia added to the chaos and corruption, and soon Dudayev’s regime was even less able to pay salaries than governments elsewhere in Russia. A Moscow bank robbery by Chechen criminals netted almost a billion dollars; most of the money was brought back to Chechnya. Grozny became a centre for smuggling, fraud and money laundering, while the government’s role in the republic was collapsing. Meanwhile, the hawks in Yeltsin’s administration wanted a ‘small victorious war’, something that would increase their popularity among nationalistic Russians after an ultra-nationalist candidate, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, had won about every fourth vote in the parliamentary election. However, the main reason for invading Chechnya was the political ambitions of Yeltsin and his inner circle. If Chechnya seceded, the spirit of rebellion could spread to the rest of the North Caucasus, and all of Russia could fall apart. (P51)And the last about respect of culture: Isa had lost what he most valued: Chechnya’s cultural treasures. ‘The national museum in Grozny was bombed after Russian forces looted what they thought worth preserving: European paintings, anything made of gold and silver, precious stones and metals. Chechen and Caucasian art was blown to pieces.’ (P37)...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Apr 16, 2022","May 04, 2022","Apr 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2808414-the-angel-of-grozny

Quite a few pages of this book is devoted not simply to the poets, but to the quirky, inspirational subculture of their community in Chile. Moreover, what is poetry for? It seems this novel attempts to discuss this question once again. In many cases it is impossible to say but there are “poems that prove poetry is good for something, that words can wound, throb, cure, console, resonate, remain”.But even if you do not like novels about writers or poets, it is difficult to resist the charm of this particular one. Poetry is just a background for the relationship between a boy and his stepfather. Parenthood is obvious theme of a myriad works of fiction. But I do not remember reading any novel before about this particular angle. At least nothing of a kind which made me contemplate the uniqueness of this bond and its fragility. After the breakup with his girlfriend, Gonzalo had to leave his stepson after 6 years being practically his father. The mother does not want Gonzalo being involved in the boy’s further life. And when a biological parent would have some rights, Gonzalo does not have any. He has to leave. And it is such a sad situation that it would risk to become melodramatic in other hands. But Zambra treats it with such poignancy, self-deprecation and lightness that it never does.I do not know why but I was thinking about Telemachus and disappeared Odysseus while finished reading. There is no obvious reference to this in the novel, just a feeling how the boy subconsciously absorbs some of his father’s personality in his absence. No any biological bond in this case. The novel is not perfect. The third part that talks about the community of poets is only loosely connected with the main story. I wondered whether he could do better job either by more tightly Integrating it into the main plot; or by not trying at all and leaving it as a stand-alone story within the novel. However, I was happy he has included this part. I’ve found out so many interesting facts about the poets in Chile. At the centre of the part is American journalist, Pru writing an article:“an article about a literary country, a country where poetry is oddly, irrationally important.” She interviews many writers for her mosaic of unacknowledged poets, or poetic types: “poet-critics,” “poet-editors,” “poet-booksellers,” “poet professors, poet-journalists, poet-fiction-writers, poet-translators,” “several bards dedicated to less literary professions,” and one “poet-performer” who writes two poems, simultaneously, on separate sheets of paper with both hands. “The world of Chilean poets is a little stupid,” Pru concludes, “but it’s still more genuine, less false than the ordinary lives of people who follow the rules and keep their heads down.” If the poets could at least a bit decrease the level of superficiality and falsehood in the world, I wish all of us would poets, at least a bit. Needles to say there were quite a few poems included in the novel. Some of them I really loved like this one by Enrique Lihn:Nothing to lose by living, try it:here’s body just your size.We made it in the dark our of love for. The art of the fleshBut also in earnest,thinking of your visit as a new game, joyful and painful;out of love of life, out of fear of death and of life,out of love of deathfor you or for no-one. I think anyone who hold a baby in their hands at least once could not help but be moved by those lines.The language of the novel is pretty simple. And it is great as it is more immediate, not overburdened. Also it makes the digressions about the language stand out within. And there are quite a few of such discussions, for example about the connotations of the word “stepfather” in different languages. I also liked the appearance of the author. He did not overplay the trick. He has appeared only twice it seems. Both times I think he made a significant impact on the whole and moved the narrative away from a potential cliche.And the ending was so smart and poignant at the same time that I was almost moved to tears simultaneously forgetting all my reservations about prior pages.PSI've forgotten to mention a brilliant translation by Megan McDowell especially considering the amount of difficult poetry involved....more",Notes are private!,0,78,1,"Feb 18, 2022","Feb 22, 2022","Feb 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58492105-chilean-poet

It was a fresh combination of witty humour, sharp philosophy and sex more or A while ago I’ve read Pola’s first novel Savage Theories and enjoyed it. It was a fresh combination of witty humour, sharp philosophy and sex more or less in that order of priorities. I have to admit I did not care that much for sex, but it did not distract me from the rest either. So when this book was published I knew I want to read it. This novel is a similar mix. But the humour has overgrown into a scathing satire and the proportion of sex has substantially increased. I liked the former, but I was a bit put off by the latter. Though I still managed not to get distracted:-)The novel is focused on the phenomenon of global literature and the community of the writers, its creators. There is also a thread devoted to a certain overreach in American campus culture.The setting is an international writer’s gathering in Sweden for a series of networking events ending up in a certain prize-giving. No readers are invited. Mona, the Peruvian writer residing in the US is the one of the nominees. So we see the event through her eyes. In spite of taking quite a bit of drugs and occasional drink, her perspective seems to be quite clean-eyed and reliable. And it is scaring and funny also. She observes the formation of the trend in literature when the writers create with having a global appeal in mind, already thinking how it would translate. Any type of the local issue is polished for global consumption, put under common denominator to make “relevant” to global discourse or rather the publishers understanding of it and what would sell. “Maybe, Mona ventured, intellectualizing one’s suffering was just the regional brand, in the same way that Marco signaled his Latin American bona fides by peppering his speech with references to Che Guevara and Luis Miguel, or the way Abdollah branded himself a Proud Muslim Invader. The ways that each of them appropriated their own local colors and used them as the backdrop for playing their parts in the theatrical literary market: these were just the modern tools of the trade, weapons in the battle royale of “world lit.”Globalisation could bring a lot of positive things. For example, in literature, better language skills could shorten the cycle of translation (many more could read in original as well) and bring more books to different audiences. However, it seems the other side of the coin prevails, when the market kicks in. A book becomes a commodity and the author behind it becomes a seller of this commodity. As any commodity the product should be as such as to require a minimum adjustment to the local markets, but looking all the same “localised”. It is not so different from a vegetarian Big Mac in India, for example. Then, this product would sell well globally. But the product in this case is not a Big Mac - it is someone’s thoughts and feelings. And, again similar to Big Macs and cars, this type of global literature has managed to create a local pushback:“Mona recalled a writer she’d met during a residency in Provence: a woman from Hawaii, the author of a book that had been adapted to film, who told her she never read anything in translation. “America is so big, there’s already so much to read!” the Hawaiian writer explained. She said there was a Nebraskan literature and a Northern Californian literature and Southern Gothic literature, and then of course there was the emerging Hawaiian literature, to which her work was foundational. Writers were figuring out the local stories that their target markets wanted to consume. And as offerings diversified, they cultivated new readers, such that eventually every local writer would supply his readers with stories, and these local writers would be able to live off what they wrote, just like a berry farmer who sells organic red currants at the farmers market on Saturdays.”If this debate has got some legitimacy for fruits and vegetables the fact that it is indeed relevant to the literature I found true but a bit odd. It is a pity when people limit their reading horizons due to a certain concept of patriotism. As a reader and as a person who generally do not eat Big Macs locally produced or not, I needed to educate myself how to navigate between these “products” to find something authentic. I am personally more interested in differences between the cultures, rather than commonalities. A bit like Mona: ""Mona felt much more comfortable in the company of other languages. That is, she preferred to live en traducción, according to her literary tastes: she was much more interested in Japanese lyrics of terror and Nigerian poetry written in Hausa than she was in reading about ... intellectuals who got rich writing about the poor in Miraflores, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, or Santiago—it was all so boring."" And, I do not care that much how my “stories” are sourced as soon as they are the works of art. I found Mona to be a great companion for a time being and an acute insider. She has appeared to be on the receiving end of all this trends:“Mona knew that what she did (whatever it was) was considered too intellectual (or difficult) for her to achieve rapid commercial recognition.”I strongly suspect the author of this book was in the same position as the character. But I have a feeling that Pola had to give in a bit to this pressure. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain why she needed to throw “a trauma on a campus” trope in this novel and spiced it up with a bit of dystopia. I could not justify it otherwise. And this has disappointed me. I bet this book would sell much more and win the prizes, but it has impressed me less for that matter in spite of being very sharp, witty and on the ball; in spite of the fact that I agree with Mona’s views.PSI do not have time to discuss properly the campus aspect of the novel. It is tangental for the book. But here is a few quotes I found incisive: Mona had arrived at Stanford not long after the waves she made with her debut novel tossed her onto the beach of a certain impetuous prestige—and at a time when being a “woman of color,” in the vade mecum of American racism, began to confer a chic sort of cultural capital. American universities shared certain essential values with historic zoos, where diversity was a mark of attraction and distinction. By playing the part of an overeducated Latina adrift in Trump’s America, Mona experienced academic captivity as a sort of serene freedom.Mona’s identitarian fantasy was quite well received on campus (it related to her research topic) and offered her the opportunity to advance her career merely by being herself—as much herself as humanly possible. Later she realized it would have been even more advantageous to add on some kind of physical disability—a slight but evident defect—but nobody’s perfect. Even so, Mona enjoyed a unique advantage on campus: her intellectual pedigree was well established by the time she arrived. The august critic Jorge Rufini had called her debut novel a “radical phenomenon” in a Cuban cultural journal of distinction: the literary Chanel of the Latin American left. The journal retained an indelible sophistication for having been founded by Fidel Castro as a cultural arm of the Cuban Revolution. Mona liked to imagine the back issues stacking up in the leader’s bathroom. What Rufini liked about her novel—what he called its “vital commitment”—was its marriage of politics and literature, the sancta sanctorum of the Latin American Boom. Such a commitment, Rufini complained, had become “painfully rare” in her generation....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Feb 08, 2022","Feb 16, 2022","Feb 08, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53317483-mona

I am sure anyone who knows and loves Russian classics would not be able to withstand the charm of this book. Additional bonus - St Petersburg comes alive in these pages with its winter, water and cold beauty.The novel has been first published in 1993, but has been practically unnoticed. It was also translated and published in France at that time, but again it did not make a ripple there. However, allegedly Nabokov’s son has read it and likened it to his father’s work. Now, it has been republished after the death of its author. I hope it would be widely read and translated as it is quite a rare book. The language, the style, subtle but very profound and wide intertextuality - all are in there. I have not enjoyed that much reading a novel in Russian since I’ve read Sasha Sokolov. It also includes wonderful, very unusual take on The Idiot: By Fyodor Dostoyevsky - Illustrated And Unabridged. And it seems to me, Pushkin has been finally symbolically revenged in his duel with Dantes. However, there is such a subtlety in this novel that I am not sure whether it is mine imagination or the author’s one. I’ve heard comparison varying from Ulysses to St. Petersburg by Bely. But those comparisons are widely off the mark unless they are directed on magic role a city plays in a text. Set in the 70s of the 20th century, this novel is comfortably original. It is a proper tour de force through time and power of literature. Initially I wanted to translate a few quotes, but I do not possess enough skills to convey the lightness of his prose and his literary allusions. I hope someone would do it soon.In Russian:Чудный, выстраданный и изящный роман. Как любое талантливое произведение, он перекликается и отражает множество других, особенно из классической русской литературы, но не только. И каждый возможно найдёт причины для сравнения, отголоски своих любимых книг. Для меня это был, как не странно Кортасар, который, кстати цитируется в одной из первых глав. Но роман при этом при всем ничему не старается подражать и комфортно стоит особняком. Интересно выстроен. Многоголосье. Противопоставление двух взглядов на суть творчества, но не просто и не в лоб. Сознательная незаконченность: “всякий пристойный роман, просто в силу онтологического его закона, есть система разомкнутая, хотя бы по одному тому, что, имея отчетливое начало, ни один достойный роман никогда не имеет финала, и по тому, что он четырежды, в четырех формах, процесс: процесс эамышления, процесс создания, процесс прочтения и процесс восприятия.”И эта гигантская ссылка 4, в почти 200 страниц, как не странно работает. Я читала ее после того как закончила основной текст. Эссе не всегда увлекало, но восторженность автора заразительна. И последняя часть, где его героиня говорит о Пушкине, а затем - философии литературы - очень. Некоторые фрагменты гениальны, например монолог девочки у штор, сцена с любовницей отчима или начало шестой главы про боль. Есть конечно моменты, которые мне не совсем понравились - слишком много уменьшительных, немного старомодное, слегка рыцарское отношение к женщинам. Интересно, что рыцарство кстати критикуется внутри романа. Но в целом, читать такой текст - это наслаждение. И, как я уже упоминала по английски, лучший анализ Идиота и замечательный восторженный кусочек Об Онегине в ссылке. И как изящно и трогательно он использовал мета на «Униженных и оскорбленных»!В общем - восторг.

So I had to get this one. And, in general, it did not disappoint. It is populated by my favourite I’ve never read a book by an author from Venezuela. So I had to get this one. And, in general, it did not disappoint. It is populated by my favourite sort of characters - poets, psychiatrists, madmen and losers. Also it is written in this style of interweaving stories mixing fact and fiction when real people and fictional characters interact and tell those stories about each other. In my experience, Latin American writers excel in this type of storytelling. Two recent examples I’ve read were Natural History by Carlos Fonseca and When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamin Labatut, the latter imaginatively less successful imho, but more famous maybe due to its subject matter. And, behind all these books there is a powerful shadow of Roberto Bolaño.This novel follows this tradition. It is intertextual, witty and almost aphoristic in parts:“Love equals love plus the fear of losing what you love.”“There is no idea in advertising. Everything we sue is taken from the public psyche. And that’s the key: we sell them something they lardy have.”The author successfully uses the polyphonic structure, another relatively fashionable device. While Labatut focuses on the nature of scientific discovery and Fonseca - on performative aspects of art and its politics, this one focuses on linguistics and power of language. This is the one of my favourite subjects. Mention Sausser’s name and I am easily bought. I still vividly remember The Seventh Function of Language. But this book is also full of anagrams, palindromes and acrostics.The backdrop of the main story is the time of black-outs in Venezuela at the beginning of the 2nd decade of our century. But the stories within the stories effortlessly move through the time and space including such diverse places like Paris and Communist Warsaw. I won’t go into more details of the plot and structure of this book, just point out that I’ve learned a lot and enjoyed the ride. I give two examples:The one of the characters is Dario Lancini. In reality, his name was Dario Mancini. He was the author of the very original book of palindromes called “Oir a Dario”, the palindrome itself. The largest of his palindrome was more than 700 characters. This book and its excellent translators would tell you much more. But I was fascinated by the idea of double-texts. It is something like this: “Alone, too, by myself, but noble, no regrets.”But it can also be read:“A loan to buy mice, elf, but no bell nor egrets”.Try these two ones:“Fighters sold war for fun.”“Two real eyes watered - I, alone.’The answers are in the book (p 95). But if someone is interested, I can put it here under “spoiler” alert later.2. Another character is Dr Montecinos. He stands as well for the real person, Dr Edmundo Chirinos, apparently Venezuela’s most famous psychiatrist. His story is another case when the facts beat anything a fictional tale would come up with by a margin. Chirinos studied in Germany, France and England. He was not only one of Venezuela's most renowned psychiatrists, he's also been Hugo Chavez's friend and counselor since 1992. Chirinos also was a candidate Venezuela's 1988 presidential election. But at the end of his life he has revealed a very different “face” to put it mindly. He ended up dying in confinement. Truly shocking story. The article I attach below is an interview with him in 2003, I suppose on the pinnacle of his power and ten years before his death. It is extremely fascinating document about not only him, but the country as as whole with hindsight.https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/st...As you can see, I found the book very informative and intriguing. My only wish would be that the main background plot would connect all those pieces together a little tighter. I wish Calderon would make his own symbolic palindrome out of his fictional characters, the palindrome that would go back and force holding all these stories together. Otherwise the impression is that the parts are stronger than the whole. Calderon says: “I am convinced that all the evil in the world begins in .. words”. And I was not convinced he has shown it evidently enough through the novel. But maybe it is the case that the novel would reveal much more on the further re-read. In any case, it is a fascinating, erudite and ambitious creation. I am really look forward to his next projects and hopefully the translation of his short stories. I want to finish with the quote that is quite close to home for me and probably many people in the UK now and in the US a few years ago as well:“you always hear about a lack of leadership. And when people talk about it they’re always referring to positive leadership. Nobody in this country realised as yet that evil needs worthy representation too. Men and women up the task of representing our hatred and resentment. Our president is a clown - a clown out of A Stephen King novel, but a clown all the same. That kind of power, which makes you laugh but kills you, corrodes more than serious power does, where the very presence of its leaders or symbols is a cause of fear. It is power that instead of stabbing you, lets someone do it and merely watches as you bleed to death.”PSSpecial thanks to the translators Daniel Hahn and Noel Gonzalez.

So I will let him speak for himself quite a bit:“What a dull, stupid man! I thought as I watched him clumsily spreading butter and marmalade on his bread. But people like him can’t help it, I thought; they don’t know any better. Then I desisted from such thoughts, which suddenly seemed to me improper—not unfair but improper—and I despised myself for entertaining them. We shouldn’t watch these people and observe their every action, I told myself, because it only makes us despise ourselves.”This neatly summarises my feelings about the narrator and the one of my problems with reading this book. Though I tried not to equate Bernhard with his creation, not always successfully. The narrator’s name is Murau.My general experience of this book was: 1) Boredom; 2) Boredom; 3) Frustration with the novel and myself; 3) Occasional visceral disgust - in this particular order.People with limited time might as well stop reading now as what follows would be just expansion on those points.The narrator, effectively a single voice of this novel, thinks he is very different from the majority of the humanity, especially his family, superior in fact. This is predominately on the grounds that he always preferred books to participating in the family’s business. He has left home and have become an educated and aspired self-proclaimed philosopher. He is very honest and frank man - one cannot take it away from him. But for all these self-proclaimed moral and intellectual superiority he is quite shallow in his ideas and complains. He cannot forgive people mediocrity being very mediocre himself. And that irritated me all the way through.His family, especially his parents is not a pleasant bunch indeed: the Austrian landowners who are former Nazi party members and sponsors. They’ve never repented on their views. On the top of it, his mother was having an affair with a catholic priest, an official from Vatican. So here there is a lot to unpack. Maybe, it would make much more interesting reading if he would do it properly. But it is not the purpose of this story. So what is the purpose? To proclaim repeatedly the burning hatred to those parents, siblings, huntsmen, writers and more or less everyone else, with the small exceptions of less hateful “simple people” and a tiny amount of friends, including the aforementioned Vatican man. But those friends are apparently kept in reserve in case he would need a fresh objects for his self-therapeutical hatred. Any novel can be viewed through either its form or its content. If I would just have problems with the content, but enjoyed the way how the text is constructed, I would live with that. I have a strong conviction that what separate a work of literature from a letter to a friend is its attention to its form and style. But this book has frustrated me both with its form and its content. Form“Extinction” is the novel we read that Marau is thinking of writing. This endeavour is a type of a cathartic activity for him to “extinguish” his past. So far so good, meta-fictional and clever.Suitably, it presents a type of stream of consciousness of this man who is very openly narcissistic and prone to general pronouncements of dubious value. I found him unlikable. Many other people would. But it is not a problem. I like the fiction of Nabokov for example where the majority of his narrators are impossible to like. But they are clever, devious and sinister. Or for example, Celine’s narrators. The imagery they bring to the text is wondrous. Or let’s take Lawrence at the end. His characters often rage, his opinions often are difficult to sympathise with. But they use the language one remembers for long. Here, the language is as flat as a pan. No single metaphor. Even when Marau tries to remember his past, it is like reading a user’s manual, the one how to hate everyone and everything. For a change, occasionally Marau becomes pathetic and feels overwhelmed by self-pity. Another problem I’ve had, that apart from him, everyone else is silent in the novel. The people do not have any agency to defend themselves. I appreciate the format of stream of consciousness is not friendly to a dialogue. And there is no dialogue at all. But there are millions of ways how to go about it and give people some agency. However, I think it is a deliberate choice not to bother with other people speaking. Respectively, there is no second perspective or nuance whatsoever. In the best case, some characters would silently agree with our narrator, or he would make them nod and laugh. All other characters are totally silent, especially the ones he is ranting about. There are exceptions of course when he needs more evidence for his rant. And then his mother, or father are allowed to quip. But not his sisters. Never. Their silence is their weapon apparently against our narrator. But it does not sound credible as his actions point otherwise. For me, it was just a lazy cop out. And that use of the plural personal pronoun “we”! It is used quite widely when Mr Marau feels his is saying something very profound:“We are not content until we have turned this good and lovable person into someone wicked and worthless, if it serves our turn. We are prepared to misuse him, to misuse anyone, in order to rescue ourselves from some dreadful mood that is tormenting us, some mood we have gotten into without knowing how.”Who are those “we”? Is he imagining himself The King Macbeth or Nicholas II? Or does that “we” intend to include a wider audience, like me for example? I am not part of that “we” for sure. Or is it supposed to be the point where I am supposed to start laughing hysterically?I would be able to forgive Bernhard for all these stylistic choices mentioned above. Many people also seem to be either admiring or hating the absence of the paragraphs. It did not bother me that much. Though I could easily split the text into separate complete logical parts if needed. Unlike a few novels in one paragraph I’ve read before, there were no unbreaking continuity in this narrative or even the trangressiveness of Proust (who actually used paragraphs). So for me their absence was either a gimmick or laziness. But I did not mind.The worst “crime” in my eyes was sheer repetitiveness of this text and related use of “italics”. If a triviality or pettiness would be quipped once I could handle it. But if it would be repeated ten times using a very similar set of words, that would become simply cringy and boring. Maybe the intended affect was a comic one. I am not sure. But it seriously drove me up the wall. I’ve borrowed a paragraph from the afterword by Dyer handily included in my book:‘Something repeated ten times is the opposite of art,’ wrote Proust, while Bernhard’s art insists, again and again, on the opposite. The cognitive grip of Bernhard’s logic of insistent repetition and expansive constriction is implacable, ludicrous and highly infectious, obliging the world to conform to the distorted contours by which it is mapped.”Thank you, Proust! And I would agree with Dyer’s statement with the exception of single word. Try to reread the above with replacing the word “infectious” with the two “irritating and boring”. And the man would be spot on.In the first few pages, we learn 10 reasons why his brother was not as wonderful and gifted as him, 10 reasons why his sisters have mocking faces, 10 reasons why the socialists should turn in their grave if they see what is happening in the world, etc., etc. I did not need 10 reasons for something quite so trivial - one good reason would be enough for me - I would believe. I did not know his sisters so well.And then, I noticed that every new protracted rant or let’s call it a soliloquy would start with picking a phrase and often showing it in “italics”. Then this phrase would be repeated incessantly. This is an example: “We search everywhere for our childhood, I thought, and find only a gaping void. We go into a house where as children we spent such happy hours, such happy days, and we believe we’re revisiting our childhood, but all we find is  a gaping void. Entering the Children’s Villa means nothing more or less than entering this notorious gaping void, just as going into the woods where we used to play as children would mean going into this gaping void. Wherever I was happy as a child, there now appears to be a gaping void….”Five times in a few lines. It is like a hammer on the nail. The verbal tick. And it goes for another page totalling in 13 times of “gaping void”. All of that to express such “a profound” and terribly original thought that we cannot revisit our childhood and moreover we cannot revisit even our yesterday. I am happy that he has been finally stricken by this revelation and it is a little sad and I feel for him and myself. But I do not think it is so original it is worth repeating so many times. I am sure that some people would find it elegiac and poetic. I am not one of them unfortunately and it was just painful. But at least in this bit, he does not hate or mock anyone. I’ve developed a horror of anticipating a new phrase in italics.Another demonstration of this and this one is sort of meta-fictional and a bit deeper. It refers to his method. The key word here is “exaggeration”.“We’re often led to exaggerate, I said later, to such an extent that we take our exaggeration to be the only logical fact, with the result that we don’t perceive the real facts at all, only the monstrous exaggeration….On occasion I transform this fanatical faith in exaggeration into an art, when it offers the only way out of my mental misery, my spiritual malaise. I’ve cultivated the art of exaggeration to such a pitch that I can call myself the greatest exponent of the art that I know of. I know of none greater… The painter who doesn’t exaggerate is a poor painter, the musician who doesn’t exaggerate is a poor musician, and the writer who doesn’t exaggerate is a poor writer, I said…. Without the art of exaggeration we’d be condemned to an awfully tedious life, a life not worth living. And I’ve developed this art to an incredible pitch.”That what his narrator is saying. And, in case of Bernhard himself, the “repetition” would be even more apt than exaggeration. I could appreciate all this verbiage up to the point. But please give me a hint of a subtlety!Of course it is the question of taste. And, if it would be just a few paragraphs repeating one or two phenomena, I would not mind. But when 300 pages of this excessive verbiage was systematically being piled on me; I felt exhausted.  Content“It was a pleasure to see butcher at work. At part or more admirable than the surgeon. “According to Dyer’s afterward, the reader experiences “perverse pleasures”. Reading similar statements, I did not feel any pleasure perverse or otherwise. Another example, is Marau’s interest in the tabloid’s photos showing his family car accident including his dead half-decapitated mother. I guess it is supposed to be a black humour, a satire of human nature or perverse pleasure indeed. None of it I found even remotely fascinating. I’ve picked a passage which I thought is indicative how his narrative and works. Let’s look more closely at this statement and its logic:Mothers whelp and bring children into the world, and from then on they hold the world responsible for what has occurred and for everything that subsequently happens to their children, whereas they ought to take the responsibility themselves. The truth is, Gambetti, that mothers shirk all responsibility for the children they bring into the world. What I’m saying is true of many mothers, indeed of most mothers. But I’m quite alone in saying it! We can think such thoughts, but we mustn’t express them, Gambetti; we must keep them to ourselves and mustn’t publish them. We must choke down such thoughts in a world that would react to them with revulsion. Were I to publish a piece entitled Mothers, it would result merely in my being pronounced a liar or a fool or both. The world wouldn’t tolerate such views, because it’s accustomed to falsehood and hypocrisy, not to facts. The truth is that in this world facts are ignored, while fantastic ideals are proclaimed as facts, because that’s politically more expedient and acceptable than the opposite, Gambetti. (P149)So, through all this verbiage, he leads us to conclude that main evidence “that in this world facts are ignored” and “it’s (the world) accustomed to falsehood and hypocrisy, not to facts”, the evidence of that is based upon the incidence that many people would not share his indeed dubious and slightly distasteful view that after a bit of a “whelping”, “mothers shirk all responsibility for the children they bring into the world”. Almost all of them apparently! Indeed, the majority of the mothers are irresponsible! This is an absolute fact! So let’s blame them, mothers, for the hypocrisy of this world and have a little laugh. So wise and so ironic! I could not stop my giggles.So why I did not give up reading this book? I am asking myself this question. I guess a few factors. I’ve had some hope to find something really profound between all those piles of …words.But, as soon as he was getting into something marginally interesting, and my hopes would rise, he would switch off back to banality or triviality. For example, this passage was getting somewhere: “The tragedy of the would-be writer is that he continually resorts to anything that will prevent him from writing. A tragedy, no doubt, but at the same time a comedy—a perfect, perfidious comedy.” But it did not last. He moved back to his weak heart. Marau also called Thomas Mann and Musil the writers for the lower-middle class. I guessed I could appreciate that irony, especially compared to the novel I was reading.The reason that has actually lead me to this novel was Ingeborg Bachmann. I’ve read recently her novel Malina. It impressed me so deeply that I keep reading around it, including the authors familiar with Bachmann. Bernhard was one of them. She is featured in this novel as a minor character, Maria. And that was a gleamer of light in my misery:“…Maria as someone who has everything permanently present in her mind and, because of her intelligence, can hold her own in any company. This is why Maria immediately becomes the focal point of any gathering, without having to say a word” and “Maria my first woman poet”. This last bit sounds slightly condensing to the other women poets, but I’ll take it from him.What amazes me how popular the term “Bernhardian” has become. As soon as a book contains some minimal misanthropic or pessimistic element and the stream of consciousness, preferably with the lack of paragraphs or dialogue, it is guaranteed to be labeled that way. But after reading this book, it sounds terribly misleading to me. For example, just from my relatively recent experiences I’ve seen A Passage North been branded that way. And I absolutely cannot understand why. It is dealing with the interiority of a character, written as a stream of consciousness and its temporarity is limited to a few days. But if it picks up a philosophical issue it does not drive it to the ground with repetition or hate. Another example is Infinity: The Story of a Moment by Josipovici. I do not know whether it was branded with this label. But if it is the case, it would be my ideal “Bernhardian” novel. The protagonist is a misanthrope. But what he is saying is interesting, not repetitive and not banal either. I would like to finish my ""rant"" using Marau’s help again to summarise for me the result of his novelistic efforts:“What we have in mind is something tremendous, we tell ourselves; sometimes we even tell others, being too vain to keep it to ourselves, but all we are capable of is something utterly risible.”PSI've found the supporter of my view on this novel in Alex Christofi, the contemporary English writer:""George Steiner wrote that “too often, notably in his later writings, Bernhard succumbed to a monotone of hate”, and Extinction has all the tonal variation of a fridge. Or to put it more politely, this may not be entry-level Bernhard.""Though he is a bit more sympathetic of Bernhard's earlier novel ""Concrete"".

In those stories, he experimented and polished his craft. He is impeccable stylist and trickster. Through the years, it is evident in those stories how he has developed an arsenal of the original tools that he used in his bigger works. So when reading Pnin after those stories it was easier to see which rabbit (or rather a squirrel in this case) he would pull out of his hat.I got used to the unreliability and general nastiness of many of his narrators. Here it was the one as well. I also anticipated the disdain to some fellow writers. Here, Anna Akhmatova and her early poetry seems to be the victim. Though the elegant cover up was that he parodied not her own style but the style of those young poetesses who were subconsciously imitating her. Mann, Dreiser and a few others received a dishonourable mention in passing as well. I also recognised his nostalgia for bygone Russian days and his snobbery towards academia in the US and elsewhere and pre-revolutionary middle class in Russia.His playfulness with the language was familiar as well. Here though he took it on different level trying to play with two languages at the same time. I thought it was the bold and interesting decision to leave the poetry just transliterated. I am sure it should be quite special experience to be able to sound the words without understanding. Unfortunately for me, I knew the meanings, so I did not have this experience. He inserted a lot of Russian words and expressions. Sometimes, the translation that follows was not totally successful. I found it distracting. But again, I think it might be very interesting trick for an non-Russian speaker, something akin to the much easier version of ""Finnegan’s Wake"".And he managed to make a circle in his narrative again. He has started the story with the visit to Cremona and he has finished it with Cremona as well. If I would see such trick for the first time, I would be incredibly impressed, but I’ve seen it before with him. The Circle is the better example.What was unique to this tale is its human aspect and kind humour. The main character is not very successful, but very sympathetic Professor Pnin. I hardly remember any other fully sympathetic Nabokovian character. Many scenes are genially funny. And though with the progression of the story, the narrator’s shadow becomes more visible over Pnin’s life, even the narrator fails to be sinister enough. And the squirrels are everywhere! They are even in the name of Pnin’s first love who is Belochkina. “Belochka” is a little squirrel in Russian. Normally there would be butterflies, so that was unusual as well.I liked this diversion by Nabokov into a campus novel with the Russian twist. But personally I’ve started to expect from his work some kind of a tricky puzzle and deep layered intertextuality on the top of everything else. It was not the case here. Still, I was thoroughly entertained. ...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Jan 21, 2022","Jan 24, 2022","Jan 21, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30593.Pnin

For him, those diaries were more than some jottings. Effectively they proved It is the last volume of the diaries Piglia kept through his whole life. For him, those diaries were more than some jottings. Effectively they proved him his existence and its meaning, who he was. He claimed he did not remember anything that was not in his diaries. These records even cost him a few relationships, the fact he acknowledged again in the same diaries. He’s never hidden them. And sometimes, his girlfriends would even write in them and correct his memories. But it seems he always wanted to publish them at the end.This final volume consists of three parts. The first part corresponds to the dark period of the history Argentina for the period from 1976 to 1982 when it was governed by the military and many people being made “disappeared” or murdered by the regime. At the same time, Piglia was working on his novel “The Artificial Respiration”. This part is the most difficult to read. It is very dry. I could feel how afraid he was and how he struggled what to put on the paper and what to leave out. He was also quite depressed and preoccupied by his novel which did not always go smooth. As a result, in spite of a few insightful passages on the theory of literature or philosophy, this part is a bleak and repetitive read. But it definitely conveys the atmosphere. This is the passage from the first pages when he arrived back from the US at the beginning of this period:“The worst past is the sinister feeling of normalcy; the buses travel in their loops, the people go to the movies, they sit down at bars, leave there offices, go to restaurants, laugh, make jokes, and everything appears to go on as before, but you can hear sirens and there are armed police going past at top speed un unmarked cars.”I think it is very indicative how the majority of the ordinary people feel when something extraordinary brutal happens to their surroundings. Looking for the visible changes one cannot find them straightaway. Respectively, one does not know how to react, what is the best thing to do while this surrounding disaster seem so far not affecting one directly. And this is the most disorienting and indeed sinister feeling. The second part is a day in life - a narrative summarising 24 hours from his ordinary day somewhere in the mid 90s. It is more stylised and elaborated text, moving in its sincerity, but maybe a little too detailed.And the last and my favourite part in this book is a few days from his last years. He finishes teaching in Princeton and moves back to Argentina. These pages are less cryptic. I can see how he treasures every minute of his life; finds the beauty and the mystery around him. He also thinks about some general cultural tendencies. For example I find this apt: “Social narrative shifted from the novel into film and after film, into. The series, and now it is moving from these series to Facebook and Twitter and inline networks. What grows old and loses currency ends up becoming loose and free: when the audience of the 19th century novel moved towards film, the works of Joyce, Musil and Proust became possible. When film is supplanted as a massive medium by television, the cineasts from Cahiers du Cinema rescue the old artisans of Hollywood’s great artists; now that television is starting to be replaced massively by the Web, series are being valued as an art form. Soon, with the advancing of new technologies, blogs and ancient emails and text messages will be exhibited in the museums. What logic is this? Only what expires and falls “behind” becomes artistic.”Piglia has never given up on his diary, almost to the end. And the book ends on the very poignant, heart-breaking but philosophical note. Many writers would never want their private notes being published. But the others make a special literature out of their diaries.

I’ve looked it in the dictionary. The narrator Bricolage (in art or literature) is construction or creation from a diverse range of available things. I’ve looked it in the dictionary. The narrator of this novel, Kate, does not know what it is, but she mentions the word at least twice. Everything in this novel is guaranteed to be mentioned at least twice. And where am I going with that? Yes, I was about to say that without knowing it, she creates a bricolage of a novel.Here we go. Unintentionally, I’ve created a little pastiche how this narrative works. There is a lot of circularity and a lot something that initially looks like repletion, but each time there is a little difference, a little twist. Kate rarely repeats herself but to notice those differences one must pay constant attention to the novel and to keep in one’s head a considerable amount of information without visible links between individual fact bits. And it is a hard work. At least it was for me.Another way of looking at this creation is as a novel taken to the absurd level of fragmentation. Often, those fragments ending up having an absurd meaning themselves. For example I’ve just opened the book on a random page (p191) and here is a passage:“The instrument that Ludwig Wittgenstein used to play was a clarinet, by the way.Which for some curious reason he carried in an old sock, rather that in a case.So that anybody seeing him walk dawn the street with it might have thought, there goes that person carrying an old sock.Having no idea whatsoever that Mozart could come out of it.Doubtless A. E. Housman thought he was just somebody carrying an old sock, in fact, on the afternoon when Wittgenstein found himself with diarrhoea and asked if he could use the toilet, and A. E. Housman said no.”I kept the syntax: it is a sentence per paragraph. And the narrative jumps from this “sad” episode to the American Civil War within ten lines through similar chain of free but absurd associations. That is how this novel goes. It is funny, it is poignant and unashamedly intellectual. Kate talks about the high culture and its representatives. I’ve opened another random page (p185) and counted five names on it: da Vinci, Michelangelo, Medici, Shakespeare and Galileo. So it is useful to have a phone in hand just to check her references while you reading. But as you could see, she does not pick up the obvious facts and makes up a fair amount of them on the go. She also talks about herself and what she sees around her.The novel is written by a male author from the perspective of a single woman. This woman just types a few sentences a day on her typewriter about everything. Many would ask whether the author has managed to create a female voice credible enough to pull this off. My answer would be - yes. Though I’ve had some reservations. I do not think a woman would think about her periods so many times in a short while as a man would think about sex or his penis (I’ve been told it was a lot). For Kate, on the other hand, periods seem to be the topic for excessive observations. It looks a bit like overcompensation on the author's part. However, it is wonderful to see how Kate subverts a lot of the Ancient Greek literature. For example, her doubts that Helen was the real reason for the Trojan war and her imaginary meetings between Cassandra, Helen and Clytemnestra are a lot of fun.Sometimes, the novel has reminded me an act of good stand up comedy. Equally sometimes, her predicament would properly strike me and make me feel for her.But who is Kate? Slowly sieving through all her factoids, we are gathering some knowledge about her. But what is going on? Almost at the beginning, I’ve realised it has reminded me of the story told by the character in another novel:“A person wakes up in the empty world. There is no-one and nothing. He remembers the last days and realises he is guilty that everything disappeared. He does not recall any names. How the objects were called; what were the names of the people? It seems to him that everything would reappear again if he just could recall those names. The world should be searched for in his memory.” This is the plot of a traditional play put on the stage on the one of the islands in Indonesia. The amazing fact is I’ve heard it from the one of my patients almost verbatim. He was telling me about his recurring mental experience. He has been thrown in that place in his hallucinations. He walks in the empty world and tries to recall the names.”This character in that novel was a psychiatrist. And this passage seemed to be exactly describing Kate’s experience. I do not know whether there is really such a play in Indonesia or the rest of it. But such unexpected echo between the two novels written in different languages in different countries is quite daunting. Kate is indeed unsure about her mental health. She indeed tries to recall as many facts as possible to make her existence seem more real. And she is in the world where there is no single alive creature. Though the worlds still possess a lot of objects.We can interpret the novel in many ways. Kate could be indeed mentally ill and simply hallucinating. Alternatively, she might find herself in the empty world imposed on her by the author. Or even she might be writing a book herself, typing on that typewriter of hers, imagining her character going through this experience.In any case, the extent of her loneliness is heartbreaking. It does not really matter what is really going on. Loneliness. She tries to fight it by hectically recalling and registering different facts she used to know. She tries to weave some coherent patterns between those facts by imagining the connections between the bits she considers as facts. And those patterns are quite often counter-intuitive, hardly obvious and visible only to herself. But she does it again and again and never repeats herself and never stops trying.David Foster Wallace said in his essay:“..both defined & imprisoned by the epistemic strands she knows only she can weave. And weave she does, constantly, unable to stop, self-consciously mimicking Penelope of the antiquity that obsesses her.”That is how she makes sense of her reality whatever is the source of that reality could be. That is what helps her to keep going. But how lonely that feels. And for me the most poignant impression I took from the book is how incredibly isolating and lonely a mental illness could be. But equally how it makes people be creative out of necessity as there is no other escape routes. And what about Wittgenstein? I only point out the obvious. Wittgenstein was a gay man. So connecting “Wittgenstein” and “Mistress” together is another absurd which is indeed possible in Kate’s head. For the deeper philosophical references I recommend reading DWF’s essay ""The Empty Plenum"" collected in this Both Flesh and Not: Essays book. But I do strongly believe it is not essential to know Wittgenstein philosophy of language to enjoy this book. It is a novel where new people like Rainer Maria Raskolnikov are thrown into existence by Wittgenstein’s Mistress. However, being funny and absurd, it remains the tale of penetrating, existential loneliness....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jan 10, 2022","Jan 15, 2022","Jan 10, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51506.Wittgenstein_s_Mistress

When I read it now I could feel how the world has changed in the last 6 years. The preoccupation This book has been published in Switzerland in 2014. When I read it now I could feel how the world has changed in the last 6 years. The preoccupation of people stay the same: climate change, movement between the borders, inequality and injustice. But somehow we've lost a bit of innocence since that time with the pandemics, populism and all the rest of it... We do not look at the world any more as a connected organism and the globalisation has become some kind of a rude word... The people in this book do not think like that. They think how to change the world where the goods move freely into the world when the people move freely as well. It seems, we stopped looking at the world this way even in respect of the goods.But it would be very unfair to reduce this book to a single message. It is a wonderful work of fiction. It is constructed as a long conversation between a number of voices. I am not sure those people are all at the same place. The characters are just defined by their profession. It would be the logistic expert or the translator or the writer who would start a tale about their own experience which would be seamlessly picked up by someone else. And the conversation would flow as a river. They talk about travel, bodies, writing and the borders in all senses of this word. It has reminded me very remotely Flights. But it is much tighter packed and weaved around the core of the single conversation. There are also remote echoes of Fireflies, especially preoccupation with falling and disappearances.The title comes from the experience of the emigrants at the beginning of the last century that came for work, but could not find any accommodation. So they've rented places just for a few hours while the owner not at home to sleep in shifts. They never had enough sleep. Other people despised them for that. Sleep or lack of it places part in the book. The one character cannot sleep at all. As a result he thinks he could see what is happening everywhere at once. Possibly imagining or hallucinating, but he does not of course know this. These few lines by Walt Whitman quoted in the book underscores its atmosphere:""I wander all night in my vision, stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping, bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers.""The reading experience that lingers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jan 04, 2022","Jan 08, 2022","Jan 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39911167-shift-sleepers

It works as a text or rather as a collection of little texts glued together. The writing is solid, pleasurable, full of deliberate archaisms in the proper Russian tradition a la Nabokov, the humour is good. In general, quite a few nods to Nabokov, especially to his “Gift” - lost father, hyperbolised despise of the left-wing progressives; spiritual seances (this more towards “The Vane sisters” or “The eye”). Glorious descriptive language encompassing anything from the street of Moscow to female foot (is it nod to Pushkin? - who knows…). But I’ve been unfortunate to pick up “The eye”, the real stuff, straight after this. And this has faded quickly. This is the book that could be a good companion for a few hours but not much left in the mind to work with after it is finished. The premise of counter-factual history is interesting. I understand the author is using it as a background, not as a main field for investigation or world-building. And that is fine. But the ideas - they've taken from certain school of the 19th century and shallowly presented albeit with the rhetorical force; the novel would be better without going there at all.Might come back to write more in Russian. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Dec 24, 2021","Dec 28, 2021","Dec 24, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56183819

I liked the main protagonist who was capable to laugh at himself as well as to observe and satirise certain attitudes of the American cultural elite towards ""ethnic"" literature and the willingness of some ""ethnic"" writers to propagate the stereotypes assigned to them in exchange for money or recognition. This short novel was genially funny apart from being topical. It was also fascinating to see modern America through the eyes of a Nigerian aspiring writer who is the main protagonist.

Unfortunately, I am not sure it would be translated anyThis novel has won Andrei Bely prize this year, the Russian equivalent to the Goldsmith prize. Unfortunately, I am not sure it would be translated any time soon as even in Russia it is still on the margins. But….I’ve been thinking about this book a lot. And I am still not totally sure what is that I’ve read. But I can say categorically that it is the one of the most puzzling, unusual texts I’ve read. I should not like it. Superficially it is about the 90s and it is about coming of the age in this time. It is the most exploited topic in the Russian literature for the last 20 years or so. All these metamorphoses and transitions - bandits and thieves are becoming the politicians and businessman; education is replaced by money; the falling of the old social system and the absence of the immediate legitimate replacement; its impact on people: disorientation, despair, loss. It has been done so many times that I am almost immune to those stories especially knowing that they somehow very similar to each other while they are missing something essential. It was not only about that in real life. This is superficially the same. It is told from the perspective of a boy from a provincial town. But reading about all these bandits, card swindlers, junkies, corrupted officials etc., I could not get rid of feeling that I am deciphering a certain code. There is of course a perfectly visible much deeper layer as well. The book is about idea of love. Love as concept, love as an attempt to maintain the constant attention on. The subject in someones mind. This could be a tiresome effort and come at high cost. Also it is about borderline states between sanity and madness. Is there a border at all? However, I still think there is something even deeper than that in this text which is difficult to verbalise per se. It is the relationship between the metaphysical and real. And how sometimes the one is been forcefully thrown into the other. Carl Jung quipped: “People don't have ideas. Ideas have people.” And, I think this text is about it. But, in this case, it is not necessary ideas, it is more like the totality of visions and thoughts and they are amplified by the mental states of the characters. The boy possess a number of books. He recognises his real life friends and acquaintances in the illustrations within the books. The symbolism of the books’ characters seems to be projecting into the fates of the real people. Or so it seems to the boy who sometimes searches for the explanation and sometimes just let it play its course. Here, it is not a tired magic realism trope. It is more archetypical. I was thinking about some plausible explanation how this resemblance could exist even in his mind. Only solution I could think of is that any image is an accumulation of the centuries worth knowledge of the human nature which is getting passed on through certain mechanisms, the most obvious - culture, but many less obvious ways probably exist as well. So it is not surprising that a certain personality in real life would correspond to an image which was conceived totally independently from that person. It is my version. But it could be many. Just interesting puzzle to think about. And there are many others.There are playing cards. Infinite amount of their combinations leads to infinite possibilities of creating a symbolic language. Who could think that a process of shuffling the cards in a certain way might trigger the boy feeling physically dizzy and eventually ending up for a spell in a mental hospital. The cards play both meta-fictional and the direct role in the plot. Mental institution as a mirror image of the world with its topology, symbolism, language and even performances as a therapeutics is another theme.Though the word “theme” is the last word which comes to mind when I think about this novel.But whatever ideas behind this, it is an exciting text. The words are simple, but the metaphors are weird and beautiful. The syntax is unusual as well. For example:“Behind the window, the snow was falling, or bits of a paper, or tea leaves. The downed birds.” That full stop there splits the series of images as if the camera moves away from one window to another.Or this one about memory:“Childhood dreams are floating in memory like in opaque water. And not only the childhood ones. Memory in general is one eerie opaqueness. The more you work with it the more amazed you are by its cunning and perfidy. It can suck you in like a bog and then spit you out and leave you in a full oblivion. What did really happen and what did not.” The main narrative imbeds several smaller texts, something like fairytales or little legends. They by themselves are pretty striking philosophical etudes. They are referred in the text as “the keys” that might be spotted or not. It might be another reference to the archetypes in the Jungian sense. But again more importantly how beautiful those little stories are. Here is the one:People are setting up a screen looking at the sea. In the dusk, a performance starts. The girls from the village sing gentle songs and the lighting works in such a way that the floating silhouettes are appearing on the screen - big fluttering fins, shapes and sails of ships…The performance could continue for a whole night. But where is the audience sitting? It is appeared to be that the show is performed for the fish. It reveals the human gratitude to it for being a prey. But also it shows that there is nothing to be afraid of getting into the net. On the contrary, it would start a long and pleasant journey of the fish’s soul to paradise.Creativity and madness is always a popular subject in the arts. However in this novel the author is trying to show something different. Madness makes possible reaching something unknowable otherwise. People who are mentally divergent possess a sensitivity enabling them to travel in the places where the majority cannot go. Though this gift comes at a very high price.-----Я исчерпала своё красноречие по-английски, поэтому просто пару цитат (quotes):""Нет, снова я что-то не то описал.

Both works are based on the balancing the conversation with the Russian classic literature and the dystopian elements. The prior book was more skewed towards the former; it echoed the 19th century's titans. This still contains the elements of imitating different styles, but deals with the 20th century from Velimir Khlebnikov to the Soviet realistic writers of stagnation period. But the prevailing emphasis is on the dystopian quest. Sorokin definitely possesses a wide imagination and the result is entertaining enough. There is also an element of a political satire in the first half. World leaders are represented by their genetically created prototypes designed in a form of human bottoms with thin long hands. There are eight of them - main global leaders circa 2019. Pretty off-putting, a bit funny. I was glad Boris was killed somewhere at the beginning. Of course a dystopian form of Gulag has to make an appearance as well. I did not like too much emphasis on different activities ""below waist"". All the creativity related to this area is limited by definition and did not impress me at all. Though it is represented by substantial variety of acts.

This bUpdate: It was long-listed for the International Booker Prize 2022.Someone said: ""History is what a certain time period notices in the other.”. This book has made me thinking once more what is a historical novel. There are two broad ways how to look at it. A historical novel might be a book when the author takes a certain time period, creates a bunch of fictional characters to show how this time period would affect the thoughts and actions of these imaginary people. The main idea might be to show the historical forces in play and their affect on the individual lives. This is not such a novel. This is closer to something which Javier Cercas defines as a non-fiction novel. Olga T takes the lives of people that really existed, adheres to the facts of those lives as close as she could. But at the same time, she uses the techniques that are expected from a novel. She pays huge attention to the narrative voices. And the novel is totally poly-vocal. She also uses a complex structure when the narrative is developing in three separate layers complementing each other. The structure holds together by the voice or rather gaze of Yente, the women who cannot die and sees everything from above. Olga T. calls this “the 4th person narration”. I guess Yente is the only character Olga T. Has fully created as opposed to rediscovering from history. The novel is full of diaries, old books extracts, letters and even poems. I found also the included contemporary illustrations add to atmosphere.Her characters are the 18th century Eastern European Jews, catholic priests and some Polish aristocracy. The main subject is Frankism - the heresy founded around Jacob Frank who considered himself a Messiah and had built a movement with the help of his disciples. They believed among other things that the conversion into Christianity is the necessary step to achieve their religious goals. Sects and their power is a strange subject that might feel even alien for some readers. Olga T does not seem to be interested in creating the awareness of the broader context or attracting the readers through some cheap tricks like imaginary plot twists. She seems to be interested in investigate exactly this - strangeness. Her characters exits on the margins of their societies and cultures constantly transcending those margins geographical, religious and social. They are eternal strangers:“There is something wonderful in being a stranger, in being foreign, something to be relished, something as alluring as sweets. It is good not to be able to understand a language, not to know the customs, to glide like a spirit among others who are distant and unrecognisable. Then a particular kind of wisdom awakens – an ability to surmise, to grasp the things that aren’t obvious.” This novel is very successful in demonstrating this and showing how something potentially new is painfully appearing through the cracks in the old. This novel focuses on the individuals. There are so many of them. Olga T. takes equal care in depicting an old catholic priest writing an encyclopaedia, a Jewish woman maintaining the accounts for Jacob and being the one of his many mistresses or an assimilated Jewish convert who becomes a lawyer and revolutionary to be subsequently executed by the French Commune. All these people have names. Many of them even have two sets of names as they’ve converted. Sometimes, it was hard to follow who is who. But at some stage I stopped caring that much. And the lasting impression it has created on me was of polyphony, being totally absorbed by the chorus of those voices. They have become the real people of me. Olga T. convinced me of their past existence. It is quiet a poignant feeling. It reminded me of In Memory of Memory where the author contemplates whether to quote the letters of her deceased relatives. To quote them would be to bring once more their existence into the spotlight before the eternal darkness. Not to quote would mean let them fade forever without a trace. I had a similar feeling here. Olga T. has successfully brought these ordinary people back from that darkness where they’ve been for centuries .What I struggled with is a relative obscurity of Jacob’s Frank’s character. He is represented in the novel only through the eyes of his followers. And, at the end I was not totally convinced what was that uniqueness that has attracted them to him or his teaching. From an interview I’ve read I understood Olga T just could not find a voice to deal with such type of a personality. And because of it, there is an empty space in the middle of the novel. There is also a symbol for it - a cave. There was a special cave into which Jacob went as a boy to hide in Korolevka. HIs wife was also buried in a cave. The cave is a good symbol of his ambivalence. More generally, it is a good metaphor for the the absence of dichotomy of good and evil. A cave could be a place to be lost forever. Buy equally it could be a place of refuge. Interestingly enough, this particular cave in Korolevka was just this. During the Nazi’s occupation, a few dozen Jews were hiding there for two years. It saved their lives.This story of a relatively obscure Jewish movement in pre-modern times has made me think how we all need the other to understand ourselves better. But also how easily the persecuted could turn the coats and become the persecutors themselves, and even more generally - the fluidity of any identity perceived as a cast in stone. Overall the impression I’ve got from this novel that is full of strangeness but also full of energy. And by the end, I was immersed in its atmosphere. She builds it with a lot of details. Sometimes it felt excessive. Sometimes I would miss the voice of the character I liked while reading the voices I cared less. But it adds up into the whole. Olga T. said:“Sometimes I think about this type of writing as panoptic. I like to create a scene, and characters, and let them live. I like to look down on relationships from above; I believe that reality is not a series of individual, isolated subjects and objects but the infinite quantity of relations between them. I see reality as the stage for these relationships—not only those between the subjects, but also their relationships with objects, and with nature. It would be hard to give an account of any kind of social process without incorporating this multiplicity of points of view, this interaction of so many energies.”I could see that this book could not be everyone’s cup of tea. It is probably not a page-turner. But it is a stylish novel that has a lot to say about the traces of the vanished world in our present and takes its time to do so.PS:I've found this wonderful article, the translation of Olga's essay ""How I wrote The Book of Jacob"".

I even can use a phrase from the novel “excess of baroque adornment”. Alas the author uses it not to describe his book but a fountain. However, it totally applies to his work, metaphorically speaking. And he loves his metaphors. He uses long chains of them.If I would not be bound by one word, it would get more complicated because I do not even think it is a novel in a classic sense of the word. It does not have any tight structure connecting all of its pieces into one whole. It is rather a poem. Yes a very long one and in prose, but still, it deals more with the language than with anything else in particular. I would argue that the order one read it could be pretty random between the chapters. It is all about sentences, images, certain musicality.Reading it could be frustrating as it never lets you settle, be lost in a narrative. You feel you found your way. But then the chapter ends and you’ve been thrown over the cliff into something different starting in the new one. At least it was mine impression. It is also not like Ulysses when you would expect a different style from each chapter. The style here is more or less consistent. And sometimes, those luscious meandering sentences would get on my nerves. As for example, instead of saying “he went home for Christmas” you would be treated to “He went off to savour Christmas vacation humanistically, to observe the metamorphosis of the satiating act of Aristotle on Epiphany”. Or this one:“On a nearby tray, on the racks that offered their woof still growing because recently cut, guavas freshly cut bore down on the porcine chips with their pinks ribbons, which aroused the parsley sprig on the point of the palatal regions. “And all of this for the sake of a plate of fruit. In my case it helped also to have a phone nearby as I did not know quite a few words or names. In this verbosity and baroque style it has reminded me Theroux's Darconville's Cat. But a milder version of it though and without that much of a misogynistic streak as Theroux’s book. Equally, quite often grappling with those sentences bear a fruit. Like in this case for example:“In Ravel’s piece, the quartet form dominated its impressionist pauses, the purity of its attempts to isolate islands of sensation, to give a momentary sovereignty to fragments, and when the feeling of a continuity of supported sound almost disappeared, the fragment would dissolve in the totality of the flow, complicating the unity of the current of sound, the reflections of each wave; the form contained implicit participation and justification, each rhythm was created in relation to the flow of sound, and its current pursued a supreme essence, and at the same time it seemed to be staring into the fact of everything that came close, and thus it brought about a realisation of its acts within the cosmos of sound.” The sentence contains 120 words, my word processor says. One need to work hard and read it a few times. But then - this truly beautiful description of music crystallises though the brain fog. Hopefully. The shorter nuggets of wisdom are scattered around as well for those willing to pick up:”He did not use his intellectual superiority to improve the world of the people he spoke to, but to score a mark with his personality and his whims.”“Life was a bundle tightly bound that became untied only when it fell into eternity. ”There is a very lose plot or actually at least three of them. At the centre of this work is Jose Cemi a child at the beginning and a young man (look at his initials). The first part of the plot is his family history. A few chapters are focused on the gone past of the Cuban burguesia. It is a bit Nabokov’s Speak, Memory in terms of amounts of adjectives, descriptions and colours. Though it is much harder to figure out who is who. The next part is Cemi’s intellectual and sexual coming of age. He does it mainly through his friendship with two friends with the ancient Greek names. They are debating a lot about the morality of homosexuality, Apocalypses and other theological issues. I might be impressed more by those dialogues if I would not just finished The Magic Mountain where there was a similar set up in terms of dialogues but more wideranging and interesting topics (for me). All these chapters are brimming with homoerotic tension. Generally eroticism plays a substantial role in the imagery and subplots in this part. My favourite bit was Chapter 12 that is the novel within a novel. It is compact, tightly packed, disorienting four intervening stories. The piece challenges our assumptions about temporal nature of the reality and just plain beautiful. If one would like to have a taster of the whole, I would recommend trying this one.Lezama Lima is a poet before anything else. I am sure he has got his poetic system and knowing it would benefit in reading this book. Without it, I can say that I am really happy I’ve read it and I enjoyed much of my fruitful struggle with it. But baroque is not my favourite style. I like it in small doses. It gave me a dose of luscious writing which would last for a along time.Just to add another and more informed perspective, here is the proper and very positive  by Edmund White:https://www.nytimes.com/1974/04/21/ar......more",Notes are private!,1,32,1,"Nov 26, 2021","Nov 30, 2021","Nov 26, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44311730-paradiso

But this novel does something different. The narrator of this novel sits in a bar and goes beyond a single narrative. He imagines stories and tries them on and off his own personality, imaginary, but possible selves. Frisch explained his intentions further ""to show the reality of an individual by having him appear as a blank patch outlined by the sum of fictional entities congruent with his personality .""The one of this imaginary self is a man called Gantenbein who pretends he is blind. This appears to give him a lot of unforeseen privileges in his public and private life. Also it makes him truly ""see"" what he would otherwise ignore. The novel is a wonderful if little melancholic profound exploration of women and men. For me it was quite refreshing to see such unashamedly male but very poignant perspective on a relationship. It is also revealing how much imagination a man could invest into jealousy. I was lead to this novel by my reading of Malina. Bachmann and Frisch were in a relationship that sadly broke off. Soon after that, Frisch has published this novel. It has been said that Lila, its main female character, is partially based on Bachmann. After reading both, I believe ""Malina"" is at least partly response to this novel. They echo each other, and reading them consequently is a special experience as if they are two sides of the same coin. I still prefer ""Malina"" for its edge in inventiveness and scope. But this one is a great novel as well....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Nov 17, 2021","Nov 29, 2021","Nov 17, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/74183.Gantenbein

The first time I could not stop turning the pages. I’ve swallowed the book or the book has swallowI’ve read this novel 2.5 times in two translations. The first time I could not stop turning the pages. I’ve swallowed the book or the book has swallowed me, I am not sure. I’ve raised through it like a car without breaks, totally engrossed by the words, the imagery and the flow of this text. I knew it is packed with meaning. But I did not care for the meaning that much this first time. I could not slow down and I did not wanted to. It gave me a lot of amazement, aesthetic pleasure and some adrenalin. The second time, I’ve read slowly. I’ve read for the meaning. I wanted to understand what was going on in this novel. And it was a very different experience, but as well powerful and intellectually unique.I imagine this book is a plant, something organic and unshapely that refuses to fit into any box and grows out of it pretty quickly sticking the new stems in various directions. I thought of Tropisms. But a tropism is the directional growth of an organism in response of an external stimulus. The organism of this novel stimulates itself more from inside. Reading this novel is more like interacting with this creature rather than a classic immersion.It reads more like a poetry in a sense that you can read it many times and each time it would be something different you would find, a new image, a new trick of the language, a new connection. It is evident that Bachmann has started as a poet.I do not think it would suit anyone who wants to know what is exactly going on. It is probably needless to say that those looking for a character driven plotted story would be disappointed. I cannot even tell categorically how many characters are there. It is fragmentary, it mixes lots of styles: letters, dialogues, dream sequences, proper nightmares and even a legend. But what holds it all together it is this cosmic desperate energy. The book is brutal, it is devastating, it is raging and darkly funny and it is terribly beautiful. The way of writing is very special as she manages to combine very rich symbolic imagery with the language that sometimes rational and practical and always very exact in terms of the choice of the words.It is the one of those books that is a puzzle on so many levels. But unlike Nabokov’s puzzles for example, this one does not have a single solution hidden by the author. There are hints and a lot of references left in the text, but everything is open to interpretation and any reading of this text would be different. I personally found it very rewarding, on the second read, putting my personal “version of events” together. But some might find this lack of clear path frustrating. I think it was wrong decision to get rid of footnotes in the last English edition of this book. I found them enriching my reading experience in my Russian edition.Bachmann called this book herself “a spiritual, imaginary autobiography”. So yes it is about her, but it is far from auto fiction as we now know it.In Malina, we meet with the woman, who narrates the whole thing from the first person “I”. She shares an apartment with one man, Malina. But at the same time, she is passionately in love with another, a Hungarian called Ivan. Those two seem to be not interested in each other’s existence. She idolises Ivan to such an extent, that the relationship becomes almost metaphysical on her part. It is strange as Ivan is otherwise a pretty ordinary divorcee with two children. While Malina remains more as a conversational partner, at least initially. Both of those male characters are far from fully flashed. It is clear that their roles are symbolic. But how far that symbolism is going? This is the one of the main intrigues of this book.And I do not think this question has got a single right answer. I put my interpretation and some background info is in the comment under a spoiler. It was a challenge, but it was a great pleasure trying to come up with the one. But I would recommend to read this comment only if you’ve read the book already. Here, I want to share a few ideas inspired by the book.A need to be naive.Once Ivan finds a few pages of her manuscript “Death styles”. Incidentally Bachmann planned to write a trilogy with such a name. But Malina is the only finished work. Ivan does not like the idea of it:“…why isn’t there anything else, there must be other books, like EXSULTATE JUBILATE, which make you mad with joy, you’re always mad with joy yourself, so why don’t you write like that. It’s disgusting to put this misery on the market, just adding to what’s already there, these books are all absolutely loathsome….” He mentions Dostoyevsky’s “The Notes from the Dead House” as an example. And then he continues: “…they’re always suffering for all of humanity with all its troubles as well and they talk about all the wars and predict new ones…” When I was reading it, I was thinking surely he is not right. And maybe he is not. But it reminded me David Graeber’s Debt: The First 5,000 Years. In there, he claimed there that Adam Smith has created an utopia in his An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. The world was not like he described it in that book. He imagined it. But it has become like that in a few generations after sufficient amount of people has read his book. Graeber, in his turn was saying that it is what we need - to imagine a new world and to write about it. It is of course not that simple, far from it. But it would be fair to say that the big chunk of contemporary, forward looking fiction written today is dystopian. It is especially true for the young adults. The world created in those books is so gloomy and so scary. I know it represents the fears and concerns about the current state of the world. Those fears in Ivan’s words, predict the new wars by making them much easier to imagine, making them real. In other words, those gloomy dystopian books shape the reality of today and tomorrow. But why there is such a little place for more positive imagination, maybe for an utopia? It seems Bachmann was thinking a lot about this transformative power of language. She said in one of her interviews: “If we would fully possess a word, possess a language, we would not need weapons.”Moreover, in her Frankfurt lectures, she talks that we treat literature as if it were an utopia. She says “we give any work of literature the chance to exist by the single fact that we read it and we would read it tomorrow.”And the language is our dream of complete expression: “Each word, each phrase, each period, each punctuation mark, each metaphor and each symbol add to this dream of being able to express everything - our dream which we would never be able to fully realise.”It reminded me Nabokov’s saying: “I know more than I can express in words, and the little I can express would not have been expressed, had I not known more.”Under Ivan’s influence the heroine experience the following:“A storm of words starts in my head, then an incandescence, a few syllables begin to glow, and brightly colored commas fly out of all the dependent clauses and the periods which were once black have swollen into balloons and float up to my cranium, for everything will be like EXSULTATE JUBILATE in that glorious book I am thus just beginning to find. Should this book appear, as someday it must, people will writhe with laughter after only one page, they will leap for joy, they will be comforted, they will read on, biting their fists to suppress their cries of joy, it can’t be helped, and when they sit down by the window and read still further they’ll start flinging confetti to the pedestrians on the street below, so that they, too, will stop, astonished, as if they had walked into a carnival, and people will start throwing apples and nuts, dates and figs just like on St. Nicholas’ Day, they will lean out of their windows without getting dizzy and shout out: Hear, hear! look and see! I’ve just read something wonderful, may I read it to you, everybody come closer, it’s too wonderful!'It is interesting she does not use the word ‘to create” or ‘to write” but “to find” about her “glorious book”. All of this is somewhere there. We just need keep looking for it, asking naive questions, it won’t work all the time, but sometimes we would be able to express something new. Utopia? Yes. Can a book make people in “leap with joy” in mass? I do not know, but it might re-shape a few little “bricks” of our reality.And the heroine starts writing a beautiful legend of the Princes of Kargan. The story is inserted in fragments further into a fragmentary novel. She is “able to find myself in the legend of a woman who never existed”.There is an image in the novel of a virus caught by her and Ivan at the beginning that she wishes would spread around. She says she would name this virus soon but never does. Many would think this virus is love. But I think the virus might be a bunch of new ideas available to her through a new language spread to the others in a form of a book and making people create good things. A type of positive social contagion through literature.Does she win at the end? No. She faces a crashing defeat:“In the apartment I lie down on the floor, thinking about my book, it’s gotten lost, there is no beautiful book, I can no longer write the beautiful book, I’ve stopped thinking about the book long ago, there’s no foundation, nothing more comes to me, not a single sentence. But I was so sure the beautiful book existed and that I would find it..”But does it mean it was not worthwhile trying? No, again.I think it is very important to challenge something that we think is obvious. Those concepts and narratives we’ve been told were alway there. The traditions that seemingly do not have a better alternative both in an individual life and a society. I think it is worthwhile to ask naive questions. Ivan, otherwise not very attractive character is really good at it. It is all in his name. Just try to move the letters around. Naive is Ivan. (Ok we need to drop “e” for this to work).He asks:“Wailing Wall, why hadn’t anyone ever built a Wall of Joy?”I am not sure why I’ve picked up this theme out of this otherwise dark, brutal and beautiful novel. But it made me feel good thinking about it.Back to “Normal”One of the other themes of the novel is collective and individual repression of thoughts. In the post-war world, so many feelings and observations are required to be silenced, ignored or even replaced by blind hope.“I almost believed it myself—that once the window and door frames are reinstalled, once the mountains of rubble disappear, then all of a sudden everything will be better, people will again live in their homes and be able to continue living. But just the fact that for years I wanted to say how strange I found this living—and continued living—is very revealing, though no one wanted to listen to me. I would never have thought that everything would first have to be plundered, stolen, pawned and then bought and sold three times over.”Based upon her words, It seems people has plunged plundering and looting and then buying and selling, wildly consuming just because they simply could and also in order to forget what they’ve been through. All of this while the war was still pretty much raging in their minds. This has sadly reminded me our “Covid back to normal” strive, but of course on a incompatibly smaller scale.Malina says at one point “there is always war inside you”. And also that:“Once one has survived something then survival itself interferes with understanding, and you don't even know which lives came before and which is your life of today, you even mix up your own lives.”ReadingThis is the last thing I want to mention. Of course I could not let it slip from my . There is a brilliant piece of writing in the book, sort of anti-interview where we do not hear the questions but only the answers by the main heroine. She completely subverts the whole thing as it is evident that there is no way her answers could be published. The exasperated interviewer switches off a tape-recorder a few times. But she talks about reading there among other things:“Reading is a vice which can replace all other vices or temporarily take their place in more intensely helping people live, it is a debauchery, a consuming addiction. No, I don’t take any drugs, I take books..”And what about this brutal and beautiful piece (after both she and her books and were physically hurt):I lie down among the books, I again caress them, one after the other, in the beginning there were only three, then there were fifteen, then over a hundred, and I ran to my first bookcase in my pajamas. Good night, gentlemen, good night, Mr. Voltaire, good night, Fürst, may you rest well, my unknown authors, sweet dreams, Mr. Pirandello, my respect, Mr. Proust. Chaire, Thukydides! For the first time the gentlemen are saying good night to me, I try to avoid touching them so as not to stain them with blood. Good night, says Josef K. to me.Bachmann is definitely a precursor of many contemporary works of fiction. Now, reading the others I probably would not help but noticing her influence. The most obvious recent example is Checkout 19. Where the narrator talks about the books she has read for about 20 pages, including Malina. I know now exactly where the inspiration was coming from. There is an exquisitely written sequence in Malina, very similar in spirit.They’ve mutually influenced each other with Max Frisch and Paul Celan (more about in “What is going on” comment under the spoiler.) Also I’ve also read that Thomas Bernhard has modelled the character of a poetess in Extinction on her personality. I could have cut and paste the whole book I think. It is so dense it is hardly a world there I would not want to quote. But one has to end somewhere. What is amazing is how she incorporated all these thoughts into the work of art. It seamlessly unites the personal, intimate stuff with the social and political. I’ve seen a lot of attempts to do that in the very recent novels, but it is rarely goes beyond a manifesto through the mouth of a character created specifically for this purpose.I’ve written many paragraphs already and I have not even started. I do not want to reduce a multitude to something measurable. But if I need to say it in one sentence, “Malina” is a wonderful, devastating and complex work about loneliness, desperate courageous attempt to be understood and its defeat.Bachmann said to someone somewhere:“I think, all of the books talk about an impossibility of people to understand each other. All this fake understanding that they call openness is not there. Understanding does not exist. Openness is nothing but misunderstanding. In essence, every human being is left together with her thoughts and feelings that cannot be translated.”...more",Notes are private!,0,77,1,"Nov 09, 2021","Nov 19, 2021","Nov 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41574536-malina

All those 3 parts were published separately within 2 years. I’ve read and enjoyed the first part soon after it was published. I’ve read the other two together and finished recently. In hindsight, I wish I would wait before reading the first part until the whole novel is published. As it is, my experience of reading the 1st part has slightly overshadowed for me the rest. In the nutshell, the majority of the ideas were pretty much expressed and explored there. However, the whole novel is still the one of the best books Ive read that are written recently. Unless specified otherwise, this  would refer to the work in its entirety. Imagine a strip. It obviously posses two opposite sides. But of you cut it, half-twist it and connect the ends you would end up with a Mobius strip. Something that defines common sense - an object with only one side combing the two. The initial sides are still separate and quite visible, but they are merged in one. This novel has reminded me a Mobius strip. Everything which appeared to be different, even opposite are seamlessly metamorphoses into each other. Time warps in a way that the past has become the future and the future meets the past. The characters seemingly different become similar, merge into each other, follow each other thoughts and actions… But only for an instance and then they separate again going their individual ways and meeting their separate fates.  [image]M.C. EscherAnd I, while I am reading, I am like the ant from the famous Escher’s work, travel on the one side of the strip only to find myself suddenly and inevitably on the other. And all of this is going on a certain loop. And I do not know whether this loop is going to end. But I suspect that - yes. But I cannot say how. Though maybe I already know how from the beginning. But I still cannot say.And this form, this ambiguity, but equally the discipline with which Fosse adhere to it is the work of art.“Everybody has that feeling when they look at a work of art and it's right, that sudden familiarity, a sort of...recognition, as though they were creating it themselves, as though it were being created through them while they look at it or listen to it."" That what Gaddis said in The Recognitions. He talked predominantly about the visual art. The big part of this book is also about this. What is “a good” picture? But I remembered Gaddis in connection with the novel as a whole. It feels “right” in Gaddis's sense.And for this feeing, I could forgive Fosse what I perceived the weakness of the plot in this last part. The women characters there were all too possessive competing for the attention of the two relatively passive men. I could forgive him a cliche - a stream of visible white light coming through the window when someones dies…Though there was a minor female character, new to this part, that I found superbly crafted. She is possessive as well all right but in a less banal way. She is an old woman renting a room to the main character. She is a bit mad and a bit desperate lady, but at the same time full of style and energy. She reminded me of Miss Havisham from Great Expectations. I thought it was brilliant move by Fosse adding her to the cast of his characters. Continuing with the visual metaphors, if this novel was a painting it would be something in the shades of white, black and greys. This lady has splashed a little streak of red into the canvas.I talked about the ideas in my  of the first part. In the rest of the novel, those ideas are amplified and developed. For me it seemed the novel has progressed more from the nature of creativity deeper into metaphysics, the nature of the Divine. In this part, the author more explicitly paid tribute to Meister Eckhart. “and if it wasn’t for him I would never have found words for closeness of God.” Those were the words of the main character.“of course Meister Eckhart is right about how many of the people who don’t believe in God are people who really do, while the ones who are doing all kinds of things to show that they believe in God actually believe in something other than God, they believe in an idol, because they believe in good works, in repentance and fasting, in sacraments, in the liturgy, in this or that conduct bringing them closer to God, yes, most of those who are inside are outside, and most who are outside are inside, the first shall be last,…”Indeed. “Those who are inside are outside…”. It seems, we are back on the Mobius strip.PSJust a few words about the translation into English. It is very good. It seems it conveys the cadence of the original. And it flows perfectly. However, I would be interested to find out what was in the original for “The Namesake”. It just somehow a bit of a narrow term. And I did not like “open-faced sandwiches” and “High Academic School”. I thought they use “butterbrots” in English and it could be understood. And high-school is just a high-school whether it is an academic stream or not. But all these things are not a big deal, just a pet peeve of mine as the words get repeated a lot in the novel....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Nov 05, 2021","Nov 09, 2021","Nov 05, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58382687-a-new-name

I still need to read it properly. I've enjoyed Graeber's anthropological perspective, erudition and the fluency of his arguments. Also I've never read anything serious by a self-acknowledged anarchist. He has made a lot if interesting original points that go against the grail of the well-defined narrative of social and economic history. And it is refreshing to say the least.My main takes:1) The big chunk of the book is devoted to the premise that debt preceded barter as the initial basis of economic activity. I need to go through his chain of arguments and the evidence once more. It is great he argues so persuasively. But I am not sure how much it matters for us as now debt is definitely presiding.2) Adam Smith has imagined an utopia how the economy works. But this utopia has become our reality at least partly because many people read his book. This is very interesting though not totally convincing. But I would know whom to blame just in case:-)3) Graeber has devoted a big chapter discussing the assumptions about moral economy and human nature: self-interest vs communism (not in a classical but in the ethical sense). This is the core to understand the people's motivations in economic activity. I definitely need more time with this chapter to see how ground-breaking his thinking is, but it is good he challenges both motives as an extreme.4) According to Graeber, to function properly, capitalism has to encourage an apocalyptic thinking and the idea that it would end eventually. As soon as people start to believe that a party could continue forever, a very real crisis hits. Example - market crush speculations from Tulip's War to 2007 recession. Again it is a very profound thought and it does makes sense. However I need to read him properly to understand the implications he thinks about.5) The most optimistic bit of the book that there is alway alternative how a society operates according to Graeber. And it is only limited by our collective imagination. So he suggest not to limit it.Whether I would agree with him or not, it is a very well written, persuasive and simply interesting book looking at the long global history. Not many thinkers achieved that much. It is a shame he is not with us any more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Oct 11, 2021","Nov 03, 2021","Nov 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6617037-debt

In a shorter term, Grossman sees Lenin, not Stalin and the cause of all ruthless evil that happened in 50 years after the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia. It is the only novel I've read from that period which describes Holodomor in Ukraine in shocking details. I believe the novel was unfinished when Grossman died.

The main role of her protagonist was to listen to her interlocutors and to project their views through herself. It is very similar here. The novel is centred on a man newly released after spending almost all his adult life in the gulag. But he hardly speaks, at least until the last episode of the novel. He listens to different people he meets in the society he was excluded from.

I tried to read them in the language he has initially written them. The majority of the Russian language stories are actually written in Berlin. The English ones - in America. But soon enough after his arrival there, Nabokov has stopped writing them all together. In general, I am very impressed with the sheer variety of those stories. It is amazing how he does not repeat himself considering that his protagonists are all immigrants and his setting is more or less constant be it Berlin, Nice or Boston. But he experiments so much in terms of style, form and the language that I never knew what to expect. His texts are rarely traditional stories with the infamous arc of a plot. Moreover, he actively strives to subvert the usual expectations. He uses amazing variety of tricks: narrators talk to the characters, many of them cannot be trusted; the narration moves from the third to the first person without any warning to a reader; prose rhymes - all these tricks for me firmly belong to the second time of the 20th century. Nabokov wrote these stories of the 20s and 30s.The impression Nabokov left me with is very different from Chekhov, my favourite Russian writer of short stories. Chekhov rarely fails to move me deeply. While Nabokov has created a sense of aesthetic admiration, almost collaboration when I felt a huge pleasure in identifying a clue he would deliberately leave or noticing a device he used to move the narrative into a different gear. But the stories are still very much populated by very human beings full of very human passions.It is likely, Nabokov was more interested in writing his novels rather than short stories. Some of them contain the ideas or sketches of his future novels. But still he managed to create some unforgettable ones.Below is my extremely subjective “Nabokov’s dozen”:13 PassengerIt is a very short text that might be a key-hole view of Nabokov’s writing philosophy. It involves a train journey and the conversation between a writer and a critic (not on the train). As a bonus, the comic element is sharp.12 Lance This one is written in English. There is a sci-fi element to it. But it is not essential. It is more like a spoof. What is essential is a conflict of modernity and human values. It is based on a similar themes as his much wider admired “Signs and Symbols”. Though the context is entirely different. But I prefer this one. It also contains a paragraph that has become even more relevant after more than 70 years. I wonder what he would make out of social media:“I suspect, I am insidiously influenced by the standard artistry of modern photography and I feel how much easier writing must have been in former days when one’s imagination was not hemmed in by innumerable visual aids, and a frontiersman looking at his first giant cactus or his first high snows was not necessarily reminded of a tyre company’s pictorial advertisement.”11 A Nursery TaleA relatively simple anti-fairy tale with a devil (in interesting re-incarnation) who might grant a wish to a young and not very pleasant man. Execution is superb and some very early connotations of Lolita.10 The AurelianThis one really made me understand how people felt after hyperinflation in Weimar Republic. But apart from it, it is formerly orchestrated with two point of views, unlikable, but at the same time deeply human main character and some butterflies in the mix.9 Lik It is the one of the most realistic and less playful Nabokov’s stories. Still he is making it meta-fictional starting with a bad play within the story where a Russian character played by a provincial Russian actor. The core element is the collision between the actor and his forgotten relative-bully. This man is suddenly resurfaced in the actor’s life from nowhere. And they seem to be mirroring each other by being a double version of a miserable emigrant existence. The finale is worthy of Dostoevsky.8 Potato Elf This story would make a good movie. I think it was the intent as Nabokov initially planned to write a script. In the centre there is an unusual and slightly sinister love triangle. The story is dramatic, almost artificially so, almost farcical. But there is a glimpse of authentic sense of melancholy and transience of life. And this passage resonated with me deeply:""Every separate day in the year is a gift presented to only one man—the happiest one; all other people use his day, to enjoy the sunshine or berate the rain, never knowing however to whom that day really belongs; and its fortunate owner is pleased and amused by their ignorance. A person cannot foreknow which day exactly will fall to his lot, what trifle he will remember forever: the ripple of reflected sunlight on a wall bordering water or the revolving fall of a maple leaf; and it often happens that he recognizes his day only in retrospection, long after he has plucked, and crumpled, and chucked under his desk the calendar leaf with the forgotten figure.""7 “Doorbell”I would be short about this one. It guarantees to subvert your expectations. 6 ‘Dashing Fellow” Very nasty unlikable protagonist. But it is a fantastic story - the way how Nabokov is creating this type. The story starts from the perspective of the main character presented in the plural first person “we”:‘Our suitcase is carefully embellished with bright-coloured stickers:”Nurberg, Stuttgart, Koln - and even Lido (but that one is fraudulent). We have a swarthy complexion, a network of purple-red veins, a black moustache, trimly clipped, and hairy nostrils. We breathe hard through our nose as we try to solve a crossword puzzle in an emigre paper. We are alone in a third-class compartment – alone and therefore bored’ But the author’s gaze is very present in this opening as well. “hairy nostrils and heavy breathing” doubtfully this chap is so self-critical.The story then moves into the third person narration, swiftly and gracefully toggles between that and the proper first single. Despicable things happen. And then this ending:“When we have fed and slept, life will regain its looks …And then, sometime later, we die’ What a brilliant framing of the story and that last line!Coincidently, I’ve come across a similar framing in the recently published novel Checkout 19 by C L Bennet5. MusicThis is probably the most lyrical story out of this selection of mine. It nods to both Chekhov and Tolstoy. It is beautiful and sad, the one of those stories when something does not happen. But I loved it. The most striking is how the development of the story within the story moves in unison with the music performed in it. Describing the music through the words is very rarely successful. But here, Nabokov achieved something even more special. 4 “An affair of honour” In this one Nabokov subverts well established genre of story about a duel. Almost all self-respected Russian writers would have written the one. I believe the French did the same. And here comes Nabokov. The story is very Gogolian. It is both comic and profound. In Nabokov’s own words (about Gogol’s tales):“..’mumble, mumble, lyrical wave, mumble, lyrical wave, mumble, lyrical wave, mumble, fantastic climax, mumble, mumble, and back into the Chaos from which they had all derived. At this superhigh level of art, literature…appeals to that secret depth of the human soul where the shadows of other worlds pass like the shadow of nameless and soundless ships.”This is perfectly applicable to this story and to many more pieces of Nabokov’s own writing. 3 The CircleThis was the first story by Nabokov I’ve read. And, it holds well in my ranking. Here I would just say - how about starting a story from “Secondly,..”. My wonderful GR friend, Ilse has written a great  of this one. 2 La VenezianaIt is the one of his early stories. It hasn’t been published until after his death. Maybe he did not like it. I do not know. But I enjoyed it enormously. At the centre of it is a painting (there is a “prototype” in real life). Through a bunch of the brilliantly crafted characters, he examines the sublime. This is combined with a satire on English affluent class and its way of life. Wonderfully composed story.1 The Vane SistersThis story is an object of art. Ricardo Piglia said in his brilliant essay Theses on a short story that the best of them contain two levels - the one on the surface and the one carefully hidden. And a story’s essence lies in how these two levels interact.This story is a superb example of this. But one needs to look hard to see it. I’ve spent a lot of time with this story. If you like looking for a clues, intertextuality and text puzzles, it is the one for you. But even if not, the imagery and the lyrics of a mundane hardly would make anyone unaffected. I would recommend to read Nabokov's stories if you want to find out what literature could do apart from straightforward storytelling. How it can ""appeal to that secret depth of the human soul where the shadows of other worlds pass like the shadow of nameless and soundless ships.""...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Sep 19, 2021","Oct 13, 2021","Oct 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/169076.Collected_Stories

I do not think I can do its justice. Firstly, to describe Grossman’s achievement one needs to write a thick volume - this This book is a masterpiece. I do not think I can do its justice. Firstly, to describe Grossman’s achievement one needs to write a thick volume - this novel encompasses a multitude. Secondly, I am so strongly moved by its subject matter that I find it really hard to have a dispassionate conversation about its literary value. I have not even been born when he wrote this book. But the history of my own family is very much in there. And that is probably true for a lot of people with the roots in Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, I cannot stop thinking about it. First of all, I am puzzled why any discussion of this novel is starting with the comparison to War and Peace. If anything, this novel is a total antithesis to Tolstoy. In his book, Tolstoy celebrates the collective - a certain Russian spirit of the ordinary “muzhiks”, the birth of the national power from below which is initially overlooked and then used and admired by the aristocracy. He does it with the help of elaborate carefully crafted prose and by contrasting a glamour of the high society, its affairs and the salons’s life and with the raw visceral pictures of the battlefield.Grossman is almost the opposite. He writes about desperate attempts to safeguard the individual under the violent pressure of the collective, national and extreme totalitarian. These forces orchestrate enormous effort to annihilate any differences and convert the individual human beings into a single obedient biomass.Gone through the whole calamity as a war correspondent, he has seen a lot. He evidenced the whole battle for Stalingrad; he was the one of the first people who were allowed into Treblinka, the concentration camp after its liberation. He has seen the victims of the collectivisation in the 30s, he has lost many close friends in the purges of 1937 and later. It is incomprehensible though how was he able to intellectually process all of this so deeply as shown in this novel.Also unlike Tolstoy’s ‘War and Piece”, “Life and Fate” is a fragmentary novel, the one of the rare successful ones on such a scale. It is striking how Grossman builds up the whole through numerous smaller stories. He does not try to forcibly create a coherent narrative. There are many lines of storytelling, digressions and enormous cast of characters. Some characters appear for only few pages to disappear forever. Even the main characters’ stories left unfinished. But exactly this mosaic structure is a powerful way to form an eagle view of that incomprehensible time. It also allows absorbing the magnanimity of it all without losing the focus on the individual lives. It is overwhelming, shocking but warm and never abstract.If one needs to pick up the big name from the Russian 19th century literature, I would compare it Chekhov. If Chekhov would ever write a big novel I could imagine it similar to this Grossman’s masterpiece. A lot of stories of the individuals taken together to produce a unique diverse and profound whole about human nature. It is unlikely coincidental that Chekhov has been mentioned quite a few times on the pages of “Life and Fate”.In spite of or indeed maybe because of the hell on the Earth context, Grossman manages to bring something very Chekhovian into the way how he tells his individual stories:A six year old boy letting out a beetle he kept in a match box before entering a gas chamber.During the hopeless defence of a stand-alone building, its captain orders a girl and a boy who found some solace in loving each other to leave it. That is just before the final destruction. And that is at the same time while, deprived of human warmth, this captain secretly hopes for the girl’s attention. He has got all the power to do whatever he wants with her but he manages not to.A woman drops her new love and returns to her ex-husband when he is arrested. She hardly even can hope to see him. But she goes to Lubyanka, writes the letters to help his fate. She gives up her personal happiness for this and she even cannot explain to herself why.A Ukrainian woman safes from starvation a Russian prisoner of war after her husband has died from Holodomor imposed by the Russian state and the Russian requisitioners.Or, a very different story - a man unburies himself after a failed execution by the Russian military tribunal, but he does not try to escape and, wounded, comes back to his executioners.That is the Chekhov’s way. But Chekhov did not explicitly pose the existential question in his writing. He focused on the idea that a human being is the highest possible value without any reference to her wealth, occupation, ethnicity or nationality. But Grossman, faced with the fight between the two thoroughly destructive evil forces goes farther. He has to. And his question is who would survive the totalitarian state or the individual. He is clear they cannot co-exist. And that is the main theme that unites the fragments of this wonderful novel. It has got a lot of “faces’ to it: Russian state or German state; Gulag or Holocaust, the front or the rear; science or a battle. But essentially they are all the part of this same question.And the big part of it is personal freedom.Many people in the Western democracies do not appreciate what freedom means, or more importantly - the lack of it. At least not I the same way as people who live under other regimes. In majority of cases, they take it for granted. But when I hear someone in the West says that different nations are more used to different systems and personal freedom might not be suitable or even desired by the Russians or Chinese or whoever else- I am simply appalled. What can I say? They simply never could imagine the experience of sticky fear when waiting in the queue for something as innocuous as a new passport. Yes, the feeling of fear mixed with guilt without any reason. That feeling which Grossman so well articulated when you get in trouble not because you’ve done something, but simply for the reason that you do not fit a certain profile and you might do something in the future. Another aspect of it when you do not know whom you can trust, even including your close friends. I think only people in the West who could understand this toxic mixture of feelings are refugees. And it is very sad.Grossman: “ Invisible force was pushing him down…. Only people who never experienced this force are able to be surprised by those who submit to it. Those who felt this force at least once would be amazed by the other thing - the ability by someone to become disobedient at least for an instant, to express a feeble, quick gesture of protest, to exclaim at least one angry word.”  Within such state systems, It is extremely difficult, almost impossible not become subdued, not to feel that everything around you is inevitable and totally give up on any personal responsibility. But in Grossman novel, many characters stand for his strong belief that “a human being cannot be destroyed inside the individual without him being complacent in this destruction”. In the one of the episodes, an ex-commissar and former communist true believer says to his friend: “We did not understand freedom. We destroyed it. And Marx underestimated its value: freedom is the foundation, the meaning, the basis under the basis. There is no revolution without it. … We are going through gulag, taiga believing that our faith (in our rightness) is the strongest. But it is not a strength, it is the weakness, the act of self-preservation.”However in another episode, a prisoner in Lubyanka, ex-chekist thinks very different. His ideal of the future society is when the gulag fence is not necessary anymore not because there is no need for gulag, but because the life on the both sides of the fence has become identical. Such was his vision. I hope collectively walk away from that. I really do.The one of the main characters is Strum, a nuclear physicist and a Jew. He refuses to denounce his scientific breakthrough and his Jewish colleagues. He does not feel very happy about it, but he feels that he has done something he ought to have done. However, later he did not quite manage to do the same in different circumstances. Grossman shows how difficult it is each time not to submit to this. Strum also receives a personal call from Stalin. Stalin used to do such things. It was always very short and might mean very good news for the recipient or otherwise. The one of the most famous instances was his call to Bulgakov. I cannot even imagine the mixture of emotions these people experienced. Grossman also asks the question which still haunts anyone thinking of Holocaust and Gulag. How is that there was such little protest from those people about to perish. Why they were so obedient in their majority. How to comprehend all of this? “What saves people when their bovine melancholy, their mute fatalism yields to a piercing sense of horror - what saves people then is the opium of optimism.” People did not lose hope to the end. And according to Arendt, “Hope in dark times is not substitute for actions.”. But I am not sure I can totally agree with both of them I cannot imagine people behaving differently in those circumstances, hope or not. One should remain rational to act, but the rational response is also fear. One needs to lose all the fear. But how? I know that there were moments in some events when this sense of fear or self-preservation disappear. The last time I’ve seen it during the Revolution of Dignity in the Ukraine 2014. But there in the camps? I am still thinking about it. There is another idea in the novel which is very different from Tolstoy. The one of the characters in the German concentration camp is thinking about the difference between the idea of the common good versus simple individual human kindness. Any idea of the common good pretends to be universal. But then there are quite a few different ideas what constitute this “common good”. So those ideas would necessary fight each other. And more often than not it would be people fighting under the slogan of those ideas. Even more often one idea would exclude some group of people. Be it the rich, the poor or the Jews, the Palestinians or immigrants, refugees, cosmopolitans - the list could go on and on. While a simple act kindness of the one human being towards another rarely leads to such things.There are so much more thoughts to discuss. But one needs to finish somewhere. And I cannot finish this long and messy piece of writing without mentioning the letter to Strum from his mother who would have perished in a ghetto by the time he got it. Grossman’s own mother has perished this way in Berdichev in the Ukraine. Though there was no letter, but Grossman was writing back to her until his own death. One does not need to read the whole novel. This letter could be read stand alone - it is the Ch 18 in the novel. It is so poignant it could not leave anyone unmoved. My family have lost my great-grandmother and her youngest 13 year old daughter in the similar circumstances not far from Berdichev. I’ve read this letter as if it was addressed to me. But I think it is addressed to all of us.

I've updated this  by adding a few things based upon the discussion and a few photos inspired by the text (though they were not taken on purpose:-). ReviewDo you know what is acrostic? I have to admit I did not know the term. And I have to check it as Nabokov's narrator refers to it in this story and it seems to be important. So I've learned that the word means compiling a text from the first letters of another text. And, it was first applied to the prophecies of the Erythraean Sibyl while the initial letter of each prophecy were combined into a word. There is a character in this story called Sybil.I think I've done enough revealing in order ""to get"" this story completely. It took me 3 readings after that first one to see it all. And this is only after I've read online that there is something hidden there. But when you look for the clues, and they suddenly stand out, and eventually it all comes together - what a moment!It is also brimming with intertextuality. It took me some pleasurable time to trace some of his references. I've picked up just two below to ""follow up"".Tolstoy's cameo appearance.(view spoiler)[ ""Leo Tolstoy visited our little group and, when asked to identify himself by specific traits of terrine habitation, launched upon a complex description of what seemed to be some Russian type of architectural woodwork (“figure on boards - man, horse, cock, man, horse, cock”), all of which was difficult to take down, hard to understand and impossible to verify"".It is appeared to be not that hard to verify nowadays with internet. Apparently some western critics thought it was a chess board. However it is a pattern of Tosltoy's veranda in the one of the buildings in ""Yasnaya Polyana"".https://ypmuseum.ru/tour/14There on the picture you can see ""man, horse, cock"" very clearly.  (hide spoiler)]Why ""Vane"" is the name?(view spoiler)[ Sybil Vane was a character in The Picture of Dorian Gray. The girl in that story also commits suicide. Nabokov has just borrowed it for his story. Angry Wilde in this story has come to complain during a spiritualist seance about ""plagiatism"" accusing ""obscurely"", but obviously Nabokov himself - Sybil's parents!. But a vane characteristically shows the direction of the wind. It might have been Sybil and Cintia respectively are doing the similar trick showing to the hopeless narrator and even the reader where to look.  (hide spoiler)]Apparently, the story was rejected by the ""New Yorker"" as the editor has not seen the trick. I am not blaming her. So Nabokov has written the letter explaining it. But it is more than a single trick. It is a wonderful use of a narrator who does not see what both the author and the reader know through his speech. It raises this eternal question how much do we know about the real meaning of our actions. And I am only partly ironic here. It is also sharp social observations and references to other works to search for. And the language.Pure aesthetic delight!PSMy wonderful GR friend Fionnuala said that the story has reminded her some of my photos. I've shared some initially.

The story full of lounging, triumph and tragedy ... maybe a farce? Nabokov does not help with the answer on this question. Typically he leaves some ambiguous clues and let you decide for yourself. It is a very cinematic story, full of dramatic effects and imagery. I understood it was supposed to be a script. It also reminded me Thomas Mann's Little Herr Friedemann. It would be interesting to read these two stories alongside each other. I suspect when Nabokov is ironic, Mann is tragic.  And this passage.

Inevitably there is a bit on hyperinflation and the politics. However, I felt slightly underwhelmed. I wanted to know more about the visual art. It was not much there apart from the work of Hannah Hoch. There was also an array into photography which faired much better. He discusses Lazlo Moholy-Nagy and August Sander. The survey of architecture was probably the best out of the three. However, for the cinema he talked more about Chaplin and Eisenstein than the Germans. The expressionists and new objectivism is mentioned in passing only.There is a chapter on ""Body and Sex"". However, it is focused predominately on women and often through the men eyes. There gay culture is barely mentioned and not discussed which defeats the purpose of having a separate chapter, imho.The author also pays a lot of attention describing how ordinary Germans lived. There are a lot of interesting facts, especially about Berlin. However, maybe unsurprisingly I've learned more from reading the literature of the period. For example recently, I've read The Artificial Silk Girl by Irmgard Keun and The Aurelian by Nabokov. They gave much better insight into the feelings and circumstances of the individuals. Intellectual history is represented through Mann, Brecht and Heidegger. And while the discussion of ""Magic Mountain"" and ""Threepenny opera"" was interesting if not too enlightening, he certainly did not impress me with his discussion on Heidegger. The latter philosophy is very complex and the author attempt to describe it in simple terms did not work for me.The main discovery was awaiting me in the epilogue when he discusses the German emigres and their influence on the post-war intellectual thought. For example, Morgenthau's name I've never even heard before. He is appeared to be the founder of the realist school in the international relations. The new reincarnation of this is gaining the ground in the US and elsewhere. And I've heard of Marcuse but I never appreciated the impact he has had on the 60s Left movements. So this book has definitely opened the new roads for my education.For hyperinflation I would look elsewhere.Overall, this book might serve well for someone who wants a starting point in understanding Weimar world.

I finished reading this book and was thinking how to approach the . I was helped by a coincidence. In an old bookshop, I came across Lions and Shadows: An Education in the Twenties by Christopher Isherwood. I opened the first page and read:“I had better start by saying what this book is not: it is not, in ordinary journalistic sense of the word, an autobiography; it contains no “revelations”; it is never “indiscreet”; it is not even entirely “true”. Its subtitle explains its purposes: to describe the first stages a lifelong education - the education of a novelist.”And it occurred to me that it could be easily said about “Checkout 19”. In spite of intricacies in style, Claire-Louise Bennett has written a Künstlerroman, the novel of the formation of a new artist. It has been done before by many famous men from Goethe to Joyce, and, evidently, Isherwood. But I have not seen many women trying to use this form and doing it so successfully. It is a risky business as well: many people do not like to read about writers writing and writers reading other writers. But I am glad she took the risk and did it with style.The book is an intricate structure itself - a Russian doll comprised of the nested texts: ( ( * ) ) * ). (view spoiler)[ There are seven of them in total. The doll is slightly lopsided as the longest text and the most sophisticated one, the chapter called “Won't You Bring in the Birds” comes the 3rd and then - there is the chapter 6 ""When we were the drama” that calling back to the 3rd one - they contrast and complete each other at the same time. The opening and the closing chapters frame the whole structure. They are written from the perspective of the first person's plural - “We”. The edifice looks delicate and fragile. In less able hands, it would collapse into the pieces. But Bennet manages to hold it together successfully through language, themes and juxtapositions running throughout like a magic thread. It is probably not a coincidence that the one of her creation is a girl repairing her sisters’ “frothy gowns”.  (hide spoiler)]And there are stories within the stories of course. The stories of her actual life are intermingled with the stories the protagonist creates there and then. And the books… She is the one who defines certain key events of her life through the books she reads. Or rather, the book by itself often would be that key event. There are many names. I counted 18 females writers mentioned as a list. But that is how she lives; that is what is important to her:“Certain written words are alive, active, living- they are entirely in the present, the same as you. In fact it feels as if they are being written as you read them, that your eyes upon the page are perhaps even making them appear, in any case, certain sentences do not feel in the least bit separate from you or from the moment in time when you are reading them. You feel they would not exist without your seeing them. Like they would not exist without you. And isn’t the opposite true too - that the pages you read bring you to life?”This idea “what brings you to life” is also conveyed in the other way. The one of the striking juxtapositions at the core of the book is the act of physical violation versus the destruction of a manuscript. Both acts happened to the protagonist. And she seems to be less perturbed by the former than the latter. She conveys this feeling so well that I felt the same. Only later I’ve started thinking why the shredding of a story written by someone affected me more that something pretty brutal done to that same person. The destruction of the written word echoes through the whole story, bounces against its walls, jumps from the real to the imagined and back.And the language. Sometimes, it is boiling on the page: excessive, baroque; numerous words, repetitions, lists, exclamation marks. Something like this:“Yes. The whole thing goes up in flames. Flames. Roaring. Yes. It all burns up quickly. Every inch of her included. Yes. Leaving behind an iridescent pile of the softest ash. The sort of ash you want stir. Softer than feathers. Run your fingers through. It tingles doesn’t it. Yes. Yes. Yes it does. We can feel it. Our fingers. Our fingers are tingling like mad aren’t they. Yes, they are. Tingling. We can feel it. Tingling like mad. Our fingers tingle, madly, madly, yes, just as if they are coming to life.”It reminded me the last chapter of Ulysses told by Molly Bloom. Then the language would settle down to almost detached observational prose. But this never last long. It is like a piece of music with constant and irregular change in tempo.It might sound familiar to people who've read her previous novel Pond. And it is. The comparison is probably inevitable. But the books are quite different in spite of the similarities of language. ""Pond"" is much tighter, but structurally less challenging book. Also the subject matter is quite different. ""Pond"" was all about things, the idea that the things are alive in essence. This idea is still present in this novel. But the main stage here is given to a human being, the one who needs to be surrounded by words, sentences and imagined human beings to feel alive:“Sometimes all it takes is just one sentence. Just one sentence, there you are, part of something that has been part of you since the beginning, whenever that might rightly be. The source, yes, you can feel in thrumming and surging, and it’s such a relief, to feel you are made of much more that just yourself, that you are only a rind really, a rind you should take care of yet mustn’t get too attached to, that you mustn’t be afraid to let melt away now and then.”...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Sep 18, 2021","Sep 23, 2021","Sep 18, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56155207-checkout-19

It is somewhat incoherent work in a good sense of the word. One cannot tightly connect the dots. And it opens itself to a wide range of interpretations. And that is a good thing - anyone can take away something tailored to the individual aspirations.However a few aspects are more certain. She took someone’s else work. She used it as a vessel. By that, she freed herself from worrying about the usual suspects such as the plot or characters. Moreover, she freed herself even from choosing a particular style. The novel is written in the form of a long letter. I have not checked the source of her inspiration, but the way how tightly she controls the style tells me it was borrowed as well from there. I am surprised I have not seen a  yet written as the pastiche and starting: “The thing is, Jeffers, I have not been interested in the plot and other attributes of a classical novel for a while. I’ve explained all of this when I was writing my previous book (the Trilogy). There, Jeffers, I tried to annihilate such things like the plot, narrator’s voice and a setting. And now, Jeffers, maybe for the first time, I try not to spend time thinking of a style; that is, Jeffers, if it is out there already, created by someone else and ready to be used.”I promise not to continue all my  in that manner… So, she took all of this “oven ready”. And on these basis, she has created a profound metaphysical inquiry. She populated this old story with a new meaning making her heroine question “what is real?”. Is there something sublime we do not usually have an access to? This inquiry has become the main purpose of her work. This question is a very old one. But it is often the torturing one, especially for those with an artistic gift. Because no artistic vision comes without cost. And it is even more true if you are a woman.When I was reading this story it was pretty clear to me that it is a Faustian tale with some feminist connotations. “The Devil” has appeared to M (the main character’s name) at least three times in different disguises. First, she discovers for herself the works of L, an artist in the pinnacle of his fame. Something in those works inspires her to change her life radically by leaving her family and starting a new search.She reflects later on that period:“I viewed myself in the cruellest light. Never have I yearned more to be capable of creating something than at that time. It felt as though only that – to express or reflect some aspect of existence – would atone for the awful knowledge I seemed to have acquired. I had lost the blind belief in events and the immersion in my own being that I realised had made existence bearable up to that point. This loss seemed to me to constitute nothing less than the gain of perceptual authority”This loss of belief in exchange for the knowledge is very close to the pact which artists make with the Devil in the tales about Faust. The loss is exchanged for that thing she called here “perceptual authority”, on in other words, the gift to see something the others cannot and to be able to reveal it.It reminded me of the phrase from Goethe which I found puzzling initially, but which might be understood nevertheless in its powerful contradiction. On the question who he was Mephistopheles answered: ""I am part of that force which eternally wills evil and eternally creates good.”Many acts of pure creation often are based on the destruction of something important and previously existing . (view spoiler)[ After the first encounter with L’s art, she sees the man on the train that challenges her with his base behaviour. But she did not stood up to him. That was the second encounter. And the third - after many years, she “summons” L to take the residence in her place. And he behaves quite diabolically towards her there.However, this my first interpretation did not quite stuck up. How L could be such a powerful force if he tries to avoid her. All his insults are quite pathetic. And his strength is fundamentally only in his canvas. How she could be his victim if she wants him effectively to fulfil her vision. The vision she feels incapable to entail herself. She feels the limits of her own gift and she wants to use him as an instrument to bridge that gap. “One can feel, in other words, a strange proximity to the process of creation when one sees the principles of art – or of a particular artist – mirrored in the texture of living. This might go to explain some of the compulsion I felt toward L: when I looked at the marsh, for instance, which seemed to obey so many of his rules of light and perception that it often resembled a painted work by him, I was in a sense looking at works by L that he had not created, and was therefore – I suppose – creating them myself.”In other words, he or a certain force through him has opened to her a new way of seeing. But now she wants him to comply with this way so she is the creator as well. But he is afraid and disgusted by her. He does not want her playing that role. In essence he completed his pact with the Devil long time ago and he does not want the competition from her. M’s problem is a problem of many artists. Fernando Pessoa expressed it very well:“tragedy - what cannot be borne is to dream a thing of beauty , but lack the skill to endow it with actions or words”.But she feels that call to create and somehow L has become the symbol and the conduit of that call for her. ""I wanted him to be more than he was, or to be myself somehow less than I was, and because I wanted those things my will was aroused – in any case, there was the feeling of some unknown lying between us that awoke a dangerous part of me, the part that felt that I hadn’t truly lived. “She also came to believe that it is possible to break through to “a greater reality” only with the help of violence or “actual destruction”.“I didn’t know what this violence was or how it could be inflicted, only that something in L’s threat seemed to promise it.”And this “greater reality” would finally deliver her freedom. Again, this is almost classic Faustian tale of achieving greater freedom through the acts of certain liberating violence. But she balances on the edge. The edge, which is being trespassed by L long time ago. “He filled one with the dreadful suspicion that there is no story to life, no personal meaning beyond the meaning of any given moment. Something in me loved this feeling, or at the very least knew it and recognised it to be true, as one must recognise darkness and acknowledge its truth alongside that of light; and at the same sense I knew and recognised L. “There is this constant presence of overpowering creative but destructive force which is often attributed to the force of the darkness in literature. But nevertheless I was at loss with my initial instincts. I realised that L hardly could stand for Mephisto. In the best case, he is Faust. M, in spite of her subconscious claim on L’a creativity could only be the one searching for a revelation or freedom at least. Not the Devil. So I was missing the Devil. That is until I thought that the Devil does not need to be personified. He might be just that - the force. The force of art! And Cusk has helped me:“For the first time, Jeffers, I considered the possibility that art – not just L’s art but the whole notion of art – might itself be a serpent, whispering in our ears, sapping away all our satisfaction and our belief in the things of this world with the idea that there was something higher and better within us which could never be equalled by what was right in front of us. The distance of art suddenly felt like nothing but the distance in myself, the coldest, loneliest distance in the world from true love and belonging.”Art as a “serpent”, art as a revealer of the hidden, the better, the unreal reality. The cold place. The “serpent” to which some gifted people make the choice to serve even if it would destroy them in the process.. (hide spoiler)]I am not sure Cusk was thinking any of this while writing this book. I do not know whether she wanted to deliver a predetermined message or simply used the book as vehicle to talk about art, the limitations of its creators as well as her usual themes of difficult relationships, divorce and motherhood. All the above is just my interpretation of this work. But:The truth lies not in any claim to reality, but in the place where what is real moves beyond our interpretation of it. True art means seeking to capture the unreal.

In this world, we travellers, whether voluntary or involuntary, between nothing and nothing, or between everything and everything, are mere passengers and should not give too much importance to any setbacks experienced en route, to any bumps and bruises suffered along the way. I console myself with that, whether because it does console me or because there is something genuinely consoling about it, I don't know. But that fictions consolation does become real if I don't think about it.And there are so many consolations! There's clear, high, calm sky, across which the occasional imperfect cloud floats by. There's the light breeze that shakes the thickly leaved branches of the trees if you're in the country, and that sets the clothes flapping when they are hung out to dry at fourth or fifth floor windows if you're in the city. There's the heat of hot days and the cool of cool days, and always, in the background, a memory or a nostalgia, or a hope, and someone smiling at the window opening onto the void, and out desires knocking at the door of who we are, like the beggars who are the Christ.""...more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Aug 24, 2021","Sep 09, 2021","Aug 24, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36012898-the-book-of-disquiet

I hope more people would discover him after that. I think I’ve finally found my favourite young writer working in English today. Four years ago, I’ve read his debut novel The Story of a Brief Marriage and was smitten by it. That novel has shown the possibility of depicting beauty and terror at the same time. It was a fair share of violence there, but at the same time the novel possessed a mediative quality humanising those people who hardly felt human themselves anymore.No direct violence in this one. It is about the art of letting go. Letting go one’s love, past, even one’s life if it is meant to be. Also it is about being in the present; how different this is from seeing the minutes, days and events slipping by in a rapid succession.I adore a slow-burning, introspective style of his writing. He manages to focus one’s attention in a moment and keep it there while the moment reveals itself like a bud of a flower. “What for lack of a better word was sometimes called love, he had realized that night, was not so much a relation between two people in and of themselves as a relation between two people and the world they were witness to, a world whose surfaces and exteriors gradually began to dissipate as the two individuals sank deeper and deeper into what was called their love. Falling in love, or what deserved to be called falling love, he had realized that night, was not so much an emotional or psychological condition as an epistemological condition, a condition in which two people held hands and watched in silent amazement as the world around them was slowly unveiled, as the falsities of ordinary life began to thin and dissolve before their eyes, the furrowed eyebrows and clenched jaws, the bright colors and loud noises, the surface excitements and disturbances all dropping away so that what remained—time stripped bare—was the only way the world could truly be apprehended, so that even if this condition did not last, even if it was lost, as eventually it is always lost, to habit or circumstance or simply the slow, sad passage of the years, the knowledge that it has imparted remains, the knowledge that the world we ordinarily partake in is somehow not quite real, that time does not need to pass the way we usually experience it passing, that somehow it is possible to live and breathe and move in a single moment, that a single moment could be not a bead on an abacus of finite length but an ocean that can be entered into, whose distant shores can never be reached.”Another thing I liked that in this novel, he does not use a dialogue at all. And without it, he still manages to create very vivid sense of interactions between his characters. The one of the themes and the one I always find fascinating is the nature of memory and forgetting. At the end, we are hardly in power to chose what we remember and what we forget both personally and historically:""Deliberately or not the past was always being forgotten, in all places and among all peoples, a phenomenon that had less to do with the forces that seek to erase or rewrite history than simply the nature of time, with the precedence the present always seems to have over what has come before, the precedence not of the present moment, which we never seem to have access to, but of the present situation, which is always demanding our attention, always so forceful and vivid and overwhelming that as soon as one of its elements disappears we forget it ever existed.""However, there are moments from our life that will always stay with us and suddenly would resurface whether we want it or not. He has found a beautiful metaphor:perhaps it was not just images of beauty that clouded one’s vision over time but images of violence too, those moments of violence that for some people were just as much a part of life as the moments of beauty, both kinds of image appearing when we least expected it and both continuing to haunt us thereafter, both of which marked and branded us, limiting how far we were subsequently able to see.This has reminded me of an interview I’ve read with a scientist studying memory. She was explaining that people who went through a traumatic experience or more rarely some striking positive event do not remember it. They practically re-live it for all intents and purposes everytime time their brain brings it over. Not surprising it limits their ability to “see” anything else in a broad sense of the word.I can keep talking about this author and his two novels for a very long time, so much he impressed me. I can mention for example the way he composes his novels which is somewhat different from the recommendations I’ve read about in this book A Swim in a Pond in the Rain: In Which Four Russians Give a Master Class on Writing, Reading, and Life for example. And I am so glad that it is! ""Story. Creating a well-rounded character. Setting. Dialogue. Historical context. I try to pay attention to these things—I do try—but they’re always afterthoughts. A lot of these other things accumulate, they find their place through a process of accretion, and they’re deposited in different waves each time I go through the text. Sometimes things occur to me, and I’m like, Oh, I can just add this. I write over drafts. There’s no first draft—I have a little center here or a little center there, and then I just go over it, and each time I do, more material accumulates until I find a way to connect those islands into something. I have in my mind that the reader expects the character to be believable or the story to be interesting. I have this little voice in my head that says I need to try—but those elements of novel writing are not what I am interested in.""(this is an excerpt from his interview you can find here. )However, I would stop for now. I just share one more observation. I find quite difficult to formulate this one, but I try as it is worth it. I found both of his novel very relatable. And, it might sound strange. His character here is a young Tamil man. The novel unfolds in Deli and Shri-Lanka. There is nothing superficially in common between us. But his yearning filled me with yearning. His memories have sent me very far down my very personal memory lane that again has nothing in common with his on a superficial level. I guess I am trying to say that it is relatively easy to write about a struggling mother of two in a such a way that a struggling mother of two reading it would see herself on the page. But it is much trickier and much more valuable to write something so universal that people could relate to without sharing any background, race, identity or suchlike....more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,"Jul 21, 2021","Jul 22, 2021","Jul 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55873262-a-passage-north

It is similar in quite a few ways - wide cast of characters on the canvas of a broader historical, social and geographical background. It has also been initially published by instalments in a newspaper. However, when Dickens is sentimental Prus is satirical or at least humorous. It was interesting and entertaining read. But for me it lacked psychological depth I expected.The main conflict is the unrequited love of a merchant, Wokulski, who becomes rich through successful deals and the ownership of a haberdashery shop in Warsaw. He is absolutely smitten by an aristocratic maiden who does not treat him as an equal. I found very hard to believe in all this passion and his blindness in the matters of love while he is very shroud and successful in other ways. The book occasionally reminded chivalry novels from the 17th century placed into the context of the 19th. Also for me it was evident that Prus was not sure how all of this would end when he has started to publish it. Inevitably, I think the comparison with the The Cherry Orchard comes to mind, the play, where a successful representative of a new capitalism, Lopakhin is buying an estate from the aristocracy whose time is over. It is a similar conflict here as well. Even plot wise, Wokulski is overpaying for the house when buying it from the father of his Dame. But Chekhov manages to create an atmosphere of transience around it, melancholic and sometimes tragic. While Lopakhin seems to be a real person bringing new energy, it is difficult to ascertain any power or even meaning in Wokuski’s character apart from the overwhelming servitude to his Dame and the passion that is hard to believe. The aristocracy here is greedy, useless and pathetic in a sort of one-dimensional way. It might have been the case of course or maybe Prus is satirising. But it lacked the depth of a more successful realistic piece of the period.However, the novel might have been considered innovative even now. Prus experiments with the narrative style. The chapters traditionally told are intervened with the diary of Zetsky, the old and very loyal Wokulski’s shop manager. Those sections told from the perspective of a pleasantly unreliable narrator is sheer delight to read. The novel still holds a lot of entertainment value. There were the moments when I was properly laughing. It is also a very valuable historical document of that period; how the matters stood in Eastern Europe, in particular in Poland that was divided into tree areas of influence by other powers at that time. This feeling of despair and sometimes misplaced patriotism that cannot find the proper way out penetrates the novel.Another thing one cannot help but notice is how casual antisemitism was in those places and times. It is shocking by out standards. And I felt in the tone of the story that the author is not sure himself where he stood. The most “enlightened” view presented by Wokulski is that Polish society made the Jews who they were - greedy and predatory by systematically killing the best of them through the century, so only the worst adopted.And women… I would be surprised if this period piece would represent the sensitivities of our times. But it is not misogyny of “Anna Karenina”, it is more of a The Kreutzer Sonata’s kind and better. This is a monologue by the character of a “strong” woman:‘You are all wretches. When a woman, at a certain stage in her life, dreams of an ideal love, you mock her illusions and demand a flirtation, without which a girl is boring, and a married woman stupid. Not until she — thanks to your collective efforts — allows banal proposals to be made, glances at you fondly, presses your hand — only then does some medieval moralist in a cowl emerge from a dark corner and solemnly curse her, created though she is in the form and likeness of a daughter of Eve: “You are not allowed to love, you will never be truly loved, because you had the misfortune to be put up for market, and because you have no illusions left!” Yet who stole her illusions, if not you and your brothers? What sort of world is this, in which illusions are first stripped off and the naked body then sentenced to death?’This view that the society of men converts the innocent girls into “whores” who after that are blamed for everything is very close to the view by the main character of "" The Kreutzer sonata"" who murdered his wife for suspected infidelity. On the one hand, it seems to be progressive, to some extent. But it totally deprives a woman fo any agency or responsibility for that matter. I was surprised to meet this attitude here. I thought it was more related to Tostoy’s later philosophy, but apparently it was zeitgeist.And this is more of the usual one coming from the mouth of our wounded romantic hero: “Wokulski laughed aloud: ‘It’s possible to free a woman from intriguers, but is it possible to free her from her own instincts? What would you advise if the man whom you consider a trifler or intriguer is to her a male of the same species as herself?’ Gradually a feeling of rage began dominating him. He walked about the room, and said: ‘How can one struggle against a law of nature by which a bitch, even of the best breed, will couple — not with a lion — but with a dog? Show her a whole menagerie of the noblest animals, but she’ll renounce them all for a few dogs. Yet it is hardly surprising, for they are her species.’”Nevertheless, it is a very well written and translated novel, and sometimes I’ve met with the proper jewels in the text:“The world is like an amateur theatre, where it is not done to insist on leading parts but reject minor roles. In any case, all roles are good, providing they are well played and not taken too seriously.’...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Jul 15, 2021","Jul 23, 2021","Jul 15, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8445416-the-doll

The story was brilliant and I wanted to read more by the author. I was pleasantly suprised that he, being so young and from Cuba, has been translated into English. Moreover, he is published in the UK by Fitzcarraldo Editions, the wonderful press. This novel is a polyphonic tale told by four family members. It is opening a rare window into the lives and thoughts of the ordinary Cubans. And it is a bleak picture showing the combination of the lack of hope and cynicism form the. young members of the family combined with the state of denial from the older ones. For the outsiders it might be a cautionary tale where the good socialists intentions might lead to in a few decades. For the insiders is an attempt by the young guy to internalise the experience of his country. It is a good novel, but i came into it with quite high expectations after the excellent short story. And it did not quite match that for me. I thought he tried to add an artificial dramatic tension into already tense situation. And the resolution was not totally satisfactory. But I am very much looking forward to his other work.The novel refers to so-called ""difficult years"" of the 90s and early 00s when the people were practically starving. I was on Cuba in 2003 and my overwhelming impression was of decaying beauty and decadence. The corruption was thriving then. The were no official restaurants, but there were plenty unofficial ones. We were invited by a young man to his house where his mum has cooked us a lobster. Lobsters and patrol were the unofficial currency. But the people tried as hard as they could to maintain their decency as well. We were guided around by a medical student. She tried to show that in spite of everything she is proud of her country. Or maybe she was not allowed to show anything else. It is very sad that now they are going through near starvation again: https://www.economist.com/the-america......more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jul 06, 2021","Jul 06, 2021","Jul 07, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46023916-the-fallen

It has only partly convinced me, but it was interesting to read. The results of a few experiments they described I found puzzling as my own ""result"" was different from the ""majority"" almost always. In general, I think I am taking a break from evolutionary psychology until it develops little further. Below are the excerpts and quotes I found insightful:""What functions does the reason module fulfill? We have rejected the intellectualist view that reason evolved to help individuals draw better inferences, acquire greater knowledge, and make better decisions. We favor an interactionist approach to reason. Reason, we will argue, evolved as a response to problems encountered in social interaction rather than in solitary thinking. Reason fulfills two main functions. One function helps solve a major problem of coordination by producing justifications. The other function helps solve a major problem of communication by producing arguments. (Our earlier work has been focused on reasoning and on developing, within the interactionist approach, an “argumentative theory of reasoning.”)"""" When beliefs are not readily testable, it is quite rational to accept them on the basis of trust, and it is quite rational for people who trust different authorities to stubbornly disagree. We don’t mean that these are the most rational attitudes possible. An intellectually more demanding approach asks for clarity and for a willingness to revise one’s idea in the light of evidence and dissenting arguments. This approach, which has become more common with the development of the sciences, is epistemically preferable—but no one has the time and resources to apply it to every topic.""""Reasons are social constructs. They are constructed by distorting and simplifying our understanding of mental states and of their causal role and by injecting into it a strong dose of normativity. Invocations and evaluations of reasons are contributions to a negotiated record of individuals’ ideas, actions, responsibilities, and commitments. This partly consensual, partly contested social record of who thinks what and who did what for which reasons plays a central role in guiding cooperative or antagonistic interactions, in influencing reputations, and in stabilizing social norms. Reasons are primarily for social consumption.""""Rules of arithmetic are taught and are not contested. There is no agreement, on the other hand, on the content and very existence of rules of reasoning. What is sometimes taught as rules of reasoning is either elementary logic or questionable advice for would-be good thinking or good argumentation (such as lists of fallacies to avoid, which are themselves fallacious).""""When people reason on moral, social, political, or philosophical questions, they rarely if ever come to universal agreement. They may each think that there is a true answer to these general questions, an answer that every competent reasoner should recognize. They may think that people who disagree with them are, if not in bad faith, then irrational. But how rational is it to think that only you and the people who agree with you are rational? Much more plausible is the conclusion that reasoning, however good, however rational, does not reliably secure convergence of ideas. Scientists, it is true, do achieve some serious and, over time, increasing degree of convergence. This may be due in part to the many carefully developed methods that play a major role in conducting and evaluating scientific research. There are no instructions, however, for making discoveries or for achieving breakthroughs. Judging from scientists’ own accounts, major advances result from hunches that are then developed and fine-tuned in the process of searching, through backward inference, for confirming arguments and evidence while fending off and undermining counterarguments from competitors.""""Communication is a special form of cooperation. The evolution of cooperation in general poses, as we saw in Chapter 9, well-known problems. It might seem reasonable to expect that theories that explain the evolution of human cooperation might also explain the evolution of communication.14 Do they really? Actually, communication is a very special case. In most standard forms of cooperation, cheating may be advantageous provided one can get away with it. For any given individual, doing fewer house chores, loafing at work, or cheating on taxes, for example, may, if undetected, lower the costs of cooperation without compromising its benefits. This being so, cooperation can evolve and endure only in certain conditions—in particular, when organized surveillance and sanctions make cheating, on average, costly rather than profitable, or when the flow of information in society is such that cheaters put at risk their reputation and future opportunities of cooperation. For communication to evolve, however, the conditions that must be fulfilled differ considerably from this. Although this is hard to measure and to test, there are reasons to think that communicators are spontaneously honest much of the time, even when they could easily get away with some degree of dishonesty. Why? Because when humans communicate, doing so honestly is, quite commonly, useful or even necessary to achieve their goal. People communicate to coordinate with others, to organize joint action, to ask help from friends who are happy to give it. In such situations, deceiving one’s interlocutors, even if undetected, wouldn’t be beneficial; it would just be dumb. Still, in other situations that are also rather common, a degree of deception may be advantageous. People generally try to give a good image of themselves. For this, even people who consider themselves quite honest routinely exaggerate their virtues and achievements, use disingenuous excuses for their failings, make promises they are not sure to keep, and so on.""""The message of this chapter might seem bleak. Reason improves our social standing rather than leading us to intrinsically better decisions. And even when it leads us to better decisions, it’s mostly because we happen to be in a community that favors the right type of decisions on the issue. This, however, cannot be the whole picture. Justifications in terms of reasons do indeed involve deference to common wisdom or to experts. What implicitly justifies this deference, however, is the presumption that the community or the experts are better at producing good reasons. But there is a potential for tension between the lazy justification provided by socially recognized “good reasons” and an individual effort to better understand and evaluate these reasons, to acquire some expertise oneself.""...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jun 24, 2021","Jul 23, 2021","Jun 24, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32336635-the-enigma-of-reason

Juancho Baile by Jose Ardila.As with any perfect story, it is impossible to describe how it works. But it does. It transports you there and acts on you. The story is full of tension, atmosphere and almost physical heat. It is filled with those raw, basic, even base, but very relatable emotions that define humans acting together. Granta provides some teasers. Here is the related one:https://granta.com/juancho-baile/2. Travellers inside the Marquee by Eudris Savon.Extremely elegant, playful text written in a dialogue with ""Garden party"" by Katherine Mainsfield. I would have to use this word again because the dialogue between the characters really drives the story even if it seemingly happens in the head of the narrator. The style is so well crafted - perfect! Additional bonus that the story is translated by Margaret Jull Costa. This boy from Cuba has already written a novel and the collection of short stories. I hope someone would bring him over to English speakers.https://granta.com/travellers-inside-...3. Sea of Stone by Aura Giarcia-JuncoIt is a wonderful postmodern tale full of longing, loneliness and search for someone and something lost. Add to that a bit of a context of modern day Mexico. https://granta.com/sea-of-stone/4. Bitter Cherries by Carlos Manuel Alvarez.After reading this story I immediately googled him. I've read some interview where he talked about the difference between a good journalist and a good writer. I am not sure my Spanish worked, but I understood he said: ""A journalist looks outside and collects the story; a writer searches inside him/herself"" And yes - that what it is! In this story, he does it so well. It is amazing one could be so quietly but rebelliously retrospective in his late 20s- early 30s. And he is a proper writer. The story is especially recommended to those who still misses her grandmother gone for many years Straightaway, on a whim, I've bought his debut novel which is appeared to be translated in English The Fallen. https://granta.com/bitter-cherries/5. Kingdoms by Miluska BenavidesIt is an excerpt from the novel she is writing. But even in those ten pages, the characters are alive and the writing is so fluent that it got me hooked. It is about the life of ordinary people in Peru. I am not sure what would be the scope of the final book. But it intrigued me and made me care for those fictional people.https://granta.com/kingdoms/The biggest discovery for me overall are the Cubans. I have not read anything by the Cuban writers before. And those two young boys are extremely impressive. I would have to go to my shelves and finally pick up their older compatriot CABRERA INFANTE GUILLERMOAlso there are two stories from this collection that are available fully on the website. They are both very good as well. They have not made it my ""top 5"", but I liked them a lot, especially this one:https://granta.com/uninhabitants/It is sort of a quite tragedy. And another freely available one, ""Borromean rings"" has reminded me how to be young, confused and a bit reckless. Now you can see my enthusiasm for these young writers.

But it definitely could and should be read independently as the modern, intelligent and schollary view on the world of Empires in the second half of the 19th century. This survey takes Goncharov's voyage as a starting point, but goes much deeper into the mechanism of functioning and the related ideology. This is a lengthy quote that summarises this mechanism strikingly well:In a passage made famous by critics in the Soviet era, Goncharov lambasts the English: "" I don't know who should civilise whom: couldn't the Chinese, with their politeness, meekness, and, yes, their knowledge of trade, civilise the English?""This is a very pointed question. Yet though it threatens to invert the hierarchy on which Europe's imperial ideology stands, it does so for a polemical effect that falls short fo the anti-colonial critique that Soviet scholars naively (I doubt it was naivety - more more political narrative and propaganda) saw in it. On. the contrary, such criticisms were part and parcel of imperial rivalries. Empires routinely found fault with the other empires so as to cast in flattering relief one's ow virtues. Indeed, Briatin's barbarous opium trade frames Goncharov's argument in the upcoming Siberian chapters, about Russia's own superior civilising credentials. (This despite the widely known fact that Russian alcohol devastated Siberia's indigenous communities). An international outcry accompanied the treatment of Native Americans by the British and later the Americans. (As the French ranted against it, they themselves were butchering Arabs and Berbers in North Africa). The British harangued. the Spanish for the excesses of Catholic missionary zeal. The expansion of the tsar's rule was widely deplored for spreading despotism across huge swaths of the globe. And jus about everyone accuses everyone else of hypocrisy. More often than not such tit-for-tat recriminations served to accentuate the prerogatives of one's own imperial model over a rival's not to renounce imperialism as such. The point was not that running an empire was an immoral business, but that empires could be better run.""A lot of things changed since those days. The Globe went through the period of decolonialisation and post-colonialism. But sadly, how much of this hypocrisy and the modus operandi still endures until our days....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"May 26, 2021","Jul 20, 2021","May 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36277754-a-world-of-empires

This is different and I have not even finished the 3rd book. The language is really good. I do not have doubts Sorokin could write. But the plot and the pathos troubled me. The trope of the chosen race consisting from 23 thousand blond blue eyes demiurges in human form is quite frankly slightly distasteful. Those creatures are coming from the Sun. They are really the rays of light. And they need to destroy the Earth and all not-bemiurges to come back to their form. The rest of the people are called “meat machines” and deserve to die as they are not chosen. I hope it was some kind of satire, but I could not find where it was supposed to be funny. And even if not to take all of this too seriously, it is becoming quite repetitive with the ritual of checking involving hitting a candidate with the ice hammer and see what happens.

The hybrid result is as follows (warning - becomes progressively more comic to the end).This book was written by the famous Russian writer about his voyage on the aforementioned Russia military frigate. ""In the autumn of 1852 Goncharov received an invitation to take part in the Admiral Putyatin-led around the world expedition through England, Africa, Japan, and back to Russia.""(Wiki). The main mission was ‘to open” Japan. The Russians were there approximately at the same time as the Americans lead by captain Perry. But they stayed near Nagasaki while Perry’s mission was focused on Tokyo. The book has become a bestseller in Russian in the 19th century and allegedly it was quite popular recently as well. Though written by Goncharov, the author of Oblomov, I do not think it is a wonderful piece of literature. However, it gives a very interesting point of view on the world of empires in the middle of the 19th century. It shows the forming prejudices and ideologies of the colonising nations. Goncharov interchangeably admires and reviles Britain. But it is evident that Russia aspires to the same mixture of “civilising the savages” and using their resources in the “best way” known only “to the advanced” European nations. Goncharov of course includes the Russians into this lot. He is vexing lyrical how brilliantly the English organised South African colony as opposed to the Dutch. And how clever they were in pacifying the local tribes. He is much less happy about how the English are treating the Chinese in the Opium Wars. But Russia is of course better. And he underlines it when he describes his comeback through Siberia. He admires the acumen of the Russian peasants colonising the land under Tzar’s supervision and how “wonderfully” they are dealing with the locals. All in all, the book is really interesting historical document if read critically. If one is interested in the story, but short of time I would recommend A World of Empires: The Russian Voyage of the Frigate Pallada instead of reading this one. It contains the great modern analysis and puts this story into the proper wider context.I want to focus only on two observations here. The one is this sheer superiority and entitlement those people felt while visiting strange lands. Here is the extract when they arrived at some Korean village:“When we tried to glance over the fence or entered the gates - what a noise those Koreans made! They even tried to hold us by our dress or sometimes pushed us rather rudely. For that we’ve beaten their hands, and they were became immediately pacified not dissimilar to the dogs who walk behind pedestrians burning from the desire to bite, but not daring.”Reading it, I felt something close to rage on behave of those Koreans. Especially as we all know this picture has been replayed so many times over different parts of the Globe. It is plane disgusting for our modern sensibilities. But I am not sure it does not happen somewhere even now when I write this unfortunately. Another thing is cultural differences. Those often lead to the tragic misunderstanding. But sometimes they are more harmless and very comic. A big chunk of the book is devoted to the trade negotiations between the Russians and the Japanese. Incidentally, when the Japanese asked which nation first “opened” them up for the rest of the world, they apparently refer to the Russians, not to the Americans. The Russians and the Japanese did not have a common language and used Japanese translators communicating in Dutch. This and a huge difference in the etiquette has lead to the enormous potential for misunderstanding and comic situations. I quote below A World of Empires: The Russian Voyage of the Frigate Pallada.""The Japanese mixture of repulsive and superiority seems to be a mirror image of the Russian one. In the imperial encounters, western and eastern prejudices clashed, though the easterners at least stayed out of lands of those they despised.”Goncharov does not spare the Japanese of his ridicule on many occasions. “But some of the Russians behaviour may appear equally comical today. Their insistence on using chairs proves a big sticking point in the logistics of this diplomacy. Having firmly rejected sitting on tatami mats, the Russians bring their own chairs from the frigate to Nagasaki’s governor mansion. This forces the Japanese to erect platforms on which to sit, so as not to be placed too low vis-a-vis the Russians. Far from entirely comfortable in their chairs and tight parade uniforms, the Russians have trouble reaching the refreshments placed on. The floor in front of them. During the most active phase of the negotiations in 1854, the Russian ferry chairs to and from the frigate for each meeting. The Japanese refuse to store the chairs, in case damage by fire or rats makes them responsible for these exotic items. The Russians solemnly release their hosts of such liability to no avail. During the initial reception at the governor’s, the Russians also refuse tot take off their footgear, as is proper in Japanese interiors - but on order not to offend their hosts, they place specially sewn calico covers over their shoes. As he shuffles through the corridors of. The governor’s palace, Goncharov keeps losing his shoe covers, those imperilling the successor Russian state diplomacy”.This story has vividly reminded me my own experience in Japan in 2004. I was on business visiting the office of the one of a Hollywood’s studio. First few days we were getting accustomed to bowing before and after the business meeting, taking business cards with both hands and looking at them in a way as it was something totally revelatory written on them at least for a few minutes. And they were in Japanese. Also it took some time to adjust to listening to a music when someone was flashing the toilet. (I was properly spooked the first time around especially after it took me a while to figure which button is for flashing mechanism). But then, as a part of my work, we needed to visit a warehouse where they were storing film reels. It was called “the backroom” and it was situated somewhere on the outskirts of Tokyo. Needless to say that neither me, nor my boss, a substantial Flemish woman, did not speak any Japanese. The mobile phones were much more advanced in Japan those days. So our phones did not work. There were three of us visiting. Our Japanese translator has shovelled my boss and me into a taxi he has stopped with his hand outside of the office. He said something to the white gloved driver who nodded agreeably. We assumed it was all fine. After we departed, the translator and our colleague, John, were about to catch another taxi for themselves. So there we went: two of us at the back sit with a silent, very seriously and solemnly looking Japanese driver behind the wheel. We traveled for about an hour without knowing where we were going, different landscape passing behind the window until it changed to a suitably industrially looking buildings in different stages of construction and something which reminded me of slums in between. We have become l little alerted by this stage. But as we were supposed to visit something looking as a warehouse, not too much. However, soon our driver has stopped in front of the huge round building looking like a stadium. It was literally at the middle of nowhere. In his solemn and ceremonial way, he pushed a little button opening out door. You are not supposed and I think you even cannot open the door yourself. So here we were - no single person around, and an empty edifice looking like a stadium, or a cosmodrome, or maybe like British GCHQ intelligence building but not like a backroom in-front of us. Our door is opened and the silent driver is waiting for us to get out. “No, no. no” - says my boss in her perfect English trying, not successfully to close that door, - “it is not our destination. We need a backroom”. The man is looking at us totally and understandably without any comprehension and is trying to push his magic button again rather demonstrably. My boss then tells to me: “Do you think it might be here?”. I pretty much doubted it. But she says: “OK. Let’s try to go and look around”. “But there is no-one here” - I say, “Not a single car passed. How would we catch another taxi, especially without knowing a single word.” “That is true”- she said. Ok we would not let this one go.” All of this is happening when our driver just patiently sitting with his back to us. My boss taps him on his shoulder and says rather loudly and carefully articulating her sounds: “Do not leave please”. He nods. We are getting out from that door. I am first, she is second. But as soon as she is out of the door, it starts to close, and to her amazement, the car is starting to slowly move! I would have to acknowledge her bravery and self-sacrifice, but she literally jumps in-front of the car with her considerable weight and shouts again: “No, no, no!” The driver stops, pushes the button again and the door is starting slowly opening again! I feel a nervous laughter raising inside. It is a competition of the wills: the one of my boss, now red faced and progressively angrier against the driver’s who has hardly moved a muscle through the whole exchange, but starting to look a bit alarmed. Unsuitably I think: “If it would go to the feast fight, she would win.” My boss is telling me: “Right. You get into the car, but put your foot out on the ground so he could not leave. And I will go and check is this the right place”. I try to limit the damage: “Could we swap? I can run faster.” She agrees. To no-one’s surprise, the place is totally deserted, I found only one small door which was probably last used during the restoration. When I come back, I see a detente scene. My boss is sitting with her both feet out and drawing something on the piece of paper. The driver is trying to call someone and looking a bit less solemn. “How would you draw a backroom?” She asks. It is evident that drawing is not her forte and not mine unfortunately. We both try to draw a bunch of film reels. She is pushing the picture in front of the driver’s nose shouting: “Backroom. Films, Hollywood!” I feel I would now burst into laughing. That would not be very helpful considering the driver starting to think we are mad and again tries to push his button to demonstrate that we need to leave. “I have the office’s phone number”, I say. I wish we could call and get someone talking to him”. I did not expect such a prompt reaction from her but while the driver is still recovering from our collectively produced art piece, my boss jumps from behind, and snatches the phone from his hand. She thinks her smile is totally disarming but I could see the driver is starting to look for escape routes. I try to soften the blow by pointing at us, the drawing, the surrounding and making reconciliatory noises while my boss is trying to dial the number. I am thinking what if he would manage to escape right now? We would be in the middle of nowhere with the car which we could not drive and the phone which we were not sure how to use. So I smile to the driver trying to keep a diplomatic relationship of some shape. Fortunately for us all, she got through and they’ve cleared the confusion to some extent. It took awhile as I suspected he did not want to deal with us any longer. But they convinced him to give us another chance. When we finally arrived at the proper place after some time, we had an extremely moving reunion with our colleague, John. He faired a bit better, but the first thing we’ve seen on arrival was lonely John sitting on a single chair in the middle of the room surrounded by a dozen by standing and silent Japanese workers all in black suits with a tie. A scene from some thriller about the Westerners and Yakuza. I still do not know who those people were as they promptly disappeared as soon as we arrived. Then we’ve finally been welcomed by the management of the backroom.As this book has reminded me of this story, I could not give it less than the 4*:-)...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"May 21, 2021","Jul 06, 2021","May 21, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/646930.The_frigate_Pallada

Spoiler 2 - it is basically Tolstoy's story mentioned above masterly retold. The strongest point of Sorokin's story is the style. It is perfectly tuned for the tale with different characters speaking different style of language. It is clearly ""calling"" to Tolstoy's tale. These two novelllas are in a wonderful, unique conversation with each other. And here is a very rare case, when I reading them it next to each other amplifies the impact compared to reading a single one. I am not hiding anything under the spoiler's alert as it is hard ""to spoil"" this story. The beauty of it in the moments of both spiritual awakenings and tiny details of the language. It is distinctive as well how Sorokin - re-imagined the conflict in Tolstoy's story and solved it.Oh, and yes: there is a speculative element in Sorokin's novella. It might come across a little gimmicky to some and non sufficient for the lovers of the speculative fiction. But it did not do anything for me at all. Neither positive nor negative. It won't change my opinion of the story.If you plan to read this one, read Tolstoy's first and I can assure, you would find one more dimension here. I normally do not like retellings.

The translator is Huw Davies. The Press is Glagoslav Publishing. It is also available on Amazon’s kindle. I highly recommend the book. Carefully and painstakingly, the author of this book reconstructs what happened in Yasnaya Polyana in 1910. We all know that 82 year old count Leo Tolstoy walked out leaving behind his wife of 48 years and the estate he has lived in all his life. But no-one knows exactly why he did it. The author attempts to resolve this puzzle. He goes through the enormous amount of primary sources including the diaries, letters and memories of main participants of the drama, the articles in the press and of course Tolstoy’s legacy. Many of those documents are quoted at length in the book which gives it an additional dimension.The result reads like a tragedy of King Lear. Tolstoy allegedly did not like Shakespeare. So it seems ironic how close the end of his life comes to remind the one of the Bard’s tale. But the story is even more complex as there is a main character which is absent in the Shakespearian plot. It is Tolstoy’s wife, Sophia Andreevna.The book covers their whole life together. From the beginning their marriage, they were such mutual confidents that they have been reading each other diaries. And this continued almost until the end of their joint life. The author makes you almost part of their story. It is occasionally very painful and often borderline voyeristic read. Inevitably, as in any family conflict, you would end up taking sides. Though the author tries very hard to show the story from many perspectives, be objective. And I think, he is successful at that. But for me personally, there were no choice at the end. My sympathy towards Tolstoy and his followers were wearing very thin. And I wholeheartedly took the side of his wife at the end.I would not go into the complexity and the nuances of the drama. This book is a wonderful and very well written source to find out more. I hope they would translate it one day. But probably there are books about it in English as well. I just note a few things. For the first 30 years of their marriage Sophia Andreevna was pregnant for about 10 years - one third of all the time. She was breastfeeding all the children probably for the big chunk of the rest. They've buried 5 of them. She was also responsible for the estate and copying his work. And then, he has had his moment of enlightenment and somehow made her feel she could not follow him where he goes in his thoughts. He got disenchanted with family and with the institute of marriage all together. Many other things happened. But I think the one of the main issues was that he was not able anymore to love the woman shaped by the life with him, his influence, his convictions, his passions. There is a line that comes to mind by the one of Russian poets:""But who if not us turn our loved ones into the othersThose others whom we would not be able to love evermore?""And then by from the same poem:""I desired to make the whole Globe happy,But failed give happiness to a single alive soul.""One might say the ideals are more important. Tolstoy’s views have evolved. Maybe. But how those evolved views could evolve into such a general ambivalence to all women and the one in particular that he writes The Kreutzer Sonata? The depiction of jealousy in that novella is unbelievable in its force. But the conclusions which this novella is leading to, that woman’s nature is evil and christian marriage allegedly cannot exist… How could it hurt that one woman who shared his life?I cannot imagine how wounded she felt. Notwithstanding, she has met tzar officials asking them to publish it as it was censored. But also she could write herself! She wrote her own novella in response: “Whose fault is that?”. The novella has not apparently been published until 1994. There, the main heroine says:“Is it true that women's’ calling is only for giving our body in service to a hungry baby and then move it to be used by our husband? Always, one or the other? Where is my life? Where am I? This girl who sometime ago was eager to serve God and other ideals?”I do not think it is a tale of living with a genius. It is more complex and more simple at the same time. It is the story of one family. The one of those that as we know, “all unique in their unhappiness.” There is a passion and love involved up to the end. It is not Tolstoy’s views that has lead to the tragic end, it is more his confusion and losing his love. The most poignant moment of the book when Sophia is finally allowed to see Tolstoy who is not conscious and have a few hours to live. They did not let her in before that. How faithful and wise that woman could be in spite of or maybe because of all those last years of the nightmare they’ve been through. The love survived in her case....more",Notes are private!,0,68,1,"May 04, 2021","May 07, 2021","May 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10402917

And this filling is somewhat iffy. Possibly, it contains too much spice or just lacking the sophisticated ingredients the bread made you to anticipate.(view spoiler)[ Back into the world which “we cease to understand”. The book contains a number of pieces starting with an essay and then progressively moving forwards using the real scientists and the context of their studies in more fictional way. The framing essays worked very well for me. Labatut shows erudition and the skill of weaving together the facts from different areas to deliver his message. Obviously not the first to contemplate this, he convincingly demonstrates that the scientific progress could be used both for good and for the most evil means. In the last essay, the only one written from the first person, he comes back to this idea and makes it more poignant and personal. I would argue with his view that pesticide's use has lead to the overpopulation, but this is a minor detail. His theme of the ethics in science is much wider. In the pieces about Schwarzschild and Grothendieck he shows that both men in different circumstances where afraid that the human nature would lead to maths and science discoveries ending civilisation. Grothendieck has quit doing maths as he thought he might discover something which could be so dangerous that no-one should know. The second theme Labatut is tackling is the nature of scientific discovery - how it happens, in which form the inspiration comes to people; how a moment of epiphany looks like? By nature of this it is a bit mystical topic. There is a whole literature around it. He quotes Grothendieck:“A perspective is by nature limited. It offers us one single vision of a landscape. Only when complementary views of the same reality combine are we capable of achieving fuller access to the knowledge of things. The more complex the object we are attempting to apprehend, the more important it is to have different sets of eyes, so that these rays of light converge and we can see the One through the many. That is the nature of true vision: it brings together already known points of view and shows others hitherto unknown, allowing us to understand that all are, in actuality, part of the same thing.”This points towards a collaboration. Also, of course there is Kuhn with his idea of scientific paradigm shift in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. I’ve read a few years ago a book by Cedric Villani, the Field medalist Birth of a Theorem: A Mathematical Adventure which tries, not totally successfully in my view, to reveal this mystery from his perspective. All of these ideas are very interesting read.But obviously no-one could know for sure. Quite a few of such moments take place without witnesses. So here, Labatut would need his imagination of getting into the heads of those scientists. It is an audacious task. And that is “the filling” which I did not enjoy. The main part is devoted to the story of discovery of quantum physics at the beginning of the 20th century. This story and the enigma of the theory is well known and told many times. But Labatut is interested in scientific inspiration. So he picks up three main protagonists Heisenberg, Schrödinger and de Broglie and builds his story around them. All these three were very colourful personalities in real life. So Labatut has had enough material to work with. But I found the result quite disappointing. It is a blend of poor man’s The Magic Mountain in case of Schrödinger with a Faustian tale in case of Heisenberg. I am not sure whether it was intentional. But it reads like quite a bad parody, and it is not thrilling or funny. At least I did not share the sense of humour. And epiphanies. What did help our men according to Labatut’s imagination?“Heisenberg refused to masturbate: he was convinced that all his body’s energies must remain bottled up so that he might devote them to his work.”But:  “Schrödinger would masturbate as soon as she had left the room, when he could still close his eyes and see her sitting by his side. Afterwards a tremendous guilt would beset him. Because he could not reach the bathroom without her help, he would clean himself with a cloth he kept hidden beneath the bed, like an adolescent still living at his parents’ house.”And “she” was a 16 year old TB infested girl. She was created for the story b Labatut as far as I understood. In real life, Schrödinger did his discovery on a two weeks vocation in the Alps. He indeed took a girlfriend with him whose identity is still a mystery. I doubt he had a need to invoke his discovery with jerking off under such circumstances. Much later in a few year, he has had a pretty distasteful affair with an underaged girl (17), but it hardly had a relation to his scientific prowess. He has not made any more discoveries.De Broglie is easier. According to Labatut, he was collecting the objects of art by mad people in memory of his dead friend. The one of them was a pile of excrements in a form of Eiffel tower or something. I forgot exactly what it was and I do not really want to check. There are other examples, some of then a bit more imaginative, like for a example a dream of castration. But is it really necessary for all of it to be so gory? Many people jerk off, some even soil their pants like poor Heisenberg did in this book, but not many come up with the wave function or uncertainly principle. (hide spoiler)]Enough said, I think. There is a lot to like in this book. He explains the underlying ideas pretty well. He also shares the list of the books he has read in his research. But “this filling” in the middle has significantly diminished my enthusiasm. The enigma of the scientific epiphany has remained unresolved. And in terms of “the world we cease to understand”. I dare say we have not ceased just yet as we never did understand it at the first place....more",Notes are private!,0,122,1,"Apr 27, 2021","Apr 30, 2021","Apr 27, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53972214-when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world

It might have been a Mobus stripe. But it was a figure of 8 for me - something that twists, intersects once and then repeat itself without a beginning or an end. I do not think many people would like this novel. But I loved it. I liked both how the subject matter is presented and how the novel is written. For me it was the case when those two sides perfectly complemented each other.The book made me think how much in our lives depends on a simple luck. There is quite limited amount of cross-roads an average human being faces during her life time. But each of those crossroads bears huge importance for what would happen next. And, while on some of them, a person would not always be in position to chose which way to go. Luck or should we call it pure chance, or history would decide. “Soot is a reflection of something, a reflection, an inside-out being, an interior on the surface, the outside within him, a whole world in there, a world of reactions, effects, consequences.”The first of those cross-roads is simply someone’s birth. One person might be born to clever caring parents in a safe place adorned with genes and cultural capital. Another - not so lucky. Then it might become a little less random. Or so it seems, or so we want to think. But still on each of those cross-roads any human being might take a wrong turn without even being aware of it. And there would be no way back. In each of these points we leave a shadow of us, a doppelgänger - someone we have not become and never would, but it was a fair chance there and then for better or worse.This book is in a way a reminder about it. About this potential alternative which might be less comfortable, less pleasing and safe. And that the fact the we are here in a safe country means very likely that there are many other places where it does not feel that safe. The fact that some people try to come to our safe country to rescue their children or maybe to give them what seems a better chance. But very often these people pay a huge price. They pay with their dignity and sometimes with the dignity of their children.And it might have been that those parents would have been us and our children would have been theirs. Pathetic and long-winding way of saying a simple thing. I know. But that is what the author made me think about. Many other authors tried that and they failed. In particular, I cannot stand so called “misery memoirs”. But this author has totally succeeded. He does something special with the language. He writes in a figure of 8. He writes a novel trembling with urgent words like a string of a cello the main character plays on.I said “the character” but it is more like a voice. Actually many voices, but they seem to be coming from one source; maybe it is this single person thinking or maybe not. They are getting entangled with each other, they compete with each other, you cannot always tell who is speaking; noting you can do but follow the stream, the sound of those voices. And they weave together a collective portrait, collective conscienceless. This is very disorienting. It throws you off guard. And the voices take you into the dark places; They talk to you about working in a cruise ship’s kitchen or restaurant toilets; they make you understand why people hit each other; why some of them would tame their terror of death with substance abuse; why children would grow to become the same as their parents. At least many of them would:“…The thing that drove me mad, the thing that pulled me out of my childishly straightforward, simple existence, out of my wits, was the realisation – at first diffuse, covert and inexplicable, before becoming a revelation and then a kind of experience, a somatically and intellectually couched understanding – that some lives don’t deserve to be lived. That this lie prevails. And no one can do anything about it…....You live fully in the shadow of your parents’ failures, their losses, their blind struggle. You’ve got kids to take care of but you go to pieces, breaking down the moment you start thinking about your own childhood.”""The words Amor Fati is tattooed in a scar tissue of the one of the characters’s chest. “Love your fate”. I've looked it up. It is often associated with what Friedrich Nietzsche called ""eternal recurrence"", the idea that, over an infinite period of time, everything recurs infinitely… Figure of 8.These voices also show how fragile this balance, this borderline that seems to be totally solid between “their” world and “ours”. A girl is telling about her encounter with “do-gooders”:“but if I say shit about how things are, real talk, and maybe my thoughts about why things are the way they are, they look at me with the same expression I imagine a certain person was wearing when he looked at Oliver Twist asking for more food.… that’s why we laugh at them, right, laugh at them and say: we feel sorry for you, cos we know we’re better equipped for the future than you could ever be, with your straight spines and broad smiles, … Feeling at ease in the world, is there anything more twisted, is it even possible to be more conceited?” Another figure of 8.There is abrupt musicality in the style of the text. The music also brings its symbolism into the narrative. Two names stood out: Scelsi with his strange, non-european music where everything has to do with rhythm, not melody. Everything is alien like the people from foreign lands coming and bringing their sounds with them. And ÉricSatie, an early 20th-century Parisian avant-garde who liked his repetitions. Amor Fati - “eternal recurrence”.This whole work has reminded me a novel by another Scandinavian author, Jon Fosse The Other Name: Septology I-II. In a different way it deals with similar questions. The fear of death, the fear of life, the alternative fates. And these books in a way are more real than life. Paraphrasing Kundera, in a novel one could be both. In one life you are an artist and in another - you are an alcoholic. In one life you are a musician playing Scelsi and in another you are a tired, beaten half-alive junkie. And it could still be you in both cases. No moral lesson in it. But there are moments:“That sensuality, in living. A soft scarring. The body faced with this love, yeah an address, a message of love, why ever not, that had previously been concealed, now came forth into the light. And this light flooded, heavy and urgent, over objects and beings, over the world, whose age and size were so enormous that the mere hint of it, the mere hint of the contours of just an insignificant fraction of all that, of the unnameable fabric of eternity, that boundless cloud of not knowing, had me drowning in love.”PSIn terms of the parallels in style, another two names came to my mind is Celine and Lobo Antunes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Apr 18, 2021","Apr 19, 2021","Apr 18, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49007455-wretchedness

He claims that in her work, any writer would hide a message which is difficult to see at the first glance, like a figure hidden in the pattern of a carpet. But unlike the carpet's situation, very often no-one would be able to distinguish that message, that figure, without the writer's help; even if they would try really-really hard. Sagasti reminded me this story. He weaves his carpet out of many elegantly written and almost self-sufficient fragments. Each of them both creates its own mini story and adds to the ""carpet"".

My  is based upon reading an electronic version of the book. I understood the design was an important integral One initial caveat straightaway. My  is based upon reading an electronic version of the book. I understood the design was an important integral part for the author. The electronic version does not convey the intricacy of this design. So I am talking here only about the text.This is another of those “genre-bending” books which has become a genre by itself. Or more likely, it has always been a genre, but less prevailing way of writing than now. It is a mixture of fact and imagination, autofiction, an essay and even poetry sometimes.I’ve paused for a second to think which adjective am I supposed to add to “writing” in the previous sentence. I was about to go for “imaginative” first. But then, it does not have to be imaginative. Then I thought about “narrative” - still does not have to be that either. I think everything goes here as soon as it is not academic. I can mention quite a lot works I’ve read in the recent years composed in this way. Names include from Rachel Cusk, Claire-Louise Bennett or Rebecca Solnit; even Flights and Second-Hand Time from the two female Nobel prize winners could fall in this category; but also more masculine non-fiction novels byJuan Gabriel Vásquez, Javier Cercas or Laurent Binet.In the outstanding essay I’ve read and probably would quote for a while, Zadie Smith talks about some writers (and the readers I presume) “being embarrassed by the novel—and its mortifying habit of putting words into the mouths of others—many have moved swiftly on to what they perceive to be safer ground, namely, the supposedly unquestionable authenticity of personal experience.”Respectively, I think the higher visibility of those works is the response to our collective quest for “authenticity” and perceived lack of it in a pure fiction. It is an arguable point which requires a separate discussion. Here, I’ve just wanted to mention that authenticity for me stems more from my ability to suspend disbelief while reading rather than the factual accuracy. What is “real” in the context of literature?Notwithstanding with “genre-bending” bit, those works still could be good or not so good; imaginative or boring. This one is exactly in the middle of the road, in my opinion. The concept of the book is that many things vanish without a trace, but they deserve the place in our collective imagination or at least in words on a page. And this is without doubt a profound thought and a noble endeavour. It reminded me another book I’ve read In Memory of Memory. There, Stepanova is thinking whether to republish in verbatim the set of letters between her deceased family members. She is driven by the similar impulse. Without her, the words in. those letters would very likely disappear into the void bound to non-existence. So she wants them to “shine” at least once more. Here, the author gives herself even more creative task. She picks up an object or a creature/a human being and uses it as an inspiration for an imaginative story or a short essay. It might be only indirectly related to the initial object, or the object might be in the centre of that writing piece.The project is ambitious. But unfortunately, the sheer variety of different writing styles the author plays with makes the book uneven. I think it was a deliberate decision be her to vary not only the nature of disappeared objects, but the styles of writing about them. And, she seems to be more accomplished in some pieces than the others. It is not always the lack of imagination. For example, the piece I found the most successful was a battle between a tiger and a lion during an imagined Ancient Roman festivity. It is quite graphic, one could say even cruel piece. But she succeeded to present it from the perspective of those animals and the spectators as well. However, she is less successful with human beings. In a few other pieces, she tried a closed third person or the first person narration, being in a head of her character. And the result was a number of flat, one dimensional constructs. She is more successful with brisk fragmentary writing - another good piece was about Sappho written in short paragraphs, factual but with subtle poetic insights into language and femininity.She disappointed me in another story where, based upon the object, I was expecting and detour into German romantic art and, instead I’ve got endless pages of her not very eventful walk among the fields. Another example of variety in style. The piece composed with long sentences. I generally like very long, stylistically challenging sentences. But this: “Yet it was not these long-unchallenged claims that piqued my interest, but the islands whose one-time existence and subsequent disappearance are vouched for in numerous accounts, and especially the testimonies referring to the sunken isle of Tuanaki, owing in some part, no doubt, to its sonorous name, which has the ring of a long-lost magic word, but above all to the strange reports about the inhabitants of this island stating that fighting was entirely unknown to them and the word “war” was not familiar to them in any of its unpleasant shades of meaning, something that, out of some deep-seated remnant of childlike hope, I was immediately disposed to believe, even if at the same time it reminded me of the wishful utopian dreams outlined in countless treatises which went so far as to claim that another world was possible, but that – as the often verbose descriptions of their increasingly elaborate and hence inhospitable social systems went to show – it was generally only preferable to the existing world in theory.”This just made me feel exhausted. Seriously should this be one sentence? I can easily split it into 5-6 normal sentences without losing anything. In fact I needed to do it insight of my head to understand what she is after. But I did not enjoy that process a single bit. And it did not bring me any satisfaction at the end like Henry James or William Gaddis would bring. Fortunately, it was just a single piece written like this.Overall, it is not a bad book. But based upon a well written introduction, I expected something like Optic Nerve, but got something like a Rebeca Solnit without social justice bit but in a more experimental packaging....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Apr 09, 2021","Apr 12, 2021","Apr 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52175029-an-inventory-of-losses

Any comparisons are always reductive, but just for the sake of impression: it has started as a Moby Dick, but then swayed all the way to Dostoyevsky but with much more intellectual streak and such a brilliant dark humour. Later thoughts:Somewhere in this novel a character asks another one carrying a thick book: “Have you been reading this?” “No I am just ing it.” - that was the answer. And that is what I really do not want to do. I’ve read this novel and I felt amazed and challenged by it. To write about it is somehow to diminish the wholeness of that experience. Anyway, I try… … and so in the painting every detail reflects… Do you get the perspective in this? … There isn’t any single perspective, like the camera eye, the one we all look through now and call it realism , there… I take five or six or ten… the Flemish painter took twenty perspectives if he had wished, and even in a small painting you can’t include it all in your single vision, your one miserable pair of eyes, like you can a photograph, like you can painting when it degenerates and becomes conscious of being looked at.I think this paragraph serves as an excellent metaphor for this novel as well as for any masterpiece. It is like a fragile castle - it contains so many perspectives that trying to separate one would dismantle the edifice. And I was starting to write this  a few times. But then gave up and just wrote what you find below. I stopped trying to analyse how this book is constructed and why it worked for me; how to reduce it to a scheme and explain it. I want to keep it alive in my memory.There is a Faustian fable in it, however incomplete as it is unclear what is the bargain at the end unlike in other Faust tales. The main character if he can be called that way is missing from the page quite often. Somewhere in the first few hundreds pages, after his fateful deal, he stopped being called by his name, or any name for that matter. He becomes just a nameless presence until very late in the novel when he was “named” again by a crook. And I wondered why. Maybe it is because the talent he possesses goes far beyond language and cannot be simply defined… Maybe it is a reference to Odyssesus and Polyphemus’s story… There could be a dozen other potential answers to this question. But it is striking how it works; how it defies all preconceptions one might have about how a main character in a novel should be. Or maybe this is the answer:“He began looking wildly round the room where shapes refused to identify themselves, and endured only in terms of the others, each a presence made possible only by what everything else was not, each suffering the space it filled to bear it only as a part of a whole which, with a part standing forth to identify itself, would perish.”This paragraph is like a dance. I could read it again and again without being tired of repetition. Maybe that is how you can define the objects and the characters without naming them…I want to talk about the female heroine, Esme. I’ve heard somewhere that Gaddis was very ungenerous in creating female characters. I protest! She is an absolutely ethereal unique creation. She is a poetess who struggles to write her poems. And here, Gaddis manages to show how an inspiration reveals itself:“It was through this imposed accumulation of chaos that she struggled to move now: beyond it lay simplicity, unmeasurable, residence of perfection, where nothing was created, where originality did not exist: because it was origin; where once she was there work and thought in causal and stumbling sequence did not exist, but only transcription: where the poem she knew but could not write existed, ready-formed, awaiting recovery in that moment when the writing down of it was impossible: because she was the poem.” “the poem she knew, but could not write”… is it the most tragic matter any gifted person person faces one day, the limitations of a gift. It reminded me the famous story by Cortazar The Pursuer when the main character, another gifted person improvises on a sax not even remembering about the time and space, and later not being able to come back to that music and suffering because of this. Esme as well feels this constant incompleteness. And then she sits downs and copies poems of someone else. It was Rilke’s “Ellegies” on that occasion.She also caught by us while reading:“Only occasional groupings of words held her, and she entered to inhabit them a little while, until they became submerged, finding sanctuary in that part of herself which she looked upon distal and afraid, a residence as separate and alien, real or unreal, as those which shocked her with such deep remorse when the features of others betrayed them. An infinite regret, simply that she had seen, might rise in her then, having seen too much unseen; and it brought her eyes down quick.”It is a fashionable way to put it, but I can “identify” with her in this respect, especially about “infinite regret of having seen too much unseen”. I think after reading certain books which reveal some of this “unseen” it is getting progressively harder to appreciate something that just “tells the story”. But Esme is much less preoccupied with her reading habits. She is more like a mirror, so natural and not at all self-cautious. And she is crazy and she uses drugs. But her life is like a dream. She just feels.“The love I have from others is not love of me, but where they try to find themselves, loving me. I dream and I wake up, and then at that moment you are somewhere ring real to other people; and they are part of your reality; and I am not.. But you are the only person I am real with..”There is this aura of eternity in her character. And she seem to feel that she is only guest here though she has been here many times before. “Others, ages dead, have wooed other men with my eyes.” She reads in the story by Olalla. And, again, she does not take that much space in this novel either. Maybe a dozen of pages spread though the thousand. Gaddis create this people with such an economy but their presence is so powerful, it lingers long when they disappear from the page and the novel moves on to something else. Much better than any “realism”. He is the kind of writer who can effortlessly bring about a totally new character in the last 100 pages of the book and not be afraid of it. And the character would be as tangible and irreplaceable as any other in the novel. He also shows how you can be original without bothering about originality…And talking about originality, any single blurb about this book mentions forgery and the debate about the authenticity of art and life. So I would not waste your time on that. I presume there are many pages written about it. But there is one aspect I’ve briefly touched upon in discussions with the one of my friends here on GR. What would survive the test of imitation? I think Gaddis gives the perfect answer:“Most forgeries last only a few generations, because they’re so carefully done in the taste of the period, a forged Rembrandt, for instance, confirms everything that that period sees in Rembrandt. Taste and style change, and the forgery is painfully obvious, dated, because the new period has discovered Rembrandt all over again, and of course discovered him to be quite different. That is the curse that any genuine article must endure.”And that is why Rembrandt or Gaddis for that matter will always be fresh and imitated by many. That is why Esme copies her poems from Rilke. And that is why Borges writes about Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote.PS1.I also want to mention how funny this novel is by parts, I had quite a few proper ""laugh out loud"" moments. The satirical element is brilliantly sharp. He satirises everything from religion and the dumbness of mass culture to the Bohemians of the 50s. Below is just an example how a distinguished, well published and well known writer, the character from the novel writes: “ I felt throbbing within my breast the thrill of a deep emotion which I was powerless to describe, as I approached the soaring walls after an exhausting climb, and reached up to pull the cord on the centuries old bell. Its gentle voice sounding distantly just as it must have on that sunny day (snowy might be) when Saint x (to fill in) appeared at this same door…”It gave me the one moment of “recognition” that I would be happy to avoid. I’ve read, sometimes even finished many contemporary novels written that way stuffed with meaningless adjectives and unnecessary pathos.And here how Gaddis writes himself:“the sea which has lots the glare of sunrise. The sea, romantic in books, or dreams or conversation, symbol in poetry, the mother, the last lover, and here it was, none of those things before him. Romantic? This heaving senseless actuality? alive? evil? symbolic? shifting its surfaces, of blind life and death. Boundlessly neither yes or no, good nor evil, hope nor fear, pretending to all these things in the eyes that first beheld it, but unchanged since then, still its colour, heaving with the indifferent hunger of all actuality.”2. I've just discovered to my surprise, that Esme was modelled on a real person, ""the modernist muse"" Sheri Martinelli. She by herself was a painter, a poet, a model and she has inspired many in her days:http://stevenmoore.info/martinelli/sm...3. Many people say it is a difficult novel. I did not feel that way. I sincerely enjoyed it. As any great book one can read it on many levels. And you do not need to be an expert on literature to enjoy it. I loved working on the sentences. But even if you do not enjoy such stuff, you would still find a lot to like. There is a lot of intertextuality.

Once he was representing the mother of 14 year old teenager who died in custody while being Dexter Diaz is a prominent human rights lawyer in the UK. Once he was representing the mother of 14 year old teenager who died in custody while being retrained by 3 officers. The boy was the youngest person died in such a way then. His mother could not comprehend how it could happen. And Dexter could not explain it then. This hefty tome is the result of his quest to understand the human nature. So much he wanted to be able to answer this question that he went to Harvard to study moral cognition (new science combining neuroscience, experimental and evolutionary psychology). He also travelled widely.The book is a combination of individual stories and his findings including the proposed psychologic theory. The individual stories are all related to so-called human rights violations form child slavery and using child soldiers in war zones to human trafficking and female genital mutilations. Also, he investigates such dilemmas like the right to die. On another hand, he presents findings from the labs in experimental psychology investigating the human nature. He is extremely curious and erudite individual. So the book is peppered with a lot of sometimes tangental but always very interesting information starting from life of the Gobi fish and finishing with the nostalgia experienced by Frederic Chopin.At the core of the book is a theory that our actions are driven by 10 types of our behaviour. Those types are the models within our brain that get activated depending on the actual situation. And this activation is leading to a series of our actions. These types evolved with the evolution of a human. I do not want to mention all ten, but I give a few examples. Kingsman - the type which makes us to select and protect our kin as opposed to others. Parents-child is the obvious example. And Dexter starts the book with posing a relatively well known dilemma: if you need to make a choice during the school shooting whom would you safe: only your child or 40 other children except your child? Another example is a Romancer - again pretty obvious. But for whatever reason, expressed more in men than women. Dexter shows the study when men were happy to spend much more money on-line when an attractive female was present silently in the room. But not wise versa. That, together with another factors, has lead to the conclusion that there is a romancer in us ready for sacrifices to safe (not always successfully) a beloved. The third example, less obvious is “The beholder of beauty”. He claims that just born babies can recognise beauty. And, growing up some of them could become criminals if the perceived beauty does not belong to them. He illustrates with the men ordering acid attacks on the girls who previously rejected them. I found it much less convincing - strange feeling of beauty. There are another seven types from Rescuer and Nurturer to the Tamer of Terror.This theory is not new of course. Even Jung was talking about something similar ages ago. What is new is that Dexter tries to bring about the evidence from the lab for this and the evolutionary nature of this. I have to admit I am very sceptical in the explanatory power of this model beyond what is obvious. Plus Dexter drives home the idea that our brain is responsible for our mind. We sort of all suspect this. But sofar no-one knows exactly how. It is the famous mind-body problem which has not been solved. So when for example Dexter brings neuroscience into this and tells that the pain of the others activates the same neurological network as our own pain, I am not convinced that I can project it into something called “The Perceiver of pain” , the one of his types. I also have a problem with the idea that the one of those types prevails in a concrete situation. It is somehow deprives us of the agency. “It is an an evolutionary aggressor in me who hit you. I am sorry” type of thing. I know Dexter probably means the opposite. That I should try to tame that aggressor type. But then we are going meta level “Who is I?” And his theory somewhat looses its explanatory power again.Additionally, I doubt that some findings revealed in the artificial experiments of Western campuses would hold on a battlefield in some African country.But in spite of all these reservations (and it would be one more at the end), I liked the book. The strongest part for me were the individual stories and human rights issues. Dexter takes us to such places we would not think of. Also he makes some issues, looking abstract to us (well at least to me) looking very much concrete. He introduces us to a boy called Anthony from Ghana who was sold into slavery by his own father. And Dexter shows all complexity of this situation. In another story, he takes us to Central African Republic. He is right when he says not many people even know about its existence. I did not. And he tells the story of three very different people dragged into never ending conflict there. In other stories, he brings attention to acid attacks, HGMs, trafficking and children prisoners and many other issues. He also for example visits Haiti to talk how people (predominantly women) survived the violence in the aftermath of the earthquake. A few times, I was afraid that the book was dragging into the territory of the sensational. But he timely put his foot on the brake. When I was reading the book, I was wondering why it was not nominated on any prizes. It is fashionable now to write and read a hybrid fiction/non-fiction works. But for whatever reason, it is more popular when a writer of fiction introduces factual information in her works. At this case it is the opposite - it is definitely the work of non-fiction. But Dexter uses the whole toolbox of the fictional writing here. For example, the direct speech, dialogue and “being in the head of a character”. There are many example where Dexter would not be able to know in such a detail what his characters were talking about - before a battle for example. But he is bold in applying the fictional toolkit to make his writing more vivid. And it is vivid. How accurate it is? Sometimes I doubted this. For example, there is a story about the Russian boy “disciplined” by his PSD suffering father by holding him below the water level in a sink. I was not sure how it really took place. Unlike in the UK, they only very rarely would have a plug in a sink in Russia. Normally the water would float through without staying in the sink at all. So there are such details. But I think he has put a lot of efforts to convey the jest of situations accurately. At least I want to believe him. And the nature of these tales is such that the narrators, his interlocutors, cannot be always reliable after going through all that traumatic experiences. In spite of some reservations, I really recommend this book. It is that kind of book to read and argue with loudly in the empty room. Or silently agree with. It is full of interesting ideas and It is good for discussion, even with the children. Later, I’ve listened Ito t in the car with my family and we had some interesting arguments about it. And though I sometimes felt somewhat irritated with Dexter’s persona, the people populating it would stay with me for a long time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Mar 13, 2021","Jun 17, 2021","Mar 13, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40920818-the-ten-types-of-human

That is by itself not that bad and Mr Cesaratto's ability to explain difficult concepts is quite outstanding. The bottom line I think that his view is that the distribution of surplus income between the owner of the capital and the labour is the point of social contract, so can and should be negotiated. That contradicts the edifice of neoclassical economics which states that it is a naturally evolving equilibrium. There is a lot of discussion about it both in terms of historical and economic theory.There is a lot of other interesting discussions in the book. He is anti-Euro (as a currency) in its current form. It was fascinating to view the recent financial and Eurozone crisis from the Italian left academic perspective. I personally do not agree with some statements. And I did not like a certain element of bashing the German ""neoliberals"". But there are many details in the book to support his view. In general, the political and economic view on Italy for the last 50 years was new to me and very interesting at that.Also the book is excellent in describing the modern financial system and the role of money. It is becoming a main stream theory now that the banks do not need to have deposits first to produce/lend money and that a country with a sovereign currency can issue money before collecting tax revenue. But he is not a supporter of MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) unless it applies to the US, I understand. This is due to international borrowing and currency risks for the majority of the world countries.The book would be a curious read for those who want to look at economic theory and policy from the left of the political spectrum. ...more",Notes are private!,1,24,1,"Mar 13, 2021","Apr 09, 2021","Mar 13, 2021",,,view (with text),/book/show/56548598-heterodox-challenges-in-economics

I have not been even born until well after one third of that decade. So I do not have any personal recollections to speak of. But recently, I have become especially interested in the 70s's Britain. Based upon a number of articles I've read it seemed to hold the key for understanding the contemporary Britain and the recent political events such as Brexit.This book is a good, easy to read overview of the political, social and economic events of that decade. It starts with Heath winning the election and ends with Thatcher doing the same for the first time in 1979. It is written by a left-leaning journalist/historian. But it is not preachy at all and he has put a lot of energy into this book. The strongest bit is his conversations with many people, politicians, trade union leaders and the journalists participating in the events. Though it did not particularly address the relationship with Europe, it did help me to understand the country I live now much better. I've learned a lot about the strikes, trade union movements, the politicians struggling with the shifts in the society. I did not know before about 3 days week, for example. Although I've heard about the winter of discontent, I did not know what it entailed and the scope of it all. It is fair to say that my sufficiently idealistic view of the past in the UK of that decade, as opposed to the USSR were I was growing, was slightly dented. The book also touches upon the conflict in Northern Ireland and feminism/LGBTQ movement but does not go deep enough into any of these.I posted a few updates if someone is interested. Here, I just note a few facts that I found amusing:1) apparently in the late 70s there was a talk in the British press that the Britons are people of leisure, so they do not need so many consumer goods like the Germans for example. Not sure whether it needs a further comment;2) the monetarism and austerity was actually first tried by the Labour government, not by Thatcher. Even with the trade unions the story is more complicated that I've thought initially - the social contract with the Labour government has run its course in 1978 and they could not find the common ground for the next one. 3) At the end of the 70s the British society was the most equal as it was ever. That was partly due to the previous two decade and the improvement of the lives of the masses. But partly due to economy far from flourishing. So the rich got poorer. However the employment was almost full and the social mobility was high. It is striking for me that there were no single first rank politician both Conservative and Labour who would be ""an old Etonian""! It went downhill from there on this. But what puzzles me is that considering all this achievements in building an egalitarian society why so many were striking so often practically paralysing economy and the social services as well?It is a fascinating book about the fascinating time which has defined the future trajectory of this country it seems.

But for now - just a few thoughts. The book is written for the general publI would need to come back and to write a proper  of this book later. But for now - just a few thoughts. The book is written for the general public. Anne Krueger is a proponent of the free trade. She worked both in academia and in the international institutions. So the book is the result of her knowledge, practical experience. It also introduces some theoretical concepts in the area. It is written as the response to Trump's assault on free trade. So it is an American focus. However, it would be useful to anyone who are interested to understand the issues in the area. It is relevant as we are currently going through the process opposite of globalisation of decoupling some of the global supply chain for the sake of national self-sufficiency and other national interests or just sheer politics. I did not know much about the international trade. And this book was very useful. Though I have to warn that the subject is pretty dry. And it is not Ms Krueger's fault. Below is 8 lessons she conveys in her book. It is an extract from the summary chapter. All of these topics are dealt with extensively in the text.Lesson 1. Multilateral rule of law is vital to the global economy. More than seventy years ago, it was recognized that there had to be a rule of law governing international trade.Lesson 2. Liberalizing trade further will enable more rapid economic growth. Strengthening and deepening trade (and financial) ties has been a hallmark of the international trading system since the Second World War. The reduction of tariffs and virtual elimination of QRs, combined with further drops in costs and duration of transport and communications, has more than doubled the share of trade in global GDP in the postwar years.Lesson 3. Current account balances are the result of macroeconomic policies. For any country, bilateral trade and current accounts should be positive with some countries and negative with others. Even multilateral balancing of trade does not make sense. For a country’s current account, a deficit or surplus of the multilateral current account can be beneficial or undesirable depending on the underlying macroeconomic factors driving it.current account deficit because a country has many more profitable investment opportunities than can be financed at current world interest rates from domestic savings, or there can be a deficit because consumption is on an unsustainably high trajectory.Lesson 4. Bilateral protectionist measures lose a great deal of their hoped-for effectiveness because of third-country effects. It is difficult to overstate the importance of third-country responses to bilateral trade policies. After Trump imposed tariffs on China, Vietnam’s exports to the US rose 40 percent in the next half year and even more rapidly thereafter. It is estimated that other Asian countries have filled at least half the drop in Chinese exports to the US. MexicoLesson 6. Protectionist measures have unintended and unanticipated consequences. Total consumption of a protected good may decline enough that domestic production does not even increase; but even if it increases somewhat, the gains in jobs in the protected industry can and often are more than offset by reductions in employment in using industries.Lesson 7. But for a healthy, growing economy, it is important that policymakers look to the future and find ways to improve the productivity of all rather than look backward and try to slow down new industries and ideas.Lesson 8. Protection does not create jobs. Trade destroys many fewer than is popularly believed. Protection may slow down the rate of decline of employment in a declining industry but creates many fewer jobs than expected in the protected industry and results in more job losses elsewhere. Many more jobs are lost due to capital deepening and automation than because of trade. Moreover, there is every reason to support workers whose jobs are lost regardless of whether it was trade, capital deepening, poor management, or the introduction of a better product that resulted in job loss. A better social safety net and more assistance to displaced workers without the reference why they find themselves in this position are the most beneficial....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Feb 19, 2021","Mar 09, 2021","Feb 19, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52048450-international-trade

At the centre of the novel is the fate of a young woman, the member of a military revolutionary group, who has been disappeared. And, in the words of the author:“A friend and former lover of hers plagued by guilt for his role in her fate descends into the warped underworld of memory and the 1970s Argentina he’d managed to escape, and there tries to bring her back to life and grant himself redemption.” Usually for me the appearance of the ghosts as characters would be a red flag. I am not big fan of a gothic or magic realism. But here, the whole underworld frame is more like a metaphysical analogy - a trip though the main character’s memory lane. It reminded me another recent novel about the similar period of awful terror from another part of the world: The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree. There, the ghost was the main narrator and the novel, in my view, lacked the moral complexity and was overloaded with well known tropes. Here, on the contrary, the moral complexity and the choices of each character is fully realised. This is probably the strongest feature of the novel. The ghosts are more like decorations of a scene along with the streets of Buenos Aires. I appreciated that this element did not go far beyond that of a metaphor.Not all worked for me in this novel. It seemed slightly over-designed in some ways. The author is trying to spell out a few things which might be easily understood without it. For example, Tomas, the main character is initially accompanied by the Colonel, his mentor. And, we are literally pointed towards Virgil and Dante. Also sometimes, the research almost explicitly reveals itself in the text. There is a scene, albeit short, of a torture experienced by the main character from insight. And I could not make myself believe it. I do not think anyone could make such a scene credible first person without surviving something so horrific. But the book’s strong feature is the authencity of feelings, unflinching look into the complexity of choices everyone had to make in such extreme situations. Were those actions really choices in a way how we understand the word?I also enjoyed the quality of prose. It is spare, not rushed and contemplative. It has reminded me Javier Marias, but it is much less transgressive though. It is a rare case in my experience when my impression after reading this book was boosted by reading the article by the author about how this novel has come to exist. His half-sister has been disappeared in Argentina in 1976. 10 years after that, he was born in America. She was the subject his Dad and the older half-brother did not talk about much. But when Daniel has become an adult, he decided to find out more about her and ended up responsible for the proper burial of her remains, which neither his dad not his half brother wanted to attend. So in fact, he has brought her back from oblivion in some way. And, I think this real attempt somehow is even more poignant that what he has done in the novel.The article also raised two interesting points I end up thinking a lot. The first one, after the end of the Dirty War, the victims and the perpetrators needed to share their country. As Daniel mentions, one might accidentally meet her torturer in a cafe, but also “all of whom were eradicated, were viewed with suspicion and blame, and those who had kept quiet, passively acceding to the junta, continued to keep quiet. There is a reason my Argentine friend was squeamish at the thought of what happened in the ESMA and didn’t want to see it.” Some people like the main character of the novel have escaped the country. But all of them, it seems, struggled with a mixture of the guilt of complacency and a deep trauma. Understandably, unlike the main character, they did not want to bring those times and those victims back both into their private lives and in the public discourse. This is the question I always struggle with. What is the best way in such situations how to keep the memories without retaining anger, hate and bitterness. Is it at all possible?For Daniel’s father, the act of investigating his daughter’s final hours and the subsequent burial of her remains did not bring any change. “There is no peace to this, he’d say. No redemption. No meaning.” It reminded me another book and another struggle I’ve read. In In Memory of Memory, Maria Stepanova asked herself a similar question albeit in a less tragic circumstances. She looked through the private correspondence of her deceased relatives and contemplated whether to quote them at length in her book. She said “To quote those letters would mean to save them; to leave then in a box - was to subdue them to another bout darkness (may be forever). Who apart from me would decide which course to chose. The dead do not have any rights. They are not asked” And that is the question. Do they have any rights or not? Would the girl who died at 22, killed in a political struggle, would she like the idea that her memory got a tribute in a piece of fiction? I do not know. But it seems these actions of writing a novel or of citing the old letters are meaningful. They seen to bring a closure to the next generation, not the ones who lived through. Those are silent. But to their children who have their own experience of a guilt, the guilt that they are not the ones who has been there.

It touches upon the history, mechanics of transactions, forex and QE. They discuss different definitions and theories of money. They come to the conclusion that at least now it is a social construct of debt/credit obligations between a government, central bank and commercial banks rather than a commodity.It also very briefly talks what works and what does not in the authors' opinion. They seem to be advocating more close directions credit controls over money expansion by commercial banks. They also briefly discuss the role of the government. It is useful for everyone who wants to understand how the system functions. But it is written pre-Brexit. So some of the regulation valid before might not be valid now. However, as the UK was never part of the Eurozone, it might be not that significant. Under the spoiler alert is just a bunch of quotes and ideas from the book. And this is more food for my thoughts rather than a .(view spoiler)[QEAll three channels are indirect, and all attempt to stimulate the real economy by acting through the financial sector. Thus bond purchase operations by central banks, including what is styled as QE, do not create new credit or deposits (purchasing power) directly in the hands of households, businesses or the Government. New credit may be created in the non-bank financial (or investment) sector. The investment sector may choose to invest this new purchasing power in newly issued corporate bonds or equity that may allow companies to increase their spending. However, it may also choose to buy government or corporate bonds from outside the UK, or it may invest in existing financial assets such as previously issued bonds or equities, or derivatives based on commodities such as oil or food, which will have the effect of inflating the prices of these assets. Or it may simply sit on these deposits because of concerns about the future of the economy. Meanwhile, companies that are able to raise additional funds through bond or equity issuance may choose to use the money to simply pay off existing bank debt rather than invest in productive activity. If so, this will have the paradoxical effect of reducing credit creation, and the money supply, by exactly the same amount as QE increased it. The banking sector, flooded with new central bank reserves, also has multiple options. It can choose to expand its lending to the real economy. However, it can also simply sit on the reserves. Banks are paid 0.5% interest on reserves by the central bank and they are the most liquid form of asset they can hold (see section 4.1).* Furthermore, if banks do use this additional liquidity to create credit, it might be for transactions that are profitable but do not contribute to GDP, e.g. mortgage lending or foreign currency or commodity speculation. So, bond purchase operations and QE do not involve creating (or ‘printing’) money if by ‘money’, we mean more money in the real economy that is being used in GDP-related transactions. Although it may well have pushed down medium to long term interest rates and made it easier for the Government to borrow by creating significant additional demand for gilts, since at least 2010 the main criticism of QE has been that it has failed to stimulate bank lending in the real economy. Bank credit creation shrank in 2011 and the UK economy moved into a double-dip recession in 2012.†So, we can perhaps conclude the endogenous versus exogenous money debate as follows: in modern economies, where new money is created by the banking system, the supply of money is driven by credit creation, but credit creation is not driven by the demand for credit. Instead, the credit market is determined by the supply of credit and credit is rationed. It is the quantity of credit supplied, rather than the price of credit, which will determine macro-economic outcomes and without even perhaps being aware of it, banks are thus in a very powerful position. The total increase, or decrease, in the nation’s money supply is the collective result of their individual lending and asset purchase decisions. In other words, because commercial banks ration and allocate credit, and they create new money in the process, they have a decisive influence over the allocation of new money in our economy. Macro-economic policy and analysis should be guided by an understanding and monitoring of these processes,targeted the growth of bank credit for business investment that facilitates growth in GDP transactions (2012, p. 94). The Bank of England could have provided loan guarantees for lending to non-financial corporations and unincorporated businesses, to indemnify risk averse banks for lending to sectors of the economy that raise GDP (Lyonnet & Werner, 2012, p. 96). The approach to quantitative easing adopted by the Bank of England was not the form of quantitative easing proposed by Richard Werner, because it did not promote increased credit creation by commercial banks as a consequence of the central bank agreeing to purchase all commercial banks impaired and non-performing loans at face value (Lyonnet & Werner, 2012, p. 96)[20]. The Bank of England was unwilling to engage in cleaning commercial banks’ balance sheet of non-performing loans, because of the potential moral hazard this created. Moral hazard suggests that if commercial banks are protected from the consequences of poor lending practices there is a risk that commercial banks will fail to learn from previous mistakes, which will increase future systemic risk in the financial system.Despite £199 billion of quantitative easin Lyonnet and Werner (2012, p. 96) suggest the Bank of England could increase economic activity by lending directly to companies and the government. Lyonnet and Werner (2012, p. 96) also suggest that government should no longer issue bonds to fund government deficits. Instead, government should borrow directly from commercial banks, or The Bank of England, through standard loan contracts. Borrowing from commercial banks, or the central bank, creates new money that will not crowd-out existing private sector lending. Whereas, issuing bonds on the Stock Exchange will prevent the money government borrows from being loaned to the private sector, because the bond market primarily comprises of non-bank financial institutions that do not have the ability to create new credit money.Werner has argued that the theory has important implications for development, growth and unemployment.54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 Developing economies should not be dependent on external borrowing, he suggests, since they can achieve non-inflationary growth by creating credit in their own banking system and guiding it towards productive use. The high growth witnessed by many East Asian economies in the post-war era (Japan, Taiwan, Korea, China after 1982) was achieved by the implementation of such a credit guidance regime. Indeed, Werner argues that if properly implemented unemployment could be eradicated using this approach.Why government investments might be more productive for a certain economy“Firstly, there are a number of reasons private investors might allocate money in less productive ways than the Government. Private investors, particularly institutional investors, will normally put their money where they receive the highest returns, including investing money in projects outside the UK. While this may result in a higher private return than if they had invested locally, the entire social benefit of the investment will fall abroad. In addition, the private investment sector can and does borrow money for non-productivity-enhancing purposes, such as commodity speculation and commercial property finance. This does not increase GDP transactions and will instead inflate asset prices (see discussion in section 5.6). A further example is when private investors fund private equity vehicles that take over productive manufacturers, fire local staff and outsource production to foreign low-wage countries. This reduces the number of low-skilled jobs available in the UK and contributes to unemployment. Finally, when private sector economic confidence is low, as during recessions, investors will tend to be risk averse and seek existing financial assets, including property, in which to store wealth in preference to providing funding for new commercial ventures. Trading existing assets does not stimulate GDP in the way that investment in new productive capacity and infrastructure does. In contrast, government investment is bound to contribute to GDP transactions – there is little reason for the Government to invest in existing financial assets. Particular types of investment, such as in transport infrastructure, housing construction or low-carbon conversion and energy efficiency-enhancing investments, appear to have a positive long term growth impact but are often under-funded by the private sector because the initial costs of investment are high and the returns on investment are low or take many years to arrive. In addition, spending by the Government tends to also be redistributive; channelling funds towards lower income groups (e.g. via benefits) who may spend a larger proportion of any additional income than higher income socio-economic groups.19»What is moneyFuture exchangeability of money is guaranteed by the Government in three key respects: Through its acceptability to pay taxes By tax-payer-backed insurance of bank deposits* By implicit tax-payer-funded guarantees that banks themselves will be bailed out if they get into trouble We can therefore say that all money is credit but not all credit is money. Schumpeter recognised that what is required is a credit theory of money rather than a monetary theory of credit11. And, whilst no definition is perfect, Geoffrey Ingham’s conception of money, which follows Simmel, Keynes and Schumpeter, seems appropriate: money is “a social relation of abstract value defined by a sovereign unit of account”Alternative to government borrowing to finance budget deficit or expenditure. 1. government could borrow directly from commercial banks. 2. Central bank created credit to be directly spent by the government into the economy or QE. 3. State directly creating money and put it into circulation free of interest. Example 100% reserve requirement for the commercial banks will make them just intermediary. They would stop to create money. I am surprised Friedman advocates it. 4.

It is a superb realistic novel: the characters, sociaI started to listen to this novel, but then I loved it so much that I’ve bought the actual book. It is a superb realistic novel: the characters, social conflict, the plot, the setting and also something intangible which is hard to express in words. But that, intangible is what really matters.Through my reading experience, I could not shrug off the feeling how little the dramatic development depended on the action of any individual character. How there was a certain inevitability and logic where everything was going. And each action by a character would be predetermined by some intangible factors be it her/his background or the situation they’ve found themselves in. It is like people happened to be in certain circumstances; and though in theory they would have an option to choose how to act, they would end up doing what the like of them have done before again and again. It wasn’t a hint of the historicism in Hegel’s sense or the Eastern karma. It was more like people “drifting” through their lives in spite of all the drama happening to them. It was like those little English people (and the locals as well) were placed into a vastness of space and time. And even when they try to learn this place they would fall the victims of their own preconceptions. It was like a fight of collective evil with the collective good. But both of the sides of the battle were illusive and impossible to grasp.Later, I understood from reading the intro, it was intentional. Forster “tried to indicate the human predicament in a universe which is not so far comprehensible to our minds.“ But it was so well done that it never felt far-fetched or fake.It was the last novel Forster has written. He became “wearisome” of the “studied ignorance of the novelist”. He lived almost 50 years after that without writing any new novels. I have a split feelings about this. On the one hand, I wish he would write many more books of fiction. He was a rare talent based upon this novel. On the other hand, I appreciate he had not. I think he has squeezed everything he could out of the combination of the form and his talent; and he knew when to stop. This is a rare gift as well to know when to stop.And this novel is alive. Reading it, I was full of emotions, both basic and complicated. At some point I was brimming with rage, at the other - I felt overwhelming compassion for one character. And as the people in the novel, I felt something behind the scenes “not so far comprehensible to our minds”.The novel is the result of Foster’s time lived and travel in India. I thought his desire to understand and explain the clash of different systems of belief was a very nuanced one for the Westerner. So many things changed since almost 100 years this novel was written. But so many things stayed totally the same. This feeling when a group of people, a nation or a person feels inherently and not justifiably superior to the other did not diminish or disappear at all.I loved the book. But I have a few “problems” with the novel. The main one is that I felt Forster played safe in the resolution of the main conflict in the book. Was it a realistic resolution? Yes, it was. And, It underscored underlying fairness and decency of some individuals within the grossly unfair colonial set up. But was it the most likely scenario that this conflict would resolved in such a way? I doubt. And it would be even more revealing if the novel would lead us that way. But alas, Foster it seems has stuck to the inherent sense of English “fairness” in some of his characters. Another minor peeve - he got rid of my favourite character before long.Still, it is this rare beast of a wonderful, complicated novel that is also a pleasure to read....more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,"Jan 21, 2021","Jan 31, 2021","Jan 21, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45195.A_Passage_to_India

It is written as a result of the course Saunders is teaching for many years to the aspiring young writers as a part of MFA program. I am just a reader. And, if I would want to write a story (unlikely), I would definitely stay away from any formal advice on the matter. Saunders, and presumably the majority of his students do not speak Russian. So they read these stories in translation. I am a native Russian speaker so I can read the original. But I like Saunders’s previous work. And when the one of my wonderful friends here (Hi, Vesna!:-) has nudged me towards reading this book with her, I did not hesitate.The book has amused me. At the end, it was a very unusual, but fruitful reading experience, though I disagreed with quite a few interpretations of the individual stories. And I ended up writing the longest  ever (sorry for that)! It made me think again about many issues such as the process of translation, the value of professional creative writing programs (MFA) and what is that thing that makes a story special.The book consists of 3 main parts. Saunders would start with the story. It would be followed by the essay of its closed reading. In the essay, Saunders would underscore the angles of the story which would show some technique or observation useful for an inspiring writer. Then, Saunders would comment in a separate short chapters -“afterthoughts” about his own process of writing. The comments would be inspired by the story in one way or another.I’ve enjoyed the most when Saunders was talking about himself. Here, the book was becoming alive. His sincere desire to show how he does his craft was evident. Also his thoughts about human nature, ageing, the meaning of life were interesting and fresh.I struggled more with his analysis, and respectively with his attempt to teach how to write creative fiction based upon those stories. But I admired his passion and love for Russian literature throughout. The  did not fit into the box. So I've split it in two parts. The first part is the comments on some individual stories. And the second part is my reflections on professionalisation of writing through MFA degrees. This part is in the first comment's box.Individual storiesSaunders has picked 7 individual stories for his book. He looks at 3 stories by Chekhov, 2 by Tolstoy; Gogol and Turgenev have a story each. I’ve read only 3 of the stories before. It was amusing to see the reactions of a writer from a very different linguistic tradition. Especially, he could only read these stories in translation. Sometimes, it has affected his interpretations. In the case of “The Darling”, the English version got him quite derailed from the original in my opinion. However, it was a fascinating and enjoyable experience to accompany him on his reading journey compare my notes with his.Singers by TurgenevThis story is a part of ‘Sketches of a hunter”. It is sketchy indeed and very descriptive. Turgenev spends the bigger part of it painting with words his numerous characters for them only to meet once in a village pub to enjoy a signing competition. I thought the story was dull unless you are interested in the anthropology and the ways of the entertainment between the Russian lower classes circa mid 19th century. But Saunders used it rather successfully to show that a writer cannot totally define his style. And even if Turgenev would want to write like someone else, he would very likely come back to write like Turgenev: ie put a lot of descriptions even if he does not need them for his plot. And if he, Saunders, once wanted to write like Hemingway, it did not work until one day he tried to write like Saunders. And it was liberating. That was the lesson. But in terms of Turgenev, there are much better stories to read and enjoy. In his short stories, he is brilliant in creating complex portraits of romantic love. Asya and Faust are good, for example, if someone wants to taste how deep Turgenev could go beyond the sketches.TolstoyI do not have much to say about the Tolstoy’s stories. I thought Saunders analysis was quite profound. This is his thought about the first one:“Master and Man,” we begin living it; the words disappear and we find ourselves thinking not about word choice but about the decisions the characters are making and decisions we have made, or might have to make someday, in our actual lives.” But the stories he has chosen did not moved me deeply enough to make a wider comment. It is a well known fact that Tolstoy idealised peasants. In the last story, “Alesha the Pot”, he talks about a young lad who subdued his personality to the desires of his superiors. Saunders grapples with this character and tries to find the complexity and double meanings. Also it is the story when Saunders brings some Russian speakers to help him with translation. Well, in terms of the complexity, the only complex thing in that character is his natural simplicity. He is as simple as any part of nature. And he is closer to the natural world than to any modern Western person. The Darling by Chekhov(view spoiler)[This is a relatively famous story. Even Tolstoy has devoted an essay to it in his days. The main heroine is a woman called Olga (or more softer - Olenka). The story is about her ability of fully merging herself with her love interest. She can only imagine her existence while she is a part of the whole with someone else. And, when she loses this person she feels totally empty, unable to find any sense in her life. She sees herself as a mirror for her love, the organic extension of the person she loves. It is as if her soul imbeds the soul of her partner. In Russian original she is called “Dushechka” which could be literally translated as a “little soul.” And there is not a notch of any egoistic motive in her.I think we all intuitively sense what she feels. Anyone who has ever loved knows how the part of one’s identity inevitably surrenders. It might be a natural process, it might be a series of compromises or a scandal. But the bottom line when we are not alone, we share our essence with someone else. We become a bit alike. Often in a relationship, one person sacrifices more than another. But it is not necessary even an acknowledged sacrifice. It just happens. Olenka is an extreme of this process. She talks only about the topics valued by her love interest. She does it in a way how he would talk about it. She thinks like him and she cannot do otherwise. It is a little tragedy for her. But Chekhov being Chekhov introduces some comic undertones. After the premature end of two marriages and one romantic liaison, Olenka goes through a crisis and cannot see her future. But then the fate brings a school boy under her wing, the son of her ex-lover. And Olenka uses all the power of her devotion on this boy. The end is a bit open to interpretation. Did she found the power of motherly love? Is it temporary? She was always slightly over the top. Can the boy give her respite from feeling empty for a long time?This is the story. Now, I think this is an example when the nuance in translation (or the lack of it) has played its role in Saunders’s interpretation of the story. First, the title “Darling” is not ideal. Even ‘The Soulmate” would be better by playing on the Russian relationship between ‘Dushechka” (the original title) and dusha (the soul). But that is just the beginning. The cornerstone is the relationship between Olenka and the boy. Boy is 11 year old. She wakes him for school, makes sure he does his work, worries about him like a real mum. The boy being boy is a bit sloppy and stroppy. He does not like her seeing him off to school and shows it. That might create an impression that he feels overwhelmed by her love and attention. But in Russian it is very slight undertone. He behaves like any real son would behave in this age. She behaves like many good mothers would; she puts him to bed, she checks on him sleeping. The last sentence of the story she overhears him saying in his sleep in English version:‘I’ll give it to you! Scram! No fighting!’On the basis of this ending and one more phrase before that, Saunders seems to be reevaluating the whole story. He judges the phrase in a Freudian way that it was addressed by the boy to Olenka. He is not alone in this either. He quotes Eudora Welty who says: “The last words of the story are the child’s and a protest”. Respectively, Saunders raises the point of indignation calling Olenka “oppressive” and “vampirically feeding upon whomever she designated as her beloved”. He goes on and concludes:“By the end of the story, we feel that her tendency to become that which she loves is innate, a fixed trait of her character that has manifested, naturally, on a series of love objects.”Earlier, but I think after forming his judgement about the ending he goes on mocking her for trying to identify the cat as her love interest. But the cat in the story is actually a female, which is not obvious in English. And such an identification seems to be far fetched and simply fantastical. Olenka does not fall in love with cats.When I’ve read all of this, I thought something very wrong. Based upon my Russian reading, Olenka came across as the kind, slightly unfortunate and absolutely selfless person. I went back and check the ending. In Russian the boy says:Я тебе! Пошел вон! Не дерись!As well - 3 sentences. Literally it translates:Я тебе! - I - to you! (In a sense I would get you or I would hit you).Пошел вон! - Get lost addressed to a male. The verb ending in Russian is very clear. It is get lost, man. Not get lost, woman. It cannot be unless the boy is not Russian and speak in some weird dialect!Не дерись! - It is an imperative verb form. One can translate it: “Do not fight!” But it would be better: “Do not squabble” or “Do not bicker” in a sense like the boys do in a school yard. It is crystal clear to me that the boy is having a school yard fight in his dream. It is nothing whatsoever to do with poor Olenka. It is really a pity that one sentence so much derailed the story for the English audience. It is so even if it has made the story more interesting for the interpretation on vampiristic and egoistic transformation of love. But those things are not there I am afraid.  (hide spoiler)]NoseIn my opinion, Gogol stands out with his unique ability to create distinctive voices in his prose and in his anticipation of the 20s century absurdism. “Nose” is the story for example about the disappearance of a nose from the face of a low level St Petersburg’s official. One can find traces of Gogol in Kafka or Okutagawa. Saunders analysis is quite entertaining. He talks a lot about how Gogol creates a distinctive narrative voice for the story. But I was surprised he calls the genre of Gogol stories a “skaz”. Skaz in a traditional Russian meaning is a story based upon a rural legend or a fairy tale which is often being retold orally. It is soft of an epic tale. Leskov, the another Russian writer of the 19th century is famous for using the element of skaz in his short stories. One could say Gogol used some element of this in his “Mirgorod” stories. But here, in St Petersburg stories, it is hardly a skaz in the definition known to me. Gogol indeed uses unreliable narrator and he is excellent in it. Maybe the term “skaz” was redefined somehow in the Western Canon. I do not know. But I certainly would classify Gogol as early absurdist rather than a “skaz” writer.Gooseberries This is the one of my favourite Chekov’s stories. So I am quite passionate about it. In its core is a monologue of Ivan, the one of the characters on the possibility of happiness. Among other things Ivan is saying:‘It is obvious the happy person feels this way only because the unhappy ones carry their burden in silence, and without this silence the happiness would be impossible.”. He continues that it should be someone with a little hammer standing behind and knocking to remind the happy people about this fact. He also appeals to his friends to do good and acknowledges that he is not able of doing it properly which keeps him awake at night. At the same time, Ivan gives the title to the Saunders’s book. He swims in a river under rain and he truly enjoys the moment. He is totally radiant and amazingly full of life. It seems to me that Saunders thinks that Ivan is a bit of a hypocrite on the basis that he enjoys his swim and is content while preaching the impossibility of happiness. Saunders also picks up the detail of a stinking pipe left by Ivan that disturbs the sleep of his friend. On this basis, he think Ivan is somewhat “narcissistic”.  I am simplifying a bit his argument, but this interpretation made me smile. No Russian I know would assign the stink from the pipe to any egoistic impulses of Ivan. In fact, no Russian would find this detail so significant in terms of Ivan/s character. ‘Swimming in the pond”, is more complicated though. It is not about happiness for Ivan and it is definitely not about being content in spite of believing that it is no-one should be happy. No. It is about feeling alive. As simple as that. It is about knowing that life is full of tragedy, but feeling that a person cannot do much but live in full swing.“There is no strengths to continue living, but in any case one needs to live and one really wants to live!” - says Ivan later.He is a contradictory character. But he is not a hypocrite. He does not allow himself being happy in spite of what he says. He just lives. That is why he is in the pond under rain....more",Notes are private!,1,240,1,"Jan 18, 2021","Jan 26, 2021","Jan 18, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53487237-a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain

I’ve never thought that economics was a science, definitely not in a traditional sense of the Periodically I “dive” into reading books about economy. I’ve never thought that economics was a science, definitely not in a traditional sense of the word. It has a very limited ability to come up with a predictive theory. Nevertheless, it is an important and interesting discipline to read about. So, this year with all the mess we are going through, I felt a “pull” to come back to these books again. Not surprisingly, I am interested how we could bear the cost of the pandemics and what risks it poses to our societies. But it is not only pandemics. The trends were there before as well. What is the role of the government? What are the sources of inequality and the policies to address it; the future of work; social activism; global development and the future of the globalisation; climate change… The list could go on. But this particular  is of the book on the Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). I’ve first heard of it when someone mentioned the book The Deficit Myth: Modern Monetary Theory and the Birth of the People's Economy by Stephanie Kelton. Stephanie was the adviser to Bernie Sanders. The core theory is not particularly new. But it seems to have made a breakthrough into popular imagination, especially with the young socially-minded activists. I’ve decided not to read Stephanie’s book first. My decision was partly motivated by purely economic reasons - the cost of the hardback. But also I was thinking it would be more beneficial to read a book summarising the views from the wider spectrum of opinions. This collection of essays is very good for this purpose. It gives a platform to both the supporters and the opponents of the theory.Additionally, this book has appeared to be indicative of another problem with economics and its role in the intellectual life of the society. Some of those essays were really badly written. And, it seems the economists are notorious in communicating difficult ideas in a simple language. If they do it, it is usually dumped down to such a level that the core is distorted. In fairness, it is not only economists who suffer from this.MMT is the one theory though that has managed to overcome this problem party by active explanatory and marketing campaign and partly by its relevance. Though I still think quiet a bit of “dumping down” is taking place.So what is MMT? That is how I understood it in its simplest form:The government of a sovereign country does not need to tax in order to spend. This is because the government is a sole issuer of the thing we call “money”. Moreover, spending more than collecting in taxes is good as it creates surplus for the private sector of the economy. Taxes are required only after that to “suck out” redundant money from the economy in order to avoid inflation. Taxes also are important to have all this running smoothly. As if we would not need to pay taxes why would we want the money issued by the government at the first place? But as it stands, if we would refuse to pay taxes, the government have a coercive mechanism to put us to prison for example. We do not want to go to prison. So we would use the bills issued by the government. The bottom line is there is no financial constraint for the sovereign government. Only constraint is the availability of real resources such as labour, energy, technology etc.As the one of the proponents put it (not from this book): “is that while it remains emphatically true that we, as individuals, are financially constrained by the finite number of Dollars each of us can earn and save—as a collective society, working and cooperating together, we have all the financial resources necessary to pay ourselves to accomplish virtually anything we are capable of. This, in the end, is the astonishing “truth” that will solve the “unsolvable” dilemma of our National Budget.”Another supporter (Dirk H. Ehnts Ch8): “Essentially, the currency issuing government faces no purely financial constraints. The only constraints a monetarily sovereign government faces are the availability and quality of its real resources as well as the risk of inducing inflation if total spending exceeds the productive capacity of the economy in some significant sector.”The policy which is logically following is government should spend as much as it needs to without creating the price’s growth.Specifically, the government could become “the employer of last resort” to eliminate involuntary unemployment. But there is even more popular version between the activists - any policy protecting the disadvantaged or common interest could be financed this way. One does not need to care about the employment that much at the end. And the taxes are not so important in this. They use the word “pre-distribution” instead of “redistribution” as the government spends correctly the first time around.That sounds fantastic. And, actually the theory is not that simplistic as it might look. Famous Keynes was asserting that the government could increase its spending without the risk of inflation in the window until the economy reaches the full employment. But still, there is substantial amount of questions with this theory even from mine perspective of very limited knowledge. The theory is based on the following assumptions: “the degree of monetary sovereignty depends on four conditions: 1) the government of a nation issues its own fiat currency, 2) it is able to enforce its tax liabilities denominated in its own currency, 3) it does not issue any (significant amount of) debt instruments not denominated in its own currency;4) it does not promise to exchange its own currency into anything else at a fixed rate”.The last two of those assumptions effectively exclude the major part of the world as no developing country posses such amount of monetary sovereignty with their external liabilities denominated in US$ and pegged exchange rates. So the theory might be OK for the US and a few other rich economies, but not for the majority of existing world. And this “double standard” for me is the major issue. It is to some extent the hidden continuation of colonialism. Generally, the theory is not focused on open economy. In fact, I’ve I found the only one MMT supporting economist who is dealing with developing countries and how MMT would apply to them - Fadhel Kaboub He asserts that in order to apply MMT the country has to become self-sufficient for food and energy instead of trying to develop export orientated economy. This is very good, apart from probably not very feasible. Even I can see that if food sufficiency might be possible (with huge efforts), the energy sufficiency requires at least access to the new technologies. This requires resources. Mr Kaboub thinks that the resources could be cultivated through investments in education. At this point I think we face classic “the chicken and the egg” problem. In general, I am very sceptical about recommending developing countries self-sufficiency in the post-colonial world.Now, back to the US and the likes. I am bit sceptical in terms of MMT core philosophy of taxation. Based upon the fact that money can be printed in any volume the government wants (subject to the constrains of the real resources which are difficult to estimate in real time), the taxes become the instrument of inflationary regulation. But then, if everyone understand this, people and businesses might not want to pay any of it. Moreover, in ideal case, the taxes then are not required at all. I find hard to believe that such philosophy born on the left would not be loved by the libertarians. In practice though, the role of the taxation is not only financial. To some extent, it is a part of the coherent social contract. This might be in danger if everyone would see that they do not play any role in financing the needs of the society. Another problem with MMT is that they do not consider the role of the central banks as essential. Specifically, as far as i understood they do not think that independence of this institution is required. I think it is fundamental as the government is subject to short-term political cycle while the central bank (or the Fed in the US) is not.I find the argument that the state is not limited in printing money quite liberating. But taking to the extreme, it leads to interesting experiment. For example, the local authorities - they do not have “monetary sovereignty”. But if they would aspire to, they could follow the same logic and issue some “tugriks” which would be accepted as a payment of local taxes for example. Or in fact any community could do something similar and even establish some lending in “tugriks”. One can say it would be illegal. But if there is a will there is a way. I think the success or the lack of it of the alternative payment systems would be crucial to understand the limits of this point.Back to the book, some of the fellow post-Keynesian economists in this collection have had some reservations in respect of the MMT. Some of them, even from the left of political spectrum, were seriously critical. This is the view of Jan Toporowski, the Professor at SOAS:“The purpose of a radical economic policy is social and economic change, and not experiments in economic theory. Truly radical monetary theorists test their ideas against the possibilities of achieving that change, rather than using social and economic change to add radicalism to the thought experiments of academics and hedge-fund managers. Policies of environmental protection and improving the material conditions of working people through full employment and subsidy of workers’ consumption (such as health, education and welfare) challenge the social and political interests that govern society.Modern Money Theory therefore represents a certain retrogression of monetary theory: a set of doctrines to reassure Gaitskell’s “plain man” that the money is always there, rather than a theory explaining how money circulates in a capitalist economy. The doctrines are naïve and the radicalism lies in the purposes for which the money will be spent, rather than in any new thinking about money.”But many of them were more sympathetic. MMT is gaining a wide popularity between the people though. And I can see why. It is the first theory which is breaking the dogma of TINA (“there is no alternative” famously quipped by Mrs Thatcher) in the popular imagination. In the words of Luis-Philippe Rochon, another contributor the collection:“For the past three decades or so, neoliberal or mainstream economists, their political leaders and princes of finance, have used the dominant doctrine and TINA to justify some of the most ruthless policies of austerity, deregulation and privatization, with very lucrative consequences. Such policies contributed to (growth of) the wealth of the 1%, and the development and institutionalization of a dual economy: austerity for workers and profits for the rest (Epstein, 2019). In other words, the policies of the last 30 years have been good for the economic, political and financial elites. It is in this sense that Queiroz (2018) calls TINA “an ideological and political subversion of liberalism” (see also Munck, 2003). TINA has become the first line of defence, and offence, against any conceived threat to the neoliberal order.” So any argument understood by the masses and challenging this orthodoxy is a useful argument. I am happy that the tide is changing. I am sure the rich countries can afford to switch on the printing press for a bit. But I do not want a new TINA replacing the old one. I am personally sure there are better arguments and models out there. Especially, I think that the global consequences of any proposed national solution should be carefully considered and not overlooked. ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Nov 27, 2020","Dec 09, 2020","Nov 27, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53500980-modern-monetary-theory-and-its-critics

This is because it has been almost 3 weeks since my son has been to his normal school. They had a covid case in his year group and he has been sent home. But some students from his year have been told to stay. And, just when the first batch was about to come back they had another case. All went in circle again. When I tried to raise the question of mask wearing during the lessons in the classroom of 25 teenagers sitting closely together, other parents said it was unnecessary as their children would be “uncomfortable.” End of story. Let’s see what the next week brings. For now, when I was not involved in recalling what were enzymes or covalence as I was often recruited for help and motivation, I was not allowed near my Mac in any case. But here we go. Today is the first day I am “allocated” a bit of time for my own business.This book. I am a bit partial to Koch as a scientist, exciting storyteller and very decent human being. I also find the theory that he supports very elegant and intuitively appealing. So my  might come across as a bit biased. But one cannot get rid of subjectivity. Especially while we talk about consciousness. I’ve read his previous book as well. And while that one was more personal, this one is probably better in summarising the current state of science in this area.Koch’s definition of consciousness is a broadly accepted one I guess. It is any subjective experience from pain to taste, emotions, colour perceptions and more sophisticated advanced matters like feeling of self (the last however is not necessary to be conscious). I’ve recently read much older and more famous book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. There, consciousness is defined more like ability of introspection directly related to language and self-awareness. For me, it was too narrow a definition for an experience. That definition would also exclude every other living creature. I found Koch’s approach more constructive. In fairness, I think the majority of scientists dealing with the subject would agree with Koch’s broad definition now. Janes's book has been written in the 70s.Koch is a big propagator of the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) designed by the fellow neuroscientist Guilio Tononi. The book discusses this theory, its implications and touches upon other modern theories in the area.IIT starts from defining the axioms what constitutes an experience. There are 5 of them in total. If someone is properly interested in the theory, I would post a link to the article by Tononi where all of this is explained brilliantly. For my purpose here, I would just say that each experience generates something different from anything else including any other possible experiences. It sounds obvious as any axiom should. But then IIT exploits on which possible substrate such a phenomena could be generated. The answer is only on a physical system which is very highly integrated with lots of feedback loops. Such system would be able “feel like” something from inside. While other systems, less integrated with more feedforward architecture or the modules would only be able to feel like the lowest module with the highest integration.The implication of that is that we and other creatures with brains or sophisticated nervous systems would be sentient; an electrical circuit with feedback loop would possess some very minimal intrinsic perspective. It would be the case for an atom or a cell. But no spoons, tables or computers would be able to be conscious. In the case of a computer, theoretically it is possible. But modern computers are not integrated enough and could not be made to feel anything unless they are sort of a hybrid with a human (“losely mimic neuronal architectures”). As it stands, they could easily simulate anything, even consciousness. But they would not be able to know “what it feels like” to be. As Koch says, there is a big difference between “being” and “doing”.“Conventional digital computers, built out of circuit components with sparse connectivity and little overlap among their inputs and their outputs, do not constitute a Whole. Computers have only a tiny amount of highly fragmented intrinsic cause-effect power, no matter what software they are executing and no matter their computational power. Androids, if their physical circuitry is anything like today’s CPUs, cannot dream of electric sheep.”This theory is in contradiction with the currently prevailing orthodoxy that “Mind-as-software is an unspoken background assumption that needs no justification.” For Koch, “It is as obvious as the existence of the devil used to be.” This prevailing view in neuroscience and Silicon Valley is called computationism. It more or less postulates that consciousness is the result of a software run on our brain. It cannot exist without the input from outside and serves to produce the output which would go outside as well. The best theory from that camp is Global Workspace Theory (GWT):  “When activity in sensory cortices exceeds a threshold it triggers a global ignition, whereby information enters the global neuronal workspace. This information then becomes available to a host of subsidiary processes such as working memory, language, planning, and voluntary action. The act of globally broadcasting this information is what makes this data conscious. Nothing more and nothing less. Our stance is based on a simple hypothesis: What we call “consciousness” results from specific types of information-processing computations, physically realized by the hardware of the brain.”Koch quotes here the GWT's the one of the main proponents, Stanislas Dehaene.Interestingly, there is currently something called “adversarial collaboration” between IIT and GWT. By the end of 2021 we should find out who is right. Where there is something we intrinsically possess or we are just processing machines like computers. The details of this collaboration is in the link below.Coming back to the IIT, another implication of it that only the module with the highest integration would have consciousness. In other words, if we would be able to establish a strong hypothetical bridge between two independent brains, they would cease to feel like independent persons. And the combined brain would feel like one instead. So the one for the price of two effectively.However, Koch argues that our metaphors about feeling like a country or a corporation are just that, metaphors: “Thus, the Anima Mundi or world soul is ruled out, as it requires that the mind of all sentient beings be extinguished in favour of the all-encompassing soul. Likewise, it does not feel like anything to be the three hundred million citizens of the United States of America. As an entity, the United States has considerable extrinsic causal powers, such as the power to execute its citizens or start a war. But the country does not have maximally irreducible intrinsic cause-effect power. Countries, corporations, and other group agents exist as powerful military, economic, financial, legal, and cultural entities. They are aggregates but not Wholes. They have no phenomenal reality and no intrinsic causal power.” This is another thing I really like about this the IIT. But lets hope that internet would not connect us to a degree that we would stop feeling like anything and instead would become the submodules of the one big Whole that would be the only one having a consciousness.There is a lot of interesting stuff to think about in the book. Koch talks about some practical implications which are being used already. For example they built up a machine which helps to identify consciousness in a severely disabled people who cannot communicate.But the book ends with Koch’s thoughts not about science, but about moral implications of this theory. The two main ones, that the animal’s rights need to be much better protected as they are sentient beings. And another one that the intelligence should not be confused with consciousness. “Finally, if we link moral rights to certain functional abilities, such as imagination or intelligence, than we will sooner or later have to admit software running on digital computers into the club. What happens if they become capable of cognitive feats people cannot match? They would then leave us morally in the dust, even though, per IIT, they would not feel anything.”Links:Adversarial colalboration:https://www.templetonworldcharity.org...Guilio Tononi on IIT:https://royalsocietypublishing.org/do......more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Nov 17, 2020","Nov 27, 2020","Nov 17, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44512535-the-feeling-of-life-itself

It is the first book which i cannot possibly assign with any stars as it would not reflect my reading experience. It was probably the most hard book to read this year. And it took me ages. It was at the same time frustrating, but addictive experience. It was not the first Henry James I've read. In fact, I've started reading him this year and I loved my experience without reservation until this one. I think the master works for me better in a smaller doses. I absolutely loved his shorter fiction. ""Aspern papers"", ""The Finger in the Carpet"", ""Private life"" or ""The Wheel of Time"" were fantastic, enigmatic and suspenseful. The Ambassadors was great as well. I thought I got his humour, enjoyed his characters and his attitude towards them. And I did not mind the sentences too much. In fact i enjoyed treating each sentence as a puzzle when i had to.Here, it got a bit too much. Maybe it is just the time of the year, but I needed to re-read almost every single sentence at least twice. So it took me at least twice to read the book. It would take me around half an hour to settle down in to the reading session. Then, after another half an hour i would find my mind inevitably drifting far away. I would catch myself thinking about anything starting from my school years (very long gone) to what to make for dinner this evening. So i guess i need to be grateful to James that dinner varied more than usual in our household. Anything apart from the book. The beginning was better, and then, when the action or the lack thereof has moved to Venice, in has become more bearable. But the middle was a muddle for me.However, I've finished a few days ago and I keep thinking about how the novel is constructed, why James was interested in the triangle of the main characters; the role of the supportive cast. Also how he described Venice and London tube for example somehow stuck in my mind. So i cannot say I did not appreciate the novel after all. And I certainly would read more James. It is just i think for me he works better when it is less pages to turn. Especially I know he would leave a lot of stuff out for us to think about anyway and I appreciate it.I've just found this except from a letter in an old New Yorker's article:“but one thing of him I know: our language has no artist more serious or austere at this moment. I explain to myself his bewildering style thus: he is attempting the impossible with it—a certain very particular form of the impossible; namely, to produce upon the reader, as a painting produces upon the gazer, a number of superimposed, simultaneous impressions. He would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once, and get all at once the various shadings and complexities, instead of getting them consecutively as the mechanical nature of his medium compels. This I am sure is the secret of his involved parentheses, his strangely injected adverbs, the whole structure, in short, of his twisted syntax. One grows used to it by persisting. I read ‘The Ambassadors’ twice, and like it amazingly as a prodigy of skill. One other thing of signal importance is a key to his later books. He does not undertake to tell a story but to deal with a situation, a single situation. Beginning (in his scheme) at the center of this situation, he works outward, intricately and exhaustively, spinning his web around every part of the situation, every little necessary part no matter how slight, until he gradually presents to you the organic whole, worked out. You don’t get the organic whole until he wishes you to and that is at the very end. But he never lets the situation go, never digresses for a single instant; and no matter how slow or long his pages may seem as you first read them, when you have at the end grasped the total thing, if you then look back you find that the voluminous texture is woven closely and that every touch bears upon the main issue. I don’t say that if I could I would work like this, or that the situations he chooses to weave into such verbal labyrinth are such as I should care to deal with so minutely and laboriously, even if I had the art to do so; but I do say that judged as only any works of art can ever be judged; viz., by themselves, by what they undertake to do and how thoroughly they do it, Henry James’ later books are the work of a master. . . .”And, I think it has fully reflected my experience, but in a wonderfully articulate way....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Oct 04, 2020","Oct 14, 2020","Oct 04, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15994570-the-wings-of-the-dove

Everyone is entitled to his personal view on this, but I think we’ve collectively created an entertainment industry out of the biggest tragedy. Many of those books are just sensational, factually wrong, second hand rubbish. Probably there are some notable exceptions. But in my view, the accounts of the survivors and related non-fiction is more valuable than any fictional account. It is personal as well. My great grandmother and her 13 year old daughter perished in it. I’ve written a whole paragraph about this. But then, i was not sure whether to include it. So I left it out for now.My point is, I’ve read this book in spite of all the above. Admittedly it is more about current state of our world, especially Israel than the history. It is written in a form of a letter from a Holocaust historian to the Chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims. The narrator, who remains unnamed in the novel, has drifted into doing a PhD in the Holocaust studies. It was the easiest way in the Israeli academia to progress. He has been very good in his job and subsequently has started to work as a guide for Yad Vashem in Poland. It paid well and he needed money for his young family. He would take the high school groups and occasionally the military on the tour of the camps. He knew his stuff brilliantly and has become the expert in the subject. He tried to present the kids only with facts.As the novel progresses, his understanding of what he does is changing. He notices more and more the reactions of the kids and the others. This gives him a lot to think about. And, in combination with his overwhelming knowledge of the past, his mind starts to struggle under the unbearable stress. It is a polemic novel. It is impossible to discuss it without getting into the subject matter. So if you plan to read it, the next few paragraphs contain revealing quotes. However i could not hide it under ""spoiler"" alert as I would need to hide the whole thing. And there is much more to it than I have picked up here.It starts with more “gentle” questions. He asks the military officers on a tour to imagine what would they do if they would find out that the part of their army is conducting the atrocities to civilians. Would they leave the army? No-one raises hands.He contemplates himself would those people, brave young Jewish solders, resist if they would end up in a camp like this. He is not totally sure.The kids often asked why the Jewish victims very rarely put any resistance. The narrator explains in details how all of this was organised. But he notices more and more the following reaction: the victims were Ashkenazi Jews, “left wingers” who did not know how to put up a fight. The victims become more and more blamed than perpetrators. Even more shocking, once, he meets a Hassid in Krakow who came with the group to visit a grave of some Jewish Rabbi. This man claims a totally counterfactual stuff that “Thanks to the righteous Rabbi Elimelech not a single Jew died in that town died during the war”. He does not stop there either: unless perhaps the  “heretics did - the ones you call ‘enlightened’. They may have received their punishment.” So not simply a religious Jew is denying the facts. He says that the Jews who assimilated and become secular were justly “punished”. And the kids. They learn quickly. On observing the camps with groups, the narrator sometimes hears: “That’s what we should do to the Arabs.” His comment in the narrative: “When they see this simple killing mechanism, which can be easily recreated in any place and at any time, it inspires practical thinking. And they’re still children, it’s natural, they find it hard to stop. Adults think the same things, but they keep it to themselves”.  As logical end to all of this, one day during the debrief, a smart bespectacled boy stands up and says: “I think in order to survive we need to be a little bit Nazi too.” ….“Sometimes there’s no choice but to hurt civilians, too. It’s hard to distinguish civilians from terrorists. A boy who’s just a boy today could become a terrorist tomorrow. This is, after all, a war of survival. It’s us or them. We won’t let this happen to us again.”So is the purpose of “memory” achieved? That is what the narrator thinks in response to the boy’s comment. He thinks we could bring those kids to so many places; to show them museums in Paris, theatres in London or football in Barcelona… but no:“ we brought you here, to the site of the murder. And I suppose we’ve accomplished our mission. We made you see that it’s all about power, power, power. I’m not going to play naïve or chaste. You’re right. Power. Hitting. Shooting. Annihilating the other. Because without power we’re like beasts, chickens for slaughter, dependent on the graces of others who, at any moment, in a split-second decision, could chop off our heads, strangle us, strip us of our clothes and honor, abuse us in any way imaginable; make sure there’s good lighting so they can take pictures of us getting torn apart, cut, penetrated, hacked to pieces; play music in the background, turning our horrendous demise into a bit of entertainment. Everything is conditional, and therefore worthless. Culture, fashion, conversation, smiling, friendship, opinions, letters, music, sports, food, love—they have no value. They are only a flimsy sugar coating. One spit in the face melts them away. Dear teachers, you can report back to your school that the message has been received. Only power. No conscience, no manners, no second-guessing. Those only challenge the soul and harm functionality. We can’t allow ourselves even a moment of weakness, because everything will be taken away. We have to be a little bit Nazi. You’ve finally said it. You got the point, kids, well done.”And that passage has hurt me to the core. Because it is not only about Israel and its children. It seems to be everywhere now, to some extent. We’ve somehow managed to weaponise our history; to create “memory monster” as author calls it, a “virus injected into these children’s bodies,” . We use the history as a poison when we elect our future leaders or voting on “referendums”. We teach our kids to identify with the one group of people or another, but do not pay sufficient attention that there is a core which is the same for any human being. That “conscience and manners” must count at least as important as the sheer power. They must be the power! And that there is not many things which could be possessed by only one group of people, even the land often has to be shared and especially the history has to be shared. How is that possible that a Monster created by the Nazis, the one that murdered so many people then, has converted into a “Memory Monster” and still kills people and sores hatred? How it is that the ancestors of the victims identify themselves more with the efficiency of the perpetrators? It is such a hard question, almost unbearable to contemplate. And that is the one of the reasons why the narrator’s mind starts to unravel.Another interesting issue in this novel is the effect of a subject matter on a person who studies it. How something which was an abstract material at some stage becomes too real. How when dealing with these things for too long one identifies with them. And it becomes alive. During the site’s visits, the narrator starts to physically see the victims and hear they voices. But where does he stands in all of this? Did he personally start to believe that only power and force matter? That a man has to be able to kill to be taken seriously? I am not sure. The author leaves enough space for us to make our own conclusion. The book has made me feel more emotional than i would prefer to. But it is a powerful and necessary read, a work of fiction I would definitely recommend. And I wanted to finish with a more quiet and cerebral thought by Gabriel Josipospovici’s book Forgetting:""For what does the injunction not to forget really mean? How many of us have personal memories of those events (Shoa)? In fifty years’ time the question will not even make sense any more. How can we ask people not to forget what they have never known? Is not the word forget perhaps the wrong one? Perhaps what we mean is that people should know the history of Europe in the twentieth century well enough to deal with the rise of new forms of discrimination and violence against minorities and to refute those who deny that these events ever happened or that if they happened they were nothing like as bad as ‘people’ try to make out. But that is not quite right. It is too cold, too cerebral. No doubt a better-informed public is desirable, no doubt events such as Holocaust Memorial Day, with its large educational component, is valuable and important. But when politicians and others proclaim the mantra ‘We must not forget!’ they are thinking of something far more immediate, far more visceral, than simply the need for better schooling. But that is the problem. Uttering such slogans puts us in company we would prefer not to keep, the company of the likes of Milošević and Karadžić in the Yugoslav civil wars of the nineties and of extremist Irish Catholics and Protestants during the Troubles.""...more",Notes are private!,0,70,1,"Sep 30, 2020",Oct 2020,"Oct 01, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53401989-the-memory-monster

But he deserves to be loUpdate 28.09.20 - I've added more about the actual ""62"" below.I freely confess I am biased towards Cortazar for many reasons. But he deserves to be loved. Here is what Neruda has to say:“Anyone who doesn’t read Cortázar is doomed. Not to read him is a serious invisible disease which in time can have terrible consequences. Something similar to a man who has never tasted peaches. He would quietly become sadder…and probably, little by little, he would lose his hair. I don’t want these things to happen to me, so I greedily devour all the fabrications, myths, contradictions, and mortal games of the great Julio Cortázar.”What I love the most in his work is sense of total freedom in both what he does and how he does it. And this sense of free fall is so contagious. He, by himself used to quote Horacio Quiroga:""Write as though your tale is interesting only for the small number of your characters, the one of them is yourself.""And he did it. At least he did it in all the books I've read by him. This one is wonderful.62Now about this story. The conception of it is outlined in the chapter 62 of Hopscotch where the character Morelli is contemplating a book he would write going beyond usual psychology and the characters. The book which would show how we are affected by something beyond individual inclinations. I do not have the English version of that chapter at hand now. But it contains the key to this book, if one needs the one. So the title comes from there. But I insist one does not need to read Hopscotch to read this one. Apart from this link, they are not related. And this one might be even better without a key.Here is what Cortazar later was saying about ""62"":“I’d like to write in such a way that my writing would be full of life in the deepest sense, full of action and meaning, but a life, action, and meaning that would no longer rely exclusively on the interaction of individuals, but rather on a sort of superaction involving the ‘figures’ formed by a constellation of characters. I realize it isn’t easy at all to explain this.“I feel daily I’m less of an egoist and more aware of the constant interactions taking place between other things or beings and myself. I have an impression that all that moves on a plane responding to other laws, other structures that lie outside the world of individuality. I would like the book to show how these figures constitute a sort of break with, or denial of, individual reality, sometimes completely unknown to the characters themselves. One of the many problems with this scheme, a problem already hinted at in Hopscotch, is to know up to what point a character can serve a purpose that is fulfilling itself outside of him, without being the least aware of it, without his realizing that he is one of the links in that superaction or superstructure?” But when i was reading the novel, I did not know about these quotes. And, I am pretty sure I did not need to. So what do I think about the book?I will borrow Borges this time around: “It is impossible to convey the plot of his (Cortazar’s) novellas: in each of them all the words are placed exactly where they should be. Trying to summarise or retell this you will get convinced that you’ve missed the most important thing again.""So i won’t even try to do it. Though there is a game in there that the author builds for the reader to play and follow. This is the text without the beginning or the end. If there is shape to describe it, it would be a circle. The time does not flow, it exist there. This is about lovers and the impossibility of their love; about dreamers and impossibility of their dreams. About the power of friendship and art, how it shapes what we believe in. This is about cities and the one city they all go to search for each other but never to find. And all of it is unashamedly romantic but not sentimental. This is about the lack of understanding, but whatever minimal is there to be treasured. This is also about this feeling that the moment you got hold of something it slips away.   Kant says there is stuff we inherently cannot know, but we would always thrive to find it out even realising that we cannot. Many novelists and philosophers talk about the existence of this border. There is no border it seems for the characters here as there is no border between the first and the third person for Cortazar in telling this story. This story can be read in many different ways. But i think if you really want to get inside of it, you need to read it once and then start again from the beginning. It is like moving away from a canvas after examining small details and then seeing the whole.But no efforts are required to admire a sheer poetry of this and to be totally taken over:“Entro de noche a mi ciudad, yo bajo a mi ciudad donde me esperan o me duelen, donde tengo que huir de alguna abominable cita, de lo que ya no tiene nombre, una cita con dedos, con pedazos de carne en un armario, con una ducha que no encuentro, en mi ciudad hay duchas, hay un canal que corta por el medio mi ciudad y navíos enormes sin mástiles pasan en un silencio intolerable hacia un destino que conozco pero que olvido al regresar, hacia un destino que niega mi ciudad donde nadie se embarca, donde se está para quedarseaunque los barcos pasen y desde el liso puente alguno esté mirando mi ciudad.""I enter my city at night, I go down to my citywhere they wait or hurt me, where I have to fleeof some abominable appointment, of what no longer has a name,a date with fingers, with pieces of flash in a closet,with a shower that I can't find, in my city there are showers,there is a canal that cuts my city in the middleand huge ship without masts pass in intolerable silencetowards a destination that I know but that I forget when I return,towards a destiny that denies my citywhere no one embarks, where one is to stayAlthough the ships pass and from the smooth bridge someone is looking at my city. [image]and you will have to walk to the end of the train because somewhere you have to find yourself,without knowing who, the appointment was with someone who is unknown and has lost the suitcasesand you, from time to time, are also at the station but your trainit's another train, your dog is another dog, we won't meet, my love,I will lose you again on the tram or on the train, in my underwear I will runThrough crowded people and sleeping in compartments where a violet lightblind the dusty cloths, the curtains that hide my city.

I am not even sure wherReading this, I remembered a line long time forgotten, but the line that has helped me to go through a lot when I was younger. I am not even sure where it is taken from. It might be from “King Lear” or it might be from ""Mary Stuart"" by Schiller. I cannot find it through the search as I know it only in Russian. But it is something like that:  “Here, they might treat me indignantly but they will never manage to deprive me of my dignity.” In those days, I called up this phrase when faced with a potential humiliation or something more sinister. And it has always helped me through. It is probably something similar to Michel Obama’s “When they go low we go high.” But more personal than that.  And this book is about this. It is about dignity in the most difficult and tragic of circumstances. It is about sticking with it when everything else is lost. It is about not giving up.  It is an epic. It is a book about war. And like other good books about war it contains a lot of violence but a lot of observations on the human nature as well. Unlike the majority of books about war, it deals with the role women play when they fight shoulder to shoulder with men.  Strangely, there are not many books dealing with this. I can only recall the oral history The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II by Svetlana Alexievich. There, the women who survived were given the voice to tell how it was to be a soldier in a predominantly male affair. Both books show that if you are a woman your war often does not end at the battle. You still have to stay alert to violation and cruelty even surrounded by the men of your own side.  Here, the action takes place in Ethiopia when the fascist Italy invaded its territory in 1935. The Emperor has escaped to England. But many people he left behind put on a proper fight against much better equipped and numerous invaders. I did not know much about this particular conflict or the country. But the themes the author touches upon are timeless and universal. And she manages to convey them without loosing the sense of place.  This is a narrative which is relatively hard to get into. It is somewhat disorientating as it structured in unusual way. It builds around a number of photos, many of them taken by the one of the characters, Italian soldier, Ettore. On the request of his superior, who is a properly cruel man, he documents the doings of the occupiers including the atrocities . A photo carefully described would be a starting point which then would let us dive into an epic scene or a stream of memories. There are no physical images in the book.  I’ve seen the similar trick in a very different text, wonderful book by Marina Stepanova In Memory of Memory which is currently being translated to be published next year. There, initially I was not sure it worked. With our culture dominated by the visuals and all “show not tell” business, describing photos without presenting them seemed indulgent. But I’ve slowly come around to this. I can see now why. It ignites the imagination of the reader and leaves more space to form her own view. It has worked even better here for me. But it requires the perseverance. In my case i think I was greatly rewarded.  The style feels slightly detached as if from the point of view of a camera or an external observer. The writing is in present tense and builds up slowly. It is very effective when dealing with a dramatic scene be it a battle, execution or other cruel episode.  It has got this cinematic quality of slowing dramatic actions and lets us be present inside the characters’ heads, focus on the details in real time without loosing the sense of drama. This simultaneous feeling of detachment and closeness is not unlike I would imagine a person would feel under such extreme duress when the time slows to standstill and one feels separate from the body as if being faraway, not thinking, not taking it all in, observing oneself externally in order to survive. Sometimes I wished she would switch the gear a bit in terms of pace to differentiate between those epic scenes and more intimate parts or backstories. But it was not the case. It might make the reading easier, but still in my view it worked as it was. We have a camera gaze within the story of course. But it is a very different one. Ettore’s camera is the weapon.  Maybe it is not quite a rifle, but one can violate a fellow human being with it just as well leaving scars on a soul impossible to heal. It also establishes a peculiar relationship between the victim and perpetrator - a weird sense of intimacy seen through the lens.  Another interesting element of how this story is told is the chorus. These are vignettes performed by the collective voice like in a Greek tragedy. Last time I’ve met with the chorus was in Faust where they were contributing to Faust meeting with the Helen of Troy. It seems Mengiste wanted to highlight this echo of similarity of female fates through the wars and the centuries.  The book is very powerful in showing the interactions between the enemies. The Ethiopians fight for their land. The Italians try to break their spirit, not that much through the military actions but through dehumanising them. They are doing some monstrous acts. But Mengiste does not avoid complexity. They are depicted as fallible human beings. Some of them are afraid, some repent, some fall the victims of other crimes at the end. Collectively they fail. Ethiopians faith is stronger. However, their thirst for revenge and the force of their hate still leave the space for occasional acts of mercy, but never for forgiveness, even after many years. “Here is the truth he wants to ignore: that what is forged into memory tucks itself into bone and muscle. It will always be there and it will follow us to the grave. “This raises another question which resurfaces quite often in the recent debates. Can we forgive without forgetting? And if not, what specifically we should try to remember from out past and to teach out children? Can we remember the victims but let the perpetrators disappear in a memory lane? There is no definite answer. In this novel, Mengiste nods to Daša Drndić while her character closer to the end of the book recites the names of the people perished in the conflict. I found it very poignant. It is a serious novel. It is not always easy to read. Not everything worked for me. But it is a proper powerful work of fiction which has moved me and has created a lasting impression. The author takes the risks with this structure. She goes against the grail of how the story should be told, especially in the English speaking world. And this has to be applauded and rewarded. ...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Sep 18, 2020","Sep 21, 2020","Sep 18, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43726511-the-shadow-king

This was quite a pleasant part. Guile Tononi is a neuroscientist and the founder ofI continue my voyage into the different theories of consciousness. This was quite a pleasant part. Guile Tononi is a neuroscientist and the founder of the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness (IIT), the one of the most advanced modern hypotheses about the nature of it. But this book is much more playful than I expected it to be. In fact, it is hard to believe it is written by a scientist. It resembles more a kind of fiction with the hint of post-modern. Evidently it is modelled on Dante’s The Divine Comedy. Here, we do not have Dante - Galileo replaces him instead. The book has structured into three parts like the Comedy. The first part “Evidence: Experiments of nature”. Here, Galileo is lead by Frick (in real life Francis Crick, the Nobel Prize Winner for DNA discovery, but successful neuroscientist in the later life). In this part they they meet different people including famous scientists, artists and writers who happen to be in various conscious and unconscious states. Loosely, this part is focused on the different neurological phenomena related to subjective experiences. For example, the one chapter is talking about two blind painters, the one so-called retinal and another - cortical. They are based on Gian Paolo Lomazzo and Solonisba Anguissola of 16th century. Lomazzo became blind early due to methanol poisoning and become famous theoretician of painting. Sononisba in contrast has become blind in the age of 96. Here, her blindness is presented as cortical (the rare condition when the patient does not know that she is blind). “They may fall over the objects, do not recognise relatives, and instead describe people and objects which are not there at all.” This is just one chapter. But there are 11 chapters in this part covering many other matters. By the way, this book is lavishly illustrated with paintings by different artists from Bruegel and Titian to less famous but very striking ones like aforementioned Soninisba. Each chapter tells a little story through a dialogue between Galileo, Frick and the others. There are a lot of pictures as well. Then, it is followed by the set of slightly more technical notes. But again, not too technical.The next part is called “Theory: Experiments of thought”. Here, Galileo is accompanied by someone called Alturi, which is obviously stands for Allan Turing. The structure is the same: 11 chapters of travelling around and meeting different historical figures, illustrations and the notes. But the discussion is focused on information theory and its connection with the ITT. We meet Shannon, Decartes, Spinoza, Leibniz and many others. It is the place were Tononi touches upon his theory (ITT). Namely, what he imagines consciousness is, or more accurately how it arises. He does not attempt to fully explain so called “hard problem of consciousness” - how the physical brain produces mental subjective experience. But he is trying to explain what this experience (or more accurately a huge set of different experiences) comes down to. In his view, the consciousness arrises where there is a system with a relatively big number of states (our individual experiences in this case) and where the states are well integrated with each other. I do not want anyone loosing me on this. So i give the word to Galileo: “And then it dawned on Galileo. Perhaps the essential difference between the photodiode and himself was this—every time he, Galileo, had a vivid experience, even the simplest one, such as pure darkness, his brain was not merely distinguishing one possibility from another, his brain was not just telling dark from light (though Alturi had set him up like that). No, his brain and its complicated mechanisms were distinguishing between pure darkness and countless other situations, which would have led to trillions of different experiences. Because to Galileo, dark was not just different from light, it also meant it was not red, or blue, or any color in the rainbow, any face, any place, any sound and smell and flavor, any feeling and any thought, and any of their combinations. But to the photodiode, dark must have meant much less. With its simple mechanism, the photodiode had no way of knowing that dark was not a color, not a face and not a place, not a sound or smell or flavor, not a feeling and not a thought—to a photodiode, dark was not dark, but merely one out of two. To a photodiode, the whole universe merely was: this or not this. Maybe the essential difference between the photodiode and himself, indeed, was information. So Galileo came to a simple thought: perhaps it was due to the immense repertoire of alternatives that his brain could distinguish that he was conscious and the photodiode not, or infinitely less so. Consciousness makes up in number for what it lacks in weight, he thought.”So, according to this view, consciousness arises due to the differences between many individual states. It reminded me the linguistics theory by Ferdinand de Saussure, the founder of semiotics, who claimed the meaning arises due to the difference between the words... In any case, Tononi claims this phenomena of consciousness then can be measured mathematically: “Integrated information measures how much can be distinguished by the whole above and beyond its parts, and Φ is its symbol. A complex is where Φ reaches its maximum, and therein lives one consciousness—a single entity of experience.”There is no formula in the book. This part looks quite technical in my summary. But it does not in the book. Tononi, Galileo and Alturi manage to balance the accessibility with the theory through all these examples, illustrations and cameo appearances. And it is quite entertaining in its own way.The third and the final part is “Implications: The Universe of Consciousness.” It explains what implications this theory, if true, would have for our creativity, beliefs and some philosophical or theological questions. We meet Proust, Borges, Freud and many others. I do not think i’ve presented the book very well, but it was a delight to read. Having seen the recent inclusion of Love and Other Thought Experiments into the Booker longlist, I was thinking that this book has definitely deserved a nomination as well. I am not very serious about it actually and the book is a few years old. But it could definitely compete for the prize even on the ground of a literary merit. I would recommend it to my friends who are interested in the topic, but more literary inclined. At least you would meet a lot of familiar faces and appreciate Tononi’s taste in the selection of paintings. But you might learn a few things about the neuroscience on the way as well without too much effort as I did.

Intellectually satisfying and wide in scope. I really enjoyed it.A longer take:“A novel of multiple layers, novels that could be read the passage of time on the surface of rocks”. I discovered Carlos Fonseca and this particular book when the one of my good GR friends from the US sent me a link to the article in LARB, the interview with the author. My friend and I share a mutual affection for Ricardo Piglia. And it seems Fonseca considers himself as his disciple. When I started to read the article, I’ve realised that Fonseca has got a new novel out. In that novel, he attempts a new way of writing historical fiction. The novel is not supposed to be linear, chronological or even deeply psychological. He wants to attempt something more ambitious: a novel which combines many time scales, including the one of natural history. Also this novel would build upon the concept of archive - snippets of information and the artefacts not necessary united by the chronology, but more by the common vision. “Natural history” is an attempt of such a novel.The one character in it “said that for years he’d been planning a novel about the history of fire: a novel where fire was the true protagonist, a novel that would start with the chemical equation of combustion and then spread over all the continents and all the ages, a novel that would cross history like a field in flames.”How beautiful this sounds. Carlos is not quite there yet. Though fire plays a big role in his book. This novel is constructed from three layers intermingled with each other - the history of a family on a wider canvas from the second part of the 20th century, predominantly on the American continent. But then he dives deeper: “This story is written at the speed of underground currents, written on the rocks and the bark of trees. It is a history of gradual destruction that finally rises to the surface.” This last “story” is omnipresent in the text it affects everything which takes place in the novel, but does so in a very subtle way. Also this structure represents only one dimension. Another dimension is five parts focused on different ideas and story lines connected to each other as Russian doll: ( ( I ) ). The novel is an ambitious beast. I understand at the same time Carlos was working on a academic book: The Literature of Catastrophe: Nature, Disaster and Revolution in Latin America So, i am not sure whether the book was a by-product of a novel or, more likely - the opposite. But this is more or less what the novel is about as well- natural forces, their connection with human fate, politics and art.It is evident that novel belongs to Latin American tradition. It is populated by numerous characters, many of them are totally fictional, the others are real people. Many characters are poets, artists, or other creative types, many of them are slightly unhinged, obsessive or insomniacs surviving with the help of coffee or stronger substances. The main thing they do is thinking and talking to each other what matters to them. They also do conceptual art, go on trial for that and participate in its defence; and, in one part, some of them are led through the jungle to join an anarchist colony. Those who seek a strong “coherent” plot or psychological character studies might be disappointed. The prose is beautiful, but quit dense. I needed to read slowly. And sometimes, he misfires with metaphors. But this is the proper solid novel of ideas. It is an experience, the one of those books which I enjoy thinking about when I’ve finished reading it. Instead of ending it gives rise to many new beginnings into the areas I was not consciously aware exist.There are so many threads in this book that it is like a tangle. Initially i thought of listing all the ones I’ve noticed. But i decided against it. Anyone could pull out a different thread to play with. I do not want to spoil this process for people who are going to read it. So i’ve just pulled out one thread which got me thinking. Creative identityThere is a character in the novel, or should i say a real person B. Traven. He certainly existed. He is even present on this site. Though even here he is very illusive as I cannot post the link to his profile through the usual search function. He also was the character of Bolano’s 2666. But no-one actually knows who he really was, even his real name. The main thing he wrote books. And some of them were apparently good. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre was made into a movie. This B Traven said: “The creative person should have no other biography than his works”. It made me think how far we’ve moved from this in a contemporary literary world. The big part of any book’s publicity or even simple  is the identity of the author. Many people want to know how much of the events in a book are related to the author’s personal life. Many people are more interested in the identity of the author than the book itself. Lots of ing and even sales is determined by the identity of the author rather than the quality of the text. Probably there are reasons why it is like that. But is it the best way of reading a book? I wish it would be some mechanism to boost a bit of anonymity in the process of reading. But i am not sure my view would be the popular one.Coming back to the novel, Carlos does not make this point in a way I did. His mentioning of B Tavern and the art of disappearing identity just set my thinking. He also brings up the conceptual poet Kenneth Goldsmith who believes now is the time of “uncreative writing”. “A hallmark of uncreative writing is the irrelevance of inescapable identity, since the Internet allows a person to hide behind a multiplicity of names and profiles.” (from the article in New Yorker the link below). So Kenneth copies and compiles the texts from different sources without adding any of his own words. This is another extreme of this spectrum. He ones retyped the whole of New York Times for a day and made it as a book.Another character in the novel says: “Of all the objects of desire, the most seductive and fearsome is one’s own identity.” And it precisely describes our time. But is it for good? There is a woman in the novel who is put on trial for warping the borders of reality through posting what we would call now “fake” news in the press in the 1970s. Her “news” helped a few dubious corporations to lose their earnings. So was she the force for good? That is another thing to ponder. But “according to her, contemporary society ran the risk of catastrophically repeating the ancient myth of Babel, the dissemination of the divine language into millions of private ones, specialized and incomprehensible. Art was the route of possible return to unified language and a real political community.”I hope we would overcome this risk and would not make ourselves mutually incomprehensible due to misunderstandings with our private languages and desire to identify instead of to be.And it is just the one thread I’ve pulled and expended. The novel is truly rich food for thought. It is not ideal. More than anything else it reminded me Roberto Bolano’s 2666. But it does not quite reach the level of poetry and lyrical restlessness of that book. However, it is just Carlos’s second novel. And I really hope he writes the third one pretty quickly. My admiration also goes to Megan McDowell who translated it into English - brilliant job.

More than light, darkness. More than the ground, the underground."" ""Modern art is nothing more than the art history. The modern work is only the construction of the frame for which an object becomes comprehensible to the public as art.""""A luminous intuition tells him that the novels of the future will be something like this: illustrated almanacs, enormous catalogs, curiosity cabinets on which the authors, mere copyists, write commentaries."" ""No longer the event itself, but rather the images the media produced of the event."" Politics. ""Learn that defeat unleashed fanaticism.""""Power is expressed only in the capacity for destruction. One should think of destruction itself as a political category. Aesthetic as well. The creator creates by destroying. The politician creates a new world among the ruins. One should think of that initial relationship between art and politics, that initial violence that erupts as soon as the painter decides to mark the canvas with the first brushstroke. Think of the violence of the first line, the first stroke, the first verse. An initial violence that does not spill blood but rather opens spaces. A new world emerging from the flames like the Greeks imagined, a new world that comes from a violence full of mercy and passion like the gods imagined. One must think of that act of destruction as the very basis of all possible politics, as the very possibility of making the foundations tremble. To write a natural history of destruction as if it were a treatise on aesthetics."" Brancusi""In 1926, the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi had sent his piece Bird in Space from Paris to New York for an exhibition of his work that was to take place at the Brummer gallery. New York customs had detained the piece, arguing that, as it didn’t resemble the bird its title suggested, it didn’t qualify as art and fell under the category of useful objects, on which there was a 40 percent import tax. Brancusi, furious and unable to understand how his piece had ended up classified alongside kitchen utensils, decided to take up the matter in court. Agins proceeded to explore the figure of the art critic as defense witness, analyzing how critics of great renown were called to demonstrate that the thing was, without a doubt, art. Through Agins’s argument and the New York courtroom passed Edward Steichen, who would later become director of the MoMA photography section; Jacob Epstein, a renowned British sculptor; and even William Henry Fox, director of the Brooklyn Museum. But for Agins, the central critic was Frank Crowninshield. When questioned about how exactly the thing the jury saw before them was similar to a bird, he dared to say: “It has the suggestion of flight, it suggests grace, aspiration, vigor, coupled with speed in the spirit of strength, potency, beauty, just as a bird does. But just the name, the title of this work, why, really, it does not mean much.” According to Agins, with that relaxed declaration Crowninshield had shaken off thousands of years of art history and established a new relationship between art and law.""...more",Notes are private!,7,48,1,"Aug 26, 2020","Aug 28, 2020","Aug 26, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51542633-natural-history

But nowadays, many stories are just told to preach or express a single point of view. This book is different and it does not shout. And it is emotionally moving as well. Inevitably, at the end it moves gears to a bit of melodrama. It could probably do without it in my view.

He also talks a bit about the potential role of the unconscious. He is vivid supporter of the Integrated Information Theory (IIT). But ITT does not take much space in this book.

Before moving to consciousness, he was involved in the development of so-called body schMichael Graziano is a neuroscientist at Princeton university. Before moving to consciousness, he was involved in the development of so-called body schema. Body schema is a simulation model the brain uses to predict and control body movements. The idea of body schema is well known and widely used in engineering, for example in development of driverless cars and many other things. His theory of consciousness is the logical extension of this idea. I do not know much about neuroscience. But i am the targeted audience for this book as it is written for a general public. After reading it, I am bit sceptical of this theory. It might be me, or problem with the theory, or simply the way how this book is written. In one sentence, I think it seems a bit premature to write a book for general audience based upon the amount of unknowns in the theory. The theory is based on two fundamental assumptions:1) our brain is an information-processing machine. Only thing it does is computation. This word is not specifically defined in the text. But if we use Alan Turing’s definition, then the power assigned to the brain seems to be somewhat limited. 2) “It take a statement of fundamental logic that an information processing machine cannot make a claim it cannot output information unless it contains the information that it is claiming.”  I was not sure totally what it meant as it could be interpreted very reductively and vice versa. He explained a bit more: “We cannot just hope adding complexity would make machine claim it consciousness.”  Well. Many theories actually count that yes we can hope exactly that. And the emergent properties of a system is well established concept. There is for example Integrated Information Theory (ITT). But those are two main assumptions he starts with as I understood. Again, they are not mentioned at the beginning but spread around and repeated in the text. Anyway, if we assume these things, then his theory would be that consciousness is a simulation or a “cartoon” our brain plays for us to be able to control our attention. Attention is the electrical process of inhibition and passing through the signals in the brain. We do not need to know all of this while getting attracted to something, so instead we have a simulation played by our brain. This simulation is called attention schema internal model. Again the word “model” is not defined in this context. But my understanding is that brain plays this model of itself and that what makes us experience anything subjectively. Confused? I am not surprised. I could then speculate that this model would give rise to a similar model within it which would give rise to a similar modern again recursively etc etc.. Ok, I know. I am just not clever enough to avoid the irony.And Graziano does not help that much. I parsed a few passages from his book to show what I mean. Here what he says:“Now, finally, we reach the central proposal of the theory. My colleagues and I propose that the cortical attention schema has a particular form. The information within it provides a cartoonish account of how the highest levels of cortical attention take possession of items. There is no simple, physical, roving eyeball, as in the case of overt attention. Instead, that cartoonish account describes an essence that has no specific physical substance but that has a location vaguely inside you, that can take temporary possession of items—of apples and sounds and thoughts and memories—and that restlessly moves about, searching, seizing some items and dropping others. When that ethereal mental essence takes hold of an item, it has the property of making the item clear to you, real to you, vividly present—in other words, it turns the item into an experience. It also has powerful consequences. It enables you to understand the item, to respond to it, to talk about it, or to remember it so that you can choose to act on it later. It empowers you to react. That amorphous power inside you is a fictionalized, detail-poor account of cortical attention.” So “etherial mental essence” then? What is the difference between this and the classical dualism?And one more lengthy passage in which he summarises his theory in 5 points: “The attention schema theory of consciousness has some inevitability to its logic. First, we know that the cortex uses covert attention. Second, we know that it needs to control that attention. Third, we know that the brain must have an internal model of attention in order to control that attention.” - how do we know this and why? For me it is not obvious that it should be some model. And if yes, in which form this model is presented in the brain? It is not even obvious what part of the attention needs to become conscious. I have not found the answers.Fourth, we know that a detailed, fully accurate internal model is at best wasteful and at worst harmful to the process, and so, this internal model of attention would necessarily leave out the mechanistic details. Therefore, and fifth, an attention schema would depict the self as containing an amorphous, nonphysical, internal power, an ability to know, to experience, and to respond, a roving mental focus—the essence of covert attention without the underpinning details. How that “therefore bit follows”? It does not for me. If we are machines we do not need nonphysical, amorphous stories of self. Is it not “wasteful at best and harmful at worst” as well? All of this seems to be redundant and not efficient.“From first principles, if you had to build a well-functioning brain that had a powerful, cortical style of covert attention, you would build a machine that, drawing on the information constructed within it, would assert that it has a nonphysical consciousness. That cortical machine, of course, would not know that its subjective conscious experience is a construct or a simplification. It would take the nonphysical nature of conscious experience as a reality, because—somewhat tautologically—the brain knows only what it knows. It is captive to its own information.” - well, it might logically follow, but i am sorry for our brains who keep captive themselves. In his defence, I would tell that he has identified two useful features of the consciousness: 1) better internal control of the attention; 2) social aspect in understanding other conscious beings. But these two features I would argue are sufficiently independent from his specific “internal schema” theory and would apply to any other theories with the same level of success.It would be jolly good if the place of this schema-model inside of the brain would be identified by science. Then I would share the celebration. But solar, this is only hypotheses. He mentions some specific places, but it has not been confirmed as far as I understood. Another way of testing is of course is to build a similar artificial machine. After some pondering about Turing test, Graziano finally suggest this as the most objective testing. But here, it seems, anything vaguely resembling some level of real life complexity is far away. He acknowledged for example, that we do not know much about emotions to model them sensibly in silicon. The most useful bit of the book was actually the Appendix where he has shown how he would design a primitive machine with only visual awareness. I would recommend to read this bit first and see whether you would be interested to read the whole book after that. I certainly would not. His machine includes three parts: visual recognition representing an object. He likes an apple; the module representing the knowledge about the machine (I understand it is a sort of ‘self-awareness” bit). And the third which is his schema which would relate the first two to each other. But this third one for whatever reason would make the machine think in metaphysical terms. It would do so because it would be loaded with the related input. One thing i struggle with why would this be a subjective experience in a way we understand it. And why i would want to tell a machine something metaphysical if i could use one relational verb to program a connection. But alas, the machine is just a design even like that. So too early to ask probably.As a bonus, we are treated to a whole lengthy chapter about the possibility, not very remote for the immortality by coping the brains into something more lasting than a body and creating a virtual reality for those brains. He says 50 years and some of his pals say within a decade. Well, it was jolly interesting. But it was not related to the topic I was reading the book for.In general, I’ve learned a thing or two about neuroscience, but his theory seem to be not too different from pure illusionism or so called Global Workspace Theory. The last one is much better established. He recognises it. And he did not convinced me that he adds something substantial at this stage. I hope he would come up with the successful testing program and then we will see....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Aug 19, 2020","Aug 20, 2020","Aug 19, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43726566-rethinking-consciousness

The closest equivalent to this collection in English is this Death in Venice and Other Tales. Unsurprisingly, they contain the seeds of his novels Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family and The Magic Mountain. I was enchanted and fascinated in equal measure by the way how he strives and succeeds in creating the object of art from the sketches of human condition. Even in translation, I could see how he was thinking over every single word he was using. Even when seemingly not related, many of these stories in some way contemplate about the role of the art and its creator, the power of creative impulse over an individual and the spell the real art is capable of casting over us.What is unique to Mann how he can combine very dark and ambiguous themes with the sense of humour. The comic in his stories appear suddenly like a glimpse when you would hardly expect it. It varies so much from gentle humour to the darkest irony and grotesque. And many of his characters manage to combine the moment of tragedy or closeness to the divine with being pathetic and awkward at the same time. How the one could be both sinister and pathetic? Mann shows it.Another aspect which kept me fascinated is how he starts from reality; many of his characters are drawn from life, many of his initial motives are autobiographical. But, and this is the proper genius, at the end these characters and stories have nothing to do with the reality or autobiography. They grow at the page into something totally different, totally unrelated and leading their own existence. There is nothing realistic in his fiction apart from the backdrop. I felt similar with Henry James’s Ambassadors. But there, i could see that he has created the characters from scratch. Here though, Mann starts from something he has noticed or experienced. But then converts it, puts it upside down or drives it to absurd power, and in the process he creates something that never existed, and doubtfully even could exist in real life. And this is the art.And the music. The music plays an important role in many of these stories. Mann has a very rare ability to incorporate it so it is an organic part of the story. It is totally as if one can live through it. There are around three dozen stories. I thought all of them were strong and quite different from each other. I comment on a few.Wardrobe is the very short one, just a few pages. But it does not let you to settle when it delivers a turn and grows into something different and totally unexpected.Little Lizy - this is more typical Mann’s story: love triangle without love taken into tragic and grotesque end with the help of the music.Tristan - one can see the seeds of the Magic Mountain in this one. It is based upon contradiction between the healthy, life-loving but a bit basic Bürger and gloomy consumptive and art loving writer. Those two worlds collide through their relationship with a single woman. It is set in a sanatorium. The soundtrack is “Tristan and Isolde” by Wagner.The Blood of the Walsungs (1905) – a weird story of twins, named after the characters in Die Walkure. They see the opera one night at the theatre; and their affection for each other is going overboard. The complication is the girl twin is about to get married. Another part of it that they are the members of a very powerful rich Jewish family who are assimilated into German bourgeoisie. This story caused a big scandal due to easy parallel with the family of Mann’s wife whom he married a year before. It was stopped from the publication then. Also there are elements which clearly could be considered now as antisemitic tropes. I was ambivalent about the plot. For me it was like the ones of those black and white paintings by Goya. Also it made me think how much of that deep zeitgeist is still present in the modern society even if masked much better in some cases. But again, like in “Death in Venice”, it is the case when Mann took some biographical motive and drove it so much farther into the mythical territory well beyond morality into uncontrolled and undignified passions.Tonio Kröger - wonderful complex novella. Can the art be based on life? Should the artist wean himself from the simple and ordinary or even banal if he wants to create something unique? Can this banal be an integral part of him and does it inhibit his art or vice versa?“If he was asked what in the world he wanted to be, he would supply different answers, for he was in the habit of saying—and had already written—that he bore within himself the possibilities of a thousand different ways of life, together with the secret awareness that they were all impossibilities.”The essence of life cannot be expressed better. But after Kundera in his The Art of the Novel, I’ve started to value exactly this in fiction - the ability to depict many possibilities lived at the same time without facing the reality of the impossibilities. So the writer could keep supplying those ""different answers"" without the necessity to chose only one.And “Death in Venice” of course. So much has been written about this one that i decided just to add my impression in images.

The author is a professional philosopher and a big supporter of panpsychism. Obscured by materialism for the last 100 years, this view is currently becoming more and more fashionable. And as the author puts it, now represents a considerable minority. The book is very accessible, starts from zero knowledge of the problem and leads the reader through 3 main views on the nature of consciousness. The author is good storyteller and competent in explaining the philosophy behind and the main pro and con arguments for each of the main views. All famous buzz words like qualia and ""hard problem of consciousness"" are explained. The main thought and lab experiments also are talked through (how a bat feels like; zombies, black and white Mary, Chinese room etc.). Integrated Information Theory (ITT) is touched upon as well. Three main views are:-dualism - the brain is material and follows the law of physics; the mind is not material and they communicate somehow;-materialism - brain material, consciousness is an illusion the brain tricks us all into; or it is there in the brain physical properties we just need to find it.- panpsychism - the doctrine or belief that everything material, however small, has an element of individual consciousness. And, this kinds of builds up to the level of integrated human brain.The author is trying to show that panpsychism is at least as good as the other two and better from his perspective. He does it in an entertaining, but informative manner. The last chapter is more or less like a manifesto and sometimes get a tad more speculative that the rest of the book. But it did not disturb me.I would really recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the problem of consciousness and wants to understand what is fuzz about.

I am very interested in all aspects of India and its culture. So i was very happy to see the author with South Asian heritage and the story set in India in the list. Overall, my initial impression of this year's list was more positive than the usual as I did not know more than a half of the names there. I've made a list of the books I was interested in. Since then, my enthusiasm has cooled down somewhat as I realised that quite a few of these books were the type of confessional writing often based on the author's life. I do not mind it general, but after reading Real Life, i think i have enough for a while of the the sub-genre. This book is confessional as well. It is also hyper-realistic and detailed. But the difference is that Avni has actually created a fictional story and fully developed a fictional character! That seems to be quite an achievement in the recent literary climate. Though the story is fictional, the style is totally modern auto-fiction. Antara, the main character and the voice of the novel is dealing with her past and her mum who seems to be succumbing to the early dementia. The novel set in Puna, India. Antara is an artist. But her childhood was tricky. Her mum has ran to an ashram from her husband and her family taking 3 year old Antara. It has resulted in a childhood trauma for a little girl multiplied by a year in a dreadful catholic convent later. My understanding is her mum has had her quite young as well. All in all, their relationship never was easy. It was in the past, and even in the present it is very competitive, critical and easily moving from love to hate. At present, it is exacerbated by her mum's state. The book jumps backwards and forwards from Antara's childhood to the present moment. There is a supportive cast of characters. But none of them are very strong, in my view. However, Antara's super-frank, unsentimental voice and her reflections, often angry, about herself or her mum have won me over. Her similes sometimes made me wince: occasionally too much physiology for the sake of it (salivas, periods, perspiration being described and more). But the social commentary was interesting. And the ideas were quite profound in a way. It made me think how many of us, daughters, are starting our lives thinking that we will be everything opposite to our mums. But then, somehow notwithstanding, ending up more similar to them than different. I did not think the last few chapters when Antara gave birth to her own daughter added much. It was very clearly inspired by Rachel Cask's Motherhood memories and they were not more insightful or new for that. Also it was one dark twist too many at the end for my liking.

Though I still think that it is the best way to develop critical thinking and to understand the world around. But what I like the most is the beauty and elegance of the intellectual systems some of the philosophers manage to build. I do not particularly care that any of such system would bound to start from somewhere and would have an ambiguity at least. Just some of them are so beautiful in a way how they explain what it is out there and how it is connected to what is inside us.Spinoza with his conscious universe, Leibniz with his monads and now Kant. It is absolutely amazing how daring and powerful a mind should be to reimagine the whole world and make it in a coherent way. I am not surprised that the major discoveries in physics in the early 20th century by Einstein and a big chunk of the quantum physics took place in Germany or by German speaking scientists. I would think they've probably read Kant and the later philosophers who have followed him.As far as this little introduction goes, Scrutton is very good writer. I found his summary of main Kant's ideas was easy to understand. He also provides the context of the problem Kant tried to solve:""First in opposition to Hume to show that syntathic and a priori is possible (the knowledge which are neither the result of external observation nor pure logical deduction), and to offer example for it. Secondly, in opposition to Leibnitz to demonstrate that pure reason alone operating outside the constraint places by experience on it leads only to illusion so that there is no a priori knowledge of things in them selves.""It was an ambitious undertaking, but Kant has done it. Ethics was a part of his solution. So it is described in this book as well. Apart from the main idea so to speak, I've enjoyed the chapter on aesthetics. I've learned the difference between ""beautiful"" and ""sublime"". Not that I needed it, but Kant has formally proved to me why the art is so powerful.I was thinking how to summarise in a few non-technical sentences what Kant's thoughts on what is there and how can we know it. I did not find a good way, as this book is little technical still. So i decided to use the help of Brian Magee:""And so our brains and our nervous system and senses; they represent reality in terms determined by their own nature; and that is all they can ever do; and this constitutes the only experience and the only knowledge we can ever have. If we start from this considerations we can explain what empiricism it terminally unable to explain, namely how it comes about that our knowledge conforms to its subjects. What actually happening is that what appears to us as the objects of our experience are being produced for us by our apparatus. Things themselves are different. One of the most achievements of Kant that he demonstrates that permanently beyond the reach of human knowledge lies a realm of possibility such that provided a statement is not self-contradictory, any assertion about what obtains in this realm is capable of being either true or untrue and we humans have no way of knowing which. It is positively mistaken in believing that there is no reality outside the empirical realm when we know the must be, even if we can have no proper understanding of it.""

I did not expect them to be very crafty, but wanted to read them for the immediacy of our, I suppose, widely and weirdly shared experience. And by ""widely"" I mean more or less the whole planet. Based upon my understanding, she has moved from NY and spent this time in her London place with the family. Unsurprisingly, it is not difficult to identify with her experience. But some of these brief essays are quite poignant in its own right. I liked the first one called ""Peonies"" when she caught herself looking at the new tulips and wanted them to be peonies. What follows is a short meditation of being woman and spend the life writing.Another wonderful set of sketches called ""Screengrabs"". It is devoted to the last hours of their NY life. There is an episode when she walks her dogs and meets an old lady whom she knows from the neiigbourhood. The lady says to her that they all are going to get through this together. And Zadie cannot do much but nod knowing that she is actually leaving. I was touched by this moment and by Zadie's honesty of including it in these essays. It reminded me another book I've listened to recently where the western narrator living in Japan choses to leave for Hong Kong after Fukushima together with many expats. But the locals do not have this choice. She writes as well how hard it was after that to come back and how some people did not feel like welcoming any more. I do not want to make any judgement in both cases. Actually I am not sure why I am retelling this episode even. But it is the bundle of feelings on both sides i can so easily relate to.There is one political essay as well. And if anything else, that would make this collection for me as I cannot agree more with her point of view. She makes the virus a metaphor. She talks about the virus of contempt both the UK and the US. And her conclusions are not very hopeful. I just quote her:This is about the UK. I also would like to stress how potentially spot on she is about so-called ""data-rich"" structures Cummings is vexing lyrical:""...in the form of the Prime Minister’s ‘ideas man’, Dominic, whose most fundamental idea is that the categorical imperative doesn’t exist. Instead there is one rule for men like him, men with ideas, and another for the ‘people’. This is an especially British strain of the virus. Class contempt. Technocratic contempt. Philosopher King contempt. When you catch the British strain you believe the people are there to be ruled. They are to be handled, played, withstood, tolerated – up to a point – ridiculed (behind closed doors), sentimentalized, bowdlerized, nudged, kept under surveillance, directed, used, and closely listened to, but only for the purposes of data collection, through which means you harvest the raw material required to manipulate them further. ""And this is her view on the reaction in the US to BLM. And it is so much what i feel when I see many people suddenly flock to read the books by people of colour. It is very good move. But it should not be done to make one feel better about herself, or to be under illusion that this constitutes any positive performative action:""But I am talking in hypotheticals: the truth is that not enough carriers of this virus have ever been willing to risk the potential loss of any aspect of their social capital to find out what kind of America might lie on the other side of segregation. They are very happy to ‘blackout’ their social media for a day, to read all-black books, and ‘educate’ themselves about black issues – as long as this education does not occur in the form of actual black children attending their actual schools.""...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Jul 30, 2020","Jul 31, 2020","Jul 30, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53491579-intimations

But it was rewritten by the contributors specifically for the publication. Brian Magee was great populariser of the subject in Anglo-Saxon world. And he, together with his guests makes it not only very interesting and profound, but very approachable subject indeed. It would be an ideal starting point for those who has heard all the names but never tried to find out what is all about. I’ve read quite a bit on philosophy before, but even though I enjoyed the lucidity of this book and the clarity of thought. Magee said then: “in English-speaking world philosophy is not part of the mental furniture of most people, even most of those educated at universities. ..Partly this is due to the fact that in the 20th century the subject has become professionalised and technical. Partly it is due to excessive specialisation in all subjects- British education in particular is open to the criticism that it does not carry general education to a high enough level. Partly is due to Anglo-Saxon pride at not being too concerned with abstract ideas. ... Most well Anglo-Saxons are familiar with the names of the great philosophers throughout their adult lives without ever knowing what their fame is rests on, what indeed any of the famous philosophers is famous for. “I think it has changed a little bit in the last 40 years since the book came out. Mainly that some philosophical ideas percolated through literature. It is especially relevant when the science got more advanced - philosophy of mind (consciousness etc) and philosophy of language to some extent. But in general, his observations still hold. So anyone who is interested what it is all about might find this book very eliminating. The book is constructed in the form of 15 dialogues between Brian and the other philosopher. They talk about the one of the greatest names from Plato to Wittgenstein. The guest is normally specialised on the subject. The discussion is lively. This book helped me to understand many ideas I struggled though for a while. For example, Kant’s system is very vividly presented. The difference between Leibniz and Spinoza is clearly explained. And even Wittgenstein and Heidegger seem to be comprehensible. Magee is very keen on Schopenhauer unlike his guest, it seemed. So that part was extremely sparkling. It is amazing to read the book condensing so much wisdom of the West with lucidity but without simplifying too much. I wish someone does something similar now for the whole world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Jul 26, 2020","Jan 06, 2021","Jul 26, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23257.The_Great_Philosophers

That is why I’ve had a mixed experience reading this book. Many of these stories are more real than life which I do not really appreciate in short fiction. There are two high simply taken from the longer novels. Also I was not convinced by the thematic structure. Around 40% of the whole is appeared to be devoted to disasters. Out of those, the two long ones are more or less straight survivors accounts. On the positive side, around 6-7 stories did stand out for me. The majority of them were by women. I might expend on this when I have more time. And I would not advice to read the intro by Murakami until after you finish the book. It is very detailed and might “spoil” some of the stories.

It seems to aspire to be a postmodern playful intellectual novel introducing queer people and people of colour into the genre. It does well with the introduction. But it does not do that well with the post modern bit. The first part was fresh and funny. But then it has started using well versed tropes of a lost manuscripts and lost people, novel within the novel etc. And I did not find It intellectually satisfying. It seemed also to have a playful go on the literary/critical theory. Again, I did not find it funny or profound or clever. It was like a pretentious attempt to expose something the author seems to find pretentious. Or maybe it is just my different sense of humour. The question whether Virginia Wolfe was a racist was raised and I think I can get why, to an extent. But I did not get a feeling it was probed deeply enough. On the tangent, it did not work for me. But my main area of dissatisfaction was a sheer celebration of idleness both in the socialites of the 20- 30s of the last century and now. Notwithstanding with the initial class or identify background, i do not find being a socialite a very profound aspiration.

I felt being dropped right into the middle of ongoing conversation conducted by a set of the voices. A new set would start while the previous one would fade from our ear. Only difference between what I described earlier and this book is that all of these people discuss the common topic. They all talk about “Golden fruits”. You won’t figure out how many characters are there and barely get who they are. Only thing important is what they say. It is a wonderfully disorienting way of writing that sucks you in and does not let you drop off the bus so to speak. “Golden fruits” they talk about is a book. The title is unavoidably symbolic. It might be a kind of book which appears soft and pleasant. But when one starts reading it he might “cut his teeth” over the hardness of a metal. Never mind it is gold. In the novel Sarraute examines a new book as a phenomena. More strictly how a book moves from total obscurity to a sudden hype. How this situation shapes the prevailing opinions. How many people react on the utterances of the perceived authorities and how difficult to be in decent. Sarraute also made me think why it is so often at some stage the discussion about a book moves into discussion of the personal life of the author. She is so effective in showing that the real life of the book could only start when the hype is over. Wonderful gentle satire, very relevant and intelligently metafictional. The fact that I read the book called “Golden fruits” more that 60 years since it has first appeared has proved her point. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jul 08, 2020","Jul 17, 2020","Jul 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/769722.The_Golden_Fruits

We try to make all of our material cohere into a single good story. And that story is our autobiography. The chief fictional character . . . of that autobiography is one’s self’ (Dan Dennett). Moreover, to have a good life we should be like that: A person ‘creates his identity [only] by forming an autobiographical narrative – a story of his life’, and must be in possession of a full and ‘explicit narrative [of his life] to develop fully as a person’ (Marya Schechtman)I’ve taken these examples from the article by Galen Strawson “Against the narrativity”. He claims that the prevailing view in the modern academia, and in the broader society as well (I add from myself), is like that: “one may think that all normal non-pathological human beings are naturally narrative and also that narrativity is crucial to a good life”. The above examples support this claim and illustrate what is meant by the “narrative” in this concept. Strawson vehemently argues against this view. He believes there are two types of selfs. There are ones who really consider their past, present and future as a continuous narrative. But the others do see it that way. Their selves are more episodic and they do not need to connect their life into one coherent story. Strawson considers himself as one of the latter. It does not mean that the past does not exist for such people. Arguably, their past is more “genuinely alive”. Strawson brings up Rilke’s remarks on poetry and memory,  ‘For the sake of a single poem, you must have . . . many . . . memories. . . . And yet it is not enough to have memories. . . . For the memories themselves are not important.’ They give rise to a good poem ‘only when they have changed into our very blood, into glance and gesture, and are nameless, no longer to be distinguished from ourselves.”I brought up here Strawson and Rilke because I think Sarraute would totally agree with them. I think she might be one of these “episodic” people like Strawson. And I strongly suspect I am the one as well. I absolutely do not see my life as a single narrative in any sense, even in the chronological one, well that is apart from the unfortunate biological aspect. Therefore, to read “Childhood” was a very relatable experience for me. It brought up my very first memory of looking at a sack of apples and saying the word “an apple”. Or, the next one of looking at the snow coming down and feeling that I am flying towards it… I can continue, but my point is that what is left is just bits which i would not know as important but they just there, and I treasure them.Sarraute flashes out the memories from her childhood like the material for a poem in Rilke’s sense. They are like a separate little shapes which do not need to form a full picture. Instead they are incorporated into something deeper that cannot be seen as a whole, but important for Sarraute’s now nevertheless. 83 years old, she probes whether she still feels the same happiness, anguish or loneliness she felt when she was 11 and younger. At the same time, now it seems simply important for her to collect those little colourful, fragile but prickly pieces together, like in a museum; to move from one to another until the eternity would shut its door on them forever.   [image]This is the view from the Winter palace, St Petersburg. The picture I took the last time I’ve been there 15 years ago. But I have a feeling it is not very different from what young Natasha remembered after she has left the city for the last time aged 8 in 1908. Since then it was Paris for her.With modernism, the novels in the form of the internal monologue or stream of consciousness have become a literary mainstream. “Childhood” takes this one step farther however. It is an internal dialogue: Sarraute talks to herself. The one of voices asks another questions, triggers memories and probes their authenticity. I loved it. I could remember only one another book I’ve read where it has been done successfully. It is A School for Fools written by Sasha Sokolov in the 60s. It is narrated from the perspective of a teenager who might have a personality split but we would not know for sure. In any case, the novel is narrated by two parts of his selves who argue a lot. Nabokov has called the novel ""an enchanting, tragic, and touching work."" But it is already a different book and a different story.PSFor those who wants to read the whole article by Galen Strawson:http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Paper/agains......more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Jul 07, 2020","Jul 08, 2020","Jul 08, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/405452.Enfance

But he is concerned in equal measure by the effectiveness of good deeds imposed on the poor by the educated classes. Here, the situation is opposite while a gifted idealistic young man decides to work with his hands alongside the poor.”The thing we call the position in the society in reality comprised privilege of the capital and education. The poor and uneducated earn their bread by physical labour and I do not see the reason why I need to be an exception. “This attitude sounds amazingly contemporary in the third decade of the 21st century. I would not be surprised if the one of Sally Rooney’s characters, or herself or any left-leaning later millennial would say it. Though I am not sure how many of them would follow this idea to its logical end like the Chekhov’s character has done.  As a result, he is disowned by his father and ostracised by the society in his small town. But his life seems to be meaningful. That is until he falls in love. Another blow to his worldview is meeting with a student-doctor who challenged him:You want to be useful, come out of narrow circle and influence the whole masses. ..A loud energetic sermon is necessary. Why art, music are so lively and strong?”“If you would spent your gift to become a successful artist of scientist would you think that your life would be more productive in all respects?”Doctor also challenged the fairness of equality:”You live in order for an artist and his helper eat from the same table. But it is a kitchen, mundane grey side of life and live solely for this, is it not ugly?”The main character sticks to his guns. However, his life proves to be far from the ideal he has drawn in his mind. So here we have two stories where Chekhov reveals the absence of the ideal answer for the choices the society imposes on us. In the “House with mezzanine”, the artist faces the limitations of his choice. Here, the young man makes the opposite decision with his life but faces the different consequences in a same painful way. As always with Chekhov, any attempt to analyse makes his story sound didactic. And of course it is not. It is not the story about the moral choices as such. It is the story of a broken heart, the sadness and beauty and transience of the moments that to become out lives. ...more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jul 06, 2020","Jul 06, 2020","Jul 06, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/312865.My_Life

His argument is even more relevant now than 10 years ago when this was written. “Wordsworth, James, Eliot and Virginia Woolf all flourished on these shores. We need to go back and try to understand what they were up to as writers, not dismiss them as a reactionaries or misogynists, or adulate them as gay or feminist icons.”And much longer:While student at Oxford in the 50th, Josipovici was recommend the list of aspiring contemporary english writers by his tutor. The list included Anthony Powell and Iris Murdoch. He rushed to the library but ended up really disappointed. These writers did not strike him as deep as Kafka, Mallarme or his favourite Proust. He decided to wait and in 50 years he came back to the list only to find out that nothing has changed in his perceptions. The writers from the list still did not strike any deep emotional chord with him. This time around it set him on the enquiry why it was the case. The result of this enquiry is this book. It consists of two parts. In the first longer part tries to define what is modernism. But if one looks for a clear and generally accepted definition with related historical significance, one would not find it here. Josipovici is trying to understand and to convey to us his sense of what he feels by this term. It is interesting experience as he would consider himself as a modernist writer as well. So he tries to understand it from within.In his view, Modernism is a broad term. It is not bound by some historical chronology. It is more defined by how the creator of this art, in Kierkegaard’s terms, “senses vividly what is lacking and then endeavours to convey a sense of the lack”. It is the art which catches “the now” and avoids illustration of so called reality. The artists realise that they cannot depict ‘the reality”. “What afflicting Mallarme, Kafka and Beckett is the sense that they feel impelled you write this being the only way they know to be true to their own natures, yet at the same time they find that in doing so they are being false to the world - imposing a shape on it and giving it a meaning which it does not have and thus ultimately being false to themselves.”  So their art is born on this conflicting, very narrow and subtle border. Josipovici gives a lot of examples and the passages from ‘Dr Faustus” by Thomas Mann, Kafka, Beckett and Claude Simon, but also from Muriel Sparks and Golding whom he considered only successful English post-war modernists. He also relies on visual art and even music, to some extent to explain his view. But he struggles nevertheless as by definition it is hard to avoid an ambiguity in the explanation. I would try a shortcut to represent what he says:  [image]This is Cezanne's painting “The Large Bathers"" (Les Grandes baigneuses), 1895–1906. It does not attempt to illustrate the real life, it does not attempt to tell the story. Or at least when someone looks at it each time she comes up with a new unique story. There is no single unifying narrative; the figures are disjointed and do not interact. And, it borderlines between the symbols and something that we still might recognise as human condition. According to Josipovici, a modernist writer understands that it is impossible to continue doing what has been done before. So each time she starts from scratch. Each time she discards her previous experience and the tradition and tries to convey something more immediate. In parallel to this essay I was reading Borges. This point reminded me a very short story “Borges and I”. “Years ago I tried to free myself from him and swapped the mythologies of the outskirts to the games with time and infinity, but those games belong to Borges now and I shall have to imagine something new.”  Not surprisingly, Josipovici includes Borges into his Modernism though traditionally he is classified as a post-modern. In the next sentence Borges also has something to add about the condition a writer finds himself in ‘Thus my life is the flight, and I lose everything and everything belongs to oblivion or to him”In my opinion, Josipovici's attempt to define the term is meta-modernist by itself as he does not try to be historical or objective. He is is happy with his feelings, his subjectivity vividly expressed. And, I think this approach results in the reader searching for her own definition. At least in my case, I think intuitively I am really in tune with him. For me modernism in his sense is a text that leaves a lot of space and ambiguity. The text with the possibilities left wide open, multilayered in terms of possible meanings. And the text which makes me work hard as a reader. It is about the style, but not only. It is something opposite to a narrative i follow the sentence after sentence and flip the pages without pausing as it is nicely laid out for me to digest.The second bit is much shorter but more polemic and angry. He explains why, in his opinion, the modernism does not take its deserved place in English artistic landscape nowadays. The landscape which overpopulated and solidly occupied by mainstream storytellers. He is really saddened and dissatisfied with the situation. I was thinking hard what is the best way to write about it. And i decided to extensively quote him on that as he would say it better than I would.He, in his turn, quotes 6 passages 3 from from 50 years ago including Powell and Murdoch and 3 more recent including McEwen, Naupal and Philip Roth. He observes:‘They all do what they set out to do perfectly adequately: they help tell a story and create a world and characters to inhabit that world that do not flat the laws if probability. We never doubt what they telling us. What the narrator says is truth. Such narratives are easy to read. They are also illustrative: they tell the story they do not have life on their own. The smooth chain of sentences gives us a sense of security, of comfort even precisely because it denies openness, the “trembling” of life itself; the very confidence of the articulation of the narrative gives the lie to our own sense of confusions… That of course is why we read them: take us for a while out of our confusions, drawing us into a world that makes some sort of sense, that at very least can be articulated. By the same token they cannot really satisfy us since they do not speak to our condition, only makes us hungry for more…”  He also says that these stories do not do more than a good journalism would not do.But he muses, the writers write what they want. Why such writers prevail he asks. And his answer it is because that the “cultural climate” promotes them. Or in the best case scenario, it cannot see the difference.  His example Nemirovsky and Cloude Simon. “She makes “a written renunciation to all claim to be an author” in her writing. Culture when serious and intelligent and well read ers not to speak of other novelists and distinguished biographers, many of them studied poems of Eliot or the novels of Woolf at university, should betray their calling as to go into ecstasies over books like Nemirovsky while in their life times ignoring Perec, Bernhard or Hofmann.”And he attempts to answer this question:First,  “there is greater resistance to Modernism in England than anywhere else including America. “Britons defined themselves in the opposition to others, in particular to the large, aggressive Popish nations of Spain and France: Britons are different; Britons never will be slaves, to other nations or to the ideas of other nations. To this must be added the fact that England was just about the only country not to be overrun by enemy during the second world war, which was blessing for it, but which has left it strangely innocent and thrown it into the arms of culturally as well as politically, of the even more innocent United States. This has turned a robust pragmatic tradition always suspicious of the things of the mind into a philistine one. Though there is something appealing in the resolute determination not be taken in the face of European Modernism… taken as a cultural rallying-cry it is little short of disastrous.”It was written in 2009. Now, in 2020 after Brexit and all, I can see this “ideology” has created a much wider problem that the literature. And I cannot agree more with his assessment. The sad thing, at least for me where we ended up politically. The hopeful thing that in terms of the literature per se this political situation has counter-intuitively increased the awareness and the desire to know how the others think. At least I have such an impression.His second point:  “paradoxically ours is an age which while being deeply suspicious of the “pretentious” worships the serious and “profound”, so the large novels about massacres in Rwanda or Bosnia or historical novels with a “majestic sweep” are automatically considered more worthy or attention that say P. G. Wodehouse or Robert Pinger.”I guess he complains that the representation overtakes the importance of creation in literature. It is a big problem without an easy solution. Another related point, the one my good friend has pointed out here a few times, the artists are being co-opted into endless cultural wars and identity debates. I am sure there literature cannot be preserved for it. But currently in many cases it just stops being what we call literature in the process. There is also a less negative trend of genre blending which is not necessary bad thing. But as a reader, i really struggle to find something worthwhile between contemporary books unless i am prepared to invest a lot of time filtering through huge amount of “noise”. And his last point : “Finally High Art and Fashion have married in a spirit. When the speakers at major literary festival are for the most part politicians, TV personalities or foreign correspondents, the books are sold three for the price of two…, we are truly arrived at the age where the art and showbiz are one and the same.”This is an invisible hand of market. Marketing in publishing and book selling is quite aggressive under different pressures on the industry. I personally try to avoid this pressure as a customer and quite successfully. But it is getting hard to imagine a young writer getting her work published without ticking at least a few boxes in her work none of them related to the literary merit. I definitely see it when I read a successfully published work. And yes it is sad.So this is what happened to modernism according to Josipovici. I think he went much wider in the second part. Needless to say I am greatly sympathise with his point of view. And he helped me to understand my own reservations in reading the fiction produced in England. Though I still like Naipaul and Roth. But in my case at least, I am just a reader. It is easy for me to chose what i read. It is much difficult to be “a truly modernist” writer.

It is a brilliant tour de force of the intellectual and religious ideas prevailing on the territory of Iran or This book was first published in 1985. It is a brilliant tour de force of the intellectual and religious ideas prevailing on the territory of Iran or influenced by its culture. Inevitably it is focused on Shia Islam. But there is a lot more including secular tradition, sufism, manichaeism and zoroastrism, It is great in its scope and not very difficult to read. Roy Mottahedeh explains tricky concepts with ease but without loosing the level of details. I feel sad that I’ve finished this book and it is hardly possible to produce an update of this book for the last 40 years due to the political developments.On the superficial level, the book goal is to explain what has lead to the Islamic Revolution in 1979. And “how a revolution so popular in origin should be so conservative in outcome”. However, the author warns in the introduction that there is no definitive answer on this question. As well as there is no answer on the question whether the revolution was the change for the better or worse. He gives the example of the French revolution which happened 200 years ago and the historians still disagree on its consequences. For me though the sheer scope of the intellectual thought, the strangeness of it as well as some familiarity was amazing. I’ve learned a lot and enjoyed the experience of learning as well.The book does not have a historically chronological structure. Instead it follows the intellectual life of a boy of a traditional mullah family from his childhood in the 40s of the 20th century through his education and up to the revolution of 1979. The boy, Ali Hashemi is sayyed, the ancestor of a Prophet. We follow his intellectual development from the primary state school to Madreseh in Qom where he lives. Later he becomes the instructor there, leaves for Iraq to study with Khomeini, then comes back and goes to the University of Tehran to study secular subjects such as philosophy. It is a true story. And it forms approximately a third of the total book. Another two thirds are more analytical follow ups to each chapter focused on a certain aspect of the Iranian intellectual and political history such as education, revolution of 1906, the history of Shia Islam, Sufis and the poetry. Typically, the author would pick up a few prominent individuals, politician and scholars and illustrate more general points through their thinking. Those individuals include Avicenna, Khayam, Shahravardi, Karsavi, Mosaddeq and many others. Initially i've had reservations about the structure. And in fact I did not enjoy the first chapter that much. But later I was convinced that the structure worked brilliantly. The weakness of the book is predictable. His depiction of the American policy in Iran as “naive” and idealistic sounds naive at least. He mentions Roosevelt adviser saying: “Iran is or can be made something in a nature of a clinic - an experiment station-for the presidents postwar policies his aims to develop and stabilise backward areas” which is dubious by itself. But then on the next page he talks about the US sponsored coup to get rid of the elected prime minister in the 50s when CIAs paid out the mob to organise antigovernment protest effectively managing the coup. They even were amazed how cheap it came to be. I find it really far from “naive and idealistic”. The Brits who effectively ruled there together with the Russians for 2 centuries are hardly mentioned. The Russians though got there share, but still treated gently enough. But I think i can forgive him for that as it does not affect the majority of the stuff in the book and is not the main subject of his narrative.As always with my non-fiction s, I would just mention a few points which I found fascinating. The selection is very subjective and far from a comprehensive. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested to broaden their point of view and find the perspective of the world that is different from the Western one.1. Iran did not have any formal system of education, even on the primary level until the 30s of the 20s century which is very late. The first and only high level secular education establishment was a Polytechnic founded in the late 19th century but for a very specific purpose. But Madresehs first appeared in the 11th century. They were the centres of the formal Islamic learning not very different from the Medieval universities. They existed throughout the centuries and their curriculum was quite vigorous. They taught something which is known as trivium in the West: grammar, rhetoric and logic. Of course those were not the only subjects. They needed to be fluent in Arabic to learn Koran and later the Islamic law among other things.They were taught not only through reading the texts but through disputations. The scholars needed to work in pairs and to dispute the difficult bits. So it was not as dogmatic as we would imagine. The system was still in place when Ali was studying in the early 50s. My understanding is that those establishments were the only place for a brighter boy to be educated.2. Sufism appeared to play a very significant role in spreading Islam between the masses. It is a mystical movement which believes in a possibility of obtaining a knowledge through “illumination” as opposed to reason. The mainstream clerics did not like Sufis as the reason played a very significant role in the interpretation of Islam and made it a prerogative of a learned man i.e. clergy. Also they competed for the financial resources. However, the Sufism in one form or another never disappeared. The practice of “efran” - learning how to achieve illumination through repetition and other form of ecstatic experience is still popular. Ali, the main character of the book has had a spiritual teacher of efran outside the madreseh system and he has achieved the state when he could see everything around him as just a form of light. It is quite fascinating how this mystical experience is described. The Sufis also had a huge influence on Iranian poetry. Many of the poets were the Sufis themselves.3. “Seeing the light” has lead me to another little story. When i was reading Dante’s “Divine comedy” earlier this year, I’ve read somewhere that his Paradiso closely resembles in structure and appearance the Paradise described in many narratives of the Ascent by Mohammed. He ascends to the throne of God under the guidance of Gabriel “a visionary experience recorded in all his biographies culminate in light.” It has been even mentioned in Wiki. Here, it is mentioned as well. In both Dante’s book and the Ascent, God is the focus of the most vivid lights surrounded by 9 concentric circles “formed by closed files of angels emitting light and all circles revolve about the Divine Focus.” So it is very likely Dante “was inspired” by the one of these accounts. It is almost certain, but obviously it is viciously argued against by many western scholars. 4. Mani, the founder of the religion named after him in the 3rd century seems to be very fascinating and influential figure. It is strange we do not hear about him that much nowadays. I’ve heard of him and his influence on St Augustine and respectively the Medieval Christianity when I was reading [Iran]. Here, he becomes even more interesting. Mani and his follows believed universal salvation of the soul through knowledge out of evil material world. So everything material, including body is really bad. But as a consequence, everything not material, including the written word is good. So it looks like we owe to him a huge boost in establishing and spreading the literature. Before him the scriptures were not defined. The revelations were recorded by someone else, not by the prophets themselves. But he by himself received revelations and wrote scripture. Therefore, he has created the idea of canon. And all other religions had to follow. I wonder whether we owe him the idea of the canon in the Western literature as well. He made the religion more democratic through translations as well. Other established religions were very reluctant to translate their sacred texts from their original languages. Not Mani. He by himself has translated his revelations into at least three languages and encouraged other translations. He also was quite happy to “borrow” from other religions. And he encouraged composing poetry and singing hymns in native languages. While the other religions considered the poetry as the language of Satan. All in all he seemed to be the first very influential, not very scrupulous literati. He certainly influenced the genesis of the Persian poetry. 5. In general, the dualism of Zoroastrian religion has influenced the appearance of the evil and the Satan in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. In Islam in particular, it seems the devil was associated with the creative impulses as well. And his figure is quite complex, far from the simple personification of the evil. Sufi believed that Satan was so devoted to God that he just could not accept a bow from anyone else. That is why he was ready to be expelled rather than to bow to a human. So he comes out almost like martyr figure. And of course, there is influence from the dualistic earlier religions. Mottahedeh’s argument then follows that while the theology is so ambiguous, it is not surprising that this ambiguity has become a part of the Iranian identity, and more narrowly the main theme of their traditional poetry. He says: “Persian poetry came to be the emotional home in which the ambiguity that was at the heart of Iranian culture lived most freely and openly. What Persian poetry expressed was not an enigma to be solved but an enigma that was unsolvable.” And in reality, the poets in Iran could get away with something which would be unimaginable in a very strict islamic tradition. The poetry plays a very significant role in the life or Iranian people. And this ambiguity, reconciling the opposites between an extreme piety and the hedonistic cynicism might at least partly explain the contradictions of their history.6. And the last point about the books burning. I’ve recently read a novel by an Iranian immigrant. There, she described an imaginary mass books burning by the Islamists after the revolution. I do not know whether such public actions really took place. I can believe they did, but I have not investigated this question. But I came across “a festival of book burning” by rather unexpected crowd. I was reading here about Kasravi, a former graduate from a madreseh but later a prominent secularist in 20-40s of the 20th century. He believed that traditional poetry is really harmful. Here Mottahedeh says “In pamphlets such as “Hasan is Burning his book of Hafez” he attacked the cult of Persian poetry, since he felt that Iranians used poetic quotations to avoid serious thinking. Anyway, Persian poetry was imbued with the qualities he detested - flattery of patrons, fatalism and mysticism antithetical to science - so he instituted a “book burning festival” for his followers at the winter solstice.” So it seems even if the novel I’ve read is based on some fact (and i do not know whether it is in fact the case), the idea has been initially propagated on the other end of the political spectrum.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jun 16, 2020","Jun 27, 2020","Jun 16, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32986.The_Mantle_of_the_Prophet

Interestingly, both books are published close to each other. This one is from 2015. But they take very different approach. Ponds talks about the objects, both natural and human-made as parts of the Universe, alive vibrating unity, including the humans. This book is very different. It considers the role of the objects created by humans. How do we create objects, how do we transfer the meaning to them? What this meaning could be and how it changes with time.

A fewIt is unlikely we would have proper holidays this year, so I've decided to build on my fascination with Iran and read a book of travels in Iran. A few years ago, I've read Jason Elliot's book about Afghanistan and was impressed, so I've picked up this one. Jason speaks Farsi and travels widely insight the country. And I liked his way of describing his insights into Persian culture, traditions and history. He also talks with a lot of local people. The book starts with almost two pages of ""eclectic legacy"" we inherited from 2.5 thousands years of Iranian history. I would not reproduce it here, but mention just a few things from his list: the banker's cheque, the first postal service (from which the Post of the US takes his motto: ""Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night strays these couriers from swift completion of their appointed rounds.""), the first astronomical observatory, algebra, astrolabe, the bullfight, the etymological origins of ""paradise"", ""magic"", and ""scarlet"", the dome and relevant architecture, Shiraz grape, Zoroaster, the three Magi (said to have set out from Persian city of Qom), Christmas tree; tennis and polo; Thousand and One Nights (the one of the first books translated into Arabic from Persian). And that is without mentioning all the poets and all the scientists from 11-14th centuries up to now.The big part of the book is actually devoted to the cultural inheritance. I've learned a lot about the architecture and Islamic art. There is even an embedded essay about the meaning of the abstract Islamic art. Apart from the architecture which seems to be his main passion, Jason talks about the poetic tradition which wins the hearts of the Iranians even compared the religion. Apparently the poets were required to go through many years of proper education of the craft. One could not just sit down and compose. The poetry is closely related to Sufism. The book title is actually taken from the one of the poems. ""Mirrors of the Unseen"" is exactly the way of looking at a poem as a connection with the divine reality we are not able to contemplate while the verse is the slightly opaque mirror reflecting certain aspects of it.Interestingly, it seems the translation might be the reason for the rise and the nature of the Western civilisation. In the Middle Ages, the major source of learning came from the books of hellenistic traditions, especially Aristotle. But people did not know the Greek in the Western Europe. So these texts were available in translation from Arabic (or less often from Greek) into Latin. That, as we can imagine, might create a big space for misinterpretation and ambiguity. Therefore, only relatively simpler ideas got stuck. I am very much simplifying the argument. But i like the idea. Jason expands much deeper and farther why, for example, the Western tradition pays so much attention the centrality of mind (rationality, science, technology) and where it has lead all of us. While the Eastern tradition is more skeptical that mind and mind alone could be the most trusted source of humanity and goodness.The book has been published in 2006. Obviously, there is nothing on the affect of the war in Syria and other events after 2006. Besides Jason generally tries to avoid to go deep in politics. But he retells the political history of the 20th century including the coup organised by the British and Americans to get rid of Mohammad Mosaddegh. When he discusses this event with his friends - the secular middle class Iranians, they seems to be less infuriated by the role of the foreign government than he is. The one of his friends says that if not that, Mosaddegh would need to go eventually as he has started to lose the support. I was surprised by their lack of indignation. Generally, based upon Jason's conversations they seem to be wiser but more resigned that I would imagine. It was notable lack of observance of any religious traditions in 2006 at least. And the religion together with its representatives was very unpopular between the young. One of his corespondents noted though that after Islamic revolution Iran has become more democratic compared to the Shah's time. I found this thought almost counter-intuitive. There is no conversation about Iran-Iraq war in the book, Jason does not talk to the mullahs either. So if one is interested in the politics or religion she might look elsewhere.However, if one is interested in the culture of this fascinating and diverse country, with the detailed insight into the architecture, it is not a bad place to start. ...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Jun 10, 2020","Jun 16, 2020","Jun 10, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/161711.Mirrors_of_the_Unseen

By the “kitchmongers” he means the French and their culture. Would you guess who said it? It was not Mann, though he was not far behind in the sentiment at that time. These words belong to Arnold Schoenberg, the avant-garde composer, music genius for some and the scandalous upstart for another “who would be better off in clearing the snow than in composing”, a Jew from Vienna. He would change his views later of course later, as many others like him. But it would be too late for his country, if not for his music.Schoenberg is not a character in the Mann’s novel. Though he later thought he was. But this “German spirit” is the character indeed. The spirit that has lead the whole nation comprised of many outstanding individuals into a sheer madness and evil. The novel's full title is “Dr Faustus. The life of the German composer Adrian Leverkuhn as told by a friend”. After reading it, I think a different title would be more suitable even if it is less appealing: “The life of an average German man Serenus Zeitblom, PhD told through his love to his genius friend while everything dear to him goes through annihilating madness.” Though Adrian Leverkuhn plays a huge role in the novel, indeed I think that Serenus is more important. He documents in his sightly awkward, convoluted, but very sincere writing the evolution of a German mind. Serenus is not very distinctive, in fact probably very typical, honest, hard-working and thinking teacher living in the first half of the last century. He possess the strong humanist ideals, he knows and values culture, especially music; he loves his country and the land. And, during the course of his 60 years, all of this is getting destroyed by the people many of them are not unlike him. That leaves him confused, intimidated and lost. And, this biography he writes is his attempt to redeem himself, to explain to himself what happened.And yes of course there is the genius friend. More than a friend in fact. The man whom Sirenus loves with the quiet devotion. The man whom he would never dare to imagine as a lover, but whom he loves so dearly. The man who Serenus would not be able to safe. Adrian writes music. Adrian is cold and lonely. And any attempt by Adrian to become more human leads to a catastrophe. But Adrian also is vain, or at least sometimes. He thinks he could write the music which would be governed by the principles almost opposite to the all composed before him. At the same time his music would contain all this inheritance but in a way that no-one would see. And he is ready to sacrifice his life to the search for such a music.Adrian is so symbolic with the vanity and unraveling of the “German spirit”, that initially I thought that he exists only in Serenus imagination. I’ve changed my mind lately though as Adrian obtained more humanity with the novel progressing.But I have not introduced the main character yet. Because I think the main character of this novel is the music in all its variety. While Adrian is learning and composing his masterpieces, Mann is introducing us to this fascinating and complex subject of the Western music of the last few centuries. The music possess its own language which I do not know unfortunately. That made me struggle with the book and writing this  was a difficult task. I’ve learned a lot, but I would gain much more from the novel if I would know the terms like tonality, chords, harmony, contrapunct and many others. What i felt though it is Mann’s admiration for the subject and his encyclopaedic knowledge. I also know that even Mann has consulted Adorno in writing about the contemporary musical developments. But even with my limited knowledge I understood that the music was in a state of existential crisis at fin de siecle, the crisis probably deeper than any other art. Music is appeared to be closer to mathematics and even physics (the theory of waves). So the laws of these disciplines have affected music more. They said that everything which was there to compose pleasant enough and of any value has been composed. They also were debating whether music needed to please masses or to be destined for the elite. All of these is masterfully entailed in the novel. Adrian composes the music which has never actually been composed as far as I know. His music supposedly absorbs all the influences and styles in order to destroy them from within. But in one chapter, he explains to Serenus the music based on the atonality which broadly coincides with the system really conceived by our old friend Schoenberg. Schoenberg was not very happy man and made Mann to add an explanatory note to the end of the book that should reappear in all new editions. Coincidently, my edition in English does not have this note while my Russian book does.The novel also probes how far a genius would go for the sake of his art. And also where is the border between the geniality and madness. That is how Dr Faustus comes to play. Adrian is not Faust from Goethe. Goethe's Faust has been redeemed by God. Adrian is the medieval Dr Faustus from the old initial legend. He is ready to get himself sick for life if it would boost his chance of experiencing inspiration. He is called in the novel “the monk of darkness”. And he would not be forgiven. But his genius supposedly would live in his music. The actual pact with the devil here is ambiguous. We would never know whether he has actually seen the satan or it was the fist sign of his disease. It reminded me a novella by Chekhov The Black Monk where the character finds himself in a very similar situation, but choses the different way out. Adrian keeps composing, Chekhov’s character is getting “cured” but both are powerless over the bigger forces driving them over the cliff. This is the tragedy of course. But not only for Adrian. It is the tragedy for Serenus to know for a long time that he would not be able to safe the person he loves and to stay there until the end. It is a complex, multilayered novel. There are a lot of ideas to digest. It is not easy to read. However, it is worth persisting. I only wish I knew more about music theory. I did not mention that it is populated by a lot of interesting characters that add to the drama. But it a story for another time.I’ve started with Schoenberg, so I will finish with him. Leverkuhn is not his alter-ego. I understood that Adrian is a proper fictional character with many features. For example, he receives the financial support from the woman unknown to him like Tchaikovsky did. His general prototype, if any, is Nietzsche. However, Mann has borrowed a few things from Schoenberg as well. Such as for example, Schoenberg went with his students to Graz to listen to performance of Salome by Richard Strauss. Adrian in the book said he would go to listen the same opera at the same place but instead visited a prostitute. The result of this visit was his fate. In his book, The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century that is how Alex Ross described the commotion which happened in a supermarket when “Dr Faustus” was published:“One day in 1948 or 1949 a shopping complex in an upscale neighbourhood of Los Angeles, California, was the scene of a slight disturbance that carried overtones of the most spectacular upheaval in 20th century music. Marta Feuchtwanger, wife of the emigre novelist Lion Feuchtwanger, was examining grapefruit in the produce section when she heard a voice shouting in German from the far end of the aisle. She looked up to see Arnold Schoenberg, the pioneer of atonal music and the codifier of twelve-tone composition, bearing down on her, with his bald pate and burning eyes. Decades later, in conversation with the writer Lawrence Weschler, Marta could still recall every detail of the encounter, including the weight of the grapefruit in her hand. “Lies, Frau Marta, lies!” Schoenberg was yelling. “You have to know, I never had syphilis!”...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,"Jun 03, 2020","Jun 09, 2020","Jun 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13298631

IIt is a well written and informative overview for those people like me who do not know much about Iran and want to discover its history and culture. I assume, that as with many such books, if one possess extensive pre-requisite knowledge, she might find a lot of gaps or might not agree with the inevitable element of interpretation. But it was the perfect starting point for me. For a few years already I am trying to refocus my reading of history away from the West. I've read similar overview books on India, the Arabs, the Ottomans, Central Asia and very recently - Georgia. There is of course a certain overlap. But I have to say that out of all these countries the history of Iran is the saddest if i can use this term. And of course, my opinion is very subjective, based only on one book. It seems that the time is moving backwards for this land starting from the 15th century. Or maybe it is just such a contrast with the earlier days when their culture has dominated the half of the continent. Of course there were many conquests including the Arabs and then the Mongols. Then from the middle 18th century they were subject of absolutely disgusting meddling from the British and the Russians. Both replaced by the Americans in the 20th century. But even taking into account that, their rulers starting from the Safavids of the 15th century were just decadent. They were either fighting or enjoying themselves. Compared to them the Ottomans are absolute example of the statecraft. So i understand perfectly well Iranians’ taste for revolutions.I would not go into more details as it is not very grateful task to retell a good history book. I limit myself to just three observations:Iranians are the people of the poetry. Between the 10-14th centuries they've manage to produce such a plead of poets that they are still widely read worldwide, studied in Iran and at least partly define their identity. Some names: Rudaki, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam (11th century) and Attar, Rumi,Hafez and Sadi (13-14th century). How many names of the European poets do we know from that time? Women and covering. in the 18-19th century, it was considered as the question of class privilege and prestige for a woman to have a vail. Not many women or their husbands could afford it. In general women played substantial role at work and in the house. They also had quite a big indirect influence on the politics.East-West influence. Just one ancient and a bit controversial example. Mani, so-called prophet of the 3rd century AD has established a new religion Manichaeism. This religion has spread rapidly and was very influential. It has got many elements, but a few core ones was disdain with everything related to human body, sex, anything material and very broad definition of a sin. This has influenced greatly The Augustine of Hippo who himself initially was the follower. Respectively it has penetrated the Mediaeval main stream Catholic teaching and influenced the whole history of Europe through that. I've hidden a lengthy quote from this book and a bit of a Wiki article under the (view spoiler)[ ""But the most startling story is that of his influence in the West. Of all the fathers of the Christian church, probably the most influential was St Augustine of Hippo. Augustine wrote wonderful books that explained the Christian religion to the uneducated; explained the downfall of the Roman empire in Christian terms, absolving the Christians of blame (some, like Gibbon, have remained unconvinced); explained in touching and humane terms his own life, his own sense of sin and his own (late) conversion to Christianity (‘O Lord, Make me chaste—but not yet’). His presence in the thought of the church in later centuries was dominant. He also explained the reasons why Manichaeism was heretical in a Christian context. But the remarkable fact is that, before he converted to Christianity, Augustine had been an avowed Manichaean, had converted others to the sect, and may have served as a Manichaean priest. It has been disputed, but the imprint of Manichaeism on Augustine’s thinking is obvious and heavy. Many of the ideas that Augustine’s teaching successfully fixed in Catholic Christian doctrine, notably that of original sin (strongly associated by him with sexuality), predestination, the idea of an elect of the saved, and (notoriously) the damnation of unbaptised infants, originated at least partly in debates that had been going on earlier within the Christian church, though those discussions had been influenced in turn by similar Gnostic ideas to those which had inspired Mani. But many of these key concepts— especially the central one, original sin—also show a striking congruence with Manichaean doctrine. Surely Augustine could not successfully have foisted upon the Christian church Manichaean ideas that the Church had already declared heretical? Yet that seems to have been what happened, and Augustine was accused of doing precisely this by contemporaries—notably by the apostle of free will, Pelagius, who fought long and hard with Augustine over precisely these theological problems in the early years of the fifth century; and lost, and was himself declared a heretic. Perhaps the most damaging decision ever taken by the Christian church.24 As pursued later by the western Christian church in medieval Europe, the full grim panoply of Manichaean/Augustinian formulae emerged, blighting millions of lives and still exerting their sad effect today: the distaste for the human body, the disgust for and guilt about sexuality, the misogyny, the determinism (and the tendency to irresponsibility that emerges from it), the obsessive idealisation of the Spirit and disdain for the Material—all distant indeed from the original teaching of Jesus.Eastern Orthodox Church has escaped this influence.The real opponent to Augustinian orthodoxy was Pelagianism—the simple, natural appeal of which was such that it never really quite died out—a golden thread, sometimes concealed, running through medieval thought, to emerge again in Renaissance humanism. If ever a Christian thinker deserved to be made a saint, then surely Pelagius did. If ever a pair of thinkers deserved Nietzsche’s title Weltverleumder26 (world-slanderers), then they were Mani and Augustine.""WikiSome modern scholars have suggested that Manichaean ways of thinking influenced the development of some of Augustine's ideas, such as the nature of good and evil, the idea of hell, the separation of groups into elect, hearers, and sinners, and the hostility to the flesh and sexual activity, and his dualistic theology.[41] These influences of Manichaeism in Augustine's Christian thinking may well have been part of the conflict between Augustine and Pelagius, a British monk whose theology, being less influenced by the Latin Church, was non-dualistic, and one that saw the created order, and mankind in particular, as having a Divine core, rather than a 'darkness' at its core.

But it is rare when this person manages to absorb the influences It is probably not very rare when an extremely gifted person emerges on this planet. But it is rare when this person manages to absorb the influences of many cultures and produce a very original innovative syntheses in his short life. The whole body of work that transcends the national boundaries and would influence a way of writing for decades and even centuries. I know only three names in the 20th century Kafka, Borges and now, Akutagawa. Notably he was the first. What unites all these three, they were born either into the culture without long established national literary tradition or in the time of dramatic changes of the society and literature. I would leave Kafka aside. But both Borges and Akutagawa were immersed in many different languages and cultures since their childhood. Borges has read even Don Quixote in English. Akutagawa was reading both Japanese and Chinese traditional literature as child but also hungrily absorbed almost 200 years of the Western literature by the age of 18.My first encounter with Akutagawa was unsuccessful. While at university, I’ve picked up his collection of short stories and found them too stylised and boring. Now many years after, my view has changed almost to the opposite extreme. I can read him many times and never get bored. In fact, I absolutely admire the versatility of his gift. His variety of styles is exceptionally wide. And he was always experimenting with his method and searching for new techniques through his short life. He never was totally satisfied it seems. He changed the decorations and styles. But there is one thing which always present in his tales. It is authenticity of human feelings. It is also amazing how many writers he anticipated, including Kafka and Borges but even Knausgaard though it might sound incredible to start with. I’ve read much bigger volume of his stories in Russian. Not that big part of his work has been translated into English. But I think this collection contains many of his best tales with a few notable exceptions. I would just pause on a few to underscore the versatility of his gift:“Rashomon” and “In a Bamboo grove”. Those two are the most famous as they were the base of the movie by Kurosawa. But purely from the perspective of the literature, the second one stands out. Apparently it is the first time ever when a bunch of unreliable narrators are describing the same story from the different perspective, contradicting each other. And the single “truth” is never revealed. Robert Browning apparently did something similar in The Ring and the Book but Akutagawa raised it to the totally different level with the open ending. Now we are so much get used to this tool. But even from the perspective of our century, this is the one of the most elegant and economically told stories of this type.“Hell Screen” - this is not a medieval tale. This is a philosophic investigation about the dominance of the high art over reality. Apparently Akutagawa visited an anatomy morgue to write this story.“The story of head fell off” - it is included here in a comical section, but there is nothing comical about this story. And the image of a deep blue sky getting closer and closer would stay with me for a long time.“Green onions” - this story I would not be surprised to find between early Chekhov tales. How our high expectations from life often end with the prose of the aforementioned vegetable.“Horse legs” - purely from the land of Kafka.There are a few of the notable omissions in this collection:“The Yam Gruel” is translated into English. It is included into Rashomon and Other Stories. It is a tale about the feeling of a “little” person modelled on Gogol’s Overcoat. As far as I remember, Gogol’s character dies from the shock of loosing the overcoat. But Akutagawa has twisted the tale asking very different question: what if he would get what he dreams about? And there is no Akaki Akakievich. He has been replaced by a samurai.“Handkerchief” - It is available in English as well. It is included into Mandarins: Stories by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. The collection of the recently translated stories by Archipelago press. What a clever short story this is! On the surface it is about East-West and its mutual accommodation. But this is not a simple story. It is one of those tales like a matreshka doll. You’ve opened one not expecting to find another, but it is in there. And then - one more. And the smallest one does not look anything like the initial one and leaves you puzzled what was the story about really.Now the section called “Akutagawa own story”. While reading the introduction in my Russian collection, I’ve learned a lot about the state of the Japanese literature at the time. Due to the Meji reformation and opening to the West, they tried to build up their modern literature by absorbing around 200 years of the Western Canon. Obviously they were loosing themselves in the process. Apparently they did not have a concept of a novel per se. So in 1885 Tsubouchi Shōyō (1859-1935) a literary critic, translator of Western literature, and novelist formulated the principle for the Japanese fiction in his work Shōsetsu Shinzui (The Essence of the Novel). He came to the conclusion that the descriptive realism should be the way to go. This has apparently helped to focus the minds of the Japanese writers. Many of them has taken the idea even a step further following the theory that only object a person could know truthfully is her/himself. As a result they developed something called ""I-novel"" (私小説, Shishōsetsu, Watakushi Shōsetsu) where a writer would describe both his mental and physical life in its daily details with the varied level of psychological depth. So the fashionable 21th century auto-fiction was in fact born in Japan about a century earlier. I was amazed to find that out. But why i am talking about it? Akutagawa initially considered it more or less as lazy and limiting exercise. But then, at some stage, in his last decade he has started to experiment with the method. At the same time he kept experimenting with the style, used huge range of framing devices from the letters to the dialogues and the sketchs of unwritten novels (the device later successfully used by Borges who loved Akutagawa's work). He also kept his psychological complexity in these stories. And his very last tales before his suicide are read more like impressionistic pieces full of terrible beauty rather than the confessional tales. One serious omission form this part of this collection is “Dialogue in darkness”, the story that is written as a conversation between Akutagawa and the angel or maybe he is the fallen angel who has become a devil. I’ve searched whether the story exists in English. But did not find anything conclusive. The story was published posthumously. And I wanted to finish with the quote from there:D.

And, a bit of a warning now, I am going to terribly simplify his thought. But it would help me. He had this beautiful idea that everything out there is just one thing of a divine nature. But how can we think of this thing? The easiest is to imagine the endless, but not uniform fabric. I found the best explanation in this book The Great Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy:“Spinoza goes on to say that in total, all-inclusive fabric of the one substance, local and temporary formation crop up like wrinkles in a cloth. They are the real nature of what we ordinary think of as self-subsisting things such as tables, chairs, ourselves, our friends, the Himalayas. In everyday life we take such things to be identifiable items with clear, definite outlines. For Spinoza they are just temporary contours taken on here and there by the fabric of everything there is.”All we are is just wrinkles in a cloth. So are the objects surrounding us. Spinoza implies that as we have consciousness, all the objects do so as well. When I was reading Pond, I thought a lot about this. And, I think, Claire Bennet sees the world in this way. All the objects in her pieces of the text possess a special meaning and - I dare say - a soul. It might be she is talking about a pattern of bricks in a wall or about forgotten earring on a sink, a pile of compost in an bowl. And all of this communicates with her. Sometimes she feels an impulse, almost physical force coming from them. Here is the line from the last page ”the apple held her in its fluent green gaze as all thoughts and awarenesses in her began softly trickle out across the garden.”  And its not a metaphor in her case.Through all individual pieces included into this book, Clare tries to show that there is a level of communication, the level of unity higher than a human language. And sometimes she is trying to get to this level. I think that is why she is saying at one point “English is not my first language. I have not yet discovered what my first language is. I don’t  think my first language could be written down and needs to stay immersing in the elastic gloom betwixt my flickering organs.” In this, she reminds me Clarice Lispector and especially her The Passion According to G.H.. Arguably, Clarice is more successful. She really got to this level when the meaning of the individual words are sometimes obscure while the text emanates this openness and unity with something invisible otherwise. Claire still relies more on the words. But in on story “The gloves off” I think she has fully achieved this effect of total immersion. There, the text is so intense that she forgets about intelligibility of the individual words. And the text reveals the force and frenzy of her connection with the earth both physical and emotional. “I want to see the trees naked and hear the earth gasp and settle into a warm tender mass of radiant darkness. …Knowing exactly everything beneath it and wanting to get back there. You do know how passionate it is down there.”She is so good with the words. Look how she sees the mud: “yet it must be mentioned as I’d never seen mud quite like it - feudal and rich, almost igneous in fact, as if suddenly it would rupture and divulge a beast of fire or turn in on itself in a molten whirlpool of dark flashing water.”She manages to combine this cosmic thirst with self-deprecating humour not unlike Lidia Davis and other female American short story writers. In one of the stories by Clarice, her character saw a worm during her walk. That has triggered the whole epiphany of admiration combined with total disgust. Not with Clare. Maybe in an nod to Lispector she is saying: “I like worms and I have no problems picking them up, which is unusual and thus gives me a clear advantage in certain situations because it means I can fling them at people if I feel like it and that never fails to cheer me up.”Quite a few of her profound observations made me to pause and think. Such as “The desire to come apart irrevocably will always be as strong, if not stronger, then the drive to establish oneself.” or  “Everybody knows deep down that life is as much about the things that do not happen as the things that do and that’s not something that ought to be glossed over or denied because without frustration there would be hardly any need to daydream.” Each of these lines could be developed into a book by itself.My only minor complaint is that sometimes I felt she exercised in style just for the sake of it. For example, there is a piece about the usefulness of drinking in boosting the attraction of the opposite sex. It is written it seems in an academic language. I did not mind it per se. But the book in its entirety has had so much to offer that it seemed a little excessive. Though when she was exercising in the poetry in prose, those pieces were sublime.Pond has had a lot of praise when published. And I have to say that it is the best piece of the contemporary work written by an English author I’ve read in a few years. ...more",Notes are private!,1,45,1,"May 26, 2020",Jun 2020,"May 26, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26839903-pond

And this, first part, has created the most strong impression on me. But all observations below could be equally referred to the novel as whole.There is an episode somewhere close to the beginning when a young man pushing his girlfriend on the swings. She does not want to go high first. But he persists and then she goes higher and higher, and loves it. Also she loves dropping back rapidly. And when the inevitable slowdown comes, she asks for more. And it starts again from slow to quicker and higher all to the point when it takes her breath away. That is exactly the way how reading this book felt to me: from slow and mundane, slightly disorienting to intense, almost painfully poignant. And always in a rhythmical motion.The novel is written in a long rhythmical sentences with the elements of repetition. The words are relatively simple but there is a wonderful music in it a bit like a lullaby for a grown-up, a bit like a fugue. A middle-aged artist goes to check on his friend who, he suspects, is unwell and poisoned with drinking. The novel describes a bit more than 24 hours of his life. The man thinks. The man remembers. That is all. But it is a lot. It is a full-blown struggle with Kant metaphysical trio: God, freedom of will and immortality. Only I do not think the man knows about Kant. He just thinks. ""because either God is all-powerful and then there’s no free will, or God isn’t all-powerful and there is free will, within limits, but in that case God is not all-powerful, so ever since God gave humanity free will he gave up his omnipotence, something like that must be true, because without a will that’s free there can’t be love, and God is love, that’s the only thing that is said of God in the New Testament, and that’s why God lacks divine omnipotence, he has God’s weakness, impotence even, but there’s a lot of strength in weakness, yes, maybe the weakness is itself a strength? The man prays. He tries to find his own way to believe and keep his faith.It is questioning the purpose of art from the perspective of its creator. He thinks of his art, a bit like old Plato with his cave, as showing something which cannot be totally seen, just getting close to it: “I know I can paint pictures that only I can paint, because I have my very own inner picture that all the other pictures come from, so to speak, or that they all try to get to, or get close to, but that one innermost picture can’t be painted, and the closer I am to that inner picture when I paint the better I paint, and the more light there is in the picture, yes, that’s how it is “. And then:  so I had to paint them the way people wanted them, but none of them saw what I actually painted, nobody saw that, just me, and maybe a few other people, because what I painted were the shadows, what I painted was the darkness in all that light, I painted the real light, the invisible light, but did anyone see that?did they notice that. That is something I was thinking a lot recently in relation to the writers and their work. We had a discussion about Henry James and his story The Figure in the Carpet. In the story, the writer was claiming that there was always a hidden message in his work which so far none of the critics have managed to pick up. Here, it goes even one step further when even the artist does not totally realise the message…And it is simply a moving story of a life lived with its love, loss, the roads not taken, its memories and something that fades forever.I am very unhappy the blurb in English. There are two men in the novel with the same name. Blurb says  ""He (the other man with the same name) and the narrator are doppelgangers – two versions of the same person, two versions of the same life. "" But Fosse is much more subtle, much cleverer than this. He leaves the reader a lot of space to chose his own path through the novel, to form his own view. It is unfair that blurb narrows the scope of the alternative readings, a big disservice to this book. The novel touches upon something universal that is always has been and always will be. And that is why this novel will likely endure. And, the last thing, it made me discover how beautiful “Our Father” prayer sounds in Latin…that’s how it also is with all the paintings by other people that mean anything to me, it’s like it’s not the painter who sees, it’s something else seeing through the painter, and it’s like this something is trapped in the picture and speaks silently from it, and it might be one single brushstroke that makes the picture able to speak like that, and it’s impossible to understand, I think, and, I think, it’s the same with the writing I like to read, what matters isn’t what it literally says about this or that, it’s something else, something that silently speaks in and behind the lines and sentences, ...more",Notes are private!,5,139,1,"May 20, 2020","May 22, 2020","May 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46024004-the-other-name

And this book is the only one which is translated into English. It is a shame as his writing deserves much wider readership. However, personally it was a difficult book for me. The language is so beautiful and poetic. The turn of the phrase is unusual and I can see the anticipation of Pessoa in it. But the subject matter is the poor, destitute people, thieves prostitutes, such like. And he shows their life in such a miserable way. He is very fatalistic and deterministic. The poor exit to perform their destiny in the world and in the nature. Life and death. Love and death. And it lacks the relief of irony and black humour like in Celine's novels. It lacks the realistic details and multidimensional characters of Yama: The Pit. It also does not possess the energy of the recent addition to the genre Hurricane Season.What it does possess is the poetry of the language and a lot of philosophic observations beautifully expressed. A few examples:""Beneath the Tree - reality or illusion? - a figure is made of moonlight, in the opaque shadow a shimmer takes shape. The strands of moonlight come together, fog piles up, and something trembles, ready to flee - yet alive! Alive...! You might say it is merely a smile, a very sad gaze... Gabiru runs and everything disintegrates... Only the Shadow remains and the sound of moonlight drops falling on the leaves. He smiles and says, ""Ah that is how a soul is created.""""I do not if you have all noticed...Creatures, even before final agony, are more a part of the other world than the earth... Matter is already entirely soaked in mystery, there is more light that night... Things that belong to the body fall silent and, inside us, the stardust of which the soul is made begins to speak.""""After death, matter goes into an ocean. Rivers carry the molecules, until they meet up with those they are meant to join. My heart joined to yours will grow into a simple thorn bush. It will be in some modest place, but any passerby this April will be forever moved. My brain will seek out yours to float together in the serenity of some river. Whether on earth on in rocks, I will look for you unconsciously till I find and enjoy you in this stormy ocean. And if you are a fountain. I'll discover you and together we will quench the thirst of many a forgotten root.""Oh, and the translation is absolutely stunning. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"May 15, 2020","May 16, 2020","May 16, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28182427-the-poor

For if something higher and stronger than all external circumstances does not inform the life of a man, then indeed a common cold is enough to disturb his equilibrium; and all his pessimism or optimism together with his great and little thoughts are merely symptoms and nothing else. I am defeated. Why, then, should I continue to think or to argue? No, I shall simply sit and wait for what is coming in silence.And just a few notes from me. First of all, the argument still persist whether this view expressed by the character was the view by Chekhov. Chekhov said categorically no. But many critics and the readers still think it is the case about ""the central idea"" or its lack there of in his work. I think the argument is misplaced. It is always interesting though how much of the author's thought and personality is expressed in his work and how straightforward is to see it.And another thought. For me, this was not the core of the story. For me the core was how helpless one could become in spite of the superfluously successful life. And how then one is incapable of emotionally giving.

We are our childhood, our family, some friends, a few loves, more than a few disappointments. A sum reduced by infinite subtractions.”Sergio Pitol, a Mexican writer who died in 2018, is well known in the Spanish speaking world. But until quite recently he was not translated in English. Fortunately, at least some of his work has been translated now and published by Deep Vellum. I’ve read and enjoyed Mephisto's Waltz: Selected Short Stories his collection of short stories before. This trilogy is different. It is a genre defying work, a mix of his memories, essays and thoughts. He himself calls it “record my journey, the history of still unfinished education”. One would call it auto-fiction nowadays. But it is a very different from someone like Knausgaard who dwells of his real life with its minute and mundane details. Pitol lives in reading. There is no details of how many cigarettes he smokes, no single romantic relationship mentioned apart from the attachment to his dog. The main subject of this work is the books he reads, his travels and meetings with his friends who are inevitably the other writers. I cannot see that people who do not like a writer as a character or a book about other books falling in love with this trilogy. But i found it immensely enjoyable. It is the one of those book that, mind the cliche, is the conversation with an older, knowledgable and charming friend.There is a defined literary form to this work, however. The book is written as a diary, if only without the dates assigned. I think, this form has been popularised by Gombrowicz who wrote his diary while in Argentina specifically for publication. That one famously started with three days of a single entry: Me, Me, Me. Gombrowicz was writing in Polish. But the tradition somehow took the hold more between the Latin-american and Spanish writers. Some of them raised to perfection like this one and another similar project by Piglia The Diaries of Emilio Renzi: Formative Years. Vila-Matas as well constantly plays with the idea, albeit in less auto-fictional form. And, Mr Knausgaard himself obsessively reads Gombrowicz in the The End, the 6th volume of his opus. Often such work raises the question what proportion of it is “true”. In this book, Pitol says “I am aware that a large part of what we believe we remember are in fact inventions after the fact, and that this condition makes them indispensable for analytical work.”. And that is the real spirit of this book.So what is he talking about in this volume? He talks about his first visit to Venice when he has forgotten his glasses and saw the city through the eyes of a myopic, slightly out of focus. He talks about his time in Warsaw, his meetings and translations of Polish authors in the 60s, notably Jerzy Andrzejewski and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz. He talks about facing poverty in Barcelona. And always about the books. Quite often he mentions arriving at a city and staying in a hotel to read instead of venturing straight out. He talks about the death of a novel foretold many times but never happened. It allows him to muse about a few favourite beginnings. He tells the story of Paul Valery who refused to write a novel “because he is incapable of anything as banal as “Marquise went out at five o’clock.” He talks about different kind of readers, some of them who would be delighted to read a novel starting like that. He mentions how Cortazar 30 years later has subverted the whole story with Marquise. To find out, read the first line of The Winners.He talks about his favourite authors (Thomas Mann, Henry James, Galdos, Borges, Chekhov) and their way of writing. Interestingly for me, as I’ve just finished the Ambassadors, this is what he has to say on Henry James and i find it totally fitting to my experience:“James validated for me a trend that was present in my very first stories: a furtive and sinuous approach to a fringe of mystery that is never entirely clear and that allows the reader to choose the solution he believes most fitting.”He also reveals in a beautiful prose how he approaches his writing:“From the very beginning, what I had always done was scatter a series of points onto the blank page as if they had fallen there by chance, with no visible relationship between them; until one suddenly began to spread out, expand, sprout tentacles in search of others, and then the others would follow its example: the points would become lines running across the page to find their sisters, either to subordinate or serve them, until that initial group of solitary points morphed into an increasingly complex and intricate character, with gaps, creases, ironies, blurrings, and glaring darkness. That was my writing or, at least, the ideal of my writing.”There are many other things in the book starting from his experience of hypnoses and finishing with his looking at Max Beckman “Triptych Departure (1932-5)” and trying to create a story which would fit it:[image]He later finds out how Beckman interpreted it himself. Pitol is saying: ‘If someone who had not read Beckmann’s explanation stood in front of the triptych and translated that fragment (the right part with the woman and the body) similarly, I would slit my throat.” Does anyone want to guess what Beckmann said? “Reading is a secret game of approximations and distances. It is also a lottery. One arrives at a book by unusual means; one stumbles upon an author by apparent coincidence only never be able to stop reading him.” That is exactly my case with Pitol. Though there were a few moments when i needed to push through, I’ve just finished the second book of this trilogy and feel sorry already that eventually I would finish the third one and it will be no more, at least from this cycle. It might bore some people, but it is a gift for the right reader.4.5 strs rounded upwards...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"May 09, 2020","May 14, 2020","May 09, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23282068-the-art-of-flight

At least not in the sense of the 19th century. The peoplIf I've figured the one thing about this novel for certain, that it is not a realistic novel. At least not in the sense of the 19th century. The people populating it are not real. Lets take the main character Lewis Lambert Strether (even the name is ridiculous). He arrives to Paris from Woollett, Massachusetts to fetch Chad, the son of his fiancé and the heir of a manufacturing empire on her request. He appears at the same time the man of great imagination and fantastically perceptive man at that. He manages to read the romantic intention of a young girl by watching her for a few minutes standing on the balcony. At the same time, he misses something which is dead obvious in other romantic relationship he is in charge to actually break. Lets take Chad, his charge. That man, we are told, has greatly improved in Europe, has become refined and “beautiful”. But he acts as an infantile and not very bright moron. And I am not even talking about a bunch of very strong-willed, but weirdly disoriented women cast (that is apart from the ones from Whoollett). So in short, the characters can be both: perceptive and simpleminded, daft and refined, free-will and puritanic. Such characters do not exit in realism, but they do in modernism and even in post-modernism. So, this book, I think is just a game for James. He cannot be bothered with realism or true psychological depth when he plays his comedy. It is also made obvious with the famous question: what is that the manufacturing empire producing? The multiple generation of the readers keep guessing until now. He has teased people with that somewhere at the beginning of the novel. But I seriously doubt James knows himself. That is not the point. And I guess, if one would not share his sardonic, slightly evil sense of humour, this book might become a torture.I found the dialogues very funny. The blanks in them, the repetitions, the expletives. It is difficult to convey what i mean without a huge quote. But for example, the use and overuse of the words like “wonderful”, “beautiful” “deep” (in the context of a person) or sharp (in the context of the situation) might indicate the narrowness of James’s sensual vocabulary. We know it could not be further from the case. Some people would be irritated. But it made me smile - again someone else is being wonderful!Is it the first novel addressing middle-life crisis? I’ve read somewhere that the term has not been coined until the 60s of the 20th century. But our lovely Strether has come to Paris to experience it and he jolly well does. I do not know whether it sounded revolutionary in 1904. Many people, especially of a male gender come to a certain age and try to regain whatever was missed earlier, often in a romantic sphere. It is described poignantly here but again the situations constantly border the comic ones: he “relapsed into the sense- which had for him in these days most of the comfort - that he was free to believe in anything that from hour to hour kept him going.” It is a great sentence, isn’t it? On the one level, it is a perfect life philosophy. On the other, it is simple wishful thinking. So, it depends on the user very much.Sometimes i felt that while writing James was not quite sure where he was going to end with all of this. And that let me down somewhat as I was primed on suspense and psychological depth of his short stories. I expected the powerful twist at the end. It has come. But the power of it was actually in the banality of the revelation. Was it James’s strength on this occasion? I am not sure. But I think what was definitely very strong in the novel was leaving a lot of open possibilities at the very end. Since I came up with my perceived “what happened next”, I’ve read very different perceived ends from the others. And this is what I appreciate the most in the novels.And now, the sentences. One certainly need to work on them. Though after the first 20 pages or so it is becoming much easier. Some of them are truly beautiful as only a language can be: This one is about Paris: “the vast bright Babylon. like some huge iridescent object, a jewel brilliant and hard, in which parts were not be discriminated nor differences comfortably marked. It twinkled and trembled and melted together, and what seemed all surface one moment seemed all depth the next.” In general, the sense of place in the book is magic.And not all of them are so long. This one is almost Joycean: “He only glowered grandly at the tops of the old gables.”But some of the sentences, while deciphered individually, do not come to much in terms of meaning. I guess it is not always the point. The idea has come to me quite late in the book to listen to it on audio. And yes, it is great. These sentences flow audibly with all musicality of the language. And the dialogues stood out as well. I might listen to the whole book one day.I am new to James. I liked this novel a lot. But it did not beat for me “Aspern papers” and other stories in the only other book by him I’ve read before so far The Aspern Papers and Other Tales. Those were “deeper” using the one of James’s favourite words in this book. This novel is clearly not for everyone.

Lermontov What a monumental, sprawling and alive animal of a novel it is! On the one level, everything in this book is built on negation. Negation of climax: in many episodes, the suspense is being built, the scene is being carefully crafted but then something you expected is not happening, total anticlimax. Negation of Proust: the book is almost as big as the famous Proust’s masterpiece. It seems, Proust haunts the author both in literary and personal sense. The most interesting chunks of this novel is written as a stream of consciousness. But it cannot be more different from Proust. Instead of having one narrator strongly associated with the author, Cohen inhabits a dozen of his characters. In the process, he is creating a very memorable, distinctive cast, each of them with their unique voice. And the most devastating negation is that of romance. The poem by Lermontov I’ve started with quintessentially summarises the doomed love story at the core of this novel. A beautiful but married heroine Ariane, the heir of disappearing nobel Genevan protestant family, is falling for a sparkling alpha-male Jew, Solal. She is blinded by passion. He is cynical, knows everything in advance, but cannot resist. In the novel, she is compared to Anna Karenina. But we made to believe that she is too submissive and too naive to be like Anna. If he is a Don Juan, he is the failed one. He seems to struggle whether he is really alpha-male or he is just convincing himself to pretend for her love to last. In any case he in confused, tired and insecure. And they both persistently and painfully perform an act in front of each other. In this respect, the novel is more like 19th than the 20th century one. “Passion, alias, love, was a complete and utter shambles too. If unaccompanied by jealousy, it meant boredom. If attended by jealousy, then it was sheer, animal hell. She was a slave and he was a brute. Novelists were a disgrace: a gang of liars who dressed up passion and made brainless males and females chase after it. Novelists were disgrace: they were the suppliers and flatters of the owning class.”In spite of this, the book contains a few chapters of the most beautiful odes to love, youth and melancholy in I’ve read:“I stand alone upon ice floe, says he who once was young, broken-bodied and already dying on the ice floe which carries me oh I know whither through the night, I hold up my feeble hand and bless the young who on this night grow drunk on words of love beneath the infinite, hushed music of the spheres. Alone I stand upon my ice floe, and yet the rustle of spring is still in my ears. I am alone and old upon an ice floe, and night has fallen. So says one who once was young.”But the romance does not start until you are well into the book. The first third is a brilliant and merciless satire on the society with its ridiculous norms and aspirations. Cohen leaves us in the company of unforgettable, set of characters - the Deums, the family of Adriane’s husband. His adopted parents, petty bourgeoisie, are almost poignant in their feeble attempts to enter the noble society. Deum the young is trying to climb the ladder in the League of Nations. Those scenes made me properly laugh. There is also a bunch of wandering Jews, the relatives of Solal, eccentric and unique in there life-loving. They brighten the pages.So, i said it is like the 19th century novel. But it is not the 19th century novel. All those negations are just the surface layer. The book cuts much deeper than this. It goes all the way into the underbelly of the 20th century. Or maybe, even deeper than that back into many centuries, something primordial and sinister. The year of the story is 1936. It is Europe. Solal is a Jew. But he is French as well, he is cosmopolitan and he represents the power in the society. That is until the ground starts to crumble under his feet. That is until he is made to choose. He is made to perform this artificial and cruel choice by picking up one part of his self and discarding with the other. And he has to act in a way that is only honourable one left. But as a result, he is trapped and his mind unraveling. He ends up as an outcast from the society he was shining in. He is also trapped within the role he made for himself in relationship with Ariane. And then, how wide is the gap between being a victim and the cruelty equating to being a murderer? Not very wide it appears.When talking about this novel, the Chapter 35 is often mentioned where Solal seduces Ariane by lecturing her on different seduction techniques and the animal spirit of human nature. I did not like that chapter and found it quite superficial and dated. For me the most important is chapter 93 and everything that follows with the speed of a train no-one can stop. Farewell to the anticlimax. It is when Solal is trying for the last time to change something in his situation, trying to find hope in vain. On the streets of Paris surrounded by walls covered with anti-Semitic trash:“Standing motionless with his back to the wall, he moves his lips. “Christians, I thirst for your love. Christians, let me love you. Christians, fellow creatures doomed to die, companions on the earth, children of Christ whose blood I share, let us love one another,” he murmurs, and he stares at those who past by and love him not, and furtively he holds out a begging hand, and knows that he is acting foolishly, that nothing will do any good.”I’ve seen comparison of Ariane and Solal to Francesca and Paolo from Dante’s Inferno. I think the comparison to Zweig and his wife is more poignant, even if it misses on the forbidden romance and jealousy. The novels dwells on the issue which has resurfaced acutely in our time - the question of belonging, the question of identity. When the rising bigotry and intolerance in our societies, makes us face impossible choices of discarding with a part of ourselves to conform, what is our collective future? Why do we need us and them, be it the Jews, the Muslims, refugees, immigrants, the other. This is the novel not so much about the doomed romantic love, but about the eternal struggle between the animalistic and the divine within the human nature. It deserves to be widely read. It is an outstanding work of literature. PsThat is the one of those cases I wish I could read in French. I suspect this novel is very difficult to translate as it contains so many different voices, colloquial and poetic language. And I am not overblown by the English translation. I think it has lost the music, though I could see it was a big effort. I alternated between the English and the Russian translations, so it took me even longer than usual to read this thousand pages. I am sure I’ve missed a lot but I do not have regrets.

Most of these myths even today find many hints of authentication. Perhaps the most striking is the ongoing evidence of panning for gold through staked-out sheeps’ hides in the lower Svaneti district — hence the ethnographic link with a ‘Golden Fleece.’"" says Peter Nysmith in his bookGeorgia: In the Mountains of Poetry. It was the one of the first countries which adopted Christianity in 337 AD. But the geography was, to some extent a destiny of this small nation of the South Caucuses. For centuries it has been stuck between 3 empires - Persia (later Iran), Ottoman (conquered Byzantine in 1453) and later - Russian empire. The Russians formally colonised Georgia in the beginning of the 19th century. I always wanted to visit this place and to know more about it. Unfortunately, I have not managed to go there yet though i knew a few Georgians since my university days. And when I've read and enjoyed The Eighth Life, I thought it is the time to know more about this land. Unfortunately, there is not much written in English or even in Russian which would give one the initial historical overview of the country. This book seems to be the only easily available source. I would not say I did not struggle reading it. It is written in this telegraph style when a paragraph contains huge amount of information and the names packed tightly. To some extent, it is understandable, but i was reading it as penetrating through the jungle. Also I found at least one mistake. And I am far from being specialist. The Khazars, powerful nearby state in the 8th century, have converted into Judaism, not Islam, as the book points out. It has become better as the centuries progressed. I think the author is more interested in the modern period and it shows.But what a fascinating history and sophisticated culture these people possess. And it is amazing they've managed to keep it through huge amount of disasters and calamities. I just make a few points out this book which I want to investigate further:1) Golden age and Queen Tamar. They've had a female Queen as early as 1178. Her reign was the pinacle of Georgian prosperity and military power. Rustaveli in his epic The Man in the Panther's Skin reflects on her coronation ""a lion cub is just as good, whether male or female"". Maybe not very progressive view on a class, but certainly quite advanced female rights perspective:-) Initially she married a good for nothing Russian nobel for political reasons. But that was not satisfactory. Contemporary chronicle was not very flattering: ""the Russian when drunk showed his Scythian habits... utterly debauched and utterly depraved he even went for sodomitic behaviour"". So she kicked him out and married a proper Ossetian prince. They were very happy together. He fought wars. She governed. Later, in 1201 a certain Seljuk khan challenged her by declaring ""every woman is feeble-minded"" and offered her to become his concubine or worse. She replied with grace : ""You rely on gold and numerous warriors, I ... on God power"". And the Georgians totally destroyed him eventually taking the booty containing the Arabic treatise on Galenic medicine ""Book of doctors"" which was used for centuries since then.2) Russia-Iran-Georgia in the end of 18th beginning of 19th. Apparently Catherine the Great waited for the Persians to attack and totally destroy Tbilisi in the late 18th century before providing the promised help. Later it would become very easy to colonise the weakened country. Rayfield points out that the similar tactics was used by Stalin 150 years earlier while the Russians let Hitler troops to suppress the Polish uprising in 1945 ""making it more easy to annexe the protracted country"".3) The role of Beria, the Stalin's henchman, evil figure who presided over the purges after 1937. He was sociopath and the rapist as a hobby. He also governed very successful development of the Atomic bomb. But apparently he protected Georgia and the Georgians and when Stalin died he reversed his decision to send the Georgians to Siberia was the alleged cooperation with the Germans during the war.4) Pro-Stalin appraisal in 1956. I did not know at all, that when Khrushchev came to power and revealed some extent of Stalin's crimes, the Georgian students and youth did not believe it, continue to idolise Stalin and staged protests and demonstration which drown more than 10,000 people in Tbilisi, many from out of town. They tried to seize the main telegraph and radio stations, but were of course brutally suppressed by the military. At least 21 people were gunned down and murdered. I knew of course about the support Stalin has had and still has. But I did not know that the young people did something antigovernment inspired by him.I am not even going to talk about the history of the last 30 years. Now I am intrigued even more than before reading this book.

I do not understand how the book which is dealing with quite a claustrophobic subject manages to have so much empty space and air in it. Maybe it is the quality of writing. The prose is economic, sparse and not solely words have meaning. It seems, even those spaces between the words, those silences and those explanations that are left out end up meaningful as well. The book also leaves a lingering aftertaste. Something shapeless and non-verbal, like a ghostly presence without tangible image or thought.The plot is simple: what if an object or a phenomenon which surround us disappear. Not simply the objects, but the memories of them, those individual particular bits of consciousness which comprise the identity. How it would be if you look at an object, but it stops representing something meaningful. We all face such moments in our life. I’ve read once somewhere that love is over when you look at the old photo and you do not feel pain anymore… But, what is in the extreme? The book probes this to the bone, but does it with gentleness and subtlety. The thoughts which go beyond the usual limits of our comprehension, what happens if a part of you disappear living an empty whole? First figuratively, then maybe even not? How our mind can perceive non-existence, or rather a slow transformation between here and there? While reading, I was thinking about a Buddhist concept Anattā  (is a composite Pali word consisting of an (not, without) and attā (soul). The term refers to the central Buddhist doctrine that ""there is in humans no permanent, underlying substance that can be called the soul."" from Wiki). Or, just in common sense fashion, where is the limit of our identity, what do I need to lose to stop being me? Would it still matter then? The good thing about this novel that it avoids the answers. It reads almost like a documentary, like someone’s dairy. It just states the facts and the details of everyday existence with the metamorphoses which look shocking to us, the readers, but not that shocking, almost mundane to the characters. There is another thought provoking thread in the book. Some people in this society is immune to the phenomena of disappearance. They are hunted by the authorities. So quiet often they are hidden by the “normal” people. The main character hides her editor as well. Is it the act of resistance? Is it enough? What are the hopes of the people in such situations? What is considered to be brave? There are certainly some connotations of the situation during the World War 2 when some people chosen to hide the Jewish neighbours and some have chosen to renounce them. But in general, can one judge what is fatalism and what is resistance while never been in such a situation? There is almost Kafkaesque sense of futility of a big struggle. It is probably not a coincidence that the one of the main characters is named just R. However, there are a lot of happy moments in that disappearing transient space. There is kindness. And there is beauty, like a dog following the movement of the sun to enjoy its warmth, or the sound of the falling snow.The minor problem I’ve had that the book contained a novel within the novel written by the main character. Two narratives were following a symmetrical trajectory meeting at the similar allegoric situation eventually. I found the second narrative more distractive than helping. But it did not ruin the book for me. Finally, the novel contains a piece of useful “advice” that is as uncanny to find there as it is relevant to the situation many of us find ourself at the moment:“The healthiest way of living in the secret room was to wake in the morning thinking about the things that had to be done during the day; there, at night before going to bed, to check that everything had been accomplished, whether satisfactory or not.

And it is a harder call, if you like me are not armoured with this work by Marquez. I personally prefer Borges and Cortazar. For the first two chapters, I really thought i was going to admire this book. For a while now, I've been trying unsuccessfully to find something good from modern Iranian fiction. And for the first two chapters of this novel, I enjoyed the blend of the family's story with Iranian history peppered with traditional Central Asian folklore. It reminded me a book of old Persian and Tadjik fairytales I've read as a child. But then i realised that the story is being told by a ghost of the 13 year old girl burnt to death, but still pretty much present in the life of the family. And it went downhill for me from there. All the usual magic realist tropes were present there: the ghosts in huge quantities, the rivers of tears, the stopping of the time, the women's exodus to look for their dead children, black snow falling etc., etc. It was very pity as the other mystical elements of traditional Persian storytelling were buried for me in this hotchpotch. There were two more things which rubbed me in a wrong way. The first was the simplification of the politics. The story is told from the perspective of a well-off cosmopolitan family who became the victims of the Islamic revolution. They endure enormous personal loss. But they still manage to drive an expensive American car and build a huge house in a remote village. And I felt the story was understandably full of angst and bitterness not only for the victims but also for their lost cosmopolitan life style. What was missing for me is why and how so many poor people supported this barbarous regime at the first place. They are represented at the book at best misguided and at worst barbarians with the ""calloused hands"" murdering alive mermaid.Another thing I did not like is how Azar re-imagined the last days of Khomeini. I thought it was primitive. I have to admit that I personally do not like when the dictators appear at the novel without good reason and the authors are trying to speculate about their thoughts and characters. It is often happens with Hitler or Stalin. I do not mind when a whole book is devoted to the one of them or when they have just cameo appearance. But trying to re-imaging their thinking in an episode normally does not lead to a good result. Here, I doubt Khomeini was so much afraid that he wet himself or he devoted his last minutes thinking about his first masturbation. Why do we need it in this novel?And now, the last maybe minor complaint - love scenes! At the middle of it all, all this violence, all this magic and all this realism, we have two scenes which borderline cliches. Here we go:""The man plunged wildly into her and she grabbed greedily at his hardened loins. Later, when each of them remembered that wild, rebellious night in the recesses of their heart, they could not recall, how many times they climaxed inside each other... three times?""  And guess what?  ""At the end, they found themselves high upon the enlightenment of love"". I was so happy for them, but i was glad that they got it over with. That was page 112. I really dreaded that would continue. Fortunately, after one more chapter with another two characters, the torrent of love-making activities described as above have subsided. Now, to good things. I have to admit, i've exhausted my energy somewhat writing about what i did not like. But I liked the poetic language in many cases. I think the incorporation of Persian folklore was successful, if only it was not mixed with the magic realism that much. I enjoyed her forays into Zoroastrian traditions. The scene with the fire and the enchanted villagers was really memorable. Though I do not share her excitement with Zoroastrian religion. She seems to juxtapose the Islam and Zoroastrianism. But i think, she herself shows that in extreme the older traditions could be as well self-destructing.Another element I really appreciated was her intertextuality. She and her characters love books. It shows all the way through the novel. I was not particularly excited by the lengthy lists of books' titles in the text. I did not think they brought much. But I loved the poetry she quoted. And closer to the end, I've discovered the new author, Herve Bazin with: Viper in the fist.A mixed bag for me, but I can see why people would like this novel. ...more",Notes are private!,1,41,1,"Mar 30, 2020",Apr 2020,"Mar 30, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35708940-the-enlightenment-of-the-greengage-tree

I have not enjoyed the work of classic as much since I've read The Divine Comedy earlier this year. The part of it might be because I've read it in Russian translation by wonderful Boris Pasternak, the poet and the Noble Prize winner for Doctor Zhivago. The poetry of the translation is exceptional.I did not know that Faust was historical figure and he was the part of the German folklore for a long time before Goethe and his friends from the ""Sturm und Drang"" literary movement took his story as a theme of their own work. Only Goethe's play has become famous.I would not try to analyse it. I just put a few brief observations. Probably not unusually, I've preferred the first part containing Margarita's story. It was truly original in its plot and its conflict. The characters he has created since have become archetypical. The second part throws the net much wider, raises a lot more questions varying from the philosophy of the Antiquity to the creation of the artificial intelligence: ""With the years passing, the crafty mind of a thinker will create an artificial mind"". But I enjoyed it less as I found it less innovative even if equally profound. Mainly, Goethe refers to the Antique characters following a well trodden path since at least Dante. In his case though, the core story is related to Helen of Troy and Faust's obsession with her.Coming back to the first part, I was fascinated by one sentence Mephisto said which made his part in the story much more ambiguous and open for interpretation. He said:""I am part of that power which eternally wills evil and eternally works good.""That is taken from the English translation. The Russian is even more ambiguous: ""I am a part of a force that creates good while wishing evil."" I do not know what Goethe has originally said in German, but it makes Mephisto much more complicated character that just simple bearer of the evil to the world.Bulgakov in his The Master and Margarita has created similar, even more amplified ambiguity for his Wolland. It has always puzzled me there. I've read it relatively young and I was always thinking is Wolland a baddie or a goodie? It is difficult to say without going into too much of theological arguments. But even that might not help with the literature. In general, i was amazed how much Bulgakov has taken from Goethe's story. I would never guess. Maybe it is time to re-read him with this hindsight.Goethe- what a poet, what a thinker! And my applauses to Pasternak as well.""If ever I to the moment shall say: Beautiful moment, do not pass away!

It is an Italian classics, which according to the introduction, is not much loved but the Italian children. Allegedly, they are studying it at least 3 times during their school years.I've started it a few weeks ago. And during these few weeks it has become unexpectedly and eery topical. The last part described an epidemic of plague in Milan in 1630. It seems that not much has changed in the human reaction on the coming threat or in the management of these things by the government and public health authorities. The plague has been brought then by the armies moving through the city to fight the war. The authorities were warned of a danger. But “The reasons of interest and prestige which had set the imperial forces in motion were more weight than the considerations mentioned by the doctor.""As far as the public is concerned, they went through the same stages our societies were going recently and still going at the moment: disbelief, careless behaviour and ignorance, then unfounded terror and, in some cases, prejudices and trying to find a scapegoat to blame. Manzoni says: ""Ignorance often inspires courage at a time for caution, and caution in a time for courage."".But he also talks about the acts of courage and human sacrifice. The one of the characters, Father Christoforo is looking after the victims of the plague in lazaretto until his last breath...These scenes at the end of the novel have slightly overshadowed for me that it contains much more. Also it is not all gloom. It ends well (hardly a spoiler). I really liked the first part of the novel. Manzoni writes with the good sense of humour and irony. There are even scenes one can laugh at.The plot is really simple. A peasant boy wants to marry a peasant girl. But a villain aristocrat tries to ruin everything as he makes a bet to have the girl. There is a lot of clergy involved, both good guys and less good guys. The tone is often extremely pious which has put me off a bit. The plot is quite didactic as well.However, the historic analysis Manzoni incorporate in this novel is quite interesting. Quite likely, it tells us more about early 19th century when the novel was written than about the 17th century when the novel is set. But in any case it is fascinating to find out about such matters like the bread revolts in Milano or how the people communicated remotely when many of them could not write (through someone who could) and misunderstandings it caused.The article by ""Economist"" about this book, which is somewhat unfairly under the paywall.

This was also nominated for this year Booker International. Maybe unusually, but I’ve decided to read this book after finishing The Thirty Years War. This was also nominated for this year Booker International. Maybe unusually, but I knew about Tyll Ulenspiegel since my school days. Bizarrely, the legends about him were included in our school’s program of foreign literature. We’ve studied an extract from The Legend of the Glorious Adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel in the Land of Flanders & Elsewhere. Though it is fair to say i do not remember much from those days. This novel was written in a 1867 novel by the Belgian author Charles De Coster. De Coster took the hero of the German folklore tales, gave him the girlfriend Nelle and a sidekick friend and transferred him into the reality of the late 16th century’s Germany and Flanders. He kept his trickster spirit, made him a witness of the war and added his role as freedom fighter against the Spanish oppression in the 80 years war in Flanders and the Netherlands. It seems, Kehlerman has done the same trick, but placed his hero in Germany a few decades later. I’ve fetched De Coster’s book just now and it seems very good. It is a fragmentary picaresque tale with the elements of contemporary philosophy, a murder mystery and the supernatural. For whatever reason, it was very popular in the Soviet Union. There is a beautiful Soviet movie (1976) modelled on this novel and the paintings by Bruegel the Elder. Here is the short beginning sequence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5BFD.... There is also an opera based upon this book.So all in all, I was very much intrigued to pick up “Tyll”. And, it seems, Kehlman has borrowed quite a few things from De Coster. He gave Tyll a friend Nelle. Tyll’s father was prosecuted by the Inquisition in both books. Tyll is buried alive in both books as well. The idea of Tyll thinking about immortality and the meaning of the time seems to be present in both books as well. The historical period and the context of two novels are closely comparable as well. Without fully reading De Coster’s book, I am not sure how I feel about the similarities between the two stories. Generally, I am not a big fun of the secondary retelling. But it seems, Kehlmann has changed quite a lot for his book to stand on its own. For me the strongest and original side of this novel was its atmosphere, its lyrical prose. And of course Tyll. He does not come across as a trickster, more like a person caught up in his own time and desperately trying to escape by constantly hopelessly moving.  “He tells himself often, life simply leads you somewhere or other - if you weren’t here, you would be elsewhere, and everything would be just as strange.”. There is a lot charm and melancholy in him as a character. And when he is present on the page, the novel comes alive. But the magic is disappearing when he is not there though. It might be just me, but I thought purely historical elements of the book were not its strongest. Kehlmann is trying to be accurate with the history. And it is probably good. But I’ve just read a book of the proper narrative history of the same events. So I knew where he was going with his characters - real historical figures. And his story just dragged for me a bit. There was no particular subtlety in suing historical information. It seemed some stuff was incorporated just to show his research. For example, “Pour Dieu et pour elle” was a motto of Prince of Braunschweig when he was going into the battles. “Elle” there was devoted to Elizabeth, the wife of Friedrich, the Winter King who allegedly was the main culprit of starting the war. It is mentioned in the novel without a good reason of being there as far I am concerned. Elizabeth and Friedrich are in the cast of Kehlmann’s main characters. He uses the tool of telling the story from inside of their heads. And while Friedrich part was not too bad, it did not always work for Elizabeth. I could not imagine flesh and blood women who has lost everything thinking like she did in the novel. Maybe with the exception of this phrase:“She squinted into the snowstorm. It had grown cold. Here I sit, she thought, Queen of Bohemia, Electress of the Palatinate, daughter of the King of England, niece of the King of Denmark, grandniece of the Virgin Queen of Scots, and can’t afford firewood.”The novel was much stronger while appealing to the universal timeless themes, I thought. For example, about our choices in life: “There are only a few moments when two things are possible, one path as much as another. Only a few moments when you can decide.”  Or about the war: “The war didn’t seem to him something manmade, but like wind and rain, like sea, like the high cliffs of Sicily that he had seen as a child.” I enjoyed quite a bit his prose. There were a few amazing scenes. In one of them, Tyll has made people throwing their shoes into the air. The another was the scene of a battle from a civilian point of view. It reminded me the scene from War and Peace with Pierre Bezukhov grasping for meaning of it all. Reading this novel reminded me of Laurus. They both possess a strong main character trying to live their life through hard times. But while Tyll here thrives for illusive immortality, Laurus there was using his supernatural gifts to heal.There is a lot to like and a lot to question in this novel. Overall I would not recommend to read the real history before plunging into this book as i did. But even though I found a lot to think about and enjoy.3.5 rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Mar 06, 2020","Mar 10, 2020","Mar 06, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/48586095-tyll

It has been long time I had this book on my shelf. And it has attracted me for two reasons: firstly, my lack of knowledge of this period of European history (17th century) and secondly, historiographic perspective. This book has been written by a young female historian just before another devastating disastrous conflict (World War II 1939-1945) which has affected almost the same territory and more but 300 years later. Respectively, I was interested to find out how she wrote history at that time.I’ve never heard about this 30 years war before. Or so I thought until i’ve started reading this book. But then I realised I did. It was when I was around 11 years old reading The Three Musketeers We had a very popular TV movie in Russia as well. And I still remember the episode of three musketeers and d'Artagnan (apparently the real historical figure as well) were protecting La Rochelle fortress from the devious supporters of Cardinal Richelieu. Of course i was passionately on the side of the courageous musketeers. That war between the gougenots and the catholics in France was taking place at the same time as the 30 years war. There is a certain overlap in historical characters notably Richelieu, but also Buckingham, the favourite of James I, as well and some others. Back to the present, or should we say, to the more remote past. This book has appeared to be a straightforward, well written narrative history of the conflict. If one requires an introduction to this war, it might still be useful. The scholarship and diligence of Wedgwood is out of the question. It is also quite entertaining in its own way and easy to read. She is very good in portraying the relevant historical figures. She normally starts with the description of their character and appearance, so it is easy to imagine a human being beyond the pure history. Sometimes though she is getting slightly carried away. For example, Wallenstein, the one of the key military leaders on the side of the Empire, is “the old sick” man when he was barely 50. While for Bernard, “his harsh virtues one would not deny”. But his engraving shows “egoistic mouth”. I wonder how “egoistic mouth” is supposed to look like and who from our current politicians possess this inhibiting deformity. I wish she would spend more time writing about the impact on the society and the ordinary people. She does not do it enough. But when she does it, she is effective in portraying the scale of devastation and how the contemporary armies looked like. Reading her, I could barely imagine the chaos and terror the ordinary people felt while the armies where moving around dragging a train of non-combatants behind including children and women, leaving decease everywhere, stealing, plundering and ruining everything not to leave any stuff for the other side. I mention briefly only one episode. After the breaking the siege, the Imperial army sacked the city of Magdeburg in 1631. Unpaid, the soldiers were given the permission to plunder the rich city. The chaos of violence insured in the process of which the fire has started. At the same time soldiers went even more out of control. “They were reports of gang rape of minors and tortures” (Wiki). Out of 25 thousands people only 5 thousands survived. Ironically, but maybe not surprisingly, the army was destroyed in the process as well. Though incomparable, it has reminded me how Napoleon has started to lose in Russia after Moscow’s fire; or how Hitler has lost eventually at Stalingrad. It seems, the war does not change through the centuries. Only the weapons do.However, if one is really interested in the history of the 30 years war, this book has got a lot significant limitations. It focuses on the events and historical figures, so it is a narrow political history. Respectively it brushes over social, cultural and economic side. It does not pay any significant attention to the courses of the conflict or at least simplify them to the actions of certain individuals like Fredrich of Palatine, Wallenstein, Gustav Adolfus, the King of Sweden. She does not attempt too much interpretive work. But when she does, it is not convincing. For example, “the political effects of the war were more distinct than its social and economic results.” It is about the conflict lasting 30 years where around 8 min people perished and practically all area of modern Germany was devastated. Or: “The absolutist and the representative principle were losing the support of religion; they gained that of nationalism. The term Protestant or Catholic lost their vigour, the terms German, Frenchman or Swede assume a gathering menace. The struggle between the Hapsburg dynasty and its opponents ceased to be conflict of two religion and became the struggle of nations for a balance of power.” I think, she is looking at the 17th century from the perspective of pre-war years of the 20th century or maybe even little earlier - 19th century when the nationalism was properly formed. I am not convinced the national agenda was there just yet all together at all. Sometimes, she succumbs to national stereotypes which look slightly anachronistic as well: “With Arnim (a Saxon general) the heart was stronger than the mind and that rigid, almost tragic sense of honour, the “aufrichtigkeit” which knows no compromise, the strength and the undoing of the German, stood between him and the betrayal which might have saved his country”. Did he know that Germany is his country not Saxony? So “sense of honour” and “no compromise” is a typical German feature?In spite of these limitations, I think it is a worthwhile book to read. It is especially the case if you are interested in historiography. It represents now the document of its time (late 30th of the 20th century). It shows how people were writing history and how this has changed. And it gives to a non-historian like me a very good idea about the key players and sequence of events in the 30 years war. ...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Feb 28, 2020","Mar 06, 2020","Feb 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/287542.The_Thirty_Years_War

The book is quite shorThis is the first novel by Aleksandra, the Polish native speaker who leaves in Europe and who has written this book in Spanish. The book is quite short and I've read it in one sitting. It is a wonderfully subversive comical story about a Polish neurotic man who finds himself captivated in Liege's mental hospital. The main reason is that he is writing his book in Antarctic language. The language is obviously not his native. And apparently, this fact creates all sorts of problems. Some of them are required to be cured medically.It is evident that Alexandra has used this novel to contemplate about the writers and the importance of the language they used. Who owns a language? In a quite light hearted manner she explores a number of quite serious questions. She touches upon military patriotism and the nativism which is on the rice in some places in Europe. She talks about a general level of ignorance of the Western Europeans about the Eastern Europeans while all the countries are bulged together into a perceived but non existing identity. I think, the same is related to the Africans as well. Another question she asks about the expectations the readers possess about the writers. For example Ionesco, the French play writer with French-Romanian heritage is attributed the following in the story:""Why do the people expect authors to answer questions? I am an author because I want to ask questions. If I had answers, I would be a politician"".In general, the one of her tricks that many real writers working in a foreign language have appeared in a cameo fashion in the book. She makes them talk. And my understanding is they speak something they said once in their real life. But she does not use the quotations marks. We meet Beckett, Gombrowicz, Karen Bixen and Agata Cristoff and many others. The book is structured as a music ostinato when some of the phrases and actions are getting repeated, almost verbatim. But it did bore me. May be because it was such a short book and the quite funny one. The translation is really superb and well thought through. There is a translator's note at the end.For many of us who live in the cultures different from our own it is much more than abstract set of issues. So I had a big sympathy for the comical misadventures of Aleksandra's character. However, still something was lacking in my experience reading the book and i could not quite put my finger what exactly. Maybe I would like more depth or more layers to it. Villa-Matas does something similar in Bartleby & Co. with more accomplishment and stylistic virtuosity. Still it is a very solid debut novel.3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 21, 2020","Feb 27, 2020","Feb 21, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/50227368-the-palimpsests

He admired him for his acerbic humour, the honesty of his stories and the brevity of his style amongst other things. I've started to search for his work translated in English and found almost none. Handily, NYRB has issued a collection of his short stories the last year and I had a chance to grab it. Julio Ramon Ribeyro was a Peruvian writer and a diplomat who leaved the majority of his life in Europe. However, many of his stories are set in his native country. He was saying about himself: ""My life is not original, much less exemplary. It's just one of many lives of middle-class writers born in a Latin American country in the twentieth century."" Zambra is more categorical: ""Ribeyro writes to live, not to demonstrate that he has lived.""This short story collection is barely a taster. It contains the stories throughout all his career from 1954 to 1994 when he died. One can follow the evolution of his as a writer. His style is changing quite radically from small surreal mysteries in a style of Edgar Poe or maybe early Cortazar through the realistic phase towards more autobiographic stories which we call auto-fiction now. And though his early work has left me unmoved, I loved the middle and later stage.There are 17 short stories in the book. I would briefly mention a few which stayed with me after I finished the collection.""At the foot of the cliff"" is set out in the community of the poor fisherman and disposed people somewhere in Peru. It is told by the old man who managed to make his home under the cliff next to the sea. Later, the other people joined him there on the narrow piece of land looking into the ocean. But of course this vulnerable equilibrium is not going to last. I remember the voice of narrator in this story - fatalistic, but full of wisdom at the same time.""Silvio in El Rosendal"" is about a man who found himself being a facienda's owner. He is grasping with the practical things how to manage his land, but at the same time, he is trying to solve a perceived puzzle made out of flowers in front of his house; the puzzle which might reveal to him the sense of his life. It is a kind of a brief Latin American Oblomov I guess, but with a twist at the end.""For Smokers only"" is probably his most famous story. It is written in the 70s and talks about his love for cigarettes and his not very successful fight with tobacco addiction. The theme might sound very didactic, but it is far from it. It is very poignant and full of references to fellow writers-smokers. Ribeyro said ""A true work must start from the oblivion or destruction (transformation) of the writer's very self. The great writer is not one who truthfully, in detail and intensely, describes his existence, but one who becomes the filter, the weave, through which reality passes and is transfigured"".  Not all of the stories in this collection are equally successful. But it is evident how passionately he is trying to follow this principle, how brave he is in his experiments with different things and how rewarding it eventually becomes. Zambra says that his diaries are fantastic. It seems this genre has flourished between the Latin American writers in the second half of the 20th century. It so happens that I've read Ricardo Piglia's Diaries as well as the ones by Witold Gombrowicz who is the Polish writer but wrote them while he lived in Argentina. Both of them were memorable and profound reads. It is a shame that Ribeyro's ones are not translated as well as the majority of his short stories.

The one in particular, ""Forgiving God"" might be a precursor of The Passion According to G.H..If I could single out, my favourite three stories would be:""The Buffalo"" from the early collection ""Family ties"" about a woman visiting a zoo after the break up with her lover.""The Egg and the Chicken"" - a philosophic but playful mediation about the nature of things and out perception of reality.""Understanding is a proof of making an error. Understanding it (egg) is not the way to see it. - Never thinking about the egg is a way to have seen it. - I wonder, do I know of the egg? I almost certainly do. Thus: I exist, therefore I know. - What I do not know about the egg is what really matters. What I don't know about the egg gives me the egg properly speaking. - The Moon is inhabited by eggs.""""Where you were at night"" - is mythical, Dantesque fable about ascending and descending to some sort of divine essence.

These things are impressive. But still as a whole I felt this collection is lacking a bit of a soul. She is deliberately creating a maze of fragmentary paragraphs even within a single story. And the reader needs to work to put it all together. I guess the idea is that the story would appear unique for every individual reader. Or, moreover, that there is no coherent story and the narrative is not the point. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not work for me. The story I liked the most was ""Mobius strip"". It was probably the most traditional by Rosie's standard, but there she managed to be experimental and lyrical at the same time. The structure of chapters and the structure of the narrative does remind the aforementioned twisted strip, but it is also full of real feelings. ""Future perfect/Arizona"" was not bad either. I enjoyed her verbal dexterity, but was less fascinated by the systematic attempt to use future perfect tense. The exercise has reminded me of school's grammar lessons.The idea of ""Chose your own adventure story"" has been done before many times. The most famous and successful (imho) is Hopscotch. Here it is a little awkward. I tried skipping many times but it felt a little random.Two parts of ""Nativity play"" required some work to put it all together. And I did eventually, I think. It was quite satisfactory exercise at the end.""Document"" seems to be a pastiche on Gothic or late Victorian maybe. But not much more.And the last story ""Postlewd"" is probably supposed to be some kind of ""me too"" creative response. But i did not get how swapping sexual organs are supposed to signify anything.

They are born in Paris from French mum and Syrian atheist dad who fled from the regime in the 80s. But unfortunately their mum dies when they are still young which makes them even more unrooted. One goes to Syria, one stays and drives Uber taxi competing with his dad’s traditional license. What makes this story stand out is the way how it is told. The older brother is the main speaker, but he alternates his voice with the younger brother’s memories about his time in Syria. I always slightly weary of the fictional tales about such experiences. They are rarely convincing. Here as well I had my reservations. But the voice of the older brother, the brother who stays behind, edgy, self-deprecating and sincere, kept me reading. And the literary trick Guven used to finish this novel made the whole incredibly poignant. In its urgency of language and realism, the novel reminded me of Celine, but with much gentler soul. As a byproduct, I’ve learned about the destiny of Romain Gary. He is not mentioned in the novel by name, but described as an emigrant who worn the Goncourt twice. So I’ve traced him by this. In general, it is impossible for the one author to get a prize more than once. But Gary wrote his another winning book after a different name. It was only revealed after his death between his papers.

Otherwise it is very difficult to explain her choices throughout even considering the context. Or maybe, it is not the fate, but a slightly over-powerful hand of the author? Another thing which struck me in this novel is how little love and passion is in there. There is no place for love in that world at all.

I felt really smart about it. It was an easy mystery to solve and the anticipation of the each next chapter was even more pleasant because of this. That is why I was so disappointed that Calvino needed to spell this trick out explicitly at the end of the book. I felt deprived of my little puzzle solved. It is especially upsetting as I’ve read he generally did not like to reveal to the readers his Oulipo tricks. Still it is a beautiful passage.Now, about the novel as whole. Inevitably, I think it has aged a bit. It was probably the third book in the recent few months when i was reading a book the writer within the novel was writing. The idea of populating the novel with the dozen of beginnings of potential novels - the pastiches on different styles does not look that innovative nowadays. Still, i enjoyed the elegance the execution, the effortless switching between the styles and the mini-ploys of some stories. My favourite were the ones with the flavour of Mishima and the latin american one. Initially, I thought it was written after Borges, but he might have gone after Juan Rulfo instead. The whole idea of travelling around the world in stories was great. Is it the way how we read ideally?But the strongest parts for me, the ones which have not aged, were of course meta-fictional. Calvino’s views on the writer’s craft, the nature of the novel and on different ways of reading were the jewels of this little novel for me. For example, on the value of “negative space” in a novel:“… there is always something essential that remains outside the written sentence, indeed, the things that the novel does not say are necessarily more numerous than those it does say, and only a special halo around what is written can give the illusion that you are reading also what is unwritten.”And, if you reading a book and find a passage which, in my case, describes exactly how you feel at the moment, this book is something to treasure: “… every rereading I seem to be reading a new book, for the first time. Is it I who keep changing and seeing new things of which I was not previously aware? Or is reading a construction that assumes form, assembling a great number of variables , and therefore something that cannot be repeated twice according to the same pattern? Every time I see to relive the emotion of previous reading, I experience different sonf unexpected impressions, and do not find again those before…. The conclusion I have reached is that reading is an operation without object, or its true object is itself. The book is an accessory aid, or even a pretext.”...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jan 23, 2020","Jan 27, 2020","Jan 23, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/374233.If_on_a_Winter_s_Night_a_Traveler

But there is no way how I can write about it properly. Hence, many quotes. A woman is facing the moment of epiphany by fatally wounding a cockroach. It catalyses the terrific meditation which makes her to strip off her human identity. It makes her go beyond the fear, beyond what we call beauty and much farther. Then she reassess how hard it is to be fully within the present. This requires the effort to give up on what we call “hope”. I was delaying the present for the promise of the future.”She needs to dispose the language as well. But only when she would have use it to it’s sheer limit when it becomes an “accretion”. “Unsayable could only be given to me through the failure of my language.”By discarding this very human stuff, she is closer to laying off her humanity, ( I want the inhuman inside the person.) By that she is approaching to the pure essence of life, life of the matter. And, by reading her I feel how she merges with this essence, “the thing” which is beyond human comprehension or expression. And how hard she needs to work to get there. By the end I feel like everything around me and on the page murmurs and vibrates with energy: “I tremble in fear and adoration of whatever exists. Whatever exists, and which is just a piece of thing, yet I must place my hand over my eyes against the opacity of that thing. Ah, the violent loving unconsciousness of whatever exists surpasses the possibility of my consciousness. I am afraid of so much matter - the matter vibrates with attention, vibrates with process, vibrates with inherent present time. Whatever exists beats in strong waves against the unbreakable grain that I am, and that grain whirls between abysses of calm billows of existence, if whirls and does not dissolve, that grain-seed. “Weird, but palpable sensation stays after this book.

And since then Don Quixote travels from the country to the country, from the culture into the culture, from a book into a book. The book has been studied, interpreted, included into the numerous canons. I would just focus on my few personal impressions. First, the writing is modern and fresh. Especially in the first part, I was laughing out loud in public places so many times as it was embarrassing. My reading was probably a bit superficial as I did not care too much whether Don Quixote, and Cervantes are pro-Christian or on the contrary, quiet rebels. For me it was more comparable to a Tarantino's movie or any other action comedy. For example this sentence (the scene of Claudia kills Don Vicente just to realise he was faithful to her after all):""Claudia pressed his hand, and her own heart felt pressed, causing her to faint onto the bloody bosom of Don Vicente, who was shaken by a mortal paroxysm.""In the second part, it feels that Cervantes becomes a celebrity, as well as his characters. In the stories of the part, he made them aware of their existence and their status. This metafictional element is fascinating. I am sure, it was very innovative 400 years ago as well. However, to me, it felt Cervantes carried a burden of his glory. I felt he has tired a bit of his characters. Or more likely, I am tired of their adventures which became a little too predictable. As a result, apart from a few vivid incidences, I did not enjoy the second part as much as the first. And I found the growing eloquence of Sancho with his verbosity a little trying.I am very glad I've read the whole book though. It also gave me the opportunity to read a few essays devoted to the book starting from intro by Harold Bloom and finishing Lectures on Don Quixote. I flipped though it reading bits and pieces. He included the short summary by the chapter which I found useful. In general he was his usual snobbish and a tiny bit spiteful self, but informative as well.

This book is no exception. I’ve read it in conjunction with reading Divine Comedy by Dante. But I think it can easily be read stand alone. Again, Borges picks up quite specific and not obvious topics for these essays and often uses Dante’s book for more general very insightful observations.For this , I’ve picked up just two examples. Ugolino - the character from Inferno, while recounting the death of his children from hunger in a Gaol and his further actions says “fasting did more than grief had done”. This line has become the subject of multiple interpretations. The possible one is that Ugolino has eaten his dead children before his death. Especially it is possible as in Inferno Ugolino is gnawing the nape of the neck of his enemy. However, the other possible interpretation that he has simply died of hunger. Borges picks up this story to generalise about the power of literature versus the reality.‘In real time, in history, whenever a man finds himself facing different alternatives, he opts for one, eliminating the others for ever; not so in the ambiguous time of art, which resembles that of hope and oblivion. Hamlet, in this literary time, is both sane and mad. In the darkness of the Tower of Hunger Ugolino devours and does not devour the bodies of his beloved children, and this wavering imprecision, this uncertainty is the strange matter of which he is made up. This was how Dante imagined him, in two possible death scenes, and how future generations imagine him.’This sense of “possibility” is the one of the strongest features that make the art, especially the fiction, so penetrating and that is in turn might affect the future reality.Another essay is about the creatures The Simurgh and the Eagle. Both are composed of other beings. Borges considers the Eagle composed of “thousands of just kings” in the Canto xviii of Paradiso. The Eagle talks and identifies as “I”, not “we”. This allows Borges to bring up the comparison with the other epic poem, from Persia written only a century later by Farid al-Din Attar called “The conference of birds”. The birds are going on the quest to find The Simurgh to bring him as their king. “Thirty birds purified by their efforts, set foot on the mountain of the Simurgh. At last they gaze upon it: they perceive that they are the Simurgh and that the Simurgh is each one of them and all of them. In the Simurgh are the thirty birds and in each bird is the Simurgh”. I like how effortlessly Borges compares the Western and the Eastern culture avoiding any “orientalism”. Additionally, I absolutely admire the idea of this Persian epic. It is on my radar for a long time. I do not think I would go ahead and read it all, though there is a new translation into English. But i might spent some time looking into the person of Farid Din Attar and his connection to Sufis and Neoplatonism.  However even while staying within the context of the Divine Comedy, Borges asks quite unusual questions and poses interesting conjectures. For example, why Francesca (famous lovers Francesca and Paolo) is placed by Dante in Inferno.

My main problem was that it is written in verses and I do not know Italian to read it in original. At the end, I’ve picked up a classic middle of the 20th century translation into Russian in tercinas verse as well. And, I think I’ve made a good choice. After a while, I got used to the pace and the music and the poetry had become palpable. But I only could imagine how amazing it is to read it in in original. Reading was not an easy work as I needed to flip to the notes at least a few times per page. But i got used to it and, at the end, the notes have started to act as as second meta- narrative. I would re-read all the notes related to a chapter before reading the chapter. It helped a lot to enjoy the verses and follow the story.It seems that modern readers often prefer “The Inferno”. I liked it as well. Especially, I enjoyed the architecture of it - downward spiral. And of course, the stories. Francesca and Paolo were the big highlight. I repeat after Borges’s that Dante seemed to be a bit envious of their attachment to each other, that they could be together for eternity if only in Inferno. While his intimacy with Beatrice was possible only through divine love. My modern sensibilities did not appreciate Dante’s treatment of the Prophet Muhammed, though I understand perfectly the historical context. He seems to be treated especially unfairly considering the hypothesis the Dante’s Paradiso is in many ways similar to the Isra and Mi'raj or night journey of Muhammad to heaven (According to Wiki and then initially raised in Miguel Asia Palacios. L’Eschatologle musulmane dans la Divine Comedie suiul de Histoire et critique d’une polemique. — Traduit de I’espagnol par B. Durant. — Arche Edidit,1992). But I guess, one could forget the man of his time.The amount of historical details and Dante’s knowledge is totally striking. I did not know much about Italy in the 14th century. And after reading it, I think i have a good impression how people thought at that time. The Inferno Journey was not scary for me. It was like the journey of discovery. And Virgil was a great guide.Moving on to Purgatory and Paradiso, I was not very much impressed by Beatrice as a guide, after Virgil. She seemed to be somewhat detached. And Dante’s dismay is palpable when she finally takes her place in Heaven (even if the feeling for her is replaced by the feeling of the divine love). But I absolutely admired the architecture of the both places he created. Specifically, I want to talk a bit about the role of mirrors and reflections. Now, for me Dante’s Paradiso will always be associated with the infinite reflections when everything is reflected and multiplied in the image of each other.Apparently, Dante mentions mirrors at least 30 times in the poem. The role of a mirror is to reflect light. He uses mirror as an allegory for the angels who do not need the language as they reflect God. He mentions it first in Chapter XV of Purgatory:Come quando da l’acqua o da lo specchiosalta lo raggio a l’opposita partesalendo su per lo modo parecchioa quel che scende, e tanto si dipartedal cader de la pietra in igual tratta,sì come mostraesperïenza e arte;così mi parve da luce rifrattaquivi dinanzi a me esser percosso;per che a fuggir la mia vista fu ratta.[13, XV: 16–24]He compares here the appearance of the angel to the reflection of the light from the mirror. And, in the process, he elegantly repeats the scientific law of light’s reflection. The power of God is compared by Beatrice to the power creating many mirrors, reflecting in all them, while keeping unity: Vedi l’eccelso omai e la larghezza de l’etterno valor, poscia che tanti speculi fatti s’ha in che si spezza,uno manendo in sé come davanti.In the final chapters of Paradiso, when he loses the ability to speak, he almost become a mirror himself focusing on reflecting the divine love. Although, Borges seemed to think that it indicates that Dante is simply asleep and dreaming of it all.And I finish with the quote from an article I’ve read in Russian (since than, I’ve lost it so I cannot site it properly at the moment):“We can suggest that the whole text of the poem was created like a huge “mirror” which reflected all intentions, all impressions learned by Dante-character in the process of his life and journey in the poem. All phenomena made by the Creator and multiplied by the love of the Poet are getting communicated to the past and future readers, like the light reflected in the universe of the Divine Comedy.”...more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Jan 02, 2020","Jan 14, 2020","Jan 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6656.The_Divine_Comedy

It is almost biblical story of a young man returning to his people, a small group called Jan travelling somewhere in the steppes of Central Asia. The man has left them as a child and now he is coming back eager to improve their life. The story is a journey of the people and him (he is not necessarily leading, in fact, he often follows them) through the steppes and desert in order to survive and to re-learn what means to be human after an eternity of incredible deprivation. It is written in a dreamy, almost hallucinatory way. It is strikingly beautiful and shockingly realistic at the same time. It reminded me a modern novel The Story of a Brief Marriage, but with the more hopeful message overall. It took me a while to realise another association it has awoken. This novella foreshadows some aspects of Pedro Páramo and respectively, all what follows. I am sure Juan Rulfo never heard of Andrei Platonov. His story is written almost 30 years after the Platonov's and takes place on another continent. But there is this very powerful connection through the people who are not alive in the proper sense of the word. In Rulfo's case, they are alive after their death; in Platonov's case they are dead while still being alive.And the ""Return"", a devastating and poignant short story, the reality of coming back from war and realising that nothing will be the same as it was....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Dec 11, 2019","Dec 13, 2019","Dec 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/589257.Soul

You know those idiotic “biographies les romancees” where Byron is cooly slipped a dream extracted from one of his own poems? And there must be on the other hand an abyss of seriousness, and I must make my way along the narrow ridge between my own truth and a caricature of it. And most essentially there must be a single uninterrupted progression of thought. I must peel my apple in a single strip, without removing the knife”.  So tells Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, the protagonist of the “Gift” to his lover about his forthcoming novella. In my view, this is a pretty accurate summary what is “The Gift” as whole actually. But he definitely saved my time and effort in coming up with something half as elegant as this phrase.Probably, it is not surprising in this case to find such an accurate description of the novel within the novel. Nabokov always plays games with his readers. “The Gift” is metafictional in its core. It contains numerous long and short, intertwined and stand alone narratives and poems. The young Fyodor, an emigre and former Russian aristocrat finds himself in Weimar Berlin where he tries to polish his gift as an inspiring writer. The book consists of five parts, and three of those parts are finished and not quite pieces of work by Fyodor. It starts with his poems, follows with his unfinished investigation into the work and fate of his father, the natural scientist and the traveller (of course, plenty of butterflies are in there). It culminates in an study or a short biography of Chernyshevsky, the Russian writer and revolutionary thinker of a sort who was the one of the founders of Social Democratic movement. The rest of the book is Fyodor’s life, thoughts about literature and surroundings, and the mystery of the process of creation. The concepts of a biography and a parody stitches this novel into the whole as a strong thread. Fyodor refers to a parody for the Chernyshevsky’s piece only. But I could not help but think that it applies to the novel as whole. Specifically, in two earlier pieces by Fyodor, Nabokov parodies an attempt by the young author to develop his craft and his skills of self-criticism. The verses of the first part I found particularly underwhelming. It was jolly good when Nabokov used his well known skill of painting with memory in the bits of prose, but those memories, even beautifully written, did not raise any response in me either. They were dear to Fyodor, but too banal and without appeal to me. The really successful witty bits were those when Fyodor was thinking about potential s of his work and was in imaginary conversations with his opponents.The second part about his father was plain boring. That is if you are not into butterflies like me. Again, I hope it was partly the author’s intention to show that effort was going nowhere with Fyodor. But it was a hard work to read. Now, fortunately, we are coming to the stuff I liked. In the foreword, Nabokov is saying that the main “heroine is not Zina (Fyodor’s girlfriend), but Russian literature.”. And it is truly the case. Through Fyodor’s thoughts, Nabokov takes the readers into the excursion through the contemporary Russian literature and criticism starting from Pushkin and ending with Bely and the others. As always with Nabokov, he does not hold punches for those who he does not like (which is the majority). But the comments are always witty and incorporated well into the text. To give just one example, Dostoyevsky “reminds a room with an electrical light switched on during the daytime.” Apart from the main 3 texts produced by Fyodor, there are many more incorporated into the texture of the novel: the extracts from newspapers, real and not, the book s, numerous poems and studies. Nabokov, as Joyce never uses the quotation marks. So it is impossible to trace directly what comes from other sources and what he devices specifically for this book. But it is a part of the game. Unless they are metafictional s, many of these texts are biographical - memories of Fyodor’s childhood, the story of Fyodor alter ego, Yasha, the travels of his father. Apparently, it was an era of biographical novels in a style Zweig and others in Europe and Tynyanov in Russia. In these novels, the author put himself into the shoes of the main character and associated strongly with him. These authors took a licence to imagine their characters and create their fictional portraits adding imaginary details to their lives. Fyodor (and presumably Nabokov) hated this. On the other hand, Fyodor was fascinated what happened to the Russian literature in the 60s of 19th century when it went downhill. Therefore Fyodor decided to create a biography of Chernyshevsky solely by compilation of existing sources. The idea was not to add fictional or psychological insights, but only comment on the existing diaries by Chernyshevsky and the documents created by his contemporaries. As a result, Fyodor came up with a spiteful, comic and slightly absurd compilation which portrays Chernyshevsky as an accident prone, not very profound, but courageous person who was just a toy in the hands of his fate. This portrait was very different from the generally accepted one. Respectively, in real life Nabokov’s publishers refused to accept this part. Though Fyodor, his character, was more successful. Again in this part especially, Nabokov does not attribute any writing, but almost all the text has been traced by Nabokov’s followers back to the sources. Amazing how a skilful writer with an agenda can create a narrative out of facts of someone else life and how vulnerable practically anyone could be in his skilful hands. However, Fyodor does not manage to answer his main question: he does not manage to explain how such an “mediocre” personality has influenced the revolutionary movement in Russia to such an extent.In spite of sometimes being infuriated with Nabokov’s snobbery (characteristically related to the “natives”- Germans and his literary enemies), in spite of being bored by the verses of the first part, I enjoyed this novel as a whole. There were two main sources of joy for me. The first one is seeing the world through Fyodor’s eyes, to be a witness of his fight to create and grasping with his gift. Nabokov is very good in “seeing” the multitude of our reality and he knows this. For example, in one scene, Fyodor thinks what he would want to teach the others. And his example is simultaneous appreciation of someone’s character, the detail of a scene and a reminisce of his own past. I think, later it was called “cosmic synchronisation in prose”.Another joy was a sheer intellectual one - to understand the structure of this beast and to hunt for many little clues and references to other authors he left in the text. For example, in the foreword to English edition he says: “I wonder how far the imagination of the reader would follow the young lovers after they’ve been dismissed.”  Well, the matter is that (view spoiler)[“the young lovers” are going home to be alone for the first time while they do not have a single keys from the place. There were 3 sets of keys and all of them are inside of the house.  (hide spoiler)] So yes, one has to come up with the imaginative solution for this one. And the harder one which I am still not sure about. A gifted poet, another character of the novel says: “ real writer should ignore all readers but one, that of the future reader, who in his turn is merely the author reflected in time.” In fact, in Russian it is even more strong. Literally it is “real writer would spite on the readers” which would be more correctly translated “real writer does not give a damn about the readers.” But this is not my puzzle. I know this about Nabokov. The puzzle is what does he mean by “the future reader is the author reflected in time”? I have a few ideas but I keep puzzling.And the structure is the total aesthetic pleasure by itself. He hints again talking about Chernyshevsky bit that he wants “composing his biography in a shape of a ring, closed with the clasp of apocryphal sonnet (so the result would be not the form of a book, which is in its finiteness is opposed to the circular nature of everything’s existence, but a continuously curving, and this infinite, sentence).” And of course he does it with “The Gift”. In the early part Fyodor sees the picture of a naked woman holding her own portrait. In the last part, Fyodor is talking about a new novel he wants to write about his life which is obviously a reference to the one I’ve just finished.Это последний роман Набокова написанный по-русски.

He was disenchanted with the spirit of revolution being replaced by the lack of hope and evolving repressions. And here I am reading this in the beginning of the 20s of the 21st century.This is the novel about the fate, about the inevitable hand of the big history playing in the life of an individual. Tynyanov has gone through a huge amount of historical documents. But his approach is the one of the artist. He used to say ""When a document finishes, I pick up"". And he has created a deeply psychological portrait of a flawed but very talented man. He has shown his moments of transitory happiness and his sense of history. The novel reads as if one watches a big screen movie when a carefully crafted frame replaces another. When i was reading it, I thought about The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel. And this might be the one of the earliest non-fiction novels in Cercas's definition.Since then I've read The Gift. Nabokov and Tynyanov were writing their books approximately at the same time. But one was in Berlin and one stayed in St Petersburg. I've learned that apparently in that time in Europe the biographical novels like those of Stefan Zweig were really popular. So, to some extent, Tynyanov was a part of this trend. However, i think the connection of Tynyanov with his subject is still deeper than in the Zweig's case with his sense of destiny and historical determinism. Nabokov went opposite way almost proving Tynyanov's formalist theory of repelling from the opposite as a moving force of literature. He wrote a mini-biography of Chernyshevsky solely based upon the documents and without any desire to invent any details or any association with his character. The results in both cases are powerful works of fiction in spite of the opposite approaches.But this one moved me much more, maybe due to the story or maybe due to psychological insight which i found contemporary and universal....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Nov 28, 2019","Dec 09, 2019","Nov 28, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/40513066-death-of-the-vazir-mukhtar

This is the first novel i've read by a writer from Belarus. He has tranAnother book shortlisted for Russian main literary prize ""Большая Книга"" 2019. This is the first novel i've read by a writer from Belarus. He has translated it into Russian by himself or rather he rewrote it for the occasion. I am pleasantly surprised by the result. It is unashamedly post-modern book, very european in its core. He is not afraid not to be original. And it is a good thing as by absorbing some influences he has eventually come up with something pretty unique in its mix. It certainly deserves to be translated into English, but unfortunately I do not think it would happen any time soon. Hence, I write a lot a about it in English. There is no “regional” specifics, social polemic or life under Lukashenko in there. Those things would get him ahead of the queue. And it is a long novel. However, the novel is praised by Svetlana Alexievich who is fellow Belorussian and the Nobel Prize winner. So maybe Fitzcarraldo editions would be interested. They’ve discovered her for the English-speaking universe. As many of the modernist and post-modern novels this one is dealing with the language as the common thread though the whole novel. The novel even starts with a character talking about his fatigue with different languages: Belarussian - “the language one cannot earn money with, one cannot kill, one cannot play with but one already cannot forget."" Russian - ""whatever one wants to tell with this language has happened already, everything replies with the thousand silly echoes and the stink of the letters long cold… The language of heavy iron tube thrown across our lives.” English - “the thing you call ‘English” is just a blown out rubber heart that pumps billion words, not alive heart… Language fast-food leaving the stains everywhere as if our world is just a bunch of napkins on someones table…. How many people think they know English and think that would be enough to make them happy. Naive fools. And how many things we might be able to tell each other if we would refuse this English, if we would be able to tell our “no” to this orgy of mutual understanding”.  He does not spare neither Spanish, nor French or German. But is just the beginning. Then we find out that this character has contracted his own language, Balbuta. He has done it just for himself not to share with anyone else. But then he is tempted to reveal it. From there, he starts to lose control over his creation. And this language is fully realised in the book. In fact, some of the novel is written in it. There are a few poems and some prose. There is a dictionary and grammar in the Appendix to the novel. I did not try to translate the passages, although I am sure one can. (The one of Belorussian poets has translated his poem into Balbuta.) But the sound of the language is wonderful.Structurally, the novel consists of six loosely intertwined novellas. One won’t see many connections until the end. They are written in a different style and have a separate core story. The first is Balbuta’s creation story; the second is set in a small village in the near future somewhere on the Western Border of whatever was Belarus now swallowed by the newly expended Russian Empire. I would call it “dystopian” but the scenario looks positively real. This part is written from the perspective of a village boy with the elements of folklore and fairytales in its core. It is followed by a lengthy story of an old granny initially leaving in the forest and healing people with her magic powers. This granny is kidnapped by the Belarus extreme nationalists to be used for their purposes. The next part is jobless lonely 40 year old man is walking a whole day along the streets of Minsk trying to deliver a plastic package from his mum to some unknown clients of hers. It is clearly a tribute to Ulysses but done without an attempt of any pastiche which I appreciated. There is one more part about a school teacher. And the last, the most intriguing and lyrical, is an existential detective story set in Europe in 2050 when main protagonist, Theresius Skema is trying to follow the trace left by a dead immigrant. He follows his trace through old bookshops the disappearing breed of a place in European cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Prague and Paris (Shakespeare and Company btw). The dead man was most likely a poet. And wonderful poems are sandwiched between these 6 parts. One can trace the echoes of the characters between the novellas, and Balbuta of course is present, but more important is the atmosphere, the common sentiment between those texts. It is like the one of those paintings when the fragments posses a separate meaning, but when you step back a little you can see a whole image, totally different, resurfacing from those fragments. The name of the novel comes from the poem by WH Auden ""In Memory of W. B Yeats"": ""In the nightmare of the dark all the dogs of Europe bark..."".  The Dogs of Europe in the novel are small European nations that nowadays in many cases treasure their european identity much above their national and ethnic ones. However, there is a palpable existential anxiety in the novel for their survival. In the case, of Belarus, the main fear is of it to be swallowed by the huge neighbour in the East. There is an anxiety for the whole Europe not to return to the past with the Wall splitting the East from the West. But the nationalism is not the solution in the book. In fact, in 2050 the national ideas seem to be playing much smaller role. Theresius Skema is of Lithuanian heritage residing in Berlin. While asked whether he is German, he simply answers “I am a Berlinian”. Interestingly, in Western Europe of 205o the men prefer to wear skirts and tights just because it is a fashion. And the sexuality is depicted much more fluid in mainstream. He is married 3 times - twice to a woman and once to a man. I wonder whether this will come true in 30 years. These are just a few nuggets. The book is not about future as much. It is not a dystopia in a classic sense. It is more about the feelings existing now, prevailing in minds of many people of Eastern Europe. But it is also a book about loneliness, about being different and of course about the power of literature and language. The intertextuality is subtle and very pleasant. Joyce is mentioned as well as Ezra Pound. Less well known Paul Celan comes up with a genius if only very sad poem “There was Earth inside them”. And name Skema actually belongs to a Lithuanian Modernist writer Antanas Škėma . As you can see, I enjoyed the book enormously. I am sure it deserves multiple readings (if only not for 800 pages' size). The first and the last novellas were simply brilliant. I think he slightly overindulged writing the part about the granny and that dragged down the whole novel a little in spite of a tight plot of that novella. The book reminded me of two totally different novels The New York Trilogy by Auster and The Seventh Function of Language. There is a very remote echo of Roberto Bolaño lurking in the shadows. However, the amount of poetry, Eastern European context and the original specially constructed language makes this novel its own unique achievement. Столько всего я уже написала по-английски, что мало остается сказать по-русски. Мне понравился этот роман своей европейскостью, что-ли. Когда он изображает западную Европу, чувствуется, что он знает о чем говорит и чувствует свою принадлежность к ней. Такого я не замечала у российских писателей. Они в первую очередь все-таки российские. Ну и в принципе качественный роман. И что он сконструировал язык, который хорошо звучит и в принципе работает, это классно, конечно. История с бабушкой-шептуньей сильно затянута. А в остальном, меня впечатлило.

And that is exactly what this novel did to me multiple times. It is set in a brothel in a South city of K. I think it is Kiev. Some people think it is Odessa. But the location is not that important. It is about the life of these women and their clients during one day and night; and then - during the following next months. Kuprin’s power of observation is enormous. He pays a lot of attention to the background. But equally within quite limited space he creates a bunch of characters so realistic, so vivid that “one can almost touch them” (said by Chukovsky). Tolstoy said it is full of dirt. Some others criticise him for idealising the prostitutes. I did not see any idealisation at all. Only if “idealisation” means giving them back their humanity. Kuprin clearly shows that in majority of cases there is no way out for these women. But there is no cheap sympathy in this novel. In fact, Kuprin shows that these attempts of artificial empathy lead to more disaster; that the desire of superficial understanding would end up in a caricature or additional humiliation. There are many extremely poignant moments in the novel. A young woman finds out she has got a terrible disease. She decides to take a revenge on men through her clients by passing it over. She does it until a very young cadet, the one of her semi-permanent clients, arrives and she decides to spare him. She just does. And she is totally at loss why. There is another moment when a student is reading Prevost's Manon Lescaut to a girl who has temporarily escaped. And the girl is angry with the heroine for being unfaithful. There are many other such nuggets of their life. Majority of them hate their clients but they are full of love which they turn to each other. Both emotionally and physically. I could not believe that such thing is mentioned at that time. Kuprin must be incredibly brave. Of course judging by our standards of 21th century I would like this theme be more visible. But 100 years ago it was probably a total anathema. There is an episodic but important character, Platonov, who is clearly a mouthpiece for the author. (I wish this would be done in a more subtle way from the literary point of view, but i can forgive Kuprin for this). This character has spend a lot of time in this brothel just being there with these girls, their management, guards, doctors, etc. ). He is saying a shocking but very profound thing:“No, horrible are the everyday, accustomed trifles; these business- like, daily, commercial reckonings; this thousand-year-old science of amatory practice; this prosaic usage, determined by the ages. In these unnoticeable nothings are completely dissolved such feelings as resentment, humiliation, shame. There remains a dry profession, a contract, an agreement, a well-nigh honest petty trade, no better, no worse than, say, the trade in groceries. Do you understand, gentlemen, that all the horror is in just this-- that there is no horror! Bourgeois work days--and that is all…”And, I am thinking, is it good or is it bad when sex becomes a business? It is that such life becomes a kind of normality, the same I imagine like in a war zone or maybe actually the same like going to an office everyday? One just has to live their life I guess, to still feel dignity…What strikes me is how universal this novel and how modern it is. It has written in 1908-1915, and maybe there is no legal brothels in the majority of places now. But none of the issues he has raised disappeared. There are still human trafficking, sex-trade and the industry of sex-workers. There are periodic discussion of legalising sex trade. It seems, when brothels were legal 100 years ago it did not seem the solution for the problem. I do not know enough about the current debate. But what i know that often when we talk about these things we forget that there are unique human destinies behind each particular case. (Sounds like a cliche, i know). And this novel is a powerful reminder. And sometimes when people write about these things now it reads more like ticking the boxes rather than what Kuprin has done. “I admire your literary genius and your profound humanity. In particular, you possess a rare and very special gift making the whole groups of people come alive on the pages of your books. It tells about you as a human being who can ascend one the achievements of the epoch and see through them. Reading the one or another page of “Yama”, i was extrapolating its meaning over the whole of Europe - this huge brothel on the age of a catastrophe.” from the letter to Kuprin from Romain Rolland PSI've read in Russian, but the novel is available in English on-line:http://www.online-literature.com/kupr......more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Nov 21, 2019","Nov 22, 2019","Nov 21, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/805630.Yama

Guzel Yakhina's first book Zuleikha has been very successful in Russia and translated into many languages, including English. But I have not read it. This novel is called ""My children"" and it is devoted to the life of Russian Germans of Volga region in the first few decades of the 20th century. Catherine the Great has invited the Germans to colonise certain uncultivated land in Russia and South Ukraine. She referred to them ""My children"" in her speech. That gave the name to this novel. The project was very successful. The Germans has created small agricultural settlements which were very effective and self-sufficient. That is until the Revolution two centuries later when the Soviet policies of collectivisation have created an artificial famine took many lives and made many children homeless. With the start of the Second World War, all the Germans from Volga were deported to Siberia and Kazakstan. Many of them perished. But that is just a background. Very skilfully, Yakhina creates either a cruel fairy tale with the elements of reality or writes about a cruel reality with the elements of fairytales. It is not an accident, that the central role at the beginning is given to the family with the telling name ""Grimm"". However more broadly, it is a story of a German teacher, Jacob Bach who, by will of fate, has become a lover and a husband, and then a recluse and a writer and a father. Constantly grappling with his fear, he is a witness of historical cataclysms tearing apart the familiar reality forever. At the same time, he watches how his words influence this reality for better and for worse. And of course, the river Volga plays the big part.Although the direct analogy would not work, it reminded me Laurus. And I am sure it will be translated eventually.

But here it is exacerbated by the fact that this novel seems to be better known in the West. And i have a few things to say about the translation. So I will stick to English this time. Sasha Sokolov bears the title of the “last Russian writer” that is quite a title considering the tradition. He emigrated from the Soviet Union in the 70s. All his novels were initially published in America. In roughly 15 years between the beginning of the 70s and middle 80s, he wrote 3 novels. After that, he has stopped publishing. “Between the Dog and Wolf” is his second novel. It is based upon his personal experience of working as a gamekeeper somewhere in North Russia in the tributaries of Volga river. He had to hunt, lead other hunters and of course meet a lot of local simple folk (hunters, fishermen, gamekeepers and even poaches). He especially befriended one old man, Pyetr Krysolymov who offered Sasha to stay in his house. According to Sasha he was a soothsayer. All these impressions were the inspiration for the novel. Pyetr’s presence in the novel is very tangible. There is even a character with similar name who seems to be a single wise man in the crowd. But Sasha said his features are spread between many characters. He also requested to put the picture of Pyetr on the cover of the first addition of his book: ( https://vtoraya-literatura.com/pdf/so... )When he published his first novel A School for Fools the critics came back with comparing that book to Nabokov’s novels. According to him, he did not read Nabokov at that time. Nabokov was banned in the Soviet Union. Interestingly, I’ve read somewhere that Nabokov actually praised his first novel. When Sokolov has arrived in the US, he has finally read Nabokov novels. And he has consciously decided to write something very different. Has he succeeded? In my view, I am not sure. I certainly felt some echoes of Pale Fire in this book. Sokolov himself always says that Joyce and Poe has had more influence on him. So he is probably very pleased that this book is compared to Finnegans Wake. I have not read the latter. But from my limited knowledge of Joyce and from reading Sokolov in the original, I do not think this comparison can be taken too far. As far as I know, Joyce has almost created his own language for his novel. Even from reading Ulysses one can gather how much attention Joyce pays to the musicality of language; how he is able to squeeze beyond the limits of its possibilities. Sokolov is good as well, but not at that level. He synthesises very successfully what is already there created by prior writers and generations. I was not totally convinced he has done something so revolutionary as Joyce in terms of the language. However, the novel is still sparkling enough. It is told in three distinctive voices. The leading voice is Ilya Petrikeich Zynzyrela, a one legged artisan who travels from place to place and earns coins from sharpening bland objects (knives, skates anything else). His part of the text is a long rambling letter of complaint to a certain official. It is told in transgressive vernacular, wonderfully imaginative language. Sokolov incorporates a lot into his speech. The character uses the bits of the Russian people’s fairytales (russkie narodnie skazki), creates new derivatives from words, sometimes he creates new words all together which is quite common in Russian vernacular language. Understandably, Illia does not want to follow a simple thread of conversation and jumps from one topic to another often within one sentence. He also uses quite a few of Russian short satirical poems called Chastúshkas. I do not know the equivalent for these in English. I only would say that they could be quite rude and they always rhyme. Sometimes he sings and quotes traditional romances and bard songs from the 70s. Bizarrely, the puzzle of a cabbage, a goat and a wolf's transfer over the river (without being mutually eaten) plays a role in the story. All this mixture reflects Russian popular culture and how Russian peasants used to speak; the language one might still find in those lands or one might have a glimpse in the collection of Russian fairytales. All his references are easy to recognise for any native speaker being born and raised there in Russia. Sokolov also names the one of the characters after Nikolay Ugodnik which is a clear reference to St Nikolas, the one of the most prominent Orthodox Saints. This adds the dimension of religious faith preserved between the locals during the Soviet times. It also adds to the mischief as St Nikolas is also associated with Ded Moroz (Russian Father Christmas) who tends to make miracles and magic transformations. Overall, this part of the text is the most unstructured out of the whole and the most humorous as well. It reads like a stream of collective conscience of the local folk rather than a voice of a single individual. The second voice is a voice of an observer, who lives in the city. Eventually we find out that his name is Yakov Ilyich Palamakhertov . He might be a writer, he might also be a painter. But his voice exists out of space or even time. He just observes through his mental eye either real paintings (Bruegel “Hunters in the Snow”), or more often he writes down the views from his window or his mental images. He moves from one image to another and describes them to us. These part is called “The pictures from the exhibition” after Modest Mussorgsky piano piece. Mussorgsky wrote it in a memory of his dead friend whose exhibition he has visited. The friend was an architect as well as the artist so his exhibition contained his impression from different places and stories starting from Baba Yaga’s hut and ending with Kiev’s Golden Gate. Sokolov uses it as an inspiration for his word sketches. Yakov is only half present in this part. It is what he sees is important. For me, it is the best part of the novel. It is etherial, patchy and very visual. It also contains two evident pastiches in Gogol’s and later and more briefly, Dostoyevsky’s style.The third part is named “Notes of a hunter “ and later in the text “The notes of a binging hunter” (Zapiski Zapoinogo Okhotnika”). The allusion is evidently to Turgenev’s sketches. But the part is made in verse. There are 37 of them in total. We find out a the end that those poems are work by Yakov as well. He writes them when he lives somewhere at the same places as Illia and works as a gamekeeper. Eventually he puts all these poems in a bottle and throws into the river, presumably for us to find and assess his genius. That is how he refers to his work in the last poem. I think, this part is an attempt by Sokolov to move from very unstructured sea of a text which is Illia’s parts through descriptive language of Yakov-observer and towards a formally constrained experimentation with the verse. For me, it was the least successful part. Some of those poems are touching and original. But the majority are imitations of style of different other poets. And, in my humble opinion, they do not reach the quality of the originals.I recognised very clearly the one imitating Eugene Onegin, the one imitating an urban romance, a few - Brodskii IosifJ, a fellow emigrant and the Nobel Prize winner, at least one is clear pastiche on another Nobel Prize winner Pasternak Boris, and the whole bunch of the poem are written under direct influence of the symbolists - Alexander Blok, Andrey Bely, Brusov. There are even allusions in the poems names to these authors. With the small exception, I just did not care for many of these poems both formally and in terms of the imaginary they’ve created as they are clear imitations of style. I'd prefer him to create some original poetic technique as well. But the experiment of combining both unstructured vernacular and formal poetry within the novel is brave and should be applaud for. I think, only Nabokov's Pale Fire has pulled it off. But what is actually going on in this novel? I think anyone who tried to read it asked himself this question. On the first reading, I could admire the language tricks and some jokes; i could picture the life of the river people. But i did not grasp the coherence of the whole or the fact there is none. On the second reading, I think I’ve got it. So below my two interpretations. I urge you not to read them unless you’ve read the novel already. It might deprive you of a pleasure to get there yourself. Realistic version:(view spoiler)[Ilia is father of Yakov Palamekhetov, (not the one-legged Alfeev who appeared in the hospital episode). Orina is mother of Yakov. Yakov calls her Maria for some reason. But he refers to her as “mama” in a one of the later poems. When Orina kicked Illia out, he lived for some time under the stairs (both Illia and Yakov mention this and refer to collecting of sweet wrapping). Yakov fancies a local underage girl who ends up having a fleeting affair with Illa and sailors. Later Illia has his accident in which he loses the leg and Orina potentially dies. However, it is not certain. After the hospital (and presumably quite a few years) Illia appears in Zavochie and starts working as a grinder. Yakov already grown up appears there independently and works as a hunter, drinks and makes poems. Orina might have appeared as well seducing many local men and causing somehow their premature death. Illic’s crutches got stollen for the attack on a dog he confuses with a wolf. He starts writing his letters of complaints and fires into some other dogs. The hunters potentially drown him for that. The hunters potentially include Yakov. Yakov dies as well at the end but we do not know why. We just know that he is being dragged in the sledges and does not feel any pain. He puts his poems into a bottle and throws the bottle into the river for someone to fish it out and enjoy.  (hide spoiler)]Post-modern version:(view spoiler)[Similar to the realistic one in terms of the plot. However, there is only one real character. It is Yakov Palamekhertov. He is educated person but ends up working as a gamekeeper in the North. He looks out of the window and sees the scene he compares to Bruegel’s. He has not much to do, so he drinks, imagines different scenes from the books he reads and recreating his real memories, he writes poems and recreating his real memories, he writes poems and he writes a body of work in a form of letters in a style of speech of a collective imaginary local man. He calls him Illia Zynzyrella . (hide spoiler)]My general impression is difficult to summarise. I like the ambiguity of the atmosphere this novel creates. I like the amount of stuff one can unpack within it. For example, the author is playing with the concept of death, its illusiveness, what is there to be felt on the other side. Both of his narrators experience the transition without realising it. Then, they carry on talking. They are not sure what is going on with them and we as a readers are not sure whether it is really happening. It is a powerful tool. He has used it even more successfully in his first novel. But for me it still pales compared to Pedro Páramo.Being raised in Russian culture, I like the easiness with which I recognised the numerous cultural references. I like the ambition of encompassing so much language patterns within a single relatively slim novel. I appreciate the mixture of humour and fatalism. In general, I admire what he has done here, but I do not love it. The timing of reading as always plays a big role. I was immersed for the big chunk of this year in Latin American literature of the same period. And If I would read this novel before Pedro Páramo or The Obscene Bird of Night, I would potentially be more overwhelmed by Sokolov’s virtuosity, but not in the reverse order. I think, partly they have the same source of inspiration in Faulkner and Poe. Sokolov is visibly affected by Nabokov and the symbolists (both influences maybe totally subconscious). I talked about Joyce earlier. Maybe I will come back to this novel after eventually reading Finnegans Wake. PS A few words about the translation. I do not know how it could be translated adequately enough avoiding the writing of a slightly different book. Out of curiosity, I've looked at the first few pages of the English translation on kindle sample. Well, the first page was a miss for me. But then it started to flow and it was easier for me to read than the original. Below are few observations from the first page (quite superficial I admit, but still):1) missing endings - Illia speaks perfect Russian from grammatical perspective. He creates his own words and amends the existing ones. But he does not change the grammar and he does not have a visible accent either. Not sure why he needs to have it in English; “The moonth” sounds very artificial. I do not see the reason to combine two words in English into one. Just because we have one simple word in Russian. It does not sound natural to what Illia would do. 2) In the English version Illia works in “the co-op of the individuals named after Sharpenhouer”. That was really strange choice to play with the name of the German philosopher. In the original, the co-op is named after Daniil Zatochnik, the Russian religious writer of 13th century. Zatochnik in Russian means both grinder and a person who is locked in a prison. So here we have 3 relevant facts together. While in English it might be witty but so much misses the point. Another character in English is introduced as Nikolai The Helper or something like that. In Russian he is Nikolay Ugodnik which is the Russian name for St Nicolas the Saint who makes miracles. The one of the poems is referring to him as well. This is used in the plot. But why the Helper?I might sound too harsh. I am sure even to attempt to translate this is a tremendous accomplishment. And it reads very well in English. It just underlines how difficult and valuable is the job of a translator; how many choices have to be made. And the most fundamental is the old choice: to stay close to the original or to create? Maybe this translator has even wrote a better English book in some respects. But I thought those few things from the first page are worth mentioning to....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Nov 06, 2019","Nov 10, 2019","Nov 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1729869._

Initially it seems that she is just different in terms of her neurological wiring. But slowly you feel that is something darker, her emotional state and her capacity to live in a moment is unraveling. Her mind starts to go in big and small circles like the arrows of the watch she is constantly thinking about. And all this time, you are inside this mind. It cannot be anything but disturbing experience isn’t? But the author’s writing shapes it in something more than that. While reading it I’ve had two images constantly playing in my head. The first was ambience, this sense of light, velvet and penetrating at the same time, surrounding me with words, constant, but slightly changing its colour. The light of words. And the second, even more visual - Virginia Woolf in her last minutes, heavy stones in the pockets, slowly moving into the river. Total sense of foreboding. I do not know why, the text is not very much like Woolf’s writing. Maybe because of the atmosphere. What are the possible escapes from that place?The book made me think of a few things. Firstly, does being good with words mean being able to communicate? Obvious answer is yes, it seems. The more versatile one is, the more options she should have to deliver the message, to be understood. But in reality it is not the case. Language and commutation sometimes seem to be the enemies of each other. Here in the book, the heroine simply lives in the world of language, but she is incapable to use the words to deliver any message. And when she sees a plain speaking (probably not very educated) neighbours, she is amazed how “smooth” they are with the words. But even without the extremes how often i find myself struggling for the fluency, for the freedom to express exactly my thoughts. And it never totally works. And I am sure, I am not alone in this.I suspect, that many people would judge this book based upon its content, or, rather their interpretation of the content. Understandably, it is not all sunny. The inherent unreliability of Ash’s thoughts are amplified by the vividness of their imaginary. This leads to the variety of possibilities for the actions really taking place. Some of those possibilities, all very plausible within the context of the novel are very dark, shocking and disturbing. And here comes my thought which i have quite often reading recent novels and how they are perceived by the readers and even some critics. Obsessed with content, we forget to look at the text as a work of art, especially if the content is controversial. We are more forgiving towards the authors writing about something we find suitable to our views and aspirations, even if the text is mediocre. And vice versa, we often let the content totally overshadow the literary benefit of the text, its form, its aesthetics. I was reading Susan Sontag’s “Against the interpretation” recently. She talks about this phenomena in relation to the wider art. “What is needed is more attention to form of art… “how it is what it is, even that it is what it is, rather than show what it means”. She calls it “the revenge of an intellect over art”. I think it is even more so nowadays when a lot of the social issues and the identities previously underrepresented are taking their places in the literature. And sometimes it is the revenge of representation and shock factors over art rephrasing Sontag. Coming back to this novel, I hope it would not be the case. I hope the form of this text, its beautiful disorientating language and circularly structure, its open ended questions would not be overshadowed by the subject matter.Another thought which this book prompted is about empathy. Especially the empathy while reading. There is this idea that reading teaches us to empathise better. I would not argue with this. However, sometimes it is presented as the most important role of reading. And this irks me a bit. Like this book for example, it would be the ideal playground for the empathy training. At the end, I’ve spent 200 pages or so in a head of another human being. But i do not feel any empathy. In fact I do not feel any sympathy even. I do not feel even sympathy to her partner, Abbot. In fact, I felt the frustration when he did not get her to the hospital, listened to her and did whatever she wanted instead. Do i feel sorry for her condition? Yes, but is strongly feel something inevitable being build around her in the text. And this ability to arose strong feelings, to raise questions, not to answer them - that is what I value in the literature. That and aesthetic pleasure I feel following a writer creating the object of art. And to finish this , one small observation about the language:“Charlie, Charlee, light of my life. Always in my mind’s eye, half-submerged, sliding away, an arm, a leg, a torso, a head, appearing then disappearing.” - This is the last sentence in this book.“Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.” - The first sentence in the Nabokov’s book.Is it just me?

I liked that Jia sat down and wrote all these nine essays especially for this book. The topics vary from her relationship with Internet to her decision never to get married. The collection is fresh, her observations are sharp and quite witty in the majority of cases. The first essay was about the impact of digital life on all of us and her in particular. I found it the most well thought, brilliantly researched and having an universal appeal in terms of readership. Another two essays which stood out for me were ""We come from Old Virginia"" about the difficulties in investigating and reporting the cases of sexual violence on the campus. She has moved beyond the obvious layer of the issue and I liked her journalistic honesty. The second was ""I Thee Dread"" about her rational of not getting married. I found it surprisingly poignant. On the other hand, there were two essays which did not speak to me. The one was where she talked about her participation in a reality TV program at the of 16 - nothing for me there. And, more surprisingly, the second one was ""Pure heroins"" about representation of young women in literature. I did not find her analysis very profound and her examples were quite limited focusing more on children and YA books which I did not know about. A few quotes:""Facebook goal of showing people only what they were interested in seeing resulted, within a decade, in effective end of shared civic reality"".""The internet was dramatically increasing our ability to know about the things, while our ability to change things stayed the same and possibly shrank in front of us.""""Where we had once been free to be ourselves online, we were now chained to ourselves online, and this made us self-conscious. Platforms that promised connection began inducing mass alienation. The freedom promised by the internet started to seem like something whose greatest potential lay in the realm of misuse.""""In the absence of time to physically and politically engage with our community the way many of us want to, the internet provides a cheap substitute: it gives us brief moments of pleasure and connection, tied up in the opportunity to constantly listen and speak. Under these circumstances, opinion stops being a first step toward something and starts seeming like an end in itself.""“The representation of an activity will vary in some degree from the activity itself and therefore inevitably misrepresent it,” Goffman writes. (Take the experience of enjoying a sunset versus the experience of communicating to an audience that you’re enjoying a sunset. ....Internet is engineered for this sort of misrepresentation; it’s designed to encourage us to create certain impressions rather than allowing these impressions to arise “as an incidental by-product of [our] activity.” This is why, with the internet, it’s so easy to stop trying to be decent, or reasonable, or politically engaged—and start trying merely to seem so.""...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Oct 31, 2019","Dec 19, 2019","Oct 31, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/44282599-trick-mirror

I’ve read it a few months ago, but i still remember the contradictory feelings from that experience. It was a mixture of delight and frustration, if you can imagine such a mixture. The delight was related to an elegant, beautifully aesthetic writing style and the book’s structure. She has based the structure on Mary’s Shelley 's Frankenstein, Russian doll of stories within the stories: ((((—)))). Her ability of weaving one story from another through brief associations are astonishing as well. But here comes frustration. The majority of the stories she telling in a book are well known like aforementioned Frankenstein, or Snow Queen, or basic biography of Buddha. When she mentioned a labyrinth I was thinking: “Oh no! Here comes the Theseus myth. And yes, it was coming my way. And the messages she is passing on through those stories are not very original and new as well. The central concept of the book is empathy and the journey of self-discovery after the traumatic experience. But again, she does not have much new to say about it. Moreover, I did not feel her overwhelming empathising when she is writing about her relationship with her mother. Her mother is slowly succumbing to Alzheimer’s decease. But this difficult situation is used in the book more to reflect on their dysfunctional relationship preceding the illness. And I did not feel Solnit really wished to look at the situation from her mum’s perspective which would be empathetic. In general, I felt a hint of narcissism and slightly teacher’s tone in the book.

Being a person who went through this nightmare myself, I cannot sympathise more. 3) queer identities, especially in the case of their overlap with the two factors above (working class and immigrant identities). Also the issues arising between the queer and gay people in the modern day Britain due to their politics.- I also like how it renders the Isle of White, its landscape and its history;- the intertextuality is palpable through the book. At the end, there is a list of reference of the books and articles mentioned.However, unfortunately, I did not enjoy that much the aesthetic choice of the novel. Isabel Wainder is PhD in Creative Writing. In their own words,  “it (the novel) collides literary aesthetics with contemporary working class cultures and attitudes.”  So i am sure it is a deliberate choice. I felt the style and the language used was deliberately made radically accessible. And I found it problematic. The anthropomorphism and the sentence structures, amount of question marks and capitalisation reminded me of the language one tends to find in a children book. And a hunt for the “lypard” specifically reminded me of a famous children book “We are going on a bear hunt”. I am not quite sure about the reason for such a choice of style. It might be to follow a marxist view that there is no difference between the high and a popular culture. Or, it might be to increase the audience of the readers who would identify with the text and help them to pay attention to the serious issues incorporated and mentions above. The typical example of the style:“At a later point, House Mother Normal walks in on the polar bear FEEDING, the reeboks in a FRENZY. Who fed them? House Mother Normal works herself up over the polar bears and the reeboks freeloading. She is exploring the possibility of them fixing the boiler in exchange for their squid-. No! I say. The polar bears are novelists, the reeboks are poets, it is not within their remit nor skill set to fix and English boiler!”It probably would make many people laugh. But I find it a bit tiresome.The book also shows the tendency of merging material culture with literature. Again, the reason might be that any literature has got a material basis according to some theories. Many characters materialise into the book’s world from the drawings on t-shirts. Reebok trainers play the role of a poet. They are also symbolic as Reebok classics are apparently the favourite trainers of the UK working class people. РАССВЕТ, a Russian youth brand based upon the nostalgia over Soviet Union is used in the plot as well. Other brands like popular cheap chocolate bars are used as metaphors as well. One lyrical passage reads like this:“What if fear, rage, joy and a sense of humour were actually Milky Ways. What if political urgency, transgression and difference where Kinder Surprises! What of WE THINK YOU ARE BORING were fun size Mars bar. What if life (a lot of it) and love (above all) were mini Galaxies, then there’d be Celebrations for Shae and I after all!”Someone help me please with the interpretation of this! I do not eat chocolate. Maybe that is why i did not get the wit and beauty of this particular metaphor.The novel is also a melting pot of genres. And this i actually did not mind in general. However, the last few pages is a collage from on-line s (the Trip Adviser) of the Isle of White Zoo. Although relevant, I do not find it super-creative and felt it was overused here. And this tipped of my rating towards 3 stars.Overall it is an experimental brave novel. The author is definitely taking risks which should be applauded for. But aesthetically i was not very pleased which is rather subjective of course and reflects my taste rather than the book quality. I will try their another novel to know them better.This novel is nominated on GoldSmith Prize 2019....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Oct 25, 2019","Oct 28, 2019","Oct 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43703179-we-are-made-of-diamond-stuff

And that allowed me to observe a great evolution from the older to the recent collection. The first one was written as if Zadie was put into a straightjacket to write it. The writing was too rigid as if she could not relax and just follow the flow of her thoughts. She was writing in the first person, but the impression was that it was not her. The voice was coming from somewhere outside. The essay on her visit to Liberia was the least successful of them all. There, it was not even first person narration, just a bunch of faceless observations. But even when she was writing about her dad’s participation in the war and his last years, she seems to be holding herself from telling too much about her feelings. The best one from that collection was the essay about the role of the writer and the reader according to Nabokov and Barth. So, it was a relief to find that “Feel Free” is a different cattle of fish. It is more assured, more mature, more personal and simply more relaxed. Her essays have become compositionally more complex and therefore interesting. Her topics very widely as well. And she is not ashamed to be herself in her writing. The first part was on the recent political and social matters. She is unhappy about Brexit. But she does not try to simply the issue: “A profound shock I felt at the result and which so many Londoners seem to have experienced- suggests at the very least that we must have been living behind a veil, unable to see our own country for what it has become.” She touches upon the question of class in this respect. She illustrates her own awkwardness when her daughter has become friends with a little boy, but Zadie did not dare to invite him and his mum on a playdate as the mum was from a council estate. She did not want even to talk to Zadie as she perceived Zadie to be higher on a class ladder. This story is a little sad as it shows the extent of not simply economic but psychological gap between the people in the UK. Still it is hard for me to understand why Zadie did not feel enough courage to make the first move. But it is fair to say that i’ve never been in a similar situation, so I do not know what i would do.I like her thoughtful measured attitude towards the race and identity politics within her essays:“In my conscious life though I cannot honestly say I feel proud to be white and ashamed to be black or proud to be black and ashamed to be white. I find it impossible to experience either pride or shame over accidents of genetics in which I had no active part.”And in the essay about The Buddha of Suburbia she writes: “Karim is nobodies victim.  From the point of view of our 21st century world where the only possible reaction to anything seems to be outraged offence, I find it relief to go back to that more innocent, hardier time, when we were not all such delicate flowers that every man’s casual idiocy had the awesome power to offend us to our very cores.“ I cannot agree more with her sentiment here. She deserves all the stars from me just for this sentence.In another essay she contemplates about the nature of celebrity and the purpose of life. In order to do that, she contrasts Justin Bieber with Martin Buber, Jewish thinker of the 20t century. It is very interesting and well constructed essay, if only a little bit too crafty one.Not surprisingly, she is the best when she talks about her creative process and about other books and authors. There are essays on Hanif Kureishi, St Aubyn, St Aubyn and many other. She talks about the role of the characters in her fiction:  “My books don’t seem to me to be about anything other than the people in them and the sentences used to construct them.” She also tells about her struggle to use the first person narrations in her fiction.Reading this second collection, I came to the conclusion that i prefer her current non-fiction work to her novels. And i hope it won’t take long for more of her non-fiction work to come....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Oct 23, 2019","Oct 31, 2019","Oct 23, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35581653-feel-free

I’ve started with this collection, but then got into the swing of things and spent a few weeks reading just essays from different authors. I found it fascinating experience, in some ways, it is easier than reading a serious novel, but very stimulating nevertheless. I plan to do it again soon with more empathises on the literary criticism. This book was the first in the bunch. It might be that the following essays and the authors I’ve read after that has affected my impression of it, but I found it somewhat insubstantial. All of these essays has been published somewhere before. And many of them were the basis for Cusk’s more fundamental and more successful works such as “Aftermath” and her excellent “Outline” trilogy. I’ve read those works before and loved them. Therefore, it was not particularly revealing to see them here in a skeleton form.The title essay ‘Coventry” was different though. And it is appeared to be my favourite. It dealt with the difficult relationship between her and her parents that often lead to a prolonged period of silence imposed on her. The essay was as ironic as it was revealing. It is worth noting that she is the third female writer I’ve read in a short while whose relationship with parents, especially their mum, bordered on an open conflict (another two were Rebecca Solnit and Vigdis Hjorth). It reminded me an observation by Milosz : “When a writer is born into a family that family is finished”. The book also contains a few essays of literary criticism. She likes Edith Wharton and DH Lawrence. She admires Natalia Ginsburg and not so keen on “Never let me go”. I admired her thoughts, if only these essays were a bit less brief.

There are infinite number of interpretations one can give to the book. And I am sure, if I would read it more times, each time I would come up with something slightly different. One thing is clear - this book defies many conventions of story telling. There is no time frame or chronology, the characters are fluid. There is one strong unifying voice emanating from the book, and I suspect it is the author’s voice. If anything, it might be considered as a gothic tale. There is a lot of horror mixed with love, deformation and distortion mixed with beauty and sometimes replacing it all together. There is a lot of suffering which feels very authentic. Nabokov once said: “The author clashes with readers on because he is his own ideal reader and those other readers are so very often mere lip-moving ghosts and amnesiacs”. I think it is very relevant to Donoso and this book. I could feel something very personal is reflected in this chaos of a novel. And his symbolism, what he truly meant is impossible to understand without knowing the history of this book creation. But, on another hand, it is not necessary as everyone in their capacity of a reader could find his own way through the maze and either create his own narrative or simply enjoy the ride. One thing is clear though and I find it quite beautiful. It is impossible to try to put any events into chronological order, or in general define the temporal aspect of the events. It is also impossible to define a single canvas of the events as well. Some of them collide, contradict each other, both happen and not happen. And if one is to enjoy the book, one has to play with this. The way how the narrator describes the sorcery of old woman is wonderfully referential to the novel:“Old women like Peta Ponce have the power to fold time over and confuse it, they multiply and divide it, events are refracted in their gnarled hands as in the most brilliant prism, they cut the consecutive happening of things into fragments they arrange in parallel form, they bend those fragments and twist them into shapes that enable them to carry out their designs.""These few lines were the key for my understanding and letting me into the book. One thing which is precisely defined in the novel is the setting. There are two main places where the actions happen. One is the Casa de Ejercicios, the covent of a sorts, managed by a few nuns and the refuge to a few dozens of the old women, a few orphan girls and a mute helper called Mudito. Another place is Rinconada, initially a rich family estate converted into the confined area populated solely by the people with different deformities. Both places come across as limitless but confusing and confined, intimidating mazes physically separated from the outside world. This contrast between “inside and outside” is the one of the main themes of the book. It is usually bad idea for the inmates of both places to get out. Even inside, the new physical barriers are constantly being erected further limiting the space. Somehow the novel has managed to combine a bleak claustrophobic atmosphere with irresistible energy.I deliberately avoid discussing the plot or giving my interpretation how it all works together. If you are interested to read the author’s story how the book was created, you can find it here https://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+Smal.... It explains some of the symbols, ideas and gives the context of the author’s life. I would recommend it.But the main theme for me was the desperate search of the characters to escape from the boundaries - both the internal and external. The main ones are the boundaries of their own identities. And at the same time, they are building the new obstacles to shield themselves from certain knowledge or a threat which might ruin them. I’ve read somewhere that the problem with boundaries if one seal them too tight, one would stop to exist as he would not have a means of interaction with external world. The powerful metaphor of Imbunche - the human creature with all his orifices sewed up plays huge importance in the book. On another hand, if one would totally destroy the boundaries between himself and the other, if one would forget what is different and special about him, the one would stop to exist, his identity would totally disappear. PSDonoso is considered the one of the LatAm Boom authors (Cortazar, Marquez, Fuentes). They left two powerful influences on the LatAm literature - the one is intertextuality and another one is dealing with the surreal, macabre, sometimes supernatural (in extreme, this leads to well worn out ‘magic realism”). This particular book is more towards the second type. I much prefer the first. However, there is no magic realism (i.e. ghost alive and other paraphernalia). It is ingrained in authentic and specially created mythology. There is strong north american gothic influence as well, i think more Poe than Faulkner here. There are metamorphoses as well which could bring Kafka name to the surface. However, I do not think it is more than superficial comparison....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Oct 16, 2019","Oct 23, 2019","Oct 16, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/382975.The_Obscene_Bird_of_Night

Maybe sincerity is underpriced asset in modern fiction.”When i was about the same age as you, Brilka, I often used to wonder what would happen if the world’s collective memory had retained different things and lost others? If we had forgotten all the wars and all those countless kings, rulers, leaders, and mercenaries, and people to be read about in books were those who had built a house with their own hands, planted a garden, discovered a giraffe, described a cloud, praised the nape of a woman’s neck. I wondered how we know that the people whose names have endured were better, cleverer, or more interesting just because they’ve stood test of time. What of those who are forgotten?”It has been a while since I’ve read a family saga. And it has been ages since I’ve read such a good one. It is the one of those books which is very tricky for me write about. I cannot quite put in words why I ended up loving this book so much. I am not a huge fan of the genre in general. There is a tradition of bold family sagas in Eastern Europe, Russia especially. I know quite a few written about the 20th century in the former Soviet Union. Lyudmila Ulitskaya does it very well. Also it has been done successfully in the recent English language books with the backdrop of China and Korea. The idea for this novel is deceptively simple - it is a story about several generations of a single family against the backdrop of historic events during the “red” century. However, there were two factors which raised my initial interest. Firstly, the main part of the book is set in Georgia. Quite often, the book with the plot based on the history of Soviet Union is written by a Russian writer. So perspective is from the centre towards the peripheries. The characters often do not have national identities unless their are Jews. Here it is different - it is the same events, but from the perspective rooted in Georgia. And I always was quite keen to read a novel about Georgia. Secondly, the author is quite young - she is a millennial living in Germany for a long time. So she could not witness the majority of things she was writing about. Though her narrator is 10 years older, almost exactly my age. And the fact that the writer lives in the Western Europe brings this slightly more detached point of view on the events combining both her western and eastern identity. I was curios to see how her generation internalised all this experience. The novel is originally written in German in 2014.The book is structured in the form of a very long letter from the aunt, Niza to her 12 year old niece. Niza, who is born in 1974, now lives in Berlin. Her niece, Brilka, whom she has not seen since the girl was a baby, has unexpectedly bursted into Niza’s life shaking her routines and piercing the bubble of her existence. Intentionally or not, Brilka asks her aunt the questions which Niza was trying to burry for a long time. Brilka wants to understand herself. And she prompts Niza to do the same. Consequently, this book is the result of her search. Reading this, i was constantly thinking how our life reminds a Russian doll; the history of the older generations are often packed inside our motivations, thoughts and actions without us even aware about it. How many things seems to be predetermined. Or are they? That is the question which Niza and the author is grappling with too, it seems. The novel is divided into 7 books-lives. Each book is devoted to a member of a Jachi’s family, mainly women. The family is founded at the beginning of the 20th century somewhere in a small town in Georgia by a confectioner who has had four daughters from two wives. The time frame between the individual books overlaps. I especially loved that the central character of each book is not simply dropped in the next one but still involved throughout the whole novel. It all starts with Stasia, born with the century, dreamy, extremely brave and devoted woman, who follows twice her loved ones plunging into the calamities of the revolution and later the second world war. Then there is Christine, her younger sister of exceptional beauty who becomes its victim. Then - Kostya and Kitty - the children of Stasia. Their fates could not have been more different from each other. He becomes a successful functionary, she has to flee to the West and never able to come back home. Niza is the last in the chain growing up in Georgia through the cynical eighties followed by wild 90s. But when i write all of this it sounds very plane, it sounds like something which has been done already a million times: revolution, purges, world war 2, the 60s, Prague spring, the collapse of the Soviet Union. I seem not to be able to show what unique about this novel. And to be honest, while reading the first book I thought it would end up like a saga of broken dreams due to the historic calamities. But trust me, it is much deeper than that. It grabbed me from the second book onwards and there is something special about it. Maybe, it is its sincerity; maybe, it is the way how the author creates these characters, how psychologically complex, multidimensional they are and how they always balance between giving in to the “Fate” and still being free to make their own choices. This is the fiction which tells the truth somehow. Inevitably, there is a lot of cruel drama in this book: murders, rapes, wars, betrayals. Some scenes felt slightly overdramatised, a bit theatrical. Later I learned that the author is a successful play writer. But there were not single time when I felt the story overstretched. All the unthinkable things she describes could happen and were everyday experience at that era.Georgia of course is a birth place of Stalin. And his shadow is hovering over the book. But the one of his henchman, Lavrentiy Beria is much more omnipresent in the plot. Stalin called him “our Himmler”. He was as nasty piece of work as they go. But in the novel, though existing only in the margins he is far from a cartoonish villain, more like a hand of destiny. Interestingly, the author chooses not to name them in the novel almost until the last few pages. Beria is known as a “Little Big Man” through the novel. Unexpectedly, I’ve learned some new history as well. I want to mention here two events. I did not know that over 5 mln Soviet citizens were forcibly repatriated from abroad after the World War II. It has been conducted by NKVD (Russian secret service) and called ‘operation SMERSH” (abbreviation to “death to spies"" in Russian). Only half of them have reached home. I did not also know about the one of the last of war actions in the same war - Georgian uprising at Texel island in Netherlands which lasted from April 5 to May 20, 1945. The Georgians, many of them exRed army soldiers captured by the Germans and made to fight on their side, have mutinied against the Nazi leadership and killed around 400 German military personal, many of them in their sleep. In one of those weird parallels coincidences, it reminded me another book I’ve read recently. In the novel Insurrecto set in the Philippines, there is an episode when the locals are attacking the American troops stationed at their land in the middle of the night.Anyway, slowly but surely, this novel has totally won me over. Her language is quiet simple, but penetratingly sincere. The book is driven by the dialogue which is snappy, sharp and bare of feelings. And maybe it is just me, but I found the book and some episodes in particular almost heartbreakingly moving. Of course, the last part about Niza was very relatable in my case. The author was writing from the perspective of a girl of almost exactly my age. When she was writing about the late 80s and early 90s, I had to stop reading quiet a few times as i felt almost physically overwhelmed by the flood of my own long forgotten memories about that time. It was crazy time, it was dangerous time, but we lived through it as it was totally normal. And we had hopes and freedom for the first time. Now, about the chocolate and the magic realism. I’ve read that some people identified a trace of magic realism in the novel. I am not one of them. As i mentioned earlier, the main theme of the book is the role of Fate in a life of an individual; the question, to which extent our origins define our life. And there is a powerful metaphor for this in a book. There is a secret family recipe of a hot chocolate which is carefully (or sometimes less so) passed from generation to generation. Added to other products, it brings only good things. But there is a belief that whoever drinks it pure will face a calamity. Many family members did have a drink. Is it the drink to blame for what happened later? Ive seen somewhere this novel is compared One Hundred Years of Solitude. Especially, that the novel covers around 100 years as well. But for me, they would be off the mark. If I would compare it to some other book, it would be The Neapolitan Novels. The similarities I found is this ""matter of a fact prose"", honesty and psychological depth. But again, it would be a mistake to take this comparison too far.It is the longest, but the most engrossing and the most moving novel I’ve read this year. And, I think it deserves to be widely read.Update: It has got a great  in the Guardian:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...I really hope more people will read it. PSI struggled to rate it.

I would never guessed based upon the style of writing. Not sure it is a good or bad fact, but it just shows never to judge gender of the author by the style of writing:-) This has not been released yet. I've read a  copy by chance. I love Lati American literature, but I have not read anything by contemporary authors from Mexico (exceptValeria Luiselli who is properly global phenomena now I believe). So I was fascinated. The novel is centered around the murder of person known as ""Witch"" which connects a bunch of characters in a remote Mexican village. The story is told polyphonically through the voices of these characters. Each chapter is written in a different voice. And each time, I felt my expectations built based upon the previous narrative were slightly thrown off kilter which was welcome. But reading this, I could not get rid off a thought that the style strongly reminds me something I've read before. The polyphonic story telling is quite popular nowadays. There is also a dash of Faulkner's influence in it. But it was something else. And then I realised it was A Brief History of Seven Killings.

It encompasses around 5000 years of Indian history and it does not focus more on the later periods, which was an asset for me. Obviously, it is not comprehensive, but it is cohesive and contains a lot of interesting nuggets of information, especially about the older periods where there was no written evidence per se. In the later periods, I would prefer more cultural history rather than the focus on politics with numerous names of leaders and the wars. But any book of such scope would have potential limitations.I've learned a lot about the interactions between the Muslims who has started to arrive in significant quantities in the 11th century and the people who lived on the subcontinent before that. At that time, the book claims, more of the Muslims arrived as refugees than the conquerors. They also brought paper and probably the spinning will into India. The period of British colonisation would probably be controversial whatever a writer does. I felt in some parts (not always) slightly like the Indian people colonised themselves. And East Indian company just appeared to be there and did not have a choice in the matter but to start to govern the region. Which i seriously doubt. However, I've read some s, and they are angry with the author for underplaying the positive role of British Empire and mentioning only negatives. So here we go. Overall, I think the book at least tried to be balanced.

As far as I know, only theseI've picked up this book because I’ve read A House in Norway by Vigdis Hjorth and it has left a lasting impression on me. As far as I know, only these two of her books have been translated into English. Both books focus on difficult moral dilemmas. And Hjorth investigates them with unflinching honesty and forensic attention to detail, which makes a very thought-provoking compelling read. “The house in Norway” was dealing with a contradictory, often conflicting relationship between a local host and her emigrant Polish lodgers. ""Will and Testament"" addresses more intimate subject matter of the consequences of a repressed childhood trauma and its impact on a large family. The narrator, the women in her 50s, has chosen to estrange herself from her parents and her two younger sisters almost completely for a long time. However, she is dragged into the inheritance dispute after her father’s death. Consequently, she needs to confront her demons once more. The reason for estrangement was that at the age of 30, newly divorced, she suddenly remembered what happened to her when she was a little girl. Or at least she thinks she remembers this. Her memory is unreliable and very painful. Going deeper would be spoiling the book as the core of the novel is her dealing with this situation. Hjorth’s urgent, personal and honest narrative style contributes to the power of the book. Her character is dealing with the family dynamics. She is trying to put yourself in the place of other family members. But she does not try or even pretend to try to be objective. And that is refreshing. There are many themes touched upon in the book which could be discussed. Some of them is hard to talk about without spoiling. But I will just mention one. More often than not, in many situations related to childhood traumas or wider domestic violence, there is no proof of wrong doing. Often, even memories are repressed. So what would be right way of dealing with such situations as a friend or a sibling? How to navigate between the victims and the potential wrongdoers? I do not have a straightforward answer. The book does not give a straightforward answer either that is why I think it is a powerful book. One might argue that as a novel it might be better if it would have the voices of other family members represented separately. Otherwise occasionally the book acquires a slight undertone of a therapeutic confession. However, it is definitely unsentimental and full of authentic raw feelings. A now, the difficult bit. When I finished reading I came across the  in New Statesman claiming that this story is lightly veiled personal story of the author. So, she has done something similar to Knausgård’s A Death in the Family. As a result, her family was distraught about the book. Her sister even wrote a counter novel. However, Hjorth still claims “Will and testament” is totally fictional. I did not know all of this when I was reading the book. Again, the situation is that there is no proof. But the family’s reaction shows that at least there is something personal there. Effectively, she has reversed the situation of a victim-perpetrators conflict on a meta level. So it made me pose and think how this fact affects me as a reader. I have to admit, initially I was slightly disappointed. It would be better if this story would not affect real people and simply pose to universal questions. But then, deep inside, I think I understand her motives and can sympathise with them....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Sep 12, 2019","Sep 18, 2019","Sep 11, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44003688-will-and-testament

The book is like a softish blanket one can wrap around with a few interlinked stories where a woman meets a man while another woman might be loosing a man at the same moment. Would they? Won't they? To be fair, there was another story there about balancing the artistic urge with being a young mother. I do not want to undermine the pleasure I received reading it. It is witty, with light, pleasant intertextuality and the some of my favourite movies of that decade used in the plot. ""Kill Bill"" and ""Lost in Translation"" are two prime examples. The characters are well rounded and quirky. The humour is self-referential and pleasantly dark.

He was born in Punjab in 1912 and died in 1955 Lahore, in the newly created Pakistan. Barely 43 yeSaadat Hasan Manto has had a relatively short live. He was born in Punjab in 1912 and died in 1955 Lahore, in the newly created Pakistan. Barely 43 years. But the majority of this years he was writing. His language was Urdu. He has never finished any formal education; failed the school’s exams; dropped out of the university as well. In spite of it, he started from translating Victor Hugo and Oscar Wilde. His translations has been published and that has started off his literary career. He has become an editor of a magazine and has started to write short stories. His life has fallen on the almost turbulent period in Indian history. He was 7 when the massacre in Armister took place. His youth took place on the background of political movements for independence. He was not very political though. He has spend his best years in Bombay working for a magazine related to the film industry. Then came independence followed by religious violence on the scale never imaginable. He witnessed this. He lived through this. Then came Partition. He did not want to leave Bombay even then. However he was asked to leave his job allegedly due to overrepresentation of muslims. So he went to Lahore to join his family. But he never was happy since then. He missed Bombey; his heavy drinking has killed him in 6 years, but he never stopped writing even when he was drinking. Reading his stories, i could not help wondering why I’ve never heard about him before? Why is he not better known worldwide, but especially in the english speaking world. His writing is terrific - so controlled and economic, but so poignant at the same time, creating such a nuanced psychologic images just in a fews sentences. Additionally, the themes of his stories are universal. Two main topics stood out for me - the life of women, majority of them are prostitutes; and the nature humanity versus violence (be it war, revolution or communal killings) - what happens to a human being facing something incomprehensible, how it skews the whole definition of being human. And his voice never goes anywhere near sentimentality, never capitalises on the horror of subject matter. It has been a few weeks since I’ve read this book. However some of these stories simply stay in my mind. In “Last Salute” two friends, who fought together for the British, are appeared to be in the different sides of India-Pakistan War following Partition. They are physically within short distance hiding from each other with their trapped regiments. They’ve recognise each other voices. Then the request for a favour and the tragedy follows. In “A Tale of 1947” Mumtaz, a muslim man is leaving for Pakistan, “the country he knows nothing off”. Three of his best friends, who are all Hindus are seeing him off. He has decided to leave after the one of these friends received the news of his uncle’s murder and acknowledged: “If Hindu-Muslim killings start here, I do not know what I will do… I do not know. I might kill you.” So Mumtaz is leaving. But before that, he is trying to talk to them one last time about what matters to him: what is religion, what does it mean to be devoted, what is the human decency. He says: “Only a naive could believe that religion could be eliminated with a gun. Why cannot they understand that faith, belief, devotion, call it what you will is a thing of the spirit; it is not physical. Guns and knives are powerless to destroy it.” And he follows on with a story of the Hindu pimp he happened to know as an example of the most decent man. The story is just 5 pages but it tells you much more than an average novel.“Toby Tek Singh”, the one of his most well known stories, is Manto’s Ward No. 6 and Other Stories. It is set in a lunatic asylum which is now in the process of exchange of its Hindu and Muslim inhabitants due to Partition. And the one man just simply refuse to leave. So much depth and poignancy is conveyed in this image.And now about the prostitutes. In his life time, Manto has received 6 charges of indecency. I’ve read those stories. And only “indecency” I found how good they were. He managed to charge the atmosphere and convey the feelings hardly with any reference to sex. More importantly, how he cares about these women, how he could see the individual behind the setting. And all of it without sliding to the usual tropes of deprivation and moral compromises. These women are alive, fighting their daily problems and set backs and try to be happy like any other women. In spite of the obvious, there is no sense of victimhood which often prevails in such stories. In “A Woman’s Life” the main character experiences a sort of epiphany in Joyce’s sense of the world. In “Ten ruppies” a young girl around 12 who still plays with the dolls is being procured by her own mum. But she does not realise that what she is doing is not normal. She just lives her life and brings her sunny disposition to her engagements. In “Mummy” the white brothel’s owner is looking after a very ill young Hindu man while everyone else has given up on him. Not all of the stories are about the oldest profession. The variety of his themes are wide. But all of them are united by his desire to understand and depict the human condition. I know how cliche this sounds, but the stories are far from any cliches.This book is the one of his most comprehensive in English. Translation is smooth and the translator claims he tried to convey the style of the original. I believe it worked. The book contains his short stories, sketches, biographical portraits and a play. I have to admit that I have not read the portraits and the play yet.

But if you are a phantom in a dream, then the great light of the dream justifies you, constructs you. And there, in the story twisting in the mood of a person sleeping, you are truer than a billion inhabited worlds.”Mircea Cantarescu really makes his readers work. I could not read this book fast. Entering this book is like diving into fragmentary layers, narratives with beautiful and and savagery images, memories and hallucinations. The novel functions in 3 dimensions: reality-hallucinations-dreams. The dimensions are far from linear, and a very thin curtain separates one from another, if any. The first impression is that it is beautiful and poetic, but it is one big mess. But then suddenly, if one persevere, one could see that all these pieces and narrative structures are closely connected. And it is a kind of revelation by itself. One need to work hard, but pieces are actually coming together in a puzzle! This is definitely not always the case within surreal, oneiric literature, in my experience. His style is partly explained by his way of writing. He writes at average 2 pages a day by hand, without drafting and does not change his text since then. In the recent interview to “Music and literature” he says:  ""I always feel embarrassed when having to discuss my crazy method of writing, because I know that nobody believes me. Even I have a hard time believing that I wrote a 1,500-page novel, over fourteen years, by hand, and that the manuscript, gathered in four big notebooks, is as clean as if I copied it, page by page. Better stated: it’s as if the text has always been there, but covered over by white paint, and my only work is to erase that paint, revealing the manuscript beneath."" The article provides kind of proof - a copy of a page of his notebook. It is striking that he sees his writing like something revealed to him rather than solely created by him. And it is very evident in this novel. In fact there is a scene when a character is walking closely to this border between his world and the reality of the writer, his creator:“Costel looked, like a sleepwalker, at his left hand:his fingers were shrinking into his palm. In a flash, he realised that he had left the Story, that he had reached the songs, where everything was crosshatched, a world barely formed, its space and time still budding. He continued moving forward, until there was nothing left of him but the forward movement. The world now was dirty and diaphanous, like modelling clay when you’ve mixed all the colours together, all the figurines, all the trees. Soon, any property would be reabsorbed into a final matrix: the night. Which also dissipated into the unthought, the unwritten, the nonexistent. Into the white page, above which i lean, and which i will no longer desecrate with the obscene see of my pen.”There is something Borgesian in this scene. But also there is a tangible palpability of this transition between non-existence and existence which I have not seen even in Borges’s universe… So, now, coming back to the usually anticipated question “what is the book about?”. It is partly autobiographical, about the character called Mircea growing in Bucharest in the 50s of the prior century. The society behind the iron curtain infested with ideology and penetrated to the bones by the security forces. It is about his mother and her youth, her experience of Bucharest’s bombing and preceding jazz age. It is an impression of a romanian village in the 40s. According to the novel, they were more happy to be surrounded by the Germans than by the Russians who replaced them:“For a time, there were always Germans in the village. … People didn’t love them of hate them; they became used to them. Only in the years that followed, when the German soldiers were replaced by Russians, did the villages begin to miss them and speak of them fondly.” …”Germans had treated the locals well. They paid for what they drank and ate, down to the last penny, and they played with children and give them chocolate. The charm of their blue eyes would stay with the Tantavans, in contrast to the Russians, who behaved like wild beasts. Rapes and robberies came one after another, and not even the movies with dumb, evil German characters, nor the slogans … would change their conviction, often repeated, if under their breath:”The Germans, you know, they was what they was, but they were good people. But God save you from an angry Russian” A rare acknowledgement that not only the defeated side in the war committed the monstrous acts was refreshing.But mentioning just this “realistic” themes of the novel would diminish it to a tiny fraction of what it is. Moreover, it won’t convey the atmosphere and spellbinding power of this work. Realistic bits are weaved around myths, allegories and philosophic metaphors. Some of the visions are quite bleak and visceral. Certainly the majority of the are unorthodox. On a philosophic level, Cantarescu constantly makes parallel between a human body in all its sophistication and physicality and the universe. They serve as a model for each other. There is a lot of neurologic and medical vocabulary. He uses the body as a map, as a space and as a Russian doll of different realities. He uses the shaven tattooed head of a girl as a history where the drawings are drilling down to any level of details available, but diving into very deep risk crossing the point of no return.Bucharest is the character in the novel. That was another feature I loved. I’ve never been in this city, but I felt like walking its streets. The New York Trilogy and all the books by Orhan Pamuk come to mind.The author also explores the question of God and the creation. His theology is a bit confusing and not fully realised. There is a certain global conspiracy through space and time which is facilitating the creation of a God who later would write them into the world. I have had a gut feeling that he would connect this to Mircea. And I would not like it. He did not in this book which was a relief. “Who reads a poor story of our lives? Of course Him, the Writer. And he reads it once, in the moment he writes it. For the duplication of worlds is a process of writing/reading, as though the umbilical cord connects them, and through the cable, simultaneously. reading and writing cross from both ends, because if he blows his Spirit through the tube, inflating our bubble or soap, we, in turn, reflect his face in it s curve, and through the tube we can see his zirconia, larynx.”  It is a beautiful image, but I think this story line would be farther developed in the following two books which are not translated into English - it is a shame!It so happened that I’ve read quite a few “surreal” novels this year without planning to. I put “surreal” into quotation marks as this novel certainly would fail any categorisation. I’ve read The Last Lover which was fascinating bundle of narratives with superb imagery. I’ve read Will Eaves's Murmur who managed to blend the theory of consciousness and the dreams of Alan Turing’s avatar. At the end, I’ve read The Geography of Rebels Trilogy: The Book of Communities, The Remaining Life, and In the House of July & August The author there also, as Cantarescu, sees her writing as something revealed to her on the page. In her case - through the voices of the medieval saints, the writers long dead and others. But this novel is the most coherent of them all without loosing the magic the imagery. It is a beautiful and ambitious work. Though one need to work hard to reveal this beauty. “What every person had intuited at some point on their lives somehow, suddenly, became clear: that reality is just a particular case of unreality, that we all are, however concrete we may feel,only the fiction of some other world, a world that creates and encompasses us.”PS1) The translation into English by Sean Cotter is brilliant. It is a masterpiece of its own. It was recently announced that he is translating “Solenoid”, the last and the most ambitious Cantarescu’s novel. It has been already translated into main European languages. As usual, English is the last (well, apart from Russian i guess). The novel has been recently nominated on Prix Medicis Etranger in France. 2) The literature and Music interview:http://www.musicandliterature.org/fea......more",Notes are private!,5,58,1,"Aug 25, 2019","Sep 11, 2019","Aug 25, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17288801-blinding

It is not a coincidence that some of them suffer from diplopia. Each main female protagonist has got her mirror reflection in another character. The reflection not in terms of similarities but in terms of the opposites. Magsalin, the translator in Manila meets her double in Chiara, the American filmmaker. Chiara arrived in the country to better understand the last part of her father’s life. She brings with her a script about her father in the 70s and the war in the beginning of the 20s century. Magsalin rewrites this script from her perspective. Somehow the script splits in two (how it happened is opened to an interpretation as many other matters in the text). And the book is broadly structured around these narratives - the road trip of the two women and their two scripts. The essence of the book is post-colonial. And, if one peels the surrounding layers (fascinating and moving by themselves), one would be left with historical tragedy of Balangiga in 1901 during the war between America and Philippines. 44 American military personnel has been killed by the locals. In retaliation, the American forces killed 37 thousands and scorched the earth around according to the book. In spite of the scale of these largely forgotten tragedy, the novel is far from didactic in depicting it. It deals with history in a subtle way. It tries to see this conflict from the perspective of the soldiers as well showing their human side. It also shows inevitable human interactions between them and the locals. There are doubles in this layer as well: one historical figure Casiana Nacionales, the woman who participated in uprising. Her double is fictional Cassandra Chase, the American photographer who managed to document the atrocities. The novel is slightly too gimmicky and postmodern in American sense. It is not Nabokov or Borges in spite of the blurb. But it is serious imaginative work dealing with history, grief, lodging and the complexity of identities in the post-colonial contemporary world. ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Aug 04, 2019","Aug 06, 2019","Aug 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46059484-insurrecto

And if it is the best book of the shortlist, I am very happy about my decision not to spend time reading any others shortlisted this year. Original :Unfortunately I ended up disappointed by this book, though I really wanted to like it. In fact, it is the only book from this year Booker I’ve decided to read. (I’ve read two others before they were long listed. ) It seems this book is widely admired by others. But it has fallen quite short of my personal expectations. The book is devoted to the lives, experiences and ideas of black women in Britain. It is constructed as 12 short stories, superficially interconnected by the author. Each story follows the life of a particular character with “grand finale” when the majority of the characters met. There is also an epilogue with the moving, but predictable twist. The book is celebration of success of these woman, which is really admirable, fantastic intention. But I seriously struggled with the execution of this. First, any individual story reads like a long read article from “The guardian”. It is sketchy, aspirational, it might be a good journalism. But I am not sure it is a good literature. Sometimes the article would become almost feminist manifesto:“We should celebrate with that many more women are reconfiguring feminism and that grassroots activism is spreading like wildfire and millions of women are waking up to the possibility of taking ownership of our world as fully-entitled human being how can we argue with that?”Wonderful, but is it how two lesbian 50 years old friends talk to each other after two bottles of red wine and 4 lines of coke? I do not know. But I doubt. The characters are used as mouthpieces for statements like that: “Her mother was unthinkingly repeating patterns of oppression based on gender”“The idea of reinventing the farm for the people who have reinvented themselves. “When I want to read an article I go to the website or buy a newspaper. I want something different from a book. At minimum I want a complex, human characters. I want depth. Here, the diversity prevail over complexity. The breadth prevails over the depth. All the stories are stories of success of the self made women. But sometimes I found it very hard to believe. The characters overcome horrific traumas such as rape, severe post tantrum depression, drug addiction. How do they do it? Just by the power of their will. In case of drug addiction, staying at home and sweating for a week cured it all. It sounds very naive at best. It is very good to hear such stories. But it should be at least some discussion that it was a rare case of luck. Without it, the whole narrative becomes simply cartoonish. And reading 12 articles under one cover becomes a bit tedious. A lot of true, but tired bits of public discourse are thrown into general mixture. For example, I do not need a character to repeat that a Muslim perpetrator of atrocities would be called a terrorist while the white would be called a madman. Sadly, I heard this one many times before. Or another character would tell me that “ Gender is a social construct” and “femininity and masculinity are society inventions. “ I read my “Guardian”. But if someone does not, I do not think she/he would be converted by seeing it first as a soundbite here. The book is a bit better in the stories of the older characters. It is still quite didactic, but less rhetorical. That feels like a relief. The epilogue involving two oldest characters of 80 and 94 years old is the best part of the whole book. In spite of all rhetoric, the aspirations of these very diverse crowd appear to be relatively middle class - the house, security, to keep a farm inside the family for generations, certain amount of prejudice towards the others. It is probably a good thing. But does it make a good literature? I am not convinced.While reading I could not but compare this book with two different recent novels of the similar topicality: Zadie Smith’s “Swing time” and “The Old Drift” by Namwali Serpell. The former deals with mixed raced friends growing up in London, the latter is structured in very similar way - 9 connected stories of predominantly female characters in Zambia. I found both of these books less than perfect but more successful and effective as fiction. These might affect my general opinion and rating of this book. This is an admirable spirit of a book, feel good manifesto, but it is bit too simplistic as a work of literary fiction. 2.5 stars rounded down....more",Notes are private!,2,849,1,"Jul 30, 2019","Aug 02, 2019","Jul 30, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/41081373-girl-woman-other

Additionally, the individual essays are understandably brief, especially when it comes to the well known people like Buddha, Gandhi or Jinnah.

After meeting Blavatsky she has become a proponent of theosophy and moved to India for good. There she participated in establishing National Congress and trying to promote education. Her life seems to be very interesting and unorthodox. It is a shame I cannot find a good biography of her. It seems she is forgotten now. Wiki page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie...Saadat Hasan Manto - a short stories writer who wrote in Urdu and moved to Lahore from Mumbai after the partition. He wrote about Bollywood, the life in Mumbai and the horrors of the partition. Being a Muslim he was tried 6 times for so-called obscenity in his stories. He was an alcoholic and died at 42. Since finding out about him, I’ve read a few extracts from his fiction and essays. What a powerful talent! I would compare his partition’s stories to Isaac Babel’s stories of pogroms in Odessa. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saada...Subhas Chandra Bose - Indian nationalist and its only military leader of the time who tried to get rid of British rule during the World War II through the alliance with Nazi Germany and Japan. He is definitely a controversial figure, but his destiny shows that the perspective from the colonies on the war was not necessary the same as from the centre. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subha...Overall, it is a worthwhile read with a lot of interesting personalities.

He spent the Second World War and the following years in emigration in Argentina. After 24 years he returned to Europe, but never went back to the Communist Poland. He is considered the one of the most prominent Polish writers and his diary is considered to be his masterpiece. It took me almost 6 months to read this Diary. I found out about its existence while reading the 6th volume of “My struggle” by Knausgard. He was huge fan. And I can see now quite a strong influence of Gombrowicz on Knausgard work. In fact, he might be a trigger for examining Hitler’s life in 200 pages essay within the 6th volume. At one point, Gombrowicz is exclaiming: “Nations of the world, do you still believe that Hitler was only a German?” Knausgard probably took it just like his starting point then. Both are quite contrarians and have strong opinions. But the difference is that Gombrowicz never focuses on the banal or the mundane. The diary was written with the idea of publication. In there, he discusses his novels, his views on philosophy and politics or other writers. He is not big fan of Dante, Proust or Borges’s fans. But he likes Sartre and does not mind Senkevich, Milosz and Shultz. Though he finds a few faults with those as well. He is very self-centred to the point of being narcissistic. Famously, his diary starts from 4 days entries just Monday: Me. Tuesday: Me, and another two days of just that. But he is passionate, he is antinationalist , he is youth lover and a defender of the individual. I liked to read about Argentina through his eyes. Many parts were very alive and interesting, but quite a few others were the polemics with Polish emigration culture which I did not care about. I guess it is worth reading if you are interested in the alternative thinking from the middle of the last century or if you are fascinated by the precursors of the modern auto fiction.

This book might be easily called “ a great Portuguese novel”. It encompasses traumatic, relatively recent past of the country including desperate bloody wars for african colonial possessions followed by the revolution against the dictatorship in 1974 and its aftermath. Four main characters, all ex-millitary men irrevocably damaged by the war, are having the reunion 10 years after coming back. The book is intermingled monologue of these four during the events of this very long night. To say that the characters are unlikable would be an understatement, but they are deeply human all the same. There is a lot of violence, sex and black humour on these pages. There are also very acute and bleak observations of a society under the dramatic change, the meaning of this change and how each human being is forced to be a part of it. It is a very male-dominated novel. There are a lot of female characters but we only see them through the eyes of these four men. For them, the women are either the objects of their admiration or instruments for fulfilling their needs. This attitude reminded me the essay, “Courtly Love, or, Woman as Thing” by Zizek. It is my third novel by Antunes and i love his unique style of writing. It could be called “stream of consciousness”, but it is the stream by at least three characters. In this novel, there are four voices talking, moving forwards and backwards in time, between the reality and the imaginary of their thoughts. It is impossible to appreciate this novel without giving it a full concentration. But it pays off in my case. He manages to combine very bleak, sometimes violent content with lyricism and beautiful imaginary. He also is very good in showing the different layers of a moment: how the outside reality is juxtaposed with the one inside someone’s head. For example, in the fragment below the protagonist is talking to another character, the captain Mendes, all along thinking about his departure from a woman in Goa many years ago: She didn’t even speak in the morning when I left her in the tumbledown house beneath a huge thunderclap, where invisible hands were torturing the clouds as if they were bread dough. The trees were agitated with tics, the brimstone light was shedding quick copper-coloured flashes over the few unmatched pieces of furniture. Not a word, not a sound, her damp fingers extended, an absolute lack of expression on her face, the Jeep heaving hesitantly in the windstorm, battered by loose leaves, trash, gusts of water, splashed of mud brought up be the wheels, just like spit. Through the body, the words, the face, the tunic of captain Mendes, he saw the house growing smaller in the distance, the restless river, the anguish of the woods, his own heart, microscopic, vibrating. Now you are watching the rain fall in some village or other, cookstoves fashioned out of three piles of stones over a small cone of hot coals and twisted logs…It is a long novel. It is a demanding novel. I have to admit, I felt a bit tired by the last 50 pages. The knowledge of context would be probably a plus. However, it is a wise and stylistically superb book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jul 03, 2019","Jul 11, 2019","Jul 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1141361.Fado_Alexandrino

And I am big fan of that novel, especially for its brilliantly controlled structure and experiments with the language styles. This book is nothing of a kind. On the contrary, I think its structure has just sprouted organically from the writing it contains. It is not a problem per se, but it is not the novel to read for the structure or the style. It is quite readable (well at least until the last bit, more about it later). So i kept turning the pages. Inevitably while reading, I’ve noticed how much acclaim it has received from the authors I respect. Ali Smith puts it “the book i wish I’ve written” (albeit she said it changes every week or month) in the Guardian. Salman Rushdie pens up an ecstatic blurb. Machado calls it a “worth heir of Marquez”. All of this sets up quite high expectations. And this book does not quite match it in my opinion.But based upon all these luminous feedback, I feel, it might be nominated for some of the prizes.It is set in Zambia in the period of hundred years from 1904 roughly to the near future 2023. Author follows 3 generations of 3 families. She picks up one character per family and per generation. So in total, the book she has got 9 chapters. Each chapter is broadly a character study when there a single character is given the main exposure supported by a cast of secondary characters. Between those chapters there is a little one page italic monologue by mosquitos. It starts with an introduction written in the first person by the racist colonist Percy Clark who arrived in what would become Zambia in 1904. The problem with this set up is that the whole felt to me quite disjointed. When the character leaves the stage at the end of the chapter, we hardly meet her until the end of the book. And some of those characters, where quite interesting and well constructed, just to be replaced by much interesting solos. The author intrigued me sufficiently with the history of Zambia, but i wish Zambia as a country would play much more role in the novel. I think of “Midnight Children” when I say it. Here, sometimes, the historical events would resurface like dam building, space program or HIV epidemics. But in many other instances I felt it is used more like the colourful backdrop of the novel.Nevertheless, I generally liked the first part of the book, the generation of grandmothers. There is pace in the story telling and the richness of details. The author makes each of three main characters having some physical disability: one has got the thick hair all over her body, another one is blind and the third one starts crying and cries for 50 years. This is called “magic realism” i understood. I thought initially it would connect to some medical breakthroughs later. But no, it stays in magical realism's realm (no pun intended). Initially it made me sigh, but it kind of worked as she uses these features in her plot and i could see she loved those characters. But i was relieved that it stopped in the second part. A few observations on the language. It is very sensory and descriptive. The type of “show not to tell” how they teach to write in schools in the UK and likely in the US as well. It is not too bad. Especially when you have a character who cries buckets non-stop, a blind person which relies on the other senses to perceive the reality or a person with an exotic appearance. But sometimes it is getting little too much: “His teeth were yellowish but she liked his pointy incisors.” The metaphors sometimes are not the most charming: “He led her hands towards his centre”. Or I hardly could imagine Percy Clark, the colonist and the racist, who has just used the N-word saying:  “We were expecting” about his wife being pregnant. In spite of few winces, I kept reading. There were a few stunning episodes. The most memorable and poignant for me was a little tangent story of an American girl who came across an african man left to die on the road after the car accident. It would be wonderful short story. I’ve learned some sad and some encouraging historic facts about Zambia. And it made me google so I am grateful to the author as now I know much more about the region, their struggle for independence in the 60s, their history since then. I enjoyed the company of some of her characters as well.But the last 1/9 including the end has substantially damaged my overall opinion. She has moved gear towards dystopia which was neither particularly original, nor particularly successful. I understood that she studied Afrofuturism in her academic career. That might be a trigger. But for me personally it took away the spell the book has had on me in spite of its limitations.I kept 3 stars as it is a debut novel.

I approached this novel with a certain degree of trepidation. There are only three books I’ve read before my 22nd birthdRayuela, Hopscotch, Cortazar. I approached this novel with a certain degree of trepidation. There are only three books I’ve read before my 22nd birthday which have left a very powerful impression on me: Two Captains which i've read when i was nine (though it is not a children book); The Master and Margarita when i was 17 and Cortazar at 22. I’ve re-read ""Two Captains"" in my 30s and it was still impressive. I am still to re-read ""Master and Margarita"" exactly because i am afraid to spoil the impression of my youth. And this one. I haven't even read it in full back then. The books were scarce when i was a student in St Petersburg. I was given a printout of the first two parts for a few days. So that what i’ve read. Back then, i was totally overwhelmed by the “olive-ashen” ambience it left inside me. Later, in early naughties, i've got myself a copy. But it was sitting on my shelf until now. When i’ve opened it, i had a mixed feeling of anticipation and scepticism. But then I've read the first paragraph:“WOULD I find La Maga? Most of the time it was just a case of my putting in an appearance, going along the Rue de Seine to the arch leading into the Quai de Conti, and I would see her slender form against the olive-ashen light which floats along the river as she crossed back and forth on the Pont des Arts, or leaned over the iron rail looking at the water. It was quite natural for me to climb the steps to the bridge, go into its narrowness and over to where La Maga stood. She would smile and show no surprise, convinced as she was, the same as I, that casual meetings are apt to be just the opposite, and that people who make dates are the same kind who need lines on their writing paper, or who always squeeze up from the bottom on a tube of toothpaste.”And i've realised - many things have changed since i was 22. I’ve moved countries, I’ve seen Paris many times, the city that plays its unique role in the novel. I’ve had a family. But there was one thing which has not changed at all. This first paragraph has totally left me skinless, and vulnerable and ready to dive in head first into this book. It is not about love - it is love itself; it is not about melancholy - it is melancholy; it is not about art of literature, it is the art.Of course it is a very different experience to read it in my 40s compared to reading it in my early 20s. When i’ve read it first time, I appreciated the layer of bohemian existence and philosophic discourse. “In Paris we’ re like fungus, we grow on railings of staircases, in dark rooms with greasy smells, where people make love all the time and then fry some eggs and put Vivaldi records, light cigarettes, and talk…” That was exactly my life and the life of my friends, and we managed to work as well being students. I do not know how. We just did not sleep I guess.Only, when i read it now, I've realised that Cortazar wrote it approaching 50 going through an existential crisis. I did not realise back then that the main character is 40. Cortazar was surprised that his novel has become so popular between the 20 year olds. But it is not that surprising - that is the age when one first time realises that life is not something which happens to you, it is yours. But you still have time and desire to think about what matters, time and desire not to think always about the consequences of your actions…Now, when i read this i see the man, formally a looser.. The man who keeps searching for an absolute which he feels somewhere near almost palpably but tries to define with words, tries to bring into the reality with the clarity and intellect, but it does not work. While there is a woman next to him, with the telling name La Maga. “There are metaphysical rivers she swims in them. I describe and define and desire those rivers but she swims in them.” She does not need to describe and define. And he is going to lose her… Is it all? Yes, for those who look for a plot. Maybe there is more loss, even tragedy, and more joy, more absurd and even humour. There is Paris which is so close one can touch it, and there is, more exotically, an apartment block and a madhouse in Buenos Aires. Many more things shuffle and form patterns “as pretty as can be” like a kaleidoscope in the book which two gays are watching detained overnight in a police truck.This novel is formally inventive. One can read it practically in any order. And this time, I’ve read it following Cortazar’s map hopping the chapters according to the scheme provided in the prologue. I would strongly recommend to do it that way. First of all, it is such a pleasurable dextral experience to be lost in the middle of the book, to go from almost end to almost beginning and never know what comes next. Secondly, it enriches the reading, allows to step out of the limitations and predictability of the linear narrative. One shares with the author a process of contemplating different matters from philosophy to literary craft, witnesses the experiments with the styles, poetic digressions, or sometimes just dives into a detail of another chapter. It is disorienting, but exhilarating and somehow extremely satisfying. Vilas-Matas said that the novel succeeds when it makes the reader somewhat into a writer or into a poet. In this novel, Cortazar voices through his alter-ego, Morelli that the reader should feel as an accomplice with the writer. Hopscotch certainly provided me this.I felt a strong influence of Dostoevsky in this novel. There is an episode when the main character, Horacio Oliveira, is called “an inquisitor”. Also the final scene of the 2nd part when the main character is having a stand off with his friend is allegedly inspired by the confrontation between Rogozin and Myshkin in The Idiot. It is a Dostoevskian novel in its core, but only if Dostoevsky would be allowed to be more romantic, less neurotic and less religious. The feeling of recklessness and fatalism also reminded me The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Each chapter of the book is compositionally complete. And some of them are simply perfect. It made me cry and laugh within a few pages, but also made me think about the language, its limitations. How, when we utter something it suddenly becomes the history, and stops being the feeling:“A whole canfield of words has grown up between La Maga and me, we have only been separated by a few hours and a few blocks any my sorrow is already CALLED sorrow, and my love is called love… I shall keep on feeling less and less and remembering more and more, but what is memory if not the language of feeling, a dictionary of faces and days and smells which repeat themselves like the verbs and adjectives in a speech, sneaking in behind the thing itself, into the pure present, making us sad or teaching us vicariously until one’s self itself becomes a vicar, the backward-looking face its eyes wide, the real face slowly becomes dim as in old pictures and Janus is suddenly any one of us. I’am saying all of this to Crevel, but i am speaking to La Maga now that we are so far apart. And i don’t talk to her with the words that only sued to serve to make us to misunderstand each other, now that its too late I begin to choose others, hers, the ones wrapped up in what she understands and which has no name, sparks and emanations which crackle in the air between two bodies or which can fill a room or a line or poetry with gold dust. “He experiments a lot with the ways of communicating, where the meaning lies. The one of the memorable chapters for me was Chapter 34 when Horacio picks a novel by Benito Perez Galdos left by La Maga. He reads it and thinks about it. What we have is a line from the novel followed by the line of his thoughts while he reads it. And the whole chapter is going like that. That was just brilliant, so effective and so disorienting something like juggling many balls…I can write another 10 pages about this book. But i finish for now by saying I am envious of people who’ve read it in original (English translation is famously good, but still it is a translation. There is a lot of French which is left untranslated. But I had my Russian copy which is excellent and contains copious notes). I'm even more envious of those who are still to discover this novel for themselves.“Hopscotch is played with a pebble that you move with the tip of your toe.The thing you need: a sidewalk, a pebble, a toe, and a pretty check drawing, preferably in colours. On top is Heaven, you almost always miscalculate and the stone goes off the drawing. But little by little you start to get the knack of how to jump over the different squares and then one day you learn how to leave the Earth and make the pebble climb up into Heaven, the worst part of it is that precisely at that moment, when practically no one has learned how to make the pebble climb up into Heaven, childhood is over all of a sudden and you are into novels, into the anguish of the senseless divine trajectory, into speculation about another Heaven that you have to learn to reach too. And since you have come out of childhood, you forget that in order to get to Heaven you have to have a pebble and a toe.”...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Jun 22, 2019",Jul 2019,"Jun 22, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53413.Hopscotch

But even within the area of experimental fiction, this is the hardest book I’ve come across in a long whileI like reading experimental fiction a lot. But even within the area of experimental fiction, this is the hardest book I’ve come across in a long while. I’ve read the first novella twice and I’ve read another two. And I am still at loss what I am supposed to feel or think about it. It is really hard for me to decipher. Maria Gabriella Llamsol is a prominent Portugese writer who spent a substantial part of her life in exile in Belgium during Salazar’s years. She came back to Portugal in the 80s and died in 2008 there at the age of 76. During the last 30 years of her life she was a prolific writer. She never wrote with thinking about her potential readership, but acquired almost cult status, especially between the other writers in Portugal. She was awarded the highest Portugal literary award twice. But she was never translated into English before. This book is her first publication in English. Her writing style is very unique. She uses the page space creatively writing in columns or leaving blank spaces between the words. Her writing is very poetic. If i would compare her to anyone, it would be Virginia Woolf. Look for example on this passage:He leaned against the wall, retreating. In an instant, he crossed the place of Fontiveros, where the houses are lime white that               ; at the same instant, in the garden of Penuela, he remained in prayer all night and, in the morning, they saw him rise up from the earth       the top of the table was rectangular yellow, the predominant colour of the air in Fontiveros and, when it was made into water, it became, in the second layer, a mirror; a wind like that from the river passed by, a wave rose up, a candle was lit within it (the room’s lamp was extinguished, the daylight disappeared): in the candlelight, our faces and handwritings intertwine; they lay in shadow, our severed left hands of Ana de Peñalosa, and they replace the duplicate pages: the second layer broken, they both appeared in a fetal position, mouths dirty with the milk of words; raised in the air, the candle went out, the room’s lamp was extinguished, the daylight disappeared.It is a beautiful writing. But i found her much harder to comprehend. I understood that she was devoted to Catholic mysticism. So maybe my lack of any background knowledge of the tradition did not help. Her characters (she called them figures) in this trilogy are historical personalities:Saint John of the Cross - 15th century Spanish Carmelite monk and the writer of mystical poetry;Ana de Penalosa - the widow and benefactor of St John of the CrossHadewijch - 13the century Dutch female mystic poet Muntzer - 15th century German religious and peasant’s revolt leader who was subsequently beheadedNietzsche - well, we all know himAll these and many other characters are visiting the main protagonist in constantly changing shapes and forms. Sometimes they are people, sometimes they become animals. Sometimes she sees their writing or see them in different period of their life. There was even a tree as a character. I understood that the main female protagonist is the author herself. But some other ers are saying she is Ana de Penalosa. In many ways it does not matter as the novel is a tapestry of visions formed in words. They are often beautiful, but I needed to dismiss with the idea of comprehension of the text as whole. The first two novellas are framed with short texts in italics signed A. Borges. I guess it is a tribute to J L Borges, or maybe not. But these two texts I think give hint to what she intended to achieve in the main body sandwiched in between. And as far as I understood, the idea was to reject the linearity of time or actuality of death. She talks of ‘Remaining life” which is expressed in writing.”Speaking and negotiating, producing and exploring, construct, in effect, the happenings of Power. Writing accompanies the density of Remaining life, of the body’s other Form, which, I tell you here is: Landscape. Writing glimpses, it cannot be used to confine. Writing as in this book, fatally brings power to the loss of memory.” Also i think, these books is an attempt to write the history from the perspective of the common people, absent from historical books: “History does not represent poor man. What was left to us is conception of reality, the shadow, the empty space and a virtuality. Princes wanted only one reality. We ended up thinking there is only one reality. … Even in 3 centuries this reflection remains: reality is social there is only one reality, and it isn’t our own, unless because of wealth, cunning, or merit we believe ourselves to be princes. … What else is history if not the place where the powerful incarnate their ghosts, achievements.” Overall, the philosophic and religious credo of these novellas could be summarised by this quote from the end of the second novella: “It is in exile, in the outside of the outside, that the network of figures, like Ana de Penalise, Nietzsche, Saint John of the Cross, Elkhart, Muntzer, Hadewijch and the others, takes root in order to receive the myth of the remaining life, and wonders whether there will be a place in the human body, among their bodies, where fantastic cosmogonic changes correspond to incredibly slow social mutations. Since no life can ever be lost.”Sounds a bit like Derida’s writing to me. I needed to read these 3 lines for about 10 times before I got a gist of meaning. I think i would need to read these books a few times to get to a glimpse of their meaning properly. On the other hand, one might just enjoy the poetic language which is a plenty in there as well....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jun 10, 2019","Jun 12, 2019","Jun 10, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34381087-geography-of-rebels-trilogy

But it might be not everyone’s cup of tea. Broadly speaking, the book is an intellectual satire, devoted to the ideas and the lifestyle of “the generation of lead”. These are the children of contemporaries and survivors of the Dirty War in Argentina in mid 70s of the last century. That was the terrible time of terror inflicted on the country by the radical right government and death squads which followed the insurgence of the radical left. As a result, the lead generation’s kids are quite cynical in terms of radical ideologies both right and left.Their view of the world is more philosophic, experimental and hedonistic. Pola, the author of the book, belongs to this generation and she is philosophy graduate. So she is well placed to write such a book. In terms of its focus, it reminded me The Remainder- another book about post-trauma generation in Latin America - Chile. But the books are very different in their tone and emphasis. “The Remainder” is more dreamy while this sometimes borderlines theoretical discourse and sometimes extremely funny. But in both cases, I was impressed by the precision and focus of their female authors tackling such a violent serious subject matter.I would not talk about the plot apart from saying that there are two main parallel narratives with quirky original characters and a lot of digressions into anthropology, psychology, theology and philosophy. (I needed to check out a few words which i did not know, “consubstantiation” or “evanescent” are examples). There are a lot of references to sex as well. The main theme of the book is an investigation of the nature of human violence. A fictional anthropologist, the contemporary of Freud, has developed the theory: “This primordial trauma - not that of having predators, as Freud had recently suggested in Totem and Taboo, but that if having been prey - explained the human fascination with transforming ourselves into predatory beast, as fellas our instinct for war and our talent for violence.”  The anthropologist has later disappeared in Africa without the trace. And, at present, the one of the characters is trying to develop and improve this theory. All of it might sound a little dry, but the book sometimes made me laugh loud. It is quite an angry satire at times. And she applies it to the right, the left and the academia, the old guerrillas and the young hipsters. So it might offend a few sensitive souls. But i enjoyed it. The translation by Roy Casey is superb. There is also a very helpful translator’s note at the back. He also posted the  here on GR.It is telling that after publishing this novel Pola has become the subject of controversy in Argentina as apparently she stepped out of the territory assigned to female writers. I am really happy that she did. And I plan to read her new book which is just out in English.PSJust thought I would add a few quotes to give the ""taste"" of her writing and sense of irony:“It is well known that the experience of terror late at night is essential to a thorough understanding of political philosophy.""On European expats in Argentina: “Pabst took advantage of the pause to slide few xenophobic notes into Mara’s ear: -These poorly educated Europeans emigrate in search of a culturally backward paradise where they can display whatever leadership qualities they possess against a background of urban third-wordiness. They are just neighbourhood demagogues pretending to be part of the vanguard here where it’s easier to be such a thing, and then bragging about how cheap the rent is to their supermarket manager friends in Munster or Riga or Rouen.”  “ugly people are inevitably more intelligent than beautiful people, because they’ve had to develop more sophisticated means of obtaining things.”...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jun 06, 2019","Jun 11, 2019","Jun 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34713510-savage-theories

So my advice would be not to try to rationalise what you read as it might not work. The author calls Kafka as her literary influence. But i did not find any existential dread which is so palpable in Kafka. It is more like “Alice in Wonderland” for the adults, if anything. It also reminded me Daniel Kharms and Russian literature of absurd. It is not a magical realism per se as there is hardly any connection to the daily reality as we know it. So what it is? “Everyday life has transformed into a dreamland, one that was like a chain of interlocking rings” - says the author on behalf of a character. That is exactly what the book was for me: a chain of connected surreal stories that play with and often merge the dichotomies of East-West, love-sex and even humans-animals. There are six main characters, 3 couples, and the noisy numerous supporting cast. All main characters are either lost themselves or lost the connection with their love. As a result, they are on the individual quests to recover their status. But we never know whether they are moving physically or just within their consciousness. All relationships are illusive. There are lots of unfilled desires within the relationship, but satisfied somehow outside. The pages are buzzing with insects, snakes, mice. There are forests from books, rubber plantations, gambling city and poppy fields. The one of the most intriguing sequences reminded me vaguely Pedro Paramo while a female character arrives to a place sustaining on the farming tortoises. But the place looks totally deserted as inhabitants do not generally come out of the houses.Many characters are intended to be westerners as they are inhabitants of the country A which is a Western country according to the book. But i really struggled to believe them as the westerners so devoid of logic they were, even in their mental landscapes. I think it is a deeply eastern (maybe even Chinese) view of a western person.Someone said about her other book that her novels are like a vase. Each reader fills it in with its own content. I could have started to fill it in with my interpretations, but i generally did not have a need as I enjoyed the illusiveness and the absurd of what i’ve been reading when i stopped caring about applying any logic to it. It was like looking through a kaleidoscope when you would never guess the next combination of the elements, but would enjoy the pattern nevertheless. Overall, jolly good ride, not for everyone probably. I will be more mentally ready if i decide to read her other books.3.5 stars rounded up...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jun 04, 2019","Jun 06, 2019","Jun 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18723434-the-last-lover

I've read a lot of books translated by her from Spanish and Portuguese including Javier Marias, Pessoa, Eca de Queroz. Therefore the fact that she edited this collection automatically triggered my attention. She also wrote a short introduction where she said: ""This anthology is double celebration, firstly of six brilliant Portuguese women writers, and, secondly, of the short story form, at which they are excelled."" And this is exactly what this book is. After reading these stories, I have an impression that the work of these six women is a classics in Portugal. It is a shame that they are not well represented in English. The variety of their literary styles is exciting, and all the stories are wonderful. It was a pleasure to read realistic, but very heart-warming stories by Sophia de Mello. Agustina Bessa-Luis could easily compete with Kafka. The world of Teolinda Gersao is surreal but more firmly grounded into the reality of female daily existence. Maria Carvalho's novella is a quite bleak social satire, but it is full of insights and black humour. Lidia Jorge writes a very carefully constructed prose. Ricardo Piglia said in his essayTheses on a short story that the best of them contain two levels - the one on the surface and the one carefully hidden. And the story essence lies in how these two levels interact. I was thinking about it a lot reading her stories. And Hellia Correia is the most surreal, absurdist and daring of them all. Each writer is specially introduced through half a page bio which i've found very helpful as well. I appreciated ""the celebration of the short form"". It so happened that I've recently read quite a few collections of short stories including Borges, Dinosaurs On Other Planets, Mephisto's Waltz: Selected Short Stories and this collection. I've always liked the form. But this time it is not about the plot and the characters for me. I experience an overwhelming aesthetic pleasure of reading them, discover the variety of possible constructions, brevity and elegance. Before reading, I did not know about any of the writers included in this collection. And now I feel dissatisfied as, apart from two cases, their work is not translated into English. But if you like short stories and want to try the less known path, i cannot recommend this collection more. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"May 31, 2019","Jun 04, 2019","May 31, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38579800-take-six

The book contains 14 short stories by him written in the period from 1957 to 1994. I found these short stories visceral, exquisitely composed, but relatively challenging. One needs to work to appreciate him. But after some initial effort, I’ve enjoyed this collection, especially the last few stories. He is at his best when he introduces two, or sometimes even 3 layers of the narrative. He is more interested in the creative process rather than the plot. So he often introduces a writer who writes the story at the same time we read it. I found it a brilliant framing device giving an additional depth to the text. He calls it listening “to the voices through the voices”. In the last story of this collection, “The dark twin”, Pitol’s protagonist summarises his literary credo:“A novelist is someone who hears voices through the voices. He crawls into bed, and suddenly those voices force him to get up, to look for a sheet of paper and write three or four lines, or just a couple of adjectives or the name of a plant. These features, and a few others, cause his life to bear a striking resemblance to that of a deranged, which doesn’t bother him at least; on the contrary, he thanks his muses for having transmitted these voices to him without which he would feel lost. With them he goes about drawing the map of his life. He knows that when he is no longer able do it, death will come for him, not the final death but leaving death, silence, hibernation, paralysis, which is infinitely worse.”Contrary to any rules, I would recommend to start reading this book from this last story. It is the one of the best in the collection and it gives a very good idea about his writing style. I think, it would help you to decide if you want to read the whole book.

The book is structured in a form of the footnotes to an unwritten novel. The novel, which should have been written by ""the writers of No"" - those writers who have stopped to write early in their life, or those who never started. If it sounds complicated, it is actually not. It is very playful, humorous and erudite collection of anecdotes discussing the motivation to write, the reasons to stop writing, the writers- different characters and personalities for the last few centuries, starting from a young woman who has contributed to Goethe's Faustus without being properly attributed, and finishing with Juan Rulfo who has published his masterpiece ""Pedro Paramo"" and never wrote another piece of fiction in his remaining life. It seems that for the majority of serious writers stopping writing is an equivalent of stopping living. Accidentally, straight after this book, i was reading a collection of short stories by Sergio Pitol, the Mexican author. He says: ""He (a novelist) knows that when he is no longer able to do it (to write), death will come for him, not the final death but living death, silence, hibernation, paralysis, which is infinitely worse.""  That is why it is such a fascinating topic of investigation. I have to say, I am grateful to those ""No""-writers for their contribution as I am seriously struggling with the volume of the ""Yes"" ones.I like the voice of the protagonist, a lovable humpback who enjoys his solitude and much less melancholic than I initially assumed him to be. There are subtle allusions to Pessoa's ""Book of disquiet"". However, this little book is very different from Pessoa's masterpiece. It is directed outwards blending literary criticism with the imaginary diary and not taking life or literature too seriously. ...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"May 17, 2019","May 20, 2019","May 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58832.Bartleby_Co_

I’ve head this novel for a number of years, and now after reading a lot of excellent books from Latin America, That was a significant disappointment. I’ve head this novel for a number of years, and now after reading a lot of excellent books from Latin America, i decided it was the time to pick it up. First of all I’ve discovered that Neumann has left Argentina when he was 12 and now lives in Spain. I like Spanish literature as well. So it did not stop me.The novel starts when a traveller called Hans arrives in a city somewhere on the border between Prussia and Saxony. Soon we find out that the city is very enigmatic. One cannot quite remember its layout and people rarely leave the city after spending there some time there. Soon he meets a bunch of the locals and starts to frequent a salon. The novel is set in the first half of 19th of after the Napoleonic wars. Based upon all of this, i’ve assumed that it would be something vaguely in a style of The Magic Mountain - the novel of ideas and debates, but maybe a lighter version. And the first half was broadly that. However, the ideas were all far from original and the conversations were dull. Often Neumann had this tendency of listing what the characters were talking about rather than conveying the actual conversation. My son’s school calls it: “to tell instead of to show”. Below are two examples:“Professor Mietter railed against the Council of Trent. Herr Gottlieb spoke of an understanding between the different creeds. Herr Levin referred to the influence of Semitic studies and astronomy""“Seeing Rudi stand up with him, Her Goitleeb paused - should he go first… As Rudi in turn waited courteously… there was a moment of comical embarrassment.”  - I seriously did not need to be told which moment it was. I could just about guess.The topics of discussions were wide. But the discussions per se were either as above, or well-known like Kant’s views on the nationality, for example. To make it more appealing these debates were intermingled with Hans interacting with another set of characters: organ-grinder (named only in this way, living in a cave), and his friends - a factory worker and a peasant. These episodes would not be more entertaining as they always started with the organ-grinder asking everyone about their dreams which were dully reported. I do not like dreams in fiction. But those were quite dull and numerous even compared with an average standard. The character of organ-grinder could be a nice diversion, but the man was relatively passive, so it was not. And i was irritated by his name as well. In Spanish he would be el Organillero, which is ok. But in English it sounds like teeth grinding. (I know that it is a translation issue rather than the novel per se).All of this was going on and on. However finally, after 300 pages, a classic love triangle has been properly established! The love between Hans and Sophie, a proto-feminist salon’s hostess, have been consummated. Obviously it was happening behind the back of Sophie’s fiancé , the local landowner. The book tone has changed a little and it has started to remind a pastiche of an early 19th century’s romantic novel with the element of picaresque. The love has sparkled in full blossom and their lovemaking was taking place between the joint translation of the european baroque and contemporary poetry. The poetry bits and conversations about translation process were mildly interesting. But the numerous erotic scenes were not all to my liking (view spoiler)[(how about a fetish by Sophie over Hans’s big toes; and talking about menstruation and Kant almost simultaneously). (hide spoiler)] Also a subplot with love/sex-thirsty 13 year old girl (fortunately not taken to the logical end) was not particularly entertaining. I did not appreciate the language either, the creativity of such similes for example: “Leaving already? Hans asked touching her nipple like someone pressing the bell”.The attitudes of the lovers were quite interesting as well. Her: “If i weren’t going to love a man id do better to marry one who was rich and kind. You may think this conformist, but I prefer to call it pragmatism.” Him:  “The truth is we never the only ones. Everyone is or thinks about being with others.” And if she sleeps with the other men at the same time: “She’ll give me more pleasures and can teach me what she learns with others.” Oh, and then a serial rapist has appeared on the streets of the city. You know the feeling when you read the book and think when is it going to end. That was such a book for me. I was too much invested when I understood it was not going to be better. I kept reading as i wanted to find out how he would resolve the triangle. I hoped he just would not resolve it at all - leave it open. It would be a good way to finish. Any other resolution would be either unrealistic or banal. Well, he did not fulfil my hopes with that either. But at least he did not choose the most banal one.Now, I am not sure whether to try any other book by him. I’ve seen an interview with him and I liked the man.

They often stop at the moment of uncertainty. I could feel the time paused, the image created. But there was no resolution as in life. And that gives a unique space for the reader to be in - not so much to make your own ending, but to participate in the moment, burdened with possibilities.I enjoyed all stories which is rare for a collection.

So this time around I did not know what to expect. And this time around I am totally in awe to his genius. I would finish the story and go back to the beginning to read it again. This collection was written later that The Fictions. And it is better to read them in the order they’ve written. “Fictions” creates the universe. And makes you to look at it with the new eyes. This is darker, more diverse and more grounded in the day-to-day reality, or maybe, it tries to catch that threshold between day-to-day and our consciousness. In many of this stories, he brings Borges as a narrator to be a character within the story. This brings the events almost painfully close.As in all his work, the ideas of time, metaphors and symbols, the symmetry and labyrinths, the coins and the swords, the identity and betrayal, the divinity and infinity, are all present. Ricardo Piglia writes that “Borges’s greatest lesson is perhaps certainty that fiction doesn’t only depend on the person who constructs it, but also on the person who reads it.” Barthes extended this notion to the whole literature. So any individual approaching these stories will take away something unique. Below are just few of my thoughts on the stories. Aleph - the concept of reality as diverse but single whole containing infinitely many, containing infinity. Borges in the story was able to see it, but only for a brief time. The concept reminded the beauty of monism of Advaita Vedanta, the branch of indian phisophy. I am not fan of the lists in literature. But here the story contains the long list of things Borges sees looking at Aleph. And the list is probably the most powerful of a kind. Aleph is also the mathematical symbol if the smallest infinity. However, the story is not only about abstract. It masterfully connects the world of human passions with the abstract notions.The limits of imagination and our own preconceptions. In the story “Averroes search” the famous schooler in Cordoba is trying to translate Aristotle But totally cannot imagine what might be “a comedy” or “a tragedy”as such forms of art are not forbidden in Islam (at least based upon the story). He cannot do it. But at the end of the story he disappears together with the whole world just created by Borges on the page. And the reason - Borges thinks his power of properly imagine Averroes is as limited by his background and knowledge as Averroes power of imagining a tragedy. The direction of civilisation with time. In the story “Immortal” the people who reached immortality, instead of infinitely bettering themselves, have forgotten whatever they know, including the language, as they had an unlimited time for everything. In the other story “The story of the warrior and the captive maiden”, the absurdity of what we aspire to as civilisation has shown even more vividly. A barbarian soldier, stunned by the beauty of Ravenna, changes the sides and fights for the Romans. The conclusion seem to be clear. But it is immediately juxtaposed with the story of an english girl kidnapped by an Indian tribe and totally assimilated with their ways of living. Two stories might seem opposite but Borges concludes : “ Nevertheless both were carried by the secret impulse, impulse greater than the reason, and both obeyed that impulse they could not justify. Perhaps the story i have recounted is a single story. To God, the obverse and reverse of this coin are the same.”And i can write more and more. But i would probably stop here. And at the moment, I do not know how i could come back to reading modern novels after the clarity and the vision of these stories, each of them not more than 5 pages....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"May 06, 2019","May 07, 2019","May 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5787.The_Aleph_and_Other_Stories

For those who want to know the sIt is a beautiful novel.It is not about so-called immigration crisis though there is a big shadow of it in the novel. For those who want to know the shocking facts of the crisis it is better to start with her brilliant essay Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in Forty Questionsand The Line Becomes A River: Dispatches from the Borderthe book by Cantu. It is not a road trip novel, at least not in the the usual sense - you would not see a lot of other people and landscape changes though you would see some. You would not spend a lot of time witnessing the struggle of the human beings with the elements either though there is a little bit of that.It is rather a sparse and meandering space of reflection how a particular family ends. What is the place or art and its creation in the modern life. How something which was remote yesterday suddenly becomes very close, scary and urgent. How the relationship between the grown-ups affects children. How the politics cannot be disentangled from the personal, even if we would keep pretending it can. And how our children perceive the world through our eyes, but equally are trying to make sense out of it and act totally independently. It is the novel which ask powerful questions without an attempt to answer them categorically. (In his essay The Blind Spot: An Essay on the Novel, Javier Cercas calls this “a blind spot” of a novel and suggests it is an imperative for its long lasting impact.) And if this novel is a journey, it is more of a journey through reading books and thinking about them. All main characters - Mother, Father, the Boy (10) and the Girl (5) are the readers and story-tellers as well. Being a Mexican and a native Spanish speaker, Luiselly has written the book in English but with the deep roots in a certain Latin American literary tradition where the act of reading by the characters, mentioning other books and their impact is a very natural process and integral part of the narrative. And this intertextuality does not feel artificial at all. In many cases, it is more important than actions and the plot. In my limited observation, this way of writing fiction is very different from the mainstream English language plot driven literature. A book about writers are frowned upon as pretensions and boring. Mentioning the other works are considered “name dropping”. It is a pity. But i think, it has begun to change with the penetration of other influences into English-language literary landscape through the works in translation and the writers like Luiselli who start writing in English. The one of the most beautiful passages in the book is devoted to the moment when the Wife is reading Sontag. It has been quoted everywhere, I’ve heard Luiselli reading it aloud, but i cannot stop myself from quoting it here:“When i read Sontag for the first time, just like the first time i read Arendt, Dickinson, and Pascal, I kept having those sudden, subtle, and possibly micro chemical ruptures - little lights flickering deep inside the brain tissue- that some people experience when they finally find words for a very simple and yet till then utterly unspeakable feeling. When someone else’s words enter consciousness like that, they become small conceptual light marks. They are not necessary illuminating. A match struck alight in a dark hallway, the lit tip of a cigarette smoked in bed at midnight, embers in a dying chimney: none of these things has enough light of its own to reveal anything. Neither do anyone’s words. But sometimes a little light can make you aware of the dark, unknown space that surrounds, of the enormous ignorance that envelops everything we think we know. And the recognition and coming to terms with the darkness is more valuable than all the factual knowledge we may ever accumulate.”I feel the allusion to the Plato’s cave in this but somehow her words are more intimate and immediate. The perception of “name dropping” is also affected by the growth of auto-fiction in the anglo-sphere. But I would not pigeon-hall this book as auto fiction. I think her characters are imaginary, in spite of the obvious resemblance to her personal life. For example, I think the Husband here could be a man with some native american heritage (vs a fellow Mexican in real life). At least his knowledge and interest in their story and her physical description of him points me that way. Also in real life, Luiselli’s stepson was not part of her nuclear family as he was living in Mexico. But the Boy's character is very much part of the family and plays the huge role in the book.Without being a bold proclamation, the novel is thoughtfully political. The Wife is preoccupied by her planned project about the crisis on the border as well as the disappearance of two girls of her immigrant friend. On this background, she comes across to such a line in a local newspaper: “60 or 90 thousand of alien children mass that has come to america”. She thinks:  “Reading articles like this one, I find myself amused at their unflinching certitude about right and wrong, good and bad. Not amused, actually, but actually a little frightened. None of this is new, though i guess i am simply accustomed to dealing with more educated versions of xenophobia. I don’t know which is worse.”  Unhappily, I can sign up under each word of this last sentence.Children are wonderfully natural and alive in the novel, though all they do at the first part is sitting at the back of the car. Their presence inevitably leads to a reflection how our present and the past affects future. I would just pinpoint two observations by the Wife. Being in a confounded space, they listen to the radio and discuss politics, they tell stories about the past. She thinks: “I suppose we all contribute to the xenophobic inertias with the versions of history we tell our children.”  And it is so true and so unavoidable, how we program our kids with our own misconceptions which in turn, we took unconsciously from our parents. How to deal with that? Is knowing where you come from overrated?Another, more specific observation is related to how they teach children to write in America and the UK. (I do not know about other english-speaking countries, but it is very different from where I am originally from). Her 5 years old daughter splits the page into squares for Beginning, Problem, Resolution and the End. So, at the age 5, the first thing children learn, even before they can write, that each story has to have a plot. Each story has to have a problem. Each story has to have an end. Why? I was amazed with this approach when my son was at that age. They’ve hardly talked about any stories, hardly listened to them before they’ve been taught some pragmatic, and quite frankly limiting formula. The Wife comments: Bad literary education begins too early and continues for way too long. So many more things i can talk about. My head is still buzzing with this novel. I can mention how the echoes are playing on its pages between the present and the past, the real and the imagined. I can also mention that it is beautifully and carefully designed book; that there are polaroid photos, the list of names of the children perished crossing the border (similar to the novels of Dasa Drndic who is mentioned as well), maps, documents etc. There is also a novel within the novel which normally i would consider a step too far. But it worked for me here when i’ve figured out what it was. The first half of the book was narrated by the Wife. Then the narrator has changed and the novel has moved into a different gear in terms of pace and the atmosphere. I struggled initially with the “suspension of disbelief”, but the novel was alluding more and more to the spirit Pedro Páramo which I’ve just finished - the one of those serendipitous coincidences -so it carried me through. And the end has moved me close to tears.PS 1This book was nominated on Woman’s Prize 2019. But was not shortlisted which is a real shame. The fact is vindicating my view not to read by the lists, especially the lists of the prizes. PS2Valeria Luiselli is a millennial born in 1983. Why don’t they call her “a voice of millennial generation” then? In my view, she is a way better than the other books by the millennials I’ve read (a very limited sample I have to admit). Maybe I know why they do not. Maybe because her writing easily transcends generational divide and talks about something timeless being deeply in engaged in our time. Quotes:About our time:We don’t know how to explain it yet, but I think we all can feel it, somewhere deep in out gut or in our brain circuits. We feel time differently. No one has quite been able to capture what happening or say why. Perhaps its just that we sense as absence of future, because the present has become too overwhelming, so future has become unimaginable. And without future, time feels like only an accumulation. An accumulation of months, days, natural disasters, television series, terrorist attacks divorces, mass migrations, birthdays, photographs sunrises. We have not understood the exact way we are now experiencing time. And maybe the boy’s frustration at not knowing what to make a picture of, or now to frame and focus the things he sees as we all sit inside the car, driving across this strange, beautiful, dark country is simply a sign of how our ways of documenting the world have fallen short. Perhaps if we found a new way to document it, we might begin to understand this new way of experience space and time.Concerns of being a modern artist (who presumably wants to make a difference):Political concerns: How can a radio documentary be useful in helping more undocumented children find asylum?Aesthetic problem: On the other hand, why should a sound piece, or any other form of storytelling, for that matter, be a means to a specific end? I should know by now that instrumentalism, applied to any art form, is a way of guaranteeing really shitty results: light pedagogic material, moralistic young-adult novels. boring art in general.Professional hesitance: But then again, isn’t art for art’s sake so often an absolutely ridiculous display of intellectual arrogance?Ethical concern: And why would I even think that I can or should make art with someone else’s suffering?Pragmatic concern: Shouldn’t I simply document, like the serious journalist I was when I first started working in radio and sound production?Realistic concern: Maybe it is better to keep the children’s stories as far away from the media as possible, anyway, because the more susceptible it is to becoming politicised, and in these times, a politicised issue is no longer a matter that urgently calls for committed debate in the public arena but rather a bargaining chip that parties use frivolously in order to move their own agendas forward.Constant concerns: Cultural appropriation, pissing all over someone else’s toilet seat, who am I to tell this story, micromanaging identity politics, heavy-handedness, am I too angry, am I mentally colonised by Western-Saxon-white categories, whats the correct use of personal pronouns, go light on the adjectives, and oh, who gives a fuck how very whimsical phrasal verbs are?Political Narrative to be fed to the masses:I think of Manuela’s girls (the disappeared ones), and its hard not to be overcome by rage. But I suppose its always been like that. I suppose that the convenient narrative has always been to portray the nations that are systematically abused by more powerful nations as a no-mans-land, as a barbaric periphery whose chaos and brownies threaten civilised, white peace. Only such narrative can justify decades of dirty war, interventionist policies, and the overall delusion of moral and cultural superiority of the world’s economic and military powers.It has won IMAC prize in May 2021, two years since I’ve read it. So well deserved. I am very happy for Luiselli. I hope she would publish something new soon. ...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Apr 26, 2019","Apr 29, 2019","Apr 26, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40245130-lost-children-archive

And it is so true for all his books I've read so far. He is a poet in everything he writes. And he writes mainly about other writers, poets, literary critics. He also adheres to the tradition, called by a fashionable word ""intertextuality"" of mentioning and discussing other books and blurring the artificial division between fiction and non-fiction (This tradition has got deep roots in Spanish language literature. It might be traced all the way to Don Quixote, but more recently it is very visible in the modern Latin American Literature starting from Borges, the Argentinians, and all the way to Zambra and Luisseli). The novel is devoted to the darkest times in recent Chilean history - the time of the dictatorship. The narrator is an old padre who is a literary schooler as well. Through his eyes, we experience the biggest power of any dictatorship - the power of sticky fear which would stop a human being thinking about the morality of his choices. Padre, or rather Bolano also tells a lot stories and possibly changes the endings. But there is one story there for which Bolano did not change much.This is the story of an aspiring writer and her charming american husband.

Firstly, the book is set in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, oil-reach trans-Caucasian country which many people would not be able place on the map. The time frame is the turbulent beginning of the last century, the first oil boom, the Russian revolution, the Young Turks and the fall of Osman empire are just a few cataclysms affecting the region. Secondly, the author of the book is unknown. The book is written from the perspective of Ali, the young and rich Muslim Prince. But the most likely author is a Jewish exile in Europe Lev Nisselbaum who has converted into Islam during his time in Germany and was known there as Essad-Bey. And lastly, the book was first published in 1937 in Germany - very unusual place and time for such a novel.I would recommend to read this book if you are interested in the atmosphere and the history of the place. The book is brilliant in describing the Caucasian region at the beginning of the last century. I could not stop but feeling that the destiny of Caucasus falling under the Soviet rule was not inevitable at all. Instead it was the one of the cruel cards served to the region in geopolitical games between the big powers. Obviously a bit idealised, but Baku is described as a cosmopolitan vibrant rich city where Muslims, Christians and foreigners live together in a relative piece. It was the fringe of the Russian Empire before the revolution. However, strong case for the independence of the region really existed when the Empire has started to crumble. Apart from Azerbaijan the main characters take us to Iran, Georgia and Dagestan. The sense of place is always vivid: Georgian hospitality, Persian sleepiness at the time, the simple life with the elements in a mountain village in Dagestan. One can learn a lot of history in this slim novel. There is also a powerful insight into a Muslim’s male mind. The main character is in love with the Georgian girl who is obviously Christian, cosmopolitan and does not want to compromise her identity beyond a certain measure. She, for example refuses, to cover her face. He, on the other hand, is trying to understand better where are the limits of his faith. This is very ancient enigmatic region. Armenia and Georgia existed well before any concept of Europe. There predated the Byzantine Empire as well and were the ones of the first places in the world adopting Christianity. Azerbaijan was the part of Persia, I believe. That is why they are Shiite Muslims. The book and the stories within it have resonated with me on personal level. It reminded me the well forgotten trip of my youth. The one of my first ever trips in fact. When I was 16, the group from my school, has travelled on the train from Kiev to Baku. The train journey took 70 hours one way. When we arrived in Baku I felt that the ground literally moved under my feet for a day after that train’s vibration. But before we arrived, we experienced a lot of cultural shocks. The group contained around 6 girls. On the last day of our journey, two things happened. First, we have seen the desert and proper caravan of camels travelling behind the windows of the train. I had an impression the caravan was going quicker than we. Secondly, our group leader, the young man of around 25 was approached by the group of Azerbaijani looking men with the business offer to sell us (6 girls) for a good price. Fortunately, we did not know what the men were talking about. But they look very amiable and smiling. Again, fortunately for us, our group leader has rejected their proposition saying he needs us for other things. The simple word of our leader seemed to be more powerful than the legal aspect of the suggested proceedings. So we were left alone, at least for a time being. The city, when we arrived seemed empty, the powerful winds were blown alone the streets. So when Baku was mentioned as a city of winds in the novel, it brought back a vivid memory. We’ve seen the Maiden tower - beautiful medieval construction which is as well mentioned in the book. We did not venture far enough without our sympathetic young local guide. But he took us into very weird places like an illegal leather shop. It was the time when the shelves of the proper shops were totally empty anywhere in the disintegrating Soviet Union. So he probably wanted to please us. But we did not have money anyway. We’ve also visited a Chikhana - the place where men only were having tea from very small cups while biting sugar stones. What was also striking how friendly the people were towards each other. One might stop a trolleybus anywhere by just raising a hand. It was the end pf 1989 I believe. We left and in a few months Baku has become a centre of the bloody events Baku's pogrom . I could not believe the news. The last time something similar took place was the time of Ali and Nino.Ok, back to the book. The life story of its alleged writer, Lev Nisselbaum was so dramatic that it was become the subject of the book itself The Orientalist: Solving the Mystery of a Strange and Dangerous Life. The american journalist Tom Reiss has followed the traces of Lev from Baku to Berlin and later to Italy were Lev died prematurely in 1942. Someone called ""Ali and Nino” Azerbaijan’s “Doctor Zhivago”. There are certainly a lot of similarities. However, the Pasternak’s book is much stronger work of literature. “Ali and Nino” is a profound document to the time and place, very moving, but the storytelling is relatively straightforward and a bit of overdramatising sometimes. However, it contains a lot of interesting details about the cataclysms in the region and a moving love story. I personally was also grateful for the opportunity of re-living some moments of my 16-year old self which the book has dogged out from my memory. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Apr 11, 2019","Apr 17, 2019","Apr 11, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/474078.Ali_and_Nino

They are ahead of it in social and political terms, albeit on the trajectory which i would not call highly desirable. Russia is driven by simulacrum. For better reference see Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia. Ukraine has just elected the president, a comedian, whose only previous political exposure was playing a role of the teacher in a sitcom who is becoming the President. Just like that. And India - the biggest democracy, at least so far, which is in the process of electing a Hindu nationalist for a second time who is promising to make it “great again”. This book is about Indian millennials. Can I even use this word for this generation of Indians? Though faced with the similar problem of the lack of jobs, they are totally opposite to the stereotype of a Western millennial who tends to feel a bit of a victim of the circumstances. The Indians guys do not have time for sentimentality. The story how they are dealing with their fate encouraging - they really dream big, but also it is very frightening. They are not stopping at making their country “great again”. They literally want to rule the Universe. Here comes Sinhal, the owner of the WittyFeed, a click-baiting operation. What does he thinks? “He thinks if he can build $30 mln companies telling americans things they do not need to know there is nothing he can’t do. “India is too small. I want to lead humanity. Humanity is bigger than country. I want to go outside the earth. I want to lead Mars.” One planet is not enough. Of course his hero is Eton Mask. But this chap is not alone, it seems. Far from it. And is confident of his dream. Is this coming to the West as well or is it already here?It is such a powerful book. It is dense with the profound observations. During a few years, the author was following a number of young people. The majority of them are men, but there is one woman between them. There is a young owner of a internets start-up, mentioned above who considers himself a founder of the family. There is a teacher of English who in the process of becoming a motivational guru. There is an aspiring male beauty model, a poor muslim man, who wins some beauty pageant but cannot find any legal way to earn money: “He had tried his luck at honest work, form running a memo shop to selling door handles, but only to fail harder every time. I couldn’t blame him for thinking that cheating is essential for success; he didn’t know a single person who became rich without cheating their way up . Muslim men.”; Next is a female student, the first to become a student president. There is a political fixer and yes, the last but not least - a bunch of scammers whose idea of employment are working for the company successfully chasing pensioners in America and Europe over the phone and internet.It is really worthwhile and revealing reading experience. Without farther retelling, I just leave below the author’s shocking and concise portrait of the Millennials in her country:“100 million to absorb. A wave of aspiration sweeping the countryside. But no jobs. ‘Farther you live from a big city the bigger your dreams”. “The physical life around them did not change but 20 year old in Indore has got the same access to information that Ipswich - and could very well have the same desires. They see no connection between where they live and what they want from their lives.”“What happens when a hundred million people suddenly start dreaming big in a place where no-one is prepared for it - families, teachers, employers, governments? They realise they are on their own. They reconcile themselves to the idea that they must build a world in which they can be what they want to be, where how well you do depends on how badly you want to do well. Once they have created this bubble of aspiration, they chase their dreams like their life depends on it - do or die.”“This is the generation of Indians hanging between extremes. They are hitting adulthood with the cultural values of their grandparents - socially conservative, sexually timid, god-fearing - but the life goals of American teenagers: money and fame. .. They are the most global young indians ever with the narrowest idea of what it means to be indian based on language, region, religion and an exaggerated notion of the country’s pre-colonial glories.”“They want money influence power. Become guru. They were obsessed with their dreams and attempts to make them real.”“Irrespective of whether they are rich or poor, young Hindu men I meet want the same things: economic growth over social justice, majoritarian democracy over liberal democracy, cultural nationalism over secularism, boundary wars rather than friendly relations. “And I cannot empathise more with this: ""Unlike young Indians today i could not be angry with the world because I did not have enough reason. I was too busy fascinated with that. Unlike the young people I now encounter a twenty-year-old me didn’t want india to rule the world. I was happy just to see my country become one within it. I similarly inherited my parents’ prejudices, rarely voiced, of class, caste, religion. Unlike the twenty-year-olds of 2017, though, I was fortunate enough to become a thinking adult before post-truth - so I didn’t read books to validate my ideas but to question them.

This and my long time fascination with India has prompted me to finally pick up Katherine Boo’s masterpiece of non-fiction narrative. It was a sobering and troubling experience to read this book. It has substantially diminished my hope (already small) in the goodness of humanity. Reading this book i needed totally to suspend my disbelief that it is not a Dickensian novel. It is someone’s actual day-to-day life. Katherine Boo follows the lives of a selected group of people in Annawadi’s slum next to Mumbai international airport between 2008-2011. There is a Muslim family of two parents and 10 children involved in the business of garbage sorting. There is their disabled neighbour who is ready to put her life at risk in order to destroy the family. There is a woman who aspires to be a “slumlord” and in the process realises that any favour, even the small one, could be monetazed. There are children who need to risk their life daily scavenging or stealing trying to procure their food. And the most shocking for me was the brutality of these people towards each other. We have this romantic notion of poverty, that, faced with tough circumstances, people would unite and help each other, create a tighter community. It certainly does not seem to be the case here:“Instead, powerless individuals blamed other powerless individuals for what they lacked. Sometimes they tried to destroy one another. Sometimes, like Fatima, they destroyed themselves in the process. When they were fortunate, like Asha, they improved their lots by beggaring the life chances of other poor people. What was unfolding in Mumbai was unfolding elsewhere, too. In the age of global market capitalism, hopes and grievances were narrowly conceived, which blunted a sense of common predicament. Poor people didn’t unite; they competed ferociously amongst themselves for gains as slender as they were provisional. And this undercity strife created only the faintest ripple in the fabric of the society at large. The gates of the rich, occasionally rattled, remained unbreached. The politicians held forth on the middle class. The poor took down one another, and the world’s great, unequal cities soldiered on in relative peace.”The value of human life is shockingly low. It is better to say there is no such concept. When a pair of horses died in a tragic negligence, the animal protection activists and the papers made their owner to pay a fine. While no-one cared for a boy killed and his murder never investigated, or a man hit by the car lying on the road asking for help for 6 hours until he died. The author follows how the consciousness of a young boy changed from the thought that his life matters into indifference and brutality.“Annawadi boys broadly accepted the basic truths: that in a modernizing, increasingly prosperous city, their lives were embarrassments best confined to small spaces, and their deaths would matter not at all. The boys were simply puzzled by the fuss, since they considered Robert’s horses the luckiest and most lovingly tended creatures.”And what one would not find in a Dickens novel is the level of corruption. It is a moral problem rather than the financial one. The police is better in raiding the vulnerable population than any mafia. The doctors and the legal services seem to be even worse. Everyone is involved:“In the West, and among some in the Indian elite, this word, corruption, had purely negative connotations; it was seen as blocking India’s modern, global ambitions. But for the poor of a country where corruption thieved a great deal of opportunity, corruption was one of the genuine opportunities that remained.”It is not only Indian problem. I think, unfortunately, it is persistent where the state sector of the economy is overreaching. We certainly had it in Soviet Union of my childhood. Though of course not that endemic and not life threatening. But the tradition of putting 10 quid into a doctor’s pocket was persistent. It got worse in the time of transition in the 90s. The one of my cousins was framed and put into prison at the age of 19. My uncle has learned all legal system, was hoping for a fair trial. He did not bribe anyone. No. The boy has spent 3 years behind the bars while his friends who really were involved in that crime were out and about doing more stuff. There is no false hope in this book. There is no suggested solutions either. The book is written in 2012 before Modi’s wave. I know that it is not only slums which define the face of India. But this book is very powerful read and it has left me feel totally powerless. It is not the best feeling, but I am grateful for it.Quotes:""It seemed to him that in Annawadi, fortunes derived not just from what people did, or how well they did it, but from the accidents and catastrophes they dodged. A decent life was the train that hadn’t hit you, the slumlord you hadn’t offended, the malaria you hadn’t caught.""""Asha understood plenty. She was a chit in a national game of make-believe, in which many of India’s old problems—poverty, disease, illiteracy, child labor—were being aggressively addressed. Meanwhile the other old problems, corruption and exploitation of the weak by the less weak, continued with minimal interference.""""As every slumdweller knew, there were three main ways out of poverty: finding an entrepreneurial niche, as the Husains had found in garbage; politics and corruption, in which Asha placed her hopes; and education.""""EVERY COUNTRY HAS its myths, and one that successful Indians liked to indulge was a romance of instability and adaptation—the idea that their country’s rapid rise derived in part from the chaotic unpredictability of daily life. In America and Europe, it was said, people know what is going to happen when they turn on the water tap or flick the light switch. In India, a land of few safe assumptions, chronic uncertainty was said to have helped produce a nation of quick-witted, creative problem-solvers. Among the poor, there was no doubt that instability fostered ingenuity, but over time the lack of a link between effort and result could become debilitating. “We try so many things,” as one Annawadi girl put it, “but the world doesn’t move in our favour.”""While independent India had been founded mainly by high-born, well-educated men, by the twenty-first century few such types stood for elections, or voted in them, since the wealthy had extra-democratic means of securing their social and economic interests. Across India, poor people were the ones who took the vote seriously. It was the only real power they had.""...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Mar 31, 2019","Apr 02, 2019","Mar 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11869272-behind-the-beautiful-forevers

The author models her book on King Lear and sets it in the modern day India. In general, 2018 was the year of classic retelling by the modern authors in English language. I am not big fan of the idea, though of course I admit that all the literature in a way is the retelling of the books written before. At this case as well I felt quite ambivalent about King's Lear plot, and may be if I would not know about this fact, I would appreciate the book more. Broadly, she picks up the prototypes of the five young characters from the play and studies them. Lets start with the positives:- the language at the beginning of the book felt energetic and fresh. She uses the present tense throughout and that helps her builds up pace. It worked for the first 100 pages or so. But unfortunately, later it has become somewhat monotonic. And at the sentence’s level she is not always careful. We can get this: ""She rises. Her blood is telling her to run, her head to stay and force answers. Her heart wants Gargi and Radha: her hands need to hold theirs."" I was happy not to know what her legs, stomach and other body parts wanted at that minute as the list could go on.- her villains are much more ambiguous in their motivations than in the original play and a bit more likeable. Especially it applies to the two older sisters and Jivan (Edmund). So it leaves the reader a space for contemplation . However, if someone reads this book without knowledge of the original play, this advantage would probably fade.- sense of place. I am struggling with this one a bit. For the first 3 out of the 6 parts of the book, I did not feel any sense of place - it could be anywhere, in spite of numerous untranslated dialogue incepts in Hindu. And that was a bit frustrating as I wanted to know about India. However it has changed in the last parts. The part set inside a slum was the best in my opinion.Now, negatives:- unfortunately, it suffers from those pitfalls of the first novels: too long, too disjointed and not adequately resolved. I would want to know what happened at the end to the all of 5 main characters. Of course, I've got Shakespeare for that. But standalone, the author has left a lot of ends loose. Also some strange subplot with the poisoned apple has resurfaced in the last few pages. Why?- I did not have a feeling it worked as a whole. As I mentioned, the book consists of 5 separate parts told on behalf of the one of the five young characters. It is written in a third person. The dialogue is often contrived and basic. Each of these parts looks more like a character study. The interaction with the rest of the story mainly happens through the King Lier's plot. So the feeling is that a certain new character is appearing on the scene and then dropped back into the darkness. I found it very irritating as the characters do not work with each other. Out of 5, the two parts were quite successful as stand alone novellas. And I hardly could care for another 3. I was only frustrated and not intrested, when Sita (Cordelia) was introduced, and very briefly at that, in the last part of the book for the first time while again the rest of the cast have fallen into the shadows. This is while in theory Sita would have a fantastic potential as a character as she was so different from the rest of the family.- this novel should be nominated for the bad sex award. The sex scenes and fantasies, fortunately not numerous, were really off-putting ones and made me wince, which is really rare.- India has appeared very stereotypical out of the book - the young nation and the young democracy with the huge inequality. One does not need to read this book for this. I did not get what Taneja thinks about it.Overall, Deborah Levi is saying on the blurb that Taneja is the writer to watch and I agree with that. But in hindsight, I'd rather spend my time elsewhere than reading this book 540 pages in spite of some really good parts of it.2 stars plus 1 which i always add for debut novels....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Mar 28, 2019","Mar 31, 2019","Mar 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28800253-we-that-are-young

Thematically it is a trope explored recently in some other English novels - missing child and the reaction to the disappearance of a tight small village community. See Reservoir 13 or Missing Fay. But this book is giving a totally different spin on a story using very different language tools.I won't mention the characters or the plot. Though they are very well developed for such a short novel. I will focus a bit more on a way how it is written as i found it amazingly successful. There are 3 very distinctive parts. The first part is the most experimental: it integrates the snippets of the unrelated sentences told by different people into the whole. These snippets are presented on the page as a coiled warped fragments. The impression is wonderfully wholesome. It is like while walking briskly on the street you overhear sometimes just small bits of different conversations and it all merges into the whole rhythmical music in your mind. But here there is a visual effect as well. In such a way a special poetic voice for the group of people is created. The next part is the chorus of the voices. It reminded me a bit Lincoln in the Bardo, but also there is a social dimension to it. And the last part is very moving and philosophic at the same time raising the question about what the ending of a story actually might mean. There is a scene which reminded me the Woland's ball in [book:The Master and Margarita. Overall, there was a connection there for me between these two books how the evil sometimes plays the role of the good (or at least the role of a fair judge...).It is different from the Porter's first book Grief is the Thing with Feathers.

So the warning, below is a lot of negatives.In the first part, Sally creates two likeable, relatively multidimensional and trendy characters only to heavily exploit them both in the rest of the book. At the end, it is not even amusing anymore. The prose is deliberately dry and precise. No poetry intended for sure, but there are some metaphors though. For a example, to be friends is to exchange the social capital. And there are other trendy words from the marxists vocabulary such a ""commodity"", ""transactional"" applied to love and friendship etc. (Caveat: I am writing it from memory as I do not have a book anymore). The second layer of characters are flat. I found the social dimension of the novel naive and non-conclusive. It is of course trendy to be grumpy about daily job, receive a lot of academic prizes, only to end up working as a PA at the end. And I still not sure why saying ""Venice full of Asians taking photos"" is racist. I could see how it could be called ""stereotyping"" but ""racist"" i think is not helpful. Talking about stereotyping - middle class lawyers' family is depicted as a bunch of perverts while working class family is a single parent, aspirational citadel of wisdom. There are two things which i liked though. I liked the first school part. I had a hope it would keep its slightly Cinderella's feel into the later parts of the book. In vain.

They are both 20-something londoners with a Brazilian mum and English dad. I am not sure to which extent this novel is auto-fiction, but i suspect it could categorised as such. It is also the one of those novels which could be considered ""the voice of the millennials"". After reading this, I could confirm that the comparison with ""Conversations with friends"" by S Rooney is totally justified (unfortunately in my case, as I am not a fan). In both novels we are witnessing the young women navigating their first relationships, work experiences and their bodies (including the effects of certain chronic conditions such as endometriosis (Rooney) and IBS (Rodrigues Fowler)).I liked this book more than the Rooney's as it contained more of the context and background of this girl compared to Rooney's self-obsessed heroine with her slightly naive social convictions. Quit a big part of this novel is devoted to navigating multiple identities of being both Brazilian and English and growing to understand who she really is. The girl introduces the colourful cast of 2 older generations of her family. And the background stories of her Brazilian grandparents are told in a way of a vivid fable. They are contrasted with the snippets of her everyday life in London and her childhood.I was attracted to this book by the praise by Claire Louise-Bennett. And on that ground, i expected a bit more from the language. Unfortunately, I was not totally blown off. Some parts of the story-telling was solid, but quite traditional. And the bits which were supposed to be experimental and poetic looked to me more like the snippets from a twitter feed.I do not regret I've read this book. It is a pleasant enough first novel.

It did not sound like my cup of tea on the surface, as I am as urban as one could be. Bu it is appeared to be the most wonderful read. Szymek so far is the best character I've read about this year and likely would stay this way. The author has created absolutely unique, idiosyncratic voice which makes the narrative flow. The period covered is approximately from the 30s to the 60s of the last century. It shows the fatalism and resilience of the peasant population at that time in Central Europe, the spirit which has almost totally disappeared. It is very colourful, humorous, but very profound book. Experience to treasure. And I am totally in awe about the translation into English. Johnston has managed to keep the uniqueness of the voice and the rhythm of the prose.

So I would There is no shortage of good s of this book as it was shortlisted for the Booker prize 2018 and the winner of the Goldsmith's prize. So I would not go in details through main themes and characters. Instead, below are just are few of my thoughts.It is quite an unusual novel. Not only it is in verse, but it is the opposite of a script in a way. Normally, I imagine, when a movie is being produced, it is being initially scripted in a scenario. Also, if it is a historical movie, the relevant records, photos and the artefacts would be taken into the account. So the movie would appear as a result of a written script. What we have here is just the reverse: Robertson was watching a lot of films-noir of the 50s taking actions in California, especially in LA. And he subsequently translated into a verse what he has seen to recreate the atmosphere of the disappearing city and its inhabitants, destroyed by the reckless city planners and modernity. The result is very visual, dynamic poetry which creates the moving imaginary in one's mind rather than thoughts - I could almost split it into separate frames. This was impressive. For example:In the last splinter if sunlight allowed between the skyscrapersan old lady is sitting with a book,moving her chair every quarter of an houra little farther down the alleyway.Forgetting vs remembering a certain traumatic historical experience, both on the individual level and on the level of a group of people. The main character, Walker is a young man and a former soldier. He struggles with the post traumatic disorder caused by what he has seen and what he has done during the Second World War. He tries hard but cannot get rid off his demons.And it reminded me of the broader issue. In the aftermath, what is better? To keep a collective memory of the event or to let it slip and, sometimes, even to encourage forgetting for the sake of reconciliation in a society? I've read recently a brilliant essay by David Rieff In Praise of Forgetting: Historical Memory and Its Ironies. He argues the forgetting should play bigger role and the remembering is not always as beneficial as some make us to believe. It is a difficult and interesting argument. But Walker finds out his own truth:As He lay in bed, he saw thattrying to forget was the same as trying to remember.A lifetime work, and damn near impossible.This book was another example how the order in which we read books affect our opinion. I've just read in January Three Poems which was absolutely brilliant and resonated with me a lot. Though The Long Take is quite different - it is a novel in verses rather than just long poems and the subject matter is different- but Three poems overshadowed this one for me still. The verse per se was not that elegant and sophisticated in comparison.

It is very good, at least when I was reading it, i was not thinking even for a moment about the quality of what I was reading. So it has to be good then. I had a minor issue (not sure even whether to call it ‘an issue’ rather a scratch of my consciousness) that Lindsey Hilsum used and extensively quoted Marie’s dairies. She kept the diary for her whole life and they were made available for the biography. It felt too early to comb through Marie’s intimate thoughts in a way. But without it, the biography would probably feel so immediate and authentic…But Marie. It is difficult to write anything as it is quickly becomes something of a cliche such as “beautiful life” or “she believed she could make this world a better place”. I do not want to add my tiny little drop to her growing mythology. But what if in her case it is simply true? She believed the journalists could influence the sides to stop slaughtering the innocent. And it worked sometimes after her reporting. She was very unlucky in love, her lovers and husbands betrayed her, she drunk a lot, she was glamorous and reckless. But she had the purpose in her journalism, and, when she was in the war zone, she was happy, she felt needed. And she was. According to Lindsey, she was the last of a kind. Nowadays the western journalists do not go into the conflict zones physically. The conflicting sides know how powerful the news are. So they target any independent journalist deliberately. Therefore, we do not know anymore what happens there. We find out from video clips etc. But people who do these clips often “have a cause” according to Lindsey. Marie was not so much interested in taking sides, she always reported about the plight of the civilians in war: Middle East, Iraq, Chechnya, Tamil territories, Arab spring, Syria.. My thoughts about her are very personal. It is not simple admiration, though there is that as well. I just feel i understand her so deeply. Maybe because i could see some of her features in my best female friends. Maybe, because due to my hobby of taking street photos and a few forays into photojournalism, I’ve been punched in face a few times, my camera got broken as well. Nothing of course to compare. But i know the feeling of danger, and you are becoming totally different person at that moment. You’ve just do not know yourself well enough. But everything becomes so simple at the same time, so crystal clear, that it is a kind of weird happiness. Her life is getting a lot of publicity recently. It looks like the movie is dreadful. The documentary ""Into the Wire"" seems to be good. But I think I will stop with reading this book for now.

The people of predominantly turkic origin, they dominated the Caspian and Black Sea Steppe and had a strong State between 6th and 9th century AD. They've been central in the development of trade connections between different populations and the states present in the region in this period. According to Artamonov, their fight with the Arabs has protected the latter penetrating into the Eastern Europe in 7th century; the similar role played by the Franks in the Western Europe. Controversially, they've adopted Judaism as a state religion in 8th century. Artamonov thinks that that was the reason for their decay, eventual defeat to the Rus and Khorezm and total disappearance from the history and the map. Artamonov's work with the sources and the bibliography is amazing. Apart from Byzantine and Gothic evidence, he combed through the arab, armenian, georgian, persian and iberian sources. His conclusions are typical within the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. But i could happily ignore them as they were presented in one place at the end of the book.

Они часто делали набеги на славян и русь, захватывали пленных и продавали их в рабство в Византию. [37] По сообщению арабских писателей, мадьяры были огнепоклонниками.895 г. Осенью того же года мадьяры были уже в Паннонии. Первым их делом на новом месте было пополнение недостатка в женщинах, происшедшего в результате погрома, произведённого болгарами и печенегами в Ателькузу. Их первые набеги на славян в Паннонии преследовали главным образом цель захвата молодых женщин в жены. [44]Вероятнее всего, надо полагать, что в походах на Византию в первой половине IX в. принимали участие и среднеднепровские славяне — русь — и северные — новгородцы, а вместе с последними — варяги. Открытие великого пути из варяг в греки падает именно на это времсуждения по крайне запутанному вопросу о том, что же собою представляла «русь», приведённые данные имеют большое значение. Они показывают, что понятие «русь» не совпадало с Русским государством, что была русь особая от этого государства. Однако из этого заключения нельзя сделать вывод, что русь, не совпадающая с Русским государством, была русью норманнской и что термин «русь» только потому связался с Русским государством, что в создании его участвовала норманнская русь. В действительности дело может обстоять значительно сложнее. Русью могли называться норманно-славянские военные и купеческие дружины лишь постольку, поскольку они формировались в Русском государстве и выходили из него. Норманны становились русью благодаря наличию Русского государства, через которое и из которого они выходили и в Византию и на Восток. Конечно, при этом ничто не(383/384)мешало называть русью и тех норманнов, которые не были связаны с Русским государством, потому что их соплеменники на службе Руси стали известны под именем «русь» или «русы».Через территорию Хазарии издавна пролегал важный путь, соединяющий Азию с Европой. Ещё в VI в. до н.э. скифские и греческие купцы из Причерноморья путешествовали по степям вплоть до сказочной страны аргипеев, находившейся, по мнению Томашека, на северных склонах Тянь-Шаня. Во времена Плиния существовал путь от северных берегов Каспийского моря на восток через пустынные земли, населённые лишь дикими зверями и скифами-людоедами, в страну серов, т.е. в Северный Китай. [14] О восточной части этого пути в первые века нашей эры довольно подробные сведения содержатся в китайских источниках. Северный путь китайской торговли шёл вдоль Тянь-Шаня в долину р. Или до народа усунь, а дальше через Согдиану и Иран в Сирию. Северный берег Каспийского моря в то время был занят аорсами, которые играли важную роль в связях между Кавказом и Средней Азией. Позже, с появлением гуннов, движение по северному пути на несколько столетий прекратилось. Когда тюркюты в конце VI в. стали хозяевами всех этих территорий, они пытались вновь проложить путь из Средней Азии в Византию, но трудности, связанные с преодолением безводной пустыни, вынуждали тюркютских ханов силой добиваться свободного вывоза своих товаров через Иран. [15] Этот путь оживился и приобрёл большое значение лишь после того, как уйгуры и карлуки закрыли или сильно затруднили доступ в Сибирь мусульманским купцам. Тогда особенно поднялось значение Волги, по которой и пошло движение товаров, главным образом драгоценных мехов с севера(402/403)в обмен на серебряные диргемы. Главную роль в этой торговле с Восточной Европой стал играть Хорезм. [16] Первые относительно точные сведения о Волге проникли на запад в первые века нашей эры. В V-VI вв. шведские купцы доходили до Рима через многие народы, большинство из которых жило по волжскому пути. Чудь, весь, меря, мордва и другие значатся у Иордана подвластными Германариху, но не может быть сомнения в том, что имена этих народов стали известны готскому историку VI в. только потому, что через их земли проходили торговые связи севера с югом. [17] Замечательно, что даже из Киева в Хазарию дорога шла по Окс через вятичей и далее через болгар; Ал-Истахри исчисляет длительность пути от Киева до Болгара на Волге в 20 дней. [18] Оказавшись на перекрестке важных торговых путей, хазары стали играть видную роль в международной торговле. Сама Хазария производила немного товаров. Отсюда шли скот, кожа и рыба, которые, по словам Хасдая Ибн Шафрута, доставлялись на судах в Константинополь. [19] Славился хазарский рыбий клей. Но зато через Хазарию, как промежуточную инстанцию, во множестве проходили из Руси и Волжской Болгарии различные меха. Особенно ценились болгарские соболи, буртасские лисицы и русские куницы. Ибн Хордадбех специально отмечает бобров и чёрных лисиц, доставляемых в Итиль русскими купцами. Из северных же стран шли превосходный воск, мёд, янтарь; русы доставляли железные изделия (клинки мечей). Не менее важным товаром были рабы, которых русы привозили в Итиль, где продажа их происходила на специальном рынке. Из Итиля все эти товары поступали на рынки Азербайджана, Армении, Ирана, Хорасана и Византии, доходили до Багдада, Джурджании (Ургенча), Мерва, Бухары, Константинополя и даже Александрии. В обмен на них на север шли изделия восточного ремесла, в особенности ткани, и в огромном количестве серебряная монета. Многочисленные клады VIII-X вв., находимые в северной полосе Восточной Европы, свидетельствуют о проникновении туда в хазарскую эпоху большого количества восточных «куфических» монет. Особенно много среди них саманидских монет, чеканенных в Средней Азии. [20] В Итиль — главный торговый центр Хазарии — съезжались купцы из разных стран. По Волге на ладьях прибывали русы и болгары, по Каспийскому морю приплывали на судах купцы из стран Закавказья и Ирана, приходили в Итиль караваны из Хорезма и других областей(403/404)Средней Азии, европейские купцы добирались до Итиля или сухим путём через Венгрию, Русь и Волжскую Болгарию или же по Чёрному и Азовскому морям до Дона и вверх по этой реке до переволоки в Волгу. Важную роль в торговле играли еврейские купцы. Хазария нередко посещалась еврейскими купцами из Западной Европы, путешествовавшими, вероятно, той же дорогой, по которой было доставлено из Испании письмо царю Иосифу. [21] Еврейские купцы «ра(х)даниты». т.е. знающие пути, по свидетельству Ибн Хордадбеха были хорошо знакомы и с другим путём в Хазарию — по Чёрному морю. Из Хазарии они направлялись в Балх, Мавераннагр и даже в ал-Син — Китай. [22] В X в. в Хазарии были испанские евреи Иехуда бар Меир и Иосиф Хагрис. Отдельные хазарские евреи путешествовали далеко на запад, как, например, слепой Амран, посетивший Испанию. [23] Одни купцы заканчивали свои дела на рынках Итиля и возвращались восвояси, другие только проходили через этот город на север — к болгарам и в Русь или наоборот — в страны Востока, третьи, наконец, обосновывались в Итиле, как наиболее удобном месте для своих торговых предприятий, и становились хазарскими купцами, хотя хазар по происхождению среди них было очень мало. Хазары не имели своего флота и только на лодках совершали недалёкие перевозки. [24] Зато на суше они обслуживали торговые караваны и транспортными средствами, и проводниками, и необходимой охранойдворце кагана находился обширный гарем. По установленному обычаю он имел 25 жён, являвшихся дочерьми вассальных государей, которых брали сюда волей или неволей. Кроме того, у него(408/409)было 60 наложниц, каждая из которых жила в отдельной комнате, к каждой был приставлен особый евнух.наиболее значительную роль сыграл подъём активности дагестанских иудеев, который привёл к государственному перевороту и захвату власти династией иудейских царей. Новое правительство сумело подавить сопротивление своего народа — восстание кабаров, но после этого Хазария преобразилась. Она перестала быть конфедерацией племён, объединенных своим собственным вождём — ханом, а стала монархией, покорной царю, чуждому народу по культуре и религии. Хазарские христиане, мусульмане и язычники оказались в оппозиции правительству и подчинялись только силе. Положение оказалось безвыходным ещё и потому, что свойственная иудаизму исключительность не допускала обращения в государственную религию широких народных масс и обрекала их на беспросветное прозябание в качестве вечных налогоплательщиков и запуганных слуг своих жестоких господ. Естественно, что иудейское правительство, которое не могло опираться на свой народ, вынуждено было искать союзников за пределами своей страны, главным образом в заволжских степях, среди печенегов и гузов. С их помощью хазарское правительство подавило восстание кабаров, возросшую силу мадьяр сокрушили печенеги, против печенегов и руси использовались мусульманские наёмники — арсии, а против арабов войны не велось, так как иудейско-хазарские цари отказались от Закавказьидущие политические цели. Это была не бессмысленная авантюра и не простой грабительский набег, [14] подобный походам руси в Каспийское море в первой половине X в., а хорошо продуманное предприятие, вытекавшее из трезвого учёта существующей политической ситуации и экономических потребностей Руси. Святослав хотел не только разгромить Хазарию, но и овладеть основными её территориями на Волге, на Керченском проливе и на Дону с тем, чтобы полностью взять в свои руки контроль над восточной торговлей, игравшей весьма важную роль в экономике Русского государства. Это был хорошо рассчитанный удар, в результате которого хазары лишались базы для своего дальнейшего паразитического существования и, утратив экономические основы своего военного могущества, переставали быть опасными для Руси. Ближайшим поводом для похода Святослава могли быть препятствия, чинимые болгарами и хазарами русским купцам после похода руси в Каспийское море в 943/4 г. Успешно выполнив свой военный план, Святослав не мог, однако, прочно присоединить к Руси все свои завоевания. Втянувшись в трудную борьбу на Дунае, он должен был ослабить своё внимание к востоку, не успев закрепить власть Руси над Поволжьем. За Русью остались только Подонье, да берега Керченского пролива, Волжская же Болгария и Хазария, по-видимому, недолго находились в зависимости от Руси и восстановили свою самостоятелПочти все товары, которые поступали в мусульманские страны с севера, проходили через Хорезм и хорезмийских купцов. Об этом очень хорошо свидетельствует перечень товаров, которыми они торговали, приведённый Мукаддаси: «Что касается товаров, то вывозятся следующие: из Хорезма — меха соболей, горностаев, хорьков, ласок, куниц, лисиц, бобров, зайцев и коз, также свечи, стрелы, кора белого тополя, высокие шапки, рыбий клей, рыбьи зубы (моржовые клыки?), касторовое масло, амбра, выделанные лошадиные кожи, мёд, лещинные орехи, соколы, мечи, панцири, березовая(432/433)кора, славянские рабы, бараны и коровы — всё это (получалось) от болгар...».

In my view, it has paid off. It is a complex book to think about, even Will Eaves has certainly taken a lot of risks with this short condensed novel. In my view, it has paid off. It is a complex book to think about, even more so - to write about in a linear fashion. It has got a very complex structure. It could be viewed as a matrix: in terms of the content, it is a tribute to the life and work of Alan Turing; at the same time it is a philosophical inquiry into the nature of consciousness. In terms of the form, it is a whole bunch of stuff, but mainly it is a blank-verse poetry presented as dreams or hallucinations. Those dreams are intermingled with short essay pieces presented as letters. To top it up, the first part is more or less stand alone, more or less straight-forward short story on the same subject matter. Sometimes, I thought whether this complexity added or took away from my appreciation of the book. I was seriously helped by the fact that i came to this novel after reading The Inevitable Gift Shop, Eaves’s earlier and more autobiographical collection containing his proper poems. I was also familiar with the subject matter (both Turing’s life and the areas Eaves examines). So I wonder how would I interpret the novel, if it would not be the case. I love poetry, so I guess I would still enjoy the book, but certainly it would make less memorable and more confusing experience. However, as it stands, the book has made me to revisit certain ideas which is always rewarding. And it is a moving tribute to the man who helped his country to win the huge war only for the country to pay him back with the cruelty and injustice. I start again. Knausgaard said: “Dreams in literature are monstrosities: whenever I come across one, it takes a lot for me not to flip past it or shut the book altogether. It tells me that the writer has failed to understand his responsibility to reality, or else has not understood the role of the imagination in real life”. In majority of cases, I would totally agree with him. I find it very irritating if a book contains lots of dreams by the characters. I am already reading something which is presumably the work of someone’s else imagination so i do not need the literary device which would just double it. But there is one exception.Freud said: “Poets are masters of us ordinary men, in knowledge of the mind, because they drink at streams which we have not yet made accessible to science.”  And Eaves is primarily a poet for me. In ""Gift shop"", I considered his poems as the best part of the book. They are multidimensional, vivid, imaginative. Here, as well, if one considered the dream sequences as a long-form poetry and stops trying to search for the logic in them, just flowing with the imaginary, I would bet, it would be more enjoyable than trying to figure out what reality it corresponds to. My only complain that Eaves has chosen to write it in paragraphs. I could feel the rhythm, the music there; the vividness, the dreaminess. It would be bolder to have it in stanzas. But they are beautiful in any case. They are loosely based on certain facts of Turing’s biography. But I would not be preoccupied with that. I do not think one needs to know who is who there. It is more archetypical with Metamorphoses by Ovid and Snow White fairy tale are closely involved. Turing loved the movie “Snow White and 7 Dwarves” released in 1937. He was fascinated with the story. Tragically, he died biting an apple filled with cyanid. It was judged as a suicide then. And in Eaves’s dreams sequences we meet the characters from Snow White, bearing untidy symbolism, transforming into other characters and back. We also meet with the mirrors and the apple. More symbols and more transformations - water, lake, hunting the stag, adolescent love story etc. Eaves character said himself: “They (dreams) are full of magical symbolism”. So for me there were not as much as dreams as poems. Now, I am not very good with the inserting the spoil alerts, so I just warn that below is my interpretation of the second layer of meanings of this book based upon relatively closed reading. And if you have not read it, you might want to solve the riddle in your own way. Consciousness:The blurb say “It is a profound meditation on what machine consciousness might mean and implications of AI”. I think, it is much wider that that. In fact, pure machine consciousness is touched upon, but it is not main purpose. I would dare say, the book is an inquiry into human consciousness, the consciousness as a phenomenon. Eaves is grappling with different ideas of consciousness, his own and others thinkers. The result is a slightly disorienting, challenging in parts, but certainly thought-provoking. In very broad terms, consciousness is our subjective experience and sense of self-awareness. Sometimes it is equated with mind. It is stuff which is unique to us: how do we experience pain, taste, colours, anything which no-one would be able to know on our behalf; it is related to our self.“Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.” Stuart Sutherland has gently summarised some of the difficulties in his entry for the 1989 version of the Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology: (as per Wikipedia). I hope you would disagree with Mr Sutherland, at least with the last sentence. Eaves would have done so, it seems. I have not mentioned before that he does not make Alan Turing his character. He creates Alec Pryor, the fictional being, which shares quite a few biographical details with Turing, including being forcibly treated with hormones (chemical castration) as a punishment for being gay. Nevertheless, Alec is a separate character. Initially I was fascinated why did Eaves needed Alec. At the end there are many fictional novels with non-fictional characters. The work of Javier Cercas or Bruce Duffy comes to mind. But later in the novel, I understood. I think, Eaves needs Alec as a mouthpiece for his investigation into the complicated phenomena of consciousness, self and free will. I do not know to which extent, these broad subject fascinated Turing. Even if they would, it does not seem to be sufficient evidence to know what he thought about it (maybe excluding machine intelligence). Eaves puts some Turing’s thoughts as epigraphs to each of his 6 parts. But it seems, to me he is more interested in sharing the results of his own inquiry than pretending to be inside the mind of the genius and get it wrong. I think it a wise choice.The book discusses different aspects of consciousness and ideas about it:- Under the influence of the hormones Alec’s body is changing. He is thinking whether it affects his “I”. He is afraid to lose his memories, he suffers great deal, but he thinks “I” would not totally disappear. He says: “It’s Russell’s “neutral stuff”  of the mental and the physical worlds, isn’t it, but oh it is not neutral matter being caught between them!” Eaves refers to so called  neutral monism, the view supported by Bertrand Russell, which states that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them.-  Field awareness is mentioned a few times. I think, it refers to quantum physics when the presence of an observer affects the result of the experiment. Some scientist think that the conscious can affect matter. Interestingly, Princeton University is running Global Consciousness project which is supposed to measure the effect of global conscience on the matter with allegedly positive results.http://noosphere.princeton.edu/- Qualia - a trendy way to refer to our subjective feeling for pain, or colour, or taste. Alec/Eaves brings it about generalising on his situation: “Pain is the memory without witness and collaboration. It is not real for anyone else. That is allows for torturers, including government, being torturers.” - Schrödinger “theory of consciousness”. In the one of the letters Alec says to June, his friend and ex-fiancee: “I would go so far as to say that we are commonly alone. This is a version of Schrödinger’s theory of consciousness. We each have our view of the same mountain.”  Schrödinger’s views on the subject totally permeate this book. They resurface in different places and in different disguises. In fact, I do not think Schrödinger has had a theory per se. At least he, himself was saying that the future generations would come up with the one uniting the Western empirical science and what he called “the Eastern doctrine of identity” which formed his belief. Schrödinger thought that there is a single consciousness, which is non-dual. In other words, that mind is not separated from the things experienced within the mind. His metaphor for this was a painter who inserted himself into his bigger painting of the world. His view we was close to the philosophy/religion of Advaita Vedanta (a certain variety of Hinduism).“I submit that both paradoxes will be solved (I do not pretend to solve them here and now) by assimilating into our Western build of science the Eastern doctrine of identity. Mind is by its very nature a singulare tantum. I should say: the overall number of minds is just one. I venture to call it indestructible since it has a peculiar timetable, namely mind is always now. There is really no before and after for mind. There is only a now that includes memories and expectations. But I grant that our language is not adequate to express this, and I also grant, should anyone wish to state it, that I am now talking religion, not science.” (Schrödinger, What is Life?: With Mind and Matter and Autobiographical Sketches, p. 134–135.)So implications of this view that there is only one mind and always was. With our language we would struggle to express this as even in the simple syntactic way we have tenses. The differences between us is that different view of the same mountain, which Alec/Eaves quotes (Schrödinger used different Everest’s picks). It is not that each of us is the part of the common mind. No. We are the same mind in its totality. “But not in this sense — that you are a part, a piece, of an eternal, infinite being, an aspect or modification of it... For we should then have the same baffling question: which part, which aspect are you? what, objectively, differentiates it from the others? No, but, inconceivable as it seems to ordinary reason, you — and all other conscious beings as such — are all in all. Hence, this life of yours... is, in a certain sense, the whole... “ ( Schrödinger from What is life? again).To illustrate the point that the mind is single, Schrödinger points out that we never think of ourselves in plural, even in the dreams or in the cases of the split personality. It is always one “I”. These ideas would explain Eaves’s using the same first person for different creatures, modern humans, archaic humans etc. They all seem to be the faces of this single consciousness. Or at least, that is how I’ve read it. He also uses “singulare tantrum” after Schrödinger. It means in Latin something which could be only in a singular. And the one of those “I”s created by Eaves says: “I am returned to the connected mind the unconfined and abstract space from which my own particles shrink” - sounds very much like Schrödinger’s consciousness. AI consciousness - here it is more straightforward. Turing was thinking about it himself as well. He is the author of the famous Turing test. But Eaves expends his ideas with the beautiful passage:“In the calculation, in the latter stages when I can see things falling into space. The figures and the symbols are so right that they seem to take on some of the self-conscious wonder of the person manipulating them. They move towards awareness. They, and not I, seem to say: oh, but now I see. And when that happens it is like seeing a mind arise from matter to discover that it cannot go back to its former childlike state. The matter is transformed. It is responsible now.”Alec/Eaves also contemplate about a shared mind in the sense of the connectivity, something similar to what we have now, but much more extreme - how would it look like to be constantly connected? “Where would the need for people go, the unspoken, the private stranger whom we love for being like us alone?” He argues that people would “entertain each other thoughts” instead of entertaining themselves. But this connected mind would not probably be a conscious entity anyway as “a shared mind has no self knowledge.” The main metaphor of the book created by Eaves himself is a room. It is a complex one as it stands for the consciousness - one cannot come out as one cannot perceive the world from outside oneself. At one point of the novel the one of the “I”s even transforms into a room. It is metaphor for life as well:“It is a singulare tantalum, love, the room of life, but everybody furniture is different, and none of us remembers where it came from, though we deeply sense it’s held in trust… But it will be consciousness and what it means is - there will always be the room. You will always wonder what outside the room, and who made it, and whether you are made by others or self-made original or successive, one in a long series of things patterned or randomised, and you will feel alone.”Note, Schrödinger’s “singulare tantalum” resurfaces again. I think this metaphor could be also applied to a super intelligent AI. As likely, it would be locked away in a separate physical room and kept off line for security reasons. Self One cannot think about consciousness without breaking it down to the problem of identity, the problem of the self. Eaves finds a very fascinating way of looking at it. As i mentioned before Alec’s self has got a whole multiplicity of faces. I would like to look at what Eaves has created at a slightly different angle. And he gives me a lot of hints that i could do it. Quantum physics and its “many worlds” interpretation. Eaves peppers the text with the words like “spin”, “entanglement”, “the weak interpretation”. This is all the vocabulary of the quantum physics. He makes also some direct references about the role of an observer in quantum experiments. The one of the interpretation of the quantum phenomena is the existence of many words where the all possible alternative scenarios of an action take place. These worlds are even interacting with each other at some level. These worlds are constantly being created when a particle’s trajectory is defined. This hypotheses was initially suggested by Hugo Everrett and currently is still supported by some influential physicists. (I apologise to all the scientists - I am dreadfully simplifying). From this, one might conclude that in an other quantum world Alec’s life was different. In fact, there could be more than one of those worlds. Alec says: “A glimpse of states, I had, the states to be, an infinite progress of the frames.”  In other part of the novel, Alec/Eaves says: “The world is full of discrete notes, probabilistic states, and gaps. Only a wave can take us from one to other; a force or flow; or perhaps a field”  (this is might be referred the weak interpretation of quantum phenomena by Bohm. The world “weak interpretation” is mentioned as well in the novel). So if we look at the novel through this lens, we could see Alec’s life in different worlds going differently: - in one world he is a scientist in the 21st century, married, his wife is expecting a baby, but he is suddenly having a stroke and ends up incapacitated in a wheel chair, unable to communicate;- in another Alec bites the apple and dies (p 59)- one more world - and Alec has got two children, twins; he is talking to his daughter about her place in the world. That the bit I found incredible moving.- and another world - Alec finishes his treatment and just continues his life. Sometimes, in each of these worlds Alec hears or experiences the presence of the other worlds’s Alecs. This total construction should not work, it too complicated, it should fall into pieces or should feel like a cheap trick. But somehow Eaves pulls it out and it works.And of course, there is a mirror - so many meanings! Sometimes there is a man in the mirror to complement the picture. Zizek says “The surface (of the mirror) functions as a kind of “black hole” in reality as a limit whose “Beyond” is not accessible. Again, mirror test is used to judge whether a creature has got a conscious self or not. Babies from the age of 18 months, some apes and pigeons can identify themselves, but not dogs, for example. Free WillThe problem of free will is related to the problem of consciousness. If every effect has got the cause, then everything is predetermined. Even the name Pryor might be allusion to prior - causation and determinism. But for Alec/Eaves it is the source of hope: “It should be a source of hope, this lack of control. We are both responsible and absolutely unable to make our responsibility stay the way it should.” The justice system is supposed to limit someone’s freedom for the good of the society. But in case of Turing and Alec it has created more cruelty and unfairness. Alec sometimes thinks everything what happened to him is predetermined but he still have a choice if anything to reply with “Fair play, decency, humour, subtlety”.As far as the evolving consciousness is concerned (AI or some other form) Alec says: “The price of consciousness, of power, is choice.” The choice to use power to do harm or “productive humility”. The lesson for the politicians.The novel is incredibly moving in some parts. In equal measure or even more so, it also made me think about the level of abstraction i was not thinking since age 18.

This period is subject to a substantial controversy between the historians for the obvious reasons - not many written sources and those existing are rarely reliable. The most controversial point is the role of migrations in this period. Peter Heather gives a solid overview of the problem and related points of view from no migration to so called ""invasion hypothesis"" - the theory prevailing in the first half of the 20th century and before, when a certain ""people"" fought its way into a territory and ethnically cleansed the existing population. It was later discredited and rejected. Heather's own view is somewhere in the middle: 1) there are different kids of migrations; 2) it is always more complicated then it seems (probably not surprisingly); 3) a metaphor of a ""billiard ball"" of the rapid movement of one ""people"" is replaced by ""the snowball"" of the mixed population movement (including women and children) and in other cases - elite's replacements. 4) Roman empire and later Byzantine empire and even the Arabs where source of both positive and negative influence of the evolving populations (not totally surprisingly again).Heather comes across as a historian who does not believe that ""the history is a foreign country"" as many others do. He extensively deduces his hypothesis from the analysis of the recent migrations such as Rwanda genocide for example. His theories and ideas are always lucid and he is open about the difficulties he faces. I had only problem with the book - it was quite repetitive at times. The first chapter is the most interesting and theoretical. He summarises his views and ideas. This is followed by more or less chronological narrative of the millennium starting with Goths and moving to the Slavs in the later half of the millennium. I found the The Slavs' chapters the most fascinating: he posits that the early Slavic states were based economically on the huge trading surplus from slave and fur trade in the region by the Scandinavians and the Western Slavs selling the Eastern Slavs (this bit is the most unpleasant, if true). The discussion of Franks and Anglo-Saxons I found the weakest. I did not feel it was enough evidence in the book to support Franks' mass migration. With Anglo-Saxons, he said it was a substantial migration to replace the elite and more as the existing ownership structures were replaced. However, as far as I understood him, it was not more than that. I struggle how then the language was totally replaced as well. Maybe that is because we know about it only based upon the written sources I presume. But the sources would come from the very small strata of population who could write then. Anyway, I am still puzzled about that period in England.Overall, it is very interesting, well written and well argued book, if only a little repetitive....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Jan 21, 2019",Feb 2019,"Jan 21, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/8577980-empires-and-barbarians

I can try a physiological or a spiritual one: a good short story is unexpected punch, which makes you forget how to breath; a good short story gives you a sudden moment of seeing something which was not there just a second ago… Whatever the metaphor, this novella is certainly an example of this effect. And it is very different from the other Chekhov’s stories I know.First of all, it is as a perfect form of art: the economy of the language, the structure, how he starts in the usual Chekhovian mood with a beautiful garden and little people dealing with their little lives and then, suddenly and effortlessly, he moves to the darker, metaphysical depth. The imagery he creates - the smoke in the garden at the early morning; the owners of the estate, keen gardeners, are killing the harmful warms between their bare fingers.Then, the content. It is about madness, the mania of grandeur. Or so it seems.(view spoiler)[The main character, Kovrin, the Professor of philosophy, feeling psychologically unstable, spends time at the estate of his former carer and his grown up daughter. There, suddenly he experiences the persistent hallucination of a black monk talking to him about his genius and the purpose of his existence. Kovrin realises that he is hallucinating but the conversations he is having with the black monk empower him, stimulate his work and give him energy to make the bold choices with his life. Or so it seems…“If i know that i am mentally ill, could i believe myself?” he asked the monk. The reply follows: “But how do you know that all geniuses, people the whole world trusts, have not seen the ghosts as well? The scientists now saying that a genius is very close to madness. My dear friend, only the mediocre, the people of the herd are healthy and normal. The thoughts about the nervous century, decadence and degeneration can only worry people who see the purpose of their lives in present, the people of the herd. “ “If you want to be healthy, go join the herd.”I think, here Chekhov refers to the theory of “Degeneration” by Max Nordau which was published in 1892 just two years before the publication of the Black Monk. So Kovrin trusts the monk, he lavishes in his own greatness. That is until he is getting cured on the wish of his closed ones. I do not want to reveal anymore of the story. Suffice to say that it contains many questions without giving the definite answers.What is the madness at the end? Is it the force which ruins the individual or is it the other face of the powerful creative force? What is better: to be mad but happy or accept the reality as it is, but be dulled by it? “I was getting mad, i had a mania of grandeur, but i was jolly, alive and even happy. I was interesting and original. Now I’ve become more contemplative and solid, but then I am like everybody else: I am mediocre; I feel bored by life”. Kovrin says after his recovery. “How happy should be Buddha, Muhammad and Shakespeare that their amiable relatives and doctors did not try to cure them from ecstasy and inspiration.”What is the price of happiness? Why we’ve got the capacity to turn our loved ones into a someone whom we cannot possibly love anymore?Of course, there is other possible interpretation of this novella. It could be interpreted in a mystical way: the black monk is not a hallucination- it is a revelation which would make him a prophet, if Kovrin would not reject it as a madness. According to Kovrin, Muhammad would not be remembered more than his dog, if someone “would have cured” him. But why then the black monk does not tell him more than he knows already? Why then he just repeats what Kovrin wants to hear? (hide spoiler)]The questions this story raises and leaves without answer, the ending, terrible and beautiful at the same time, has created a lasting impression on me. This along with The Dead by Joyce and El perseguidor by Cortazar are the best three novellas I've ever read. RussianКакой прекрасный рассказ! Мания величия - это плохо? Помешательство разрушает или создает? Кого оно разрушает больше - человека или его близких? Возможно так же мистическое прочтение, когда герой отвергает истину и все идёт наперекосяк. Я не ожидала от Чехова такого уровня философии. Восхищена глубиной и неожиданностью.Цитаты:“Я сходил с ума, у меня была мания величия, но зато я был весел, бодр и даже счастлив, я был интересен и оригинален. Теперь я стал рассудительнее и солиднее, но зато я такой, как все: я посредственность, мне скучно жить.”“Если я знаю, что я психически болен, то могу ли я верить себе? А почему ты знаешь, что гениальные люди, которым верит весь свет, тоже не видели призраков? Говорят же теперь ученые, что гений сродни умопомешательству. Друг мой, здоровы и нормальны только заурядные, стадные люди. Соображения насчет нервного века, переутомления, вырождения и т. п. могут серьезно волновать только тех, кто цель жизни видит в настоящем, то есть стадных людей.Повторяю: если хочешь быть здоров и нормален, иди в стадо.”“Я приняла тебя за необыкновенного человека, за гения, я полюбила тебя, но ты оказался сумасшедшим..”“Дело красивое, милое, здоровое, но и тут страсти и война, подумал Коврин. Должно быть, везде и на всех поприщах идейные люди нервны и отличаются повышенной чувствительностью.”«Как здесь просторно, свободно, тихо! думал Коврин, идя по тропинке.

The book is a compilation of short writing including poems, the snippets of literary criticism and auto fiction passages. When i was reading it I was thinking about it as a poetry collection. Even the segments written in prose felt like a poetry. Especially when the text would switch from a poem to a prose. I could still feel the rhythm. But after finishing it, I realised that Eaves called it “A memoir by other means”. So for him the autobiographical component was the most important. His thoughts about other writers were quite entertaining and some of them were profound. He mentions Chaucer, Woolf, Golding, Fathrope and O’Connory. He admires Austen and Flaubert. He contemplates what is good literary translation, how does it feel to write a poem. He does not appreciate the role or “relatibility” to characters as a criteria for judging a book. “ I did not relate to any of the characters” means “I caught sight of my rage in the mirror”. In the wonderful micro-essay on Golding’s Inheritors he explores the writer’s ability to depict non-linearity of the time through the eyes of hominid species and the boundaries of the language: “The source of its (book’s) power is a beautiful paradox: within language he conveys a largely no-linguistic way of relating to nature.” I’ve never wanted to read Golding before knowing the notoriety of “Lord of the flies” and his persona. But Eaves made me to rethink this.Still, the poems in this book were the best part. Take, for example, 81 Sturla Street with “the violet insect-o-cuter glow of streetlamp on the fallen snow”; Or “The Claim” breaming with the musicality of the language. And then there is the first piece in the VI part. It is a prose, but it reads like a poetry, amazingly harsh and beautiful little tale about archetypical infidelity framed by the voice of its unsuitable teller, a wealthy lawyer, who is like “ginger Tom stuffed into a smaller cat’s stripy shirt”. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 18, 2019","Jan 22, 2019","Jan 18, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30051159-the-inevitable-gift-shop

The technology is evolving so quickly that many papers being published right now use methods that will be obsolete within a few years.’ Without having any special knowledge of genomics, anthropology or archeology, I am not well placed to  this book. Therefore, what follows is just my impressions and main take from it. Admirably, Reich’s book is not Eurocentric, it covers all the regions to some extent. But mine notes focus more on Europe just because i live here.The book is about the breakthrough in a relatively new field - Ancient Genomics which analyses the ancient DNA in order to study how the genetic make up of modern people and their ancestors affected history. The potential investigative power of DNA for historic research was envisaged in the 60s of the last century. But only in the last 5 years or so this area has leaped forward dramatically. So, the book summarises the cutting age research, mainly derived from Reich’s lab and from his collaborations, the science in flux, not the result of the common consensus. This as well as Reich background as geneticist, needs to be taken into the account while reading it, but the book is well written, entertaining and revelatory. Moreover, in many ways it disrupts the consensus about the evolution of ancient human populations. The consensus, which existed in pre-history almost up until 2012. The research covers ancient populations and their movements around the globe since first humans and up to circa 4000 years ago (a bit later for Africa). So it does not go up to the modern time. But Reich states that for Eurasia for example, including India, the genetic make-up of people 4 thousands years ago is close to the modern make up across the high level population’s clusters such as the West and East Eurasians for example. It was certainly not the case for the earlier periods when the mixtures were very different. The book covers all significant regions such as Western and Eastern Eurasia, Australia, America, Africa and India.So what the analyses of the samples of ancient people’s genome tells us according to Reich?Main resultUntil 2012 it was generally accepted that the evolution of the ancient population could be modelled by a tree in which “today’s populations have remained unchanged and separate since branching from a central trunk” after migrating from Africa and, later, after the farmers from Anatolia and Middle East migrated our of their regions. But DNA research has revealed that “this model is dead and that instead the truth has involved great cycles of population separation and mixture"". So even 4 thousands years ago there were no such thing as a “purity” of blood or any populations which were not significantly mixed with the other.Very ancient daysThere is certainly genetic evidence that modern-humans and Neanderthals interbreed. But Neanderthals’ genetic inheritance has been decreased by natural selection as their genes seem to be toxic for many parts of modern human genome. It has got adverse affect on male’s fertility for Y-chromosome carrier. On another matter, it does not seem to be the evidence of a “switch gene” - the part of DNA sequence which while evolved in pre-history made people to obtain the language in a one-off development. EuropeSouth Europe seems to keep a lot of inheritance from the Middle Eastern and Anatolian farmers (the highest correlation is with the modern Sardinian population). But for the Northern Europe (France, Germany, Britain and alike) the story is more complicated:First, “Between six thousand and five thousand years ago, most of the northern gene pool was overtaken by farmer ancestry, and it was this mixture of a modest amount of hunter-gatherer-related ancestry and a large amount of Anatolian farmer–related ancestry—in a population that retained key elements of hunter-gatherer culture—that characterized the Funnel Beaker potters and many other contemporary Europeans. Europe had reached a new equilibrium. The people of the Funnel Beaker culture were among those who built megaliths, the collective burial tombs made of stones so large it would have taken dozens of people to move them. The archaeologist Colin Renfrew suggested that megalith building might be a direct reflection of this boundary between southern farmers and hunter-gatherers turned farmers—a way of laying claim to territory, of distinguishing one people and culture from others. The genetic data may bear witness to this interaction, as there was clearly a stream of new migrants into the mixed population. The unmixed hunter-gatherers were disappearing, persisting only in isolated pockets like the islands off southern Sweden. In remote Britain, the megalith builders were hard at work on what developed into the greatest man-made monument the world had seen: the standing stones of Stonehenge, which became a national place of pilgrimage as reflected by goods brought from the far corners of Britain. People like those at Stonehenge were building great temples to their gods, and tombs for their dead, and could not have known that within a few hundred years their descendants would be gone and their lands overrun.”Then, somewhere between 4.5 thousands years ago and 4 thousands years ago. The people from the steppe have migrated into Northern Europe in mass and within few hundreds years mixed and/or replaced the local populations to such an extent that they are now “primary ancestors of the modern population”. For example 90% Neolithic Britons (those ones who built Stonehenge) were replaced with this mixture. These steppe people were the Yamnaya, by itself the mixture of Iranian and Armenian populations spreading from the coast of the Black and Caspian sea. They were the first people in Eurasia using the wheel, the horse and wagon which made them very mobile. It is unclear how they were so effective in replacing the existent population. But the one theory is bubonic plague to which they were more immune. They brought it with them. Reich finds it ironic that the earlier Europeans might have been the victims of a similar fate the later Europeans inflicted on the Native Americans in the later history. The first evidence of Yamaya migration is found in the Corded Ware culture. It is notorious by the fact that it helped the Nazis with their theories. They thought the Germanic people went East with this culture and laid their territorial claim for the Eastern Europe on that basis. The DNA study revealed just the opposite, the Corded wire culture reflected a mass migration of Yamnaya people into the central Europe from the steppe:“But the genetics showed that the connection between the Corded Ware culture and the Yamnaya culture reflected major movements of people. The makers of the Corded Ware culture were, at least in a genetic sense, a westward extension of the Yamnaya. Our finding about the genetic link between the Yamnaya and the Corded Ware culture demonstrates the disruptive power of ancient DNA. It can prove past movements of people, and in this case has documented a magnitude of population replacement that no modern archaeologist, even the most ardent supporter of migrations, had dared to propose. The association between steppe genetic ancestry and people assigned to the Corded Ware archaeological culture through graves and artifacts is not simply a hypothesis. It is now a proven fact.”The famous Russian symbolist Alexander Blok in 1918 has written a poem in which he said: “We are all Scythians” (the later people of the same steppe). He might have been right at the end. There is also a hypothesis that Yamnaya people were the first who spoke Indo-European language which they spread with them both to the West and to India. IndiaThe population of India is in fact a set of numerous fairly genetically distinct small populations which do not mix with each other very much. Endogamy have been practised in South Asia for thousands years. And the theory that the British has substantially boosted the cast system by actively encouraging non-mixing between the casts during the colonisation has been disapproved by genetic evidence (as far as I understood the argument). But no-one in India could claim a genetic purity either. There is an evidence of substantial West Eurasian incursion, possibly through Yamnaya as well or the related people (the male line only). But when Reich tried to discuss it with his indian colleagues, “They did not want to be part of a study that suggested a major West Eurasian incursion into India without being absolutely certain as to how the whole-genome data could be reconciled with their mitochondrial DNA findings. They also implied that the suggestion of a migration from West Eurasia would be politically explosive. They did not explicitly say this, but it had obvious overtones of the idea that migration from outside India had a transformative effect on the subcontinent.We wrote that the people of India today are the outcome of mixtures between two highly differentiated populations, “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI) and “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI), who before their mixture were as different from each other as Europeans and East Asians are today. The ANI are related to Europeans, central Asians, Near Easterners, and people of the Caucasus, but we made no claim about the location of their homeland or any migrations. The ASI descend from a population not related to any present-day populations outside India. We showed that the ANI and ASI had mixed dramatically in India. The result is that everyone in mainland India today is a mix, albeit in different proportions, of ancestry related to West Eurasians, and ancestry more closely related to diverse East Asian and South Asian populations. No group in India can claim genetic purity.”ControversiesAs Reich has got the background in medical genetics, he might come across as not paying sufficient attention to certain ethnic and cultural sensitivities. I personally think that in some areas he is brave enough not to avoid those topics all together. But I could see that some people might find him too direct. And certainly he might cause a lot of disagreements if ethical applications of if his statements would be taken further. Two examples:- some Native American tribe councils do not allow the tribe members to provide DNA for scientific research even for medical reasons. This ban acts even in the cases if a person involved signs the individual consent form. Reich thinks it might be more harmful than good. - biological differences across the populations. Here it is getting quite complicated because people associate those high level populations like East Asians, Europeans, Africans etc with race. The race is very charged word for variety of reasons and more appropriate in the conversations about social constructs and their devastating consequences on the society. So Reich is careful showing the difference between the terms of “race” and “population”. However, Reich states that the biological differences across the populations do exist. And sooner or later some differences between the traits and cognitive capabilities might be found as well. Those differences might be smaller that the differences within populations, but still significant. His view that the society should be prepared to discuss this situation.“What real differences do we know about? We cannot deny the existence of substantial average genetic differences across populations, not just in traits such as skin colour, but also in bodily dimensions, the ability to efficiently digest starch or milk sugar, the ability to breathe easily at high altitudes, and susceptibility to particular diseases. These differences are just the beginning. I expect that the reason we don’t know about a much larger number of differences among human populations is that studies with adequate statistical power to detect them have not yet been carried out.If selection on height and infant head circumference (across the populations) can occur within a couple of thousand years, it seems a bad bet to argue that there cannot be similar average differences in cognitive or behavioural traits. Even if we do not yet know what the differences are, we should prepare our science and our society to be able to deal with the reality of differences instead of sticking our heads in the sand and pretending that differences cannot be discovered. If as scientists we wilfully abstain from laying out a rational framework for discussing human differences, we will leave a vacuum that will be filled by pseudoscience, an outcome that is far worse than anything we could achieve by talking openly. We will need to deal with these studies and react responsibly to them when they are published, but we can already be sure that we will be surprised by some of the outcomes. The right way to deal with the inevitable discovery of substantial differences across populations is to realize that their existence should not affect the way we conduct ourselves. As a society we should commit to according everyone equal rights despite the differences that exist among individuals. We aspire to treat all individuals with respect regardless of the extraordinary differences that exist among individuals within a population, it should not be so much more of an effort to accommodate the smaller but still significant average differences across populations.”Some of these points might be debatable and certainly might be emotionally charged for many people. They are discussed in the one of the last chapters of the book. I hope this discussion would not distract the general public and the scientific community from the main findings and the substantial break-through in the the ancient DNA research which is presented in this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jan 11, 2019","Jan 22, 2019","Jan 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35749414-who-we-are-and-how-we-got-here

Occasionally reading it hurts almost physically. But it is a beautiful book nevertheless.Lucia Joyce, It is a very angry, fierce and disturbing book. Occasionally reading it hurts almost physically. But it is a beautiful book nevertheless.Lucia Joyce, the daughter of James Joyce was extremely talented girl struck with mental illness in her twenties, committed to different mental institutions soon after that. She ended up spending the largest part of her life incarcerated in one asylum or another without her family ever visiting her, including her mother. Moreover, after her death the majority of her letters and papers were destroyed on the request of Stephen Joyce, the only living direct descent of James Joyce. If there is anything left, the access to it remains sealed. And Stephen Joyce has got the reputation of being terribly litigious. So Lucia remains largely untouchable for any serious scholarship, deliberately erased from public memory, not understood and not known even after has death. Is the destruction of the papers, alleged withdrawal of information from the archives the protection of privacy or the act of vandalism?Many people disappear from this Earth without leaving a trace; or more often, they continue to leave in the memories of their loved ones, but not in the memories of a broader society. But some people have the right to be remembered more widely due to their exceptional talent, exceptional life or exceptional misfortune. Is it moral to deprive these people this right even after their death?I think, this issue motivated Alex Pheby to go on crusade in writing this book. The another reason, it seems was the act of revenge to all the people alive or dead who might harm Lucia in her life and who prevent any justice after her death. And he did not spare anyone in his writing.The book is brilliantly structured. It is a series of thought experiments - vignettes, focusing on what might have been done to Lucia. Each of them contain a real person, the closed to her, family member or a doctor. And those thought experiments imagine the proper extreme of cruelty. Lucia exist there only as an empty space, she could be identified only through the actions done to her by the others. Each action drop by drop is adding to the burden she is not capable to carry. Everyone gets blamed: father, brother, uncle, mother, Beckett… Incest, domestic violence, abortion, medical torture and abuse in love - all is in here in the proportions which may be considered unlikely. But Pheby argument is that in the absence of the facts available, any speculation is fair: “the truth will come back and bite your arse”. However the book is not simply a speculative rant. It is a beautiful work of literature with striking, even if disturbing, imaginary, full or literary allusions. I was hypnotised how he created a link between snow and fire, matches, incendiary acts and burning the documents. Snow plays a big role in Joyce’s The Dead. Here, Pheby reimagines the story of The Little Match Girl who is trying to burn the matches while looking at the falling snow before dying on the street. Lucia creates a fire in the one of mental institutions which almost cost her life; she seems to possess the matches constantly and chew on them. The fire burns all evidence of her existence; her nephew would order this destruction. But while being a boy, he is mesmerised by the terrible beauty of burning papers flying in the space after an air raid in 1941: “When he looked up into the sky, his mouth full of pastry and custard, and raspberry seeds sticking in his back teeth, he was amazed to see snow falling burning to land at his feet. The snow turned to infinitely thin curled black crisps of nothing which became smudges when touched with the toe of his shoe but he did not question his eyes.”The separate allusions in each of the vignette is not difficult to relate to the actual events or relevant speculations. Be it failed treatment of Lucia by Jung and his essay on Ulysses; the Lucia’s role in Renoir’s film adaptation of ""The Little Match Girl"" or failed love story with Beckett and his Dream of Fair to Middling Women, depicting her unfavourably, unpublished in his life time. There is only one part which totally puzzled me. There is a bit about The Lady with the Little Dog, the one of Chekhov’s most famous story. But the story has been turned upside down to make the main heroine a vengeful creature to the point of being inhuman and making the dog into the rapist (!) of the male character involved. I did not get what he is referring to either in Joyces’s life or in Chekhov's story. And it left me with a slightly unpleasant aftertaste - what Chekhov has to do with all of this? Maybe someone could explain. However, I guess if one reads “Lucia”, one should be prepared to adjust to the author’s hyperbolic lenses.It is a well known fact that Joyce knew Egyptology and incorporated “The Book of Dead” into the imaginary and philosophy created in Finnegan’s Wake (FW). Joyce even suggested to Frank Budgen that he write an article about FW, entitling it James Joyce's Book of the Dead. Another critic draws the attention to ""the splendidly magical atmosphere created by this rich association of gods, insects and Elysian Fields”. There is an agreement between Joyce’s scholars that Lucia was an inspiration for some characters in FW or for its language. There is also a more extreme opinion that Joyce agreed to get Lucia committed in order to finish the book. Pheby uses all these facts to incorporate an Egyptian theme into his book. We meet a lot of insects here as well: persistent gnats, disturbing tapeworms who allegedly manage to penetrate one’s brain and create a work of literature. (I think it is a reference not only to Jung’s Essay on ""Ulysses"", but also to Joyce’s suspected syphilis). And the main key metaphor of the book is conveyed through egyptology as well. In parallel to the main vignettes, we are following the story of two archaeologists discovering a tomb containing a mummy of a girl. However, it is evident that the tomb and the mummy were vandalised, evidently, during the burial rites to stop the girl to get into the other life. So even in death she would be lonely and stuck. The narrating archeologist decides to put the things right for her: “There I made to repair the damage that had been done to the best of my abilities”. I think Alex Pheby certainly did good job in his ""repair"". The book has made me to research what is factually known about Lucia. It is not a lot. But i think I know a big part of it now. There is a wonderful book attempting the biography of Lucia by Carol Shloss Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake. It is mainly based on the textual analysis of FW and Joyce’s notebooks. But Carol Shloss had to delete a lot of references to her source material from the book and some of her conjectures on the request of infamous Joyce’s estate (Stephen). She lately has worn a lawsuit against the estate. And her supplementary text containing the original research could be viewed in the US on-line. But sadly not in Europe. And that made me angry. I only could imagine how it would feel to research a proper book about Lucia.Alex Pheby’s book is also important as it deals with the barbaric methods of treating the mental illness in 20th century. For some reason, this often affected women living in a shadow of famous men. He details some horrific experiments which, I am afraid, not totally fictitious. In the recent years, the interest in Lucia’s life has sparkled quite a few works of fiction. Alex Pheby’s stands out as the most conceptual and inventive one. There is also The Joyce Girl devoted to Lucia’s years in Paris and Lucia, and ""The girl who danced in Shadows"" by Joyce Garvey, The Irish academic dealing with her time in Northampton asylum. There was also a play “Calico” about her relationship with Beckett. And Carol Shloss’s biography is wonderful research into her creativity and relationship with Joyce. However, I hope that soon the scholars would be allowed to research freely whatever documents are left about her life, and we would have a scholarly, documentary based biography, which would do her justice. It is an uncanny coincidence that I’ve read this book shortly after finishing The End by Knausgard (the final instalment of his Mein Kamf project). Both books are dealing with the issues of privacy; what is the truth about a concrete individual and where are the limits between the public and the private sphere. In the case of Knausgaard, he puts his family under public eye almost in real time. Especially it affects his wife who has got a bipolar and struggles with her mental health. Now the public image of her created by the project would accompany her life whether she wants it or not. In the case of Lucia, it is the opposite extreme: she is dead since 1982. She was silenced and abandoned for the last 40 years of her life. She was extremely talented person. If she would have a different life, she might achieve a lot of creative success notwithstanding her illness. Or she might not. We would never know. But she is certainly not an ordinary person. And even now we are not allowed to know the whole truth about her. The part of her legacy was physically destroyed. And all of that for the sake of privacy. Whose privacy is that? Hers? Her nephew? Joyce’s who is dead since 1941? The border between the private and the public is getting blurrier in our time. It is not always a good thing. But in the case of the talented woman, silenced by her family and her condition, we have the right to know more. I am sure she was not alone in the 20th century. And all of these silenced voices should be able to be heard now. Therefore this brutal, angry book is so powerful and timely.AppendixSome articles about Lucia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_J... - Wikihttps://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/28/bo... - Hermione Lee's  of Carol Shloss book.

Instead for me it was pretty much anticlimax and the point whenThis final book of “My struggle” was supposed to be a culmination of the whole series. Instead for me it was pretty much anticlimax and the point when his struggle decisively felt like my own struggle with this book. I suppose, this could be counted as an achievement of this opus. The purpose of this final instalment was to explain why he went alone with the project at the first place (to write a book about himself more or less from the birth to the age of 40) and to use it as a platform to deal with the anger expressed by some real people he wrote in the book about and share the reactions of others. So it is kind of a metafictional work. And initially i found the idea interesting. But the problem was it went much further and has fallen apart. Instead, i was reading 3 separate books packaged in a single volume: the first one was more or less as I summarised above; the second was 400 pages plus essay and the third was details of his wife’s depressive and manic episode, caused, at least to some extent, by this project and his lack of sensitivity to her mental fragility. So first part was Knausgaard as usual in a quite good form. But the rest of the book I found simply intolerable (apart from 50 pages closed reading of Celan’s poem and brief family holiday on Canaries). The essay in the middle is like a heavy brick thrown into a lively stream and blocking it for good.What I liked about his work (especially book 2) is his ability to unexpectedly switch between a mundane detail and thinking about something else, more profound, like a memory or a book. It feels very relatable, in a way how our brain works. And I was happy to forgive the dullness of the prose and repetitiveness of his misusing for such moments. Though one have to be really patient with him. I liked also when he talked about the books he read. It would even affect his writing style. For a few pages he would write in a style Hamsun, or Joyce or whoever he would be talking about. I thought I would like to read his book s or essays about literature (That is before I came to face the essay here ). In this book he muses that a writer is afraid to be unoriginal. Well, in his case, there is nothing particular original or creative about either this book or any other books in the series, apart from these sparkling switches between the mundane and a thought. And when this disappears, only dullness stays.The above would summarise my impression overall. Initially, I thought even not to write anything more about this book. But I invested almost 2 weeks reading it, and it seemed kind of defeatist just to give up. So below just more details which were the basis for my impression.Part 1.The first part was lively. He was called by his uncle a lier for the story he wrote in Book 1 about the death of his father and its aftermath. Knausgaard starts doubting himself whether he wrote the total truth and he does not remember some details. And we as readers are presented with his internal commotion and desire to reconcile his actions with social morality or reject the morality as it is. Though, it was presented like hyper honest struggle, I could not got rid off a feeling that it was am element of craftiness in it. He said in the book 1 that his grandma was drinking with his dad and after his death. His uncle opposed it. And for me it was crucial detail. As this the thing which you would not be able to forget. So was grandmother as he described her, desperate for a drink and out of herself completely loosing her mind or totally different? That is where for me the success and authenticity of this project lies. He should know the answer and he could clear it very quickly in this book, if he wishes to do so. But he avoids it. Of course, there is always the excuse this being a “novel”. But that left slightly uneasy impression on me. For the rest, the writing is penetrated by the fragile mixture of vanity and insecurity which is his trademark. The new features in this book were his sudden affection with the lists. We’ve been treated to quite a few of them starting from the list of things to buy in supermarket. He also decides to repeat the ideas of basic literary theory of signals: what we buy tells who we are etc. Not sure why we need it here, but ok i guess. The strongest element was his conversations with his friend, Geir, who visited. Maybe he read Socrates while writing as they reminded me Socrates’s dialogues.The writing is as usual of a varied quality. We’ve been treated for example with such a sentence:  “The glassy bubbly liquid fizzing faintly settled itself in the transparent receptacle, some of the bubbles released from the surface leaping four, five centimetre in the air, visible in the light of the sun which made them sparkle. “ I believe this is referring to a glass of mineral water. I’ve forgotten exactly what it was but I strongly do not wish to come back to the book to confirm it. Also we encounter truisms like that: “It is through the feelings we connect to each other and it is the feelings which are good and bad, not the days.”However, overall i found it the most pleasant part in Knausgaard's kind of way. And, if he would finish the project with it, I would be more than satisfied. But he had not not done so.Part 2.It starts not bad. He thinks about the nature of names and why they are important which leads him to Paul Celan and his poem Stretta (""Engführung”). He already used Celan in the book 5 while reading ""Todesfuge"" (""Fugue of Death"") to a girl. But here, he subjects Stretta to a “lemon squeeze” reading trying to analyse it word by word. It takes him 50 pages. One need to have a patience, as his analysis could be too detailed and amateur, but readable nevertheless. And the poem is so beautiful that it focuses one’s attention.But then, it seems Knausgaard falls the victim of Godwin's law. (or Godwin's rule of Hitler analogies is an Internet adage asserting that ""As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1""; that is, if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to Adolf Hitler or his deeds, the point at which effectively the discussion or thread often ends.)) The definition is taken from Wiki. We do not have an internet discussion here, but we certainly have the case of the law. He decides to read Mein Kampf and he takes us with him. But it is not his usual mention and impression - it goes on and on. He moves to Hitler’s youth, Weimar republic, Mein Kampf and other books about the period. And this part is awful on two main levels. Firstly, it is just too long, repetitive, badly structured. The excerpts from his sources, including Mein Kampf are too long, often take almost a page while his original ideas (which are actually not very original) take much less space. I felt really exhausted and angry that I am subjected to reading Mein Kampf in proxy while I assumed I read about Knausgard. And for the first 300 hundred pages I did not know why i was subjected to it. The musings about Hitler’s youth are intermingled with the long and not very good recounts of Bible stories and some sociology of dubious quality about the state of working class in Austria and in England (!). The England bit is presented based upon the works of Marx and Jack London visiting East London. Knausgard concludes that the condition of working class in England did not change materially between 1850 and 1910s. I seriously doubt it is correct. But it is almost beyond the point as it drowns in many other statements, excepts and repetitions. All of it lacks the coherence and the clarity of arguments. Secondly, the content. He critises Ian Kershaw, the author of Hitler’s authoritative biography for the lack of empathy based upon a different reading of memories of a friend of Hitler’s youth. That would be fair enough I guess. It is his point of view. Right. But why? And it took me almost 400 pages to come across this:“We are opposed, and rightly so, to everything he stood for. Hitler is our antithesis. But only in respect of what he did, not in terms of the person he was. In that, he was like us. Hitler’s youth resembles my own, his remote infatuation, his desperate desire to be someone, to rise above the self, his love for his mother, his hatred of his father, his use of art as a space of great emotions in which the I could be erased. His problems forming relationships with others, his elevation of women and his anxiety in their company, his chastity, his yearning for purity. When I watch him on film, he awakens the same feelings in me as my father once did. In that too there is likeness. He represented conservative middle-classness in so many respects, and this too I know, it is the voice, trembling with indignation, that says you are not good enough. He also represents the defiance of conservative middle-class values, the young lad sleeping until mid-morning, refusing to look for a job, wishing instead to write or paint, because he is something more and better than the others. He was the one who opened a we and said you are one of us, and he was the one who closed a we and said you are one of them. But above all he was the man who emerged from the bunker, with the world in flames and millions of people dead as a result of his volition, to greet a line of young boys, his hands shaking from sickness, and there, in a fleeting gleam of his eyes, revealed something warm and kind, his soul. He was a small person, but so are we all. He must not be judged for what he was, but for what he did. What he did, however, he did not do alone. It was done by a we, that we was put under pressure, it gave way and something collapsed.”So Hitler must not be judged for what he was as Knausgard identifies with a lot of threats Hitler possessed in his youth. And that he went on and organised the humanity killing machine is just circumstances and he did not do it alone. Right. He ‘revealed something warm and kind. his soul.” Right!And it goes on in other place:“Nor was Hitler a fanatical militaristic theatre director enforcing his will on the people; the strings he played were genuine, the emotions he aroused were in everyone. Anyone who has seen footage of the rallies of Hitlers Germany knows what feelings they evoke, the sheer might of the uniformed, I less community the strength of the collective and oh how one long to be a part of such a we. Who would not wish to be a part of something’s greater that the self. Who would not wish to feel their life be meaningful? Who would not wish to have something to die for?” I would not wish. I know that for sure. And many other people would not wish as well. I could understand the humanising Hitler this way. I understand that he has not done it alone. But i do not agree that everyone wants to be “part of something greater than himself” through hatred. And, more to the point, how is it relevant to the morality or the lack of it in terms of exposing one’s own life and one's family in a novel?And another quote. He feels a part of Norwegian nation after Breivik’s terrorist act:“How could I feel such strong sense of belonging? And yet the feelings were quite incontestable, and swept everything else aside during the time of the tragedy. Only afterwards did I realise that these must have been the same forces the enormous forces that reside within the we that came over the German people in 1930.” Really? So the feeling grieve for innocent victims of the right-wing fanatic is the same as the hatred of Jews and the impact of nation's humiliation, true or imagined? It is a pure solipsism in my view. I could continue quoting form that huge pile of someone’s else writing, Knausgaard’s own confusing thoughts ranging from Hitler was deranged individual to Hitler was just the victim of circumstances. But reading it was like raking through the pile of garbage and now writing about it feels the same. Even if I do not agree with his argument, I would appreciate it more, if it would be clearly and elegantly set out. But it is not.Part 3I do not have much to say about this bit apart from reading it sometimes felt like watching at someone torturing a kitten. I am not surprised that Karl Ove and Linda separated since then. I do not think this part has added anything to what I’ve already known from the book 2. And it was a borderline misery memoir here.Josipovici, an english modernist, which I’ve discovered this year, says: ‘The world is being swallowed up in superficiality. And the artists and intellectuals react to this by seeking profundity. When they grow tired of profundity they play ironically with superficiality. But they are wrong on both counts. They should not seek the depths and they should not seek the surfaces they should seek the truth. ‘ That what I was thinking reading Knausgaard before. But at the same time, I never could totally avoid a feeling angrily summarised by Daša Drndic: “absolutely intolerable unless the person reading them is inwardly riddled with holes, full of stale air, so the cultivation of perverse voyeuristic instincts serves to fill up that inner void” But it was not that much voyeurism from my side as persistent exhibitionism from the writer. I know it takes two to tango, but I felt sometimes exploited and left without choice unless to throw the book out of the window!Overall, if you want to try him, I would recommend Book 1 and Book 2.

At the same time she is constantly thinking about her sister, AHelena, the art historian is writing about Joseph Cornel an American reclusive artist. At the same time she is constantly thinking about her sister, Alice, who works in a orphanage in Chechnya after the end of two wars there. This is the premise of this short novel and its subject matter. As one can see, these two themes are quite complex and far apart. What connects them is Helena's thoughts about the meaning of art and the meaning of life; whether she could justify her sitting in her flat writing an artistic research and leading her trouble-free existence, while there is a horror happening for real somewhere on this planet. The problem is as old as this world. Moral choices.As with all three novels I've read so far by this author, I enjoyed very much the inventiveness of his style. This novella is structured predominantly in the form of a snappy dialogue. Helena talks to her neighbours from upstairs and downstairs. Also she received an unexpected visit from a czech photographer arriving from Chechnya, who says he has been sent by her sister. The language of the photographer somewhat irritated me as i would imagine he could speak proper english after his international experiences in war zones; but it is a minor quip. The tone and shape of these conversations are fabulously concise and lightly-touched. It reminded me  Autumn.The other part of the book consists of Helena's attempted writing in her search to understand Joseph Cornel as an artist and more importantly, as a human being. She feels very close to him, but she is not sure what exactly attracts her to his personality. She struggles with progressing her project and we as readers are made to witness her creative search. The book is stylistically perfect, but I think, the author struggled a bit in combining two very profound and very serious threads of Joseph Cornel and the aftermath of Chechnya's wars together. The attempt seems a fairly loose one. I would probably prefer him writing two separate novels. Apparently, Josipovici has written a short story on Joseph Cornel. I have not read it yet, but Paul Fulcher mentions it in his superb  of Heart's Wings&other stories. And he thinks it is wonderful. Chechnya deserves a separate consideration. It has been almost twenty years since the second war there. Many things happened since then including the Boston bombing and the war in Ukraine. But I still have not come across a single profound work of fiction neither in Russian nor in English about those events and their aftermath. I've read only one work of fiction Constellation of vital phenomena. It is highly praised, but i personally did not like it. I found it overwritten, a bit too exhibitionistic and too much relying on coincidences. But at least it was an attempt. This is the second attempt I've came across of dealing with the subject matter. And it deserves the praise for being there. Though it copies quite a few opinions prevailing on the subject without going further. And I appreciate it is hard to write about such things without being there. For his factual material, he relies on the books by Anna Politkovksaya, the fearless Russian journalist who has been murdered in 2006.Unusually, at the end of the book, he provides the list of publications he used in writing of this novel. I found it quite instructive as he certainly sparkled my appetite to find out more about Joseph Cornel.Overall, it was a 3.5 star read for me, but i rounded it upwards for introducing me to Joseph Cornell and touching upon the conflict everyone else seems to forget....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Nov 19, 2018","Nov 22, 2018","Nov 19, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19019067-hotel-andromeda

And this is my favourite one of the three. As usual for me, the more I like the booThis is the one of 3 short novels by Josipovici i’v read recently. And this is my favourite one of the three. As usual for me, the more I like the book the harder it becomes to articulate my response to it and make it concise… But I will try, and apologise for the amount of the quotes.The protagonist of the novel is a grumpy old man, who appeared to be a composer, talking about his long life, the world around him, the nature of creativity, beauty and everything else under the sun. He is opinionated, unashamedly aristocratic, but he is passionate and you cannot, but feel strong sympathy towards him. This is the generation of my grandparents who saw the world being destroyed more than once. They’ve already disappeared from this Earth taking with them their strength, their quiet courage and non-conformity of their views. The memories of them fading. Maybe that is the main reason why i felt so moved by this text.The literary device is an interview with the servant, Massimo, who spent a long time with this gentleman. The interview is taking place in the apparent aftermath of the composer’s death. So we never hear the actual man talking, we see him reflected in the monologues of his servant as if we are looking through a mirror. We would not know how distorted this mirror is. But I certainly felt that the reflection is authentic. According to Josipovici, the protagonist “is loosely based on the Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi (1905-1988).” So there exist a parallel of Massimo talking about his boss and Josipovici talking about the real person. Having lived through two wars and their aftermath, having loved and being abandoned by his wife, the gentleman does not really have a huge respect for the human race. His worldview is tellingly and marvellously bleak:“Human race are sheep without the innocence of a sheep. When you look back at the history of the world what you see in the history of sheep. Of madmen leading sheep and sheep following the madmen.”And the history does not teach us anything, knowledge do not change the human nature much:“A cesspit. Europe was a cesspit in those years and the stink is not totally disappeared. In Italy at any rate they still long for a strong man to lead them, a man with an iron chin. We have not seen the end of it. When I go to Hungary and Romania to hear my music played I hear about the monstrousness of the gypsies. When I go to Belgrade I hear about the smell left by the Turks and the Bosnians. When I go to Poland I hear about the treachery of Jews. There is no end to it Massimo, not end to it.”The gentleman presumably talks in the late 80s. The novel is written in 2012. And it is shocking how ominous those words sound today after just a few years. Or maybe it was always like that and it just resurfaced recently. The education would not change much. Moreover, it “draws you long paths you know are not real paths until you forget that they are not real paths and think they are the only paths.”However there is a solace for this man. It is music. But not all the music. It is the purity of sound. “Bells and gongs and trumpets of Buddhism take you back to roots. Each sound i heard had taken a lifetime to produce; each sound is a world, an infinite world, Massimo. It is like a huge cavern which take a lifetime to explore and yet which is over in no time at all, it is almost as if you could say that it does not exist in time at all.” It is infinity in a moment.It is the act of creation. I believe, anyone who was on this edge at least once, would recognise this feeling of impossibility and, at the same time, inevitability of something overwhelmingly bigger than oneself. But not everyone would be able to articulate it so beautifully: “You feel as if at every moment you are going either to be crashed away, but you also feel as if you are in touch with the secret pulse of the universe. It is an extraordinary sensation, a compressing into a moment of everything that has ever been and ever will be.” Infinity. The Story of a moment. Slim. Stylish. Moving. Angry. Authentic.

The form of this one reminded me of a ball dance. Imagine the ball room when the pairs are moving in a concentric circles - getting closer to the centre forming a tight circle only to step back and recede like a wave again. This is how this novella is structured: the story takes place in 3 separate locations in 3 separate time frames. The main character is translator who tells his story either directly (the author is using a narrator but he is clearly shadowing the main character) or through the voice of his second wife. And the narrative moves backwards and forwards in time and space. The writing is light and elegant.I could not quite tell why he needed to create a darker undertones in the story. In fact, is spite of the clearly identifiable sinister twists, the novella did not resonate with me as something sinister with at all. But maybe, the idea was to show how blur is the line between the imagination and the reality and how quick something imagined might become real.Both in the form and subject matter, it reminded me another modernist, Nobel prize winner, Patrick Modiano. He also writes about the illusiveness of what we remember, long walks and disappearing female characters. However, if Modiano is classicism, then Josipovici is more towards baroque in this novel.

To demonstrate how the historiography affects and being affected by our convictions and beliefs, he brings the example of Zulu tribe and its history written by a missionary in the 19th century.

Дочитала только потому что два человека, мнение которых я уважаю, его высоко оценили.Сначала - формально. Это еще одна семейная сага, охватывающая двадцатый век. И сколько ж их надо? Улицкая пишет их лучше. Есть еще “Московская Сага” конечно. Ну и из последнего, что я читала - “Женщины Лазаря.” Там вообще все даже похоже - любовный треугольник в пол-века, например Но там это все как-то менее надуманно. Так чем же этот роман отличается? Во-первых, формальные приемы. Много в настоящем времени - камера наезжает, герой что-то там думает или говорит, камера отъезжает- повествование возвращается в прошлое время. В какой-то момент мне это надоело. Но больше всего не понравился подход автора - он почти господь-бог такой себе в им же созданном мире. По-английски это называется “God’s view”. Некоторые писатели это используют и чаще всего это превращается в злоупотребление. Здесь - типичный пример. Нам постоянно дают знать, что случится с героями в будущем. Опять же, я не знаю русского термина; по-английски это называется “foreshadowing” - такая тень впереди героя. Меня это жутко раздражает - зачем это надо, если и так понятно, что писатель создает этих героев и сделает с ними все, что захочет. Нет, нужна демонстрация “вышей силы”. И еще, все смерти героев сопровождаются детальнейшим описанием, что они думают в последний момент. Опять же, никто кроме них этого знать не может. Но нам надо это рассказать, и не один раз, а каждый раз - на кой это?Конечно Кузнецов писать умеет и это очевидно даже мне, незнакомой с его другим творчеством. Например, что мне понравилось, это как он описывает окончание любви - проникновенно и в это веришь. Ну не понятно, зачем тогда все эти искусственные приемы нужны. Меня это только отвлекало и мешало читать.Теперь личное. Закончила я это все с ощущением негодования и уныния. А вместе с тем, облегчения, что я не живу больше в этой стране. Если бы я хотела прочитать про колобков, я бы лучше взяла русские народные сказки. А если серьезно, с каких это пор приспособленчество стало жизнеспособной философией? Само-обманом - я пониманию, способом выживания - отлично понимаю. Но чем-то больше чем это? Способом нести “разумное-доброе-вечное?” - позвольте. И писатель прямо давлеет над каждой строчкой этой своей идеей. Почему в 70-х, допустим, тот де Трифонов написал “Дом на набережной” (который кстати упоминается в этом романе) и назвал там подлость подлостью. А здесь для страха и нежелания попасться в жернова системы придумана какая-то философия:“С такими людьми лучше дела не иметь. Он из науки ушёл, чтобы такие как этот гена на него глаз не положили. С такими нельзя работать и договорится с ними нельзя, от них нужно только убегать и прятаться. Слава богу, страна большая. Хороший человек всегда найдёт где укрыться.”Вот я представила на минутку, что я, если бы там осталась, вот так бы “обколобочилась”. Точно бы. А как иначе. И стала бы себе объяснять, какая я молодец, что стараюсь тут “не по лжи”. А как это иначе-то называется? Что ж это за правда такая все время убегать?А в остальном, в романе все в зейтгвесте - чем наша пражская весна хуже их Вьетнама? Мистика, тантрический секс или как он там называется.. гуру Вал (хорошо рифмуется с “полный провал” у меня в голове). Тут же - православие, много умных имен без цели появившихся в тексте от Лакана до Шнура и Гоа, как обычно. Еще я выучила для себя новое русское слово “субурб” (красивое слово означает пригород), и вспомнила несколько забытое, но не менее гадкое слово “трахаться”.Одно отличие от других “саг”- это первый роман, который я прочитала, в котором упоминаются хоть какие-то события после 2000 года. Вот например, митинги на Болотной. Но оказывается, это был такой мягкий протест хипстеров? Я-то думала, что там детей в автозак пачками совали. Но мне отсюда, наверное, плохо видно. И вот наш герой, последний, так сказать, убегает из Москвы, где сеять разумное, доброе вечное становится почему-то невозможно, бросая своих учеников, чтобы делать тоже самое в провинции (ну, не совсем глубокой, не поселок в казахской степи, а в Тулу), чтобы там начать сеять другим детям - занавес.В общем, я понимаю, почему этот роман номинировался там на всякие премии. Но я перехожу на классику, если читаю по-русски. Может, сделаю исключение для Сорокина. Но к семейным сагам или там современным романам о двадцатом веке, меня теперь насильно не притянешь. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 15, 2018","Oct 18, 2018","Oct 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36192932

I believe “Norwegian house” is the only her novel translated into English. I hope they will translate more as I liked this book and author’s honesty and skill. I also thought the translation was very good. This little novel touches upon a very interesting, sensitive topic of how well do we know ourselves, especially when it concerns our attitude towards otherness. Alma, the main character is a neurotic , but thoughtful and talented norwegian textile artist. She considers herself as a liberal, open-minded woman ready to do good, advocating cosmopolitan values and open society. But her self -image is subject to a severe test when she rents out the annex of her house to a Polish family. During 6 years of her experience she finds out that the concrete situation is very different from the abstract views. Her attitudes and beliefs are getting tested against the clash of cultures and daily misunderstandings. The book is making us witnessing her “journey of self-discovery”, not always pleasant; her self-doubts, rages and feeling guilty, her hopeless desire to reconcile her views with her daily situation. “She had to agree with her daughter that there where ghetto-like neighbourhoods in Oslo where foreigners or people of foreign origin or whatever the current phrase was, lived and spoke their own language instead of learning Norwegian, who didn’t take part in social activities and didn’t learn Norwegian value. But the moment she thought about “Norwegian values” she immediately wanted to correct herself because she was one of those people who often mocked and scorned typical “Norwegian values” and now she was arguing that they did matter after all. She lost herself in a tangle of hopeless contradictions… “At the same time, Alma is performing the art commission for the centenary of suffrage in Norway. This as well leads to a doubt how reliably we could imagine the past, feelings and motivations of the people of the past. Could we really know what happened?All of this is taking place on the usual backdrop of Nordic charm: snow, woods, fire and slightly excessive alcohol consumption. I would not try to moralise here and try to imagine what I would do, or even to which camp I would belong in this situation. But I found this topic extremely important and fascinating.

Marias seemed to assign himself a task to reflect how is that to spend a long chunk of your life waiting for someone dear without even knowing if he ever be back. What you would do and what would be your feelings the day after day, after day… Before going any further, i need to make a caveat. Marias is one of my favourite writers. I’ve read the majority of his novels. And “Your Face Tomorrow”, so called spy trilogy, is my all time favourite of his. One could call “Berta Isla” a spin off from that trilogy. It even features the same MI6 agents. So if you did not like that trilogy you might not appreciate this book either. It is also not a spy novel - the plot is more or less evident from the very beginning. There are no thrills, twists or turns, or at least none of those which would attract the reader of spy novels. The spy novel form is just an effective vehicle he uses to create the architecture if his book. It is not a character driven novel either. Anyone familiar with Marias’s work probably would notice that he uses his characters quite often to convey his thoughts more than to shape a whole fictional individual. This book is not an exception. So what is then left to like?I liked the atmosphere, the unique digressive style of writing where each word has got its purpose - he calls it “roving”, i think; i liked his literally references when a quote by TS Eliot stayed with me even after i closed the book and made me read the poem in full. There is of course Shakespeare as well with ""Henry V"" this time. And, most importantly, i like the themes of this novel: his more traditional ones - identity, history, literature; and the unique to this one - the role of waiting in life.Since the eternity, people were doing just that - waiting for winter to end, for the crops to grow, for a war to end, for a ship to come to shores. More often than not it was women’s fate. Even biologically a woman needs to endure waiting for a child inside of her body. So she knows how to be patient probably better than a man. It does not mean to be passive at all. But it probably means to be loyal and to be hopeful in spite of everything. Berta Isla and Tomas Nevinson are school sweethearts who marry in their 20s. Berta does not know that while in Oxford Tomas has been recruited by MI6, albeit not totally willingly. “He was one of those people with great abilities and qualities, but who has no idea what to do with them unless instructed and told what they are for.” But soon it becomes apparent to her that she and the family would never play more than a small part in Tomas life. She endures his long disappearances, his internal struggle and inability to share with her anything of importance due to the secrecy surrounding his job. She goes through all of this only for one day to discover his disappearance. And that is how her waiting starts. Marias poignantly leads us through the evolution of her feelings, her motivations and struggles. It is interesting how the loyalty inevitably combines in her mind with the resentment of Tomas; how honest she is with herself. It cannot be otherwise as love has to feed on something and how one cannot resent the person who left physically, but still has got such emotional hold on one’s-self… It is a current fashion in English speaking literature to retell a myth or two. Marias, i think, would never do such a thing. He does not need to. However, Penelope from Odyssey inevitably comes to mind as there is something from the legend in Berta’s fate. “Everyone who grows accustomed to a state of constant waiting never entirely allows it to end, it’s as if half air had been taken away.”The book reminded me of another story - the story of romance between Nikolay Rezanov and Conchita at the beginning of the 19th century. He was 42 year old Governor of Russian America; she was Concepcion Arguello, 15 year old daughter of Spanish Commandante of a Fort in North California. Rezanov visited California in 1806 for about 6 weeks. In this 6 weeks he has met the girl, they’ve fallen in love and agreed to get married. But he needed the permission of the Pope for that nuptial. On the way back to Russia, he died from pneumonia. The girl waited for him for 36 years before becoming a nun. She never got married. Some sources say she knew about his death after a few years. But main legend prevails that she did not. The story has been popularised in Russia through “Juno and Avos”, the musical. But there is also a poem written by by Francis Bret Harte Concepcion De Arguello https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/conce.... The historical account of Rezanov misadventures, is subject to Glorious Misadventures: Nikolai Rezanov and the Dream of a Russian America, very interesting micro history book by itself.A separate thread which runs through many Marias books is the fascination by illusory quality of one’s Identity. How easy we can convince ourselves in something we would not believe otherwise in order to justify our actions. But, how later those self-imposed beliefs might take over our inner core and replace it without us noticing. Initially, Tomas is quite realistic about the role spies perform in a society. But later he merges himself into his job. “He, on the other hand, has been given permission to think he’s important, he’s just said as much, the sentinel always on guard, the one who wards off danger and defends the Realm, who allows others to sleep easy in their beds. How can he be so ingenious and so malleable, how has he let himself be seduced by mere verbiage? Because it is pure patriotic claptrap, although that kind of claptrap is probably never entirely without some basis in reason, built as it is on half-truths: of course there are snares, enemies, dangers. That’s why the masses are so easily led, eager for simplifications and apparent deceit.” - thinks Marta about the one of their last talks.Amazing, how it echoes with idea from The Tobacco Keeper, a wonderful book set in Iraq, I’ve read recently:“We must not forget ourselves entirely, even if we surrender to a role we’ve invented, even when it is incompatible with our personalities, because we have chosen to play a role. But I see that others, instead of playing their roles, are played by them. I wish I could find myself another role and stop playing myself. We often imagine that we control the game unaware that it actually controls us.”And later, Tomas desperately trying to hold on to his loyalty to Berta as only remaining feature he left of himself-truly when everything else melted.Historical backdrop for this novel is 70s and 80s of the last century. Specifically, it focuses on Britain this time, not Spain - Falklands War (through the eyes of a Spanish woman), Margaret Thatcher, The Troubles. He talks about the nature of collective cruelty and tribe instincts. “I imagined the people in NI to be irascible and hate filled and more fighting that any other. Not just members of the IRA and the armed Unionists, but the population as a whole; I imagined they were as gripped by savagery and a desire for revenge as we Spaniards were in the 1930s in the last century.” As usual for him he uses a visual image to trigger his reflections. He made me Google it - it is a photo of a horrific and very symbolic scene. Surely picture tells more than the worlds on that one. Also the sentence: ”He was on the way of becoming “Somebody” straightaway reminded me of  Milkman, the novel by Anna Burns I’ve read this summer which focuses on exactly this period and set in Belfast. Later I thought there were a lot of other parallels in these two novels, especially in the style and the role of tribalism in instigating the acts of violence. As you’ve probably gathered, I loved this novel. It immensely moved me and made me think a lot. But i could foresee some people saying it is dull, very much the same as his previous novels and lacks in the plot. It was not the case or beyond the point for me.Quotes:“we tend not to know much about the lives lived by our parents before we were born, and they are often a matter of no interest to us until we are grown-ups ourselves and them it’s sometimes too late to ask’.Falklands “England had suddenly childishly recovered its past and thought it was back in those distant centuries, a ghost of its lost Empire.”Politicians never dare to criticise the people who are often base and cowardly and stupid, they never tell them off or condemn their behaviour, they invariably praise them to the skies, when there is usually very little reason to praise any people anywhere. They have become untouchable and have taken place of once despotic, absolutist monarchs. Like them, they have the prerogative to be as fickle as they please and to go eternally unpunished, and they don’t have to answer for how they vote or who they elect or who they support, or what they remain silent about to or impose or claim.Going back is very worth infidelity.Why make a story out of something that simply happens. Most people would insist that the opposite is true, that nothing simply happens. They are the kind who revisit and repeat until the end of days, and never let it stop happening.PsI wish he would write another novel in which Bertram Tupra, the one of very unpleasant characters, meets his end.And I liked the cover of the book very much. ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Oct 04, 2018","Oct 12, 2018","Oct 04, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35483196-berta-isla

We still were taught that the history is objective strict science bI went to a school in Ukraine during the time of the twilight of the Soviet Union. We still were taught that the history is objective strict science based upon the historic materialism of Feuerbach and dialects of Hegel, of course enriched with the social theory of Marx. There where no questions about it. So I did not question when we were taught that the Soviet Union (in particular, the Slavic Soviet republics including Russia) were descenders from the Kiev Rus; And that Russia was inheritor of the Roman Empire intellectual luggage through Byzantine (Moscow is the third Rome on the seven hills). I did not only question it, I felt proud to belong to such a rich and ancient history! Then first came collapse of the Soviet Union, and I saw how Russia is appropriating its history leaving the former republics scrabble for their historical identities. But i was too young to bother then, I was in Russia doing a successful career, and still I did not feel the relevance of it all to the current time. Later I moved to England and all of this has become even less relevant for me. However, the war of words between Russia and Ukraine were gaining more and more power, until the real war sparkled in 2014. I think the reasons for it were in the present rather than the past. But the past has been used as a powerful weapon to split the people into groups and made them to take sides literally on the battle fields. That was as close as I personally saw and felt the war ever. And it shook me to the core. And also it was this element” how what they told us in school was not true? So i decided to investigate for myself, who is the proper inheritor of the Kiev Rus (naive I know). After reading quite a few books on the subject I understood that I could not find out the answer. Maybe no one could - i do not think there is enough historical evidence there. And the question has become more broad - does anyone need to claim the ownership of the past in such a way? Has the Kiev Rus any inheritors or is it just question logically flawed for a medieval kingdom and the contemporary states? Is it just an example how certain historical facts are used in designing the myths justifying the present. So that is how my personal history or inquiry has lead me to the broad subject of historiography and what is history for. “There is a significant difference between the ancient myths and the national narratives of the past: the former did not reject other myths, accepting for better or worse an ideological coexistence with all the rest. National historical narratives however have generally challenged or even squarely denied the myths of neighbouring people and nations. They have proclaimed themselves permanent possessors of a sole authentic truth, which explains among other things the stubbornness of their inventors in defining themselves as science.” Writes Shlomo Sand in this book. That statement is related to the historians writing between 1820 and 1930. But it is amazing how much out of this statement is now more relevant than ever! Maybe there is a difference: the historians (or should I say those who think they write history today) do not consider themselves as scientists, or rather they do not need any more to appeal to the science to cover themselves with the plethora or authenticity. The science is now partially discredited in public view by the denial of global warming, the usefulness inoculations, economic crisis etc - you know what i mean…I’ve read a few books recently on historiography, that is writing about history and what is history for. And this is by far the best. Maybe, I liked it so much because it confirmed many issues I suspected with history. Additionally, the book puts the history writing and the historians into the context of their time and space. Sand attempts to trace the history writing in various civilisations starting from so-called hydraulic societies of Mesopotamia, Egypt and China and finishing with the contemporary West (Germany, France, the UK and the US). He is the only one from what i read so far who attempts, at least initially, to widen the scope beyond the West. Though at the end he as well focuses on the four countries plus some comments on Israel. He does not attempt to be comprehensive, but he is certainly concise and convincing in his conclusions. He does not try to be “objective” - he reveals from the beginning that he shows his own view based upon his knowledge and professional experience. He also shares his personal experiences at the end of the each chapter. This “transparency’ becomes the part of his view on the process of history writing. After reading a few books on the subject including this one, it seems to me that the history is that elephant in the story of a 6 blind men and the elephant. One can investigate a tiny bit thoroughly and make conclusions which would not work either for the whole or even for the other part. But i totally can live with that and I do not think i need objectivity. However, we all now need the skills to be critical to the narratives we are consuming both historical and current. And I’d rather have critical thinking as a separate subject in schools instead of the national histories. Or alternatively, I would try to combine the critical thinking with the views on the world history. But that is ideal and it might equip the future citizens against the current national states. Also i do not think postmodernism (at least in historical studies as presented in this book) is to blame for the amount of fake information consumed as real facts. Rather I would blame our tendency to take for the true fact something which is just our belief; and our laziness or lack of time and skills to check for ourselves.This  has become the one of the longest i've ever written. And generally I do not like long s. It is always better to read the book, if you are interested in the issue. And I really recommend this one. However, below the main points I personally took from the book:- Europe has come to the writing of history relatively late. ""We can reasonably maintain that the relative delay of history writing in Europe stands out all the more when compared with certain achievements in China and the Muslim Arabic world before 15th century. Ibn Khaldun write his remarkable historical works in the 14th at the time when Christian Europe essentially wrote only chronicles of church history. Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Chinese and Hebrew antiquity chronicles were already written, but unfortunately lost. Until Renaissance the Europeans did not act as historians in any systematic way as the pagan scholars of antiquity had done.”- But since then Europeans have started actively appropriate the history of Antiquity and it was some magic continuity between the Europe in 15-16th century and the Greeks and the Romans. This has been continued more or less since then. Though there is no particular reasons to believe the people of Antiquity found present Europe even geographically central to their mentality. “The thesis that sees the Graeco-Roman era as prelude to Europe has been, and continue to be, a doubtful appropriation of a time that in fact never belonged to the Europeans, but which over the centuries has become a ‘natural’ element of their identity. The stranglehold of the West on this symbolic capital (to the detriment of all other civilisations) is not devoid of flattery and self glorification. The History of Europe has thus been made much longer and richer than it is, and ‘white’ mythistory in which philosophy, mathematics, science, theatre, democracy, civil society and the state were born- and much else besides.”- The majority of the historians between the Antiquity and the 19th centuries were representative of the rich, and respectively educated elite. He has got the list of the famous historians from Herodotus to Gibbon with their social and occupational background to support this fact. Therefore, their accounts rarely could be relied on to represent the “silent majority” (especially their thoughts and views). So this past would likely stay silent forever. Already in recent times some historians have tried to write “micro-histories” of the ordinary people through the documents left by the Inquisition or court records. The most famous of them are: The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller, Montailou, The Cheese and the Worms, The return of Martin Guerre. He admires these accounts but underlines their limitations - due to the sources they cannot represent accurately their subjects. - In the 19th centuries two tendencies coincide (or even they might be logically related) - the formations of the national states and the professionalisation of the history as a profession. The main influence of the period was historiography of Ranke, the German historian who established the pillars of the historical research and famously said that a historian should show “what actually happened”. Sand comments on the limitations of this approach: “Ranke should have written that he wanted to show what happened according to the archives that he had access to and those that he chose to search.” During the last century the historiography in Europe and the US (I can add in Russia) has become almost solely national. The historians kept themselves occupied investigating and writing the national histories (and presenting them as a result of science). At the same time the historians draw on the techniques of the contemporary realist literary tradition to present their findings. “Between 1820 to 1930 National historiography perfectly accomplished it’s mission. By creating various ‘historical pasts’, it enabled each individual French, German, Italian or English to know with certainty that the ancestors of their ancestors had always been French, German, Italian or English, and that their own nation-state was indeed the supreme and definitive culmination of these ‘ancient’ identities.”Sand convincingly claims that it “generally impossible with rare exceptions to create a stable permanent body of the citizens devoted to the state and respectful of its laws without a common language and without a unifying imaginary past (perhaps also without a war…).”. I think we have a lot of confirmations of this in our present. It is a very scary and powerful tool as the past by definition excludes many people who are presently living in the countries of the West. Or, often it does include them, but in the role which would not be glorifying. So those historical myths of the past’s glory help to unify some people against the other and deliver the political victories of a dubious nature. - In the later part of the book he s the historiography of the last half of the 20th century. He goes through the views of such prominent historians and philosophers like Bloch, Carr and Becker. Carl Becker was new for me with the very interesting view to what degree our individual memory resemble a general history “history proceeds in the selection of things which are pertinent to it.” So it is an illusion that fact speak for themselves’. As they are selected by history to tell the story. He also looks at Nietzsche as a harbinger of challenge to objectivity in the history writing which flourish in the last part of the 20th century. - This brings him to post-modernism. Rightly, imho, he does not talk about the post-modernism per se. He only talks about the post-modernism’s influence on what is the historiography. He narrows it down to the views of two practising historians: Hayden White, the American medievalist scholar who wrote “Metahistory”, and Paul Vayne, the French historian of antiquity, whose views got much less noted, but who wrote his book independently and earlier than White. Those historians underlined the role of the language in the history writing. According to Sand, both of these historians did not reject the existence of the historical facts or try to falsify them (contrary to what i’ve read in other critiques of post-modernism). However, they said that how those facts are connected is up to a historian. So historical causation is a part of “the plot” of the text prepared by the historian. Vayne was saying that the history is “a true novel”.  “It would be clearly foolish not to admit the existence of facts; that is ‘circumscribed events that happen independently of the investigator - subject. However, these facts possess no meaning in themselves, being no more than empty chronological series. There is no difference in principle between historical facts and physical ones, but radically distinguished by our ability to describe their interrelationships. Reconstruction of the causes of a historical events always forms an integral part of the plot.”The views of White are summarised by the Sand as follows: “the idea that historical narratives are verbal fictions that have nothing in common with scientific representations. The difference between history and literary is clear: contrary to the novelist, the historian is not entitled to present events and characters that did not appear in the past reality. The historian does not invent new facts he is always obliged to use the evidence he has noted and discoveries he has made. Fiction only appears on the fashioning the arrangement the attribution of meaning.”I have not read neither White not Vayne and not sure I plan to. But if their views are represented above correctly, i totally agree with them. And I developed a trust in Sand’s interpretation of the history as it coincides with my experience of reading history books and comparing it with the reality as i understand it. In the book Sands also questions White’s reduction of the narrative structures to just 4 styles and the applicability of the certain styles to certain factual material, especially tragic events. “Questions is set of events which we call extermination of Indians, African Slavs trade, mass murders in Europe devoid of any inherent meaning, so we might indifferently relate it ironically or satire? Does certain evidence not impose itself more than any other right from the phase of collective research?” He is also dealing extensively with two most popular defences of the traditional historians against the post-modernism. Overall he sees post-modernism as a symptom of the “cracks” in the historical profession, not the solution to its problems. “The question postmodernism leaves in suspense is it possible to seriously write a history that would not claim to be realistic and veridical?”.- Probably it is evident by now that Sands rejects “scientific objectivity” as a possibility to the history writing. He claims that, before even considering anything else, for the older periods it would be impossible as there is not enough factual material. And for the recent past the problem is opposite as it is too much and grows exponentially. So any historian would end up choosing the facts for his narrative. And it is also predetermined by the task a historian sets to himself at the beginning of the research. While writing this I feel like reducing a complex problem to something much more simple. He devotes the whole book to dealing with this. I’d rather pull one last quote. But the best way to understand his views and learn a lot more on the subject is to read the whole book.“All historical writing that is not aware that the actions and plots related do not coincide with past reality is potentially the bearer of a mythological dimension. It may well be a serious narrative full of references and quotations, distinguished by its “exactness” and abstaining from any polemic, yet it remains nonetheless that that belief of the author, whether naive or not, associates him or her with many propagators of myth history who continue to swell the tanks of discipline today. A living myth is not a lie; it is a story about the past or the future whose veracity cannot be established in a rational manner, yet that no-one can imagine rejecting. It remains valid, in the eyes of believers, until heretics succeed in refuting it. Even in this case, however, the belief is not necessary shaken; myths in fact tend to preserve themselves as long as they are needed, or else until other myths come along to replace them. In history all societies need myths to ensure their coherence and preserve their collective identity, in particular, that of elites that revolve around the sovereign power.” This book respectively poses the questions: is it possible to seriously write the history which does not claim to be objective? Is it possible to write the history which is not bound by the national rational? Which casts doubts and which is transparent about the views of a historian from the beginning? He cautiously thinks - yes, as far as i understood the book. He also think that it is possible that some of the next supra-narrative would appear as a result of the identity politics. We certainly see that in literature. In history, i think, it is not that mainstream yet.___________________________________________________________Quotes by Sand if not specified otherwise:""We study history to free ourselves from it.""""Any partitioning of time and space and any arbitrariness which selects sorts and organised the details of facts thereby giving them each time a different meaning.""""When the science is based on logical abstractions history sticks to concrete representations.""""Until compulsory education was instituted and military service generalised and until a new administrative apparatus was established that deeply penetrated the agricultural world, a large proportion of peasants still did not know that they were French;their identity and their political consciousness scarcely went beyond the limits of the province in which they lived and worked.""""Conceptualising the specificity of Shoah (Holocaust) only acceptable of there is awareness that this means arranging a series of events into a story that, by being partial, does not fully corresponds to the reality of the past.""""National state has got hold on collective memory though education and common language.""""The fine historian must have the power of coining the known into a thing never heard before and proclaiming the universal so simply and profoundly that the simple is lost in the profound, and the profound in the simple.

It included the burning of a deceased Rus in his ship with his horse and the one of his slave-girls. Apparently, it is a unique written third party account of such an event. Reading it, young Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park author) was so impressed that he later wrote ""The Eaters of the Dead"" which was turned into a Hollywood movie. The volume of enslaving of the local population and slave trade seems to be large as it mentioned almost in all accounts.

Gorgeous writing. It is amazing that someone could write such a novel aged 28. It is a wonderful book: unsentimental, moving, existential and visual. Gorgeous writing. It is amazing that someone could write such a novel aged 28. It is dubbed as “darkly comic”. But i did not feel it comic at all - melancholic, sometimes angry - yes. It is about a life of a man, Mr Biswas, trapped in the web of a large, matriarchal and very tightly controlled family which he does not seem to have a will to leave. It is about the life passing by, unnoticed; about small daily struggles which occasionally grow into something existential; and about the eternal question what one leaves behind when the life is over. Mr Biswas’s character is hardly likable; his occasional spouts of revolt look more like tantrums; his total inability to express love (assuming he feels it) comes across as pathetic. But somehow, by the end of the novel I felt I understood him better. During my childhood in the post-Soviet Ukraine I used to know men, belonging to the generation of my parents, who felt totally trapped within the families of their wives, who hated their position and dreamed about other life, but were not able to change anything. In their cases, they usually ended up drinking heavily. In this novel, Mr Biswas is arguably wiser. The novel is long, but I never felt it. It flows, and sometimes I was catching myself that i could not find the place to stop turning the pages. However, it splits into two parts. The first one is a fine example of realism about Mr Biswas early life and the Tulsi family he is married into. (I felt the family organisation bear an uncanny resemblance to a beehive but in a more sinister way.) The atmosphere of the family’s home is claustrophobic, domestic violence is a common place, the love is replaced by possessiveness. The second part of the novel is very different in a way how it is written. It focuses more on Anand, Mr Biswas only son. And, IMHO, it is the best example of auto-fiction 50 years before Knausgaard and the others made this genre a household name. And Trinidad, unknown to me before is playing bigger role in the second part of the novel: its urban parts, its nature and its villages. Naipaul has got a unique way of describing - he mixes the details of the surroundings with the feelings of his characters. The effect is a mirror of complicated interior turmoil with the exterior out there, very visual, almost like a film. “When he got to Green Vale it was dark. Under the trees it was night. The sounds from the barracks were assertive and isolated one from the other: snatches of talk, the sounds of frying, a shout, the cry of a child: sounds thrown up at the starlit sky from a place that was nowhere, a dot on the map of the island, which was a dot on the map of the world. The dead trees ringed the barracks, a wall of flawless black. He locked himself in his room.”Reading this novel I understood the origins of Naipaul personality with his often mysogynistic attitude to women, his quiet approval of the cast system (at least superior brahmanism), his desire to belong and his lack of loyalty to people who helped him. I would never be able to justify or to approve some of those things, but i can see how they were affected by his childhood and circumstances of his life. It is a very interesting and serious dilemma whether to consume the creative output of a very talented individual, whose views and deeds one does not approve. There is a lot written on the subject, especially recently. I think, it is the subject of a personal choice. And on this occasion, I am sure I will continue reading Naipaul novels. To finish, the words by Joan Didion: “The world Naipaul sees is of course no void at all; it is a world dense with physical and social phenomena, brutally alive with the complications and contradictions of actual human endeavour."" Quotes:Beautiful:""And like all other Christmas at Hanuman house, It had turned out to be only a series of anticipations.""""The house faced east, and the memories that remained of these first four years in Port of Spain were above all memories of morning. The newspaper, delivered free, still warm, the ink still wet, sprawled on the concrete steps, down which the sun was moving. Dew lay on tress and roofs; the empty street, freshly swept and washed, was in cool shadow, and water ran clear in the gutters whose green bases had been scratched and striped by the sweepers’ harsh brooms.

The city, populated by the Germans, Jews, Ukrainians and the Polish is buzzing with energy, but there is a certain unease foreshadowing the things to come.

They are wonderful in combining interesting historical insights with the maths per se, but on the level of a school program. I loved his ""Infinity"" book. This is as well extremely erudite and fascinating. e - is irrational number which is the basis of the natural logarithm. Sounds daunting, but one can think of this number as a basis for measuring rate of change in many processes involving so called exponential growth (the rate of growth is proportional to the current state of the system). It is very relevant nowadays while almost everything what matters grows exponentially including information, population, pollution etc.The book is not very technical at all. It explains underlying maths. But also talks about fascinating historical characters and anecdotes. To illustrate, I will just mention here one episode:As the story goes, the Calculus were ""discovered"" in the 17th simultaneously by Newton in England and Leibniz on the continent. Apparently, it was huge unresolved argument who hold the priority over this discovery. The majority of academy in England claimed it was Newton and that Leibniz has stollen his ideas after seeing some of the Newton's papers. This was severely rejected by the Leibniz's defenders on the continent. Nevertheless, Leibnitz's system of notation was more intuitive and easier to understand and apply.""Knowledge of the calculus has become the dominating mathematical topic of the 18th century and quickly spread throughout the Continent. In England, where it originated, the calculus fared less well. Newton's towering figure discouraged British mathematicians from pursuing the subject with vigor. Worse, by siding completely with Newton in the priority dispute, they cut themselves off from developments on the Continent. The stubbornly stuck to Newton's dot notation, failing to see the advantages of Leibniz's differential notation. As a result, over the next hundred years, while mathematics flourished in Europe as never before, England did not produce a single first-rate mathematician.

It is a story of the one human being facing the turmoil of the 20th century in the region. It might not possess the Pasternak’s musicality of the language or the complexity of his love story. But it is at least as powerful in respect of historicity of the time and space; its impact on an individual. It is told in a form of a meta-narrative. A journalist has been contracted to write a book about the famous local composer who has been murdered during the American occupation of Iraq. The text we are reading is a mixture of this book and the reflections of the journalist on the past and present of the Middle East. He visits Iraq from Lebanon and stays in the Green Mile for his investigation. His language, elegant and thoughtful without unnecessary gloss made me stop and think many times during my reading. It was refreshing to read about the Iraq post-war from the perspective a writer from the Middle East. His observations of the clash of the cultures during the occupation and it is far from the self-evident. For example:“That’s always some misunderstanding. The translators who are mostly graduates of English or American literature, think American soldiers and officers will have some knowledge of literature and culture. But when they discover that those Americans are illiterate in every sense, it leads to friction. The Americans, for their part, believe everyone is ignorant or illiterate, and are then shocked to find that these people know more about their own culture than they do. While the Iraqis who used to think Americans would know who Walt Whitman and John Steinbeck were, now realise they are only a bunch of ignoramuses whose knowledge is limited to porn mags and sports news. Thats how the conflict starts.”He also very vividly depicts the mood in Iraq’s elite early at Sadam’s era:“Amjad believed that the Arab nation had an immortal message, which was the spiritual development of the world. The statement made Kemal burst into laughter. Kamal found i mind-blogging that this talented artist could be a convinced Baathist and an extremist Iraqi, who read Nietzsche and Fichter and admired Chamberlain, especially his book The Foundations of the 19th century. Amjad also read the literature of the Baath party influenced by Gustave Le Bon’s ideas that race and nation were identical. Amjad believed that Arbs where surrounded by inferior races who were created for barbarity and savagery. Kemal wasn’t capable of making fun of these ideas because he was scared. But he realised that nationalist ideology in Baghdad gave the oppressed people a sense of false grandeur and led them to believe that Iraq stood alone and isolated…. Martyrdom therefore was a necessity.”As far as the main narrative is concerned, the protagonist is assuming 3 very different identities during the course of his long life. He was born as a Jew, then became a Shia Muslim and lived in Iran and, later assumed the role of a Sunny Muslim in Iraq. The strongest part of this novel for me was the author’s reflections on what is identity. Early at the narrative, the young Yousef, a Jew, a talented musician, is trying to rebel against how other people define him:”Do not put me in a tight corner, do not place me in a little box. When you treat me like a Jew, you suffocate me.” … As a Jew, Yousef was required to play the role of a Jew and wear the Jewish mask, in the same way that Muslims and Christians had to play their respective roles and wear their respective masks. Masks make it easy for individuals to live in society. Rejecting the mask made the artist an alien forever, even through music, art and beauty refused to narrow the individual into a role. Yourself was a stranger to everything around him. Everybody urged him to conform to his role. But he wished only to conform to music, for music had no religion.”But later he surrenders: “But he had to wear a mask, because the mask made it possible for him to regain his self-confidence. It calmed his fears, expelled his demons and quelled the violent cries in the depths of his heart, the depths that told of hell.” Moreover, he goes much farther than any of us would go and physically recreates himself as another person changing the name, his wife, likely even his system of beliefs… He manages to have 3 lives instead of one...However the author warns:“We must not forget ourselves entirely, even if we surrender to a role we’ve invented, even when it is incompatible with our personalities, because we have chosen to play a role. But I see that others, instead of playing their roles, are played by them...We often imagine that we control the game unaware that it actually controls us. We often imagine that we uphold values contrary to those we were raised to uphold. But in truth we are only surrendering to them.”Quotes:Constructing identity: “Kemal life shows that identity is always closely allied to a narrative standpoint. A life is a story that is fabricated, formalised or narrated at a completely random moment, a localised historical instant when others turn into the “other” into strangers, foreigners and even outcasts. The story of this artist shows that identity is a process of adaptation; no sooner has in located itself in one particular historical moment that it changes into a different moment. All these imaginary communities begin with a fabricated invented narrative which denies that identities blend.""Iran and Iraq preparing for the war:""Both word and image were debased. Iraq used images to create impact by presenting the thronging crowds raising their hands mechanically and shouting. The revolution depended on the image of the masses. Iran on the other hand, turned popular phrases into poetry and vulgarity verse… There was anarchy in both countries. Each confronted the other with an artificial system that was eloquent and ridiculous. Pure chaos merged with raucous anarchy and old romantic babble. Each country went back to its heritage. Arab Baghdad went back to poetry and words, to spellbinding rhetoric that Arabs mastered. It went back to the undiminished magical power of prose, but with an additional strain of chaos and obscurantism. It was like being lulled to sleep by words without meaning.""...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 26, 2018","Aug 08, 2018","Jun 26, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17301671-the-tobacco-keeper

She talks to the anthropologies and thinks about what her language means to her:""They will never know that in her language there were more than a dozen ways of indicating and describing gratitude. Here are a few more: the gratitude of natural things for one another, like the hive for the branch, the tree for the bees, the cloud for the sun; collective gratitude, the thanks of a family or a town or a people; gratitude—directed to the cosmos—for superiority, for knowing that one is better than everybody else; the gratitude of one saved from death by starvation.Her language boasted many verbs for which no simple equivalents exist in the common language. For example, this means to be afraid of seeing time pass. This means to tell stories in the depths of winter. This is the action of stirring a kind of gravy in a pot; this also denotes the motion of a pig rooting around in the mud. This refers to the way light splinters against a range of mountains at dusk. This describes in one word how mountains gain mass and shape at dawn. This means to feel strange in an unfamiliar place. This means to be patient for spring. As does this.

There is a wedding and all the family is gathering for the final photograph. But the brother of the bride, the single son of this family is missing.

There is a big presence of religion in the novel. But again it somehow makes the book more rather then less universal. The plot plays very little role, it is not a “family saga taking place on the background of historic changes”.

It is a mixture of a thriller with the tour de force of linguistics and literary theories. Binet picked up the year 1980, took real famous people and real events and has built a fictional plot around them. He also created two main fictional characters for the connection between his plot and the rest. The book effortlessly mixes real ideas in linguistics with the fictional actions by the characters (both the invented and and the real ones). The premise is intriguing: what if Roland Barthes has been murdered and robbed of an important text he possessed. (In reality, he died after the road accident). The text would help the owner to exercise an enormous power of rhetorics through the 7th function of language. A French detective and his chosen side-kick, young lecturer of semiology are there to investigate. The intellectuals, Barthes friends and colleagues, are the main suspects; the high level politicians are after this text as well obviously. How? Binet’s language is concise. The book reads as a reportage, as if Binet is commenting on a football match. But it strangely suitable. He does a lot of weird and cruel things with his characters; but he never distorts or interpret their real theories. I appreciated this a lot as it was my main point of interest in the book. A part of the plot was inspired by Fight Club. The difference is that the fighting is rhetoric debates. But the consequences are really dire as well. Some episodes in the novel seemed too “laddish” for my liking with usual suspects of sexual prowess, drugs and mutilations of different sorts. But it was not too excessive, just enough for me to continue enjoying other things in the book. Overall I did not care too much for the plot. It reminded me The Savage Detectives where Bolano did the trick better (imho). But I loved the linguistics parts and finding out about the French intellectuals and American scholars of that time. I did not know for example, that there was such a war between the continental and analytical schools of philosophy. I am glad I found out about it in such a playful form, otherwise it would be too depressing. It is not a pre-requisite, but i think some prior knowledge and/or some interest in linguistics and semiotics would amplify the reading experience. A few words about the intellectual tradition. The French intellectuals used to be celebrities. They appeared in newspapers and TV programs. People knew their faces and listen to their opinions. I do not know about all the countries, but certainly in Russia and Turkey for example it was similar (only through unofficial channels due to the censorship). A Russian poet Yevtushenko famously said “A poet in Russia is much more than a poet”. I know also that in Spain many prominent writers maintain the column in the national newspapers. I do not know how it compares with the Kardashians or ex-factor. Unfortunately, this phenomena is almost absent in the English speaking word. I do not know the reasons for this, but it is a pity. Binet laughs at the French Intellectuals. He teases them, but he is proud of them (some english-speaking readers have only noticed the former, but not the latter); he admires their thought and defends them. He takes their ideas seriously. He definitely do not consider them “clowns” - the term used in some videos I’ve seen and ers I’ve read about these thinkers.“The world changes because intellectuals and those in powers at war with each other. The powerful win almost every battle, and the intellectuals pay with their lives or their freedom for having stood up to the powerful, and they bite the dust. But not always. And when an intellectual triumphs over the powerful, even posthumously, then the world changes. A man earns the name of intellectual when he gives voice to the voiceless.”It is a pity that currently the intellectual tradition seems to be moving to the right politically.

I took huge number of ideas from this little book. Here I would just stress one thing: everyone knows Barthes's ""the Death of the author"". But he also rejected the role of the story in the fiction. I never understood this dominating conviction, especially in the english speaking word, that people are able to see the world predominantly through the narrative (with its arch): a good book should tell the story; even a good image apparently should tell the story. I never think this way by myself. So it was quite refreshing that Barthes did not as well:""Barthes saw in his ‘rejection of story, anecdote, psychology of motivation, and signification of objects’ a powerful questioning of our ordering of experience. Since . . . things are buried under the assorted meanings with which men, through sensibilities, through poetry, through different uses, have impregnated the name of each object, the novelist’s labour is in a sense cathartic: he purges things of the undue meaning men ceaselessly deposit upon them. How? Obviously by description. Robbe-Grillet thus produces descriptions of objects sufficiently geometrical to discourage any induction of poetic meaning and sufficiently detailed to break the fascination of the narrative.

While working on the translation of Barthes’s “The preparatKate Briggs has created a wonderful case study about the experience of translating a text. While working on the translation of Barthes’s “The preparation of the novel”, she explores the translation as a cultural phenomena, a craft, a profession and, yes, an art. The book is called “A little art” as a quote from Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter , a translator of The Magic Mountain. Briggs follows her work in this book as well as the relationship between Andre Gide and Dorothy Bussy his English translator of 30 years (the writer by herself and also apparently the lover of E. M. Foster). In this essay, we also find out a lot about the text Briggs is working on and Barthes himself.Briggs shows us what she is thinking and how is she going about the process of translation. For example, to get closer to the text she decides to read everything Barthes was reading while working on his lectures. It is evident how the original text and its author shapes her thoughts even in her daily life. She uses the verb “to write” i.e. “writing a translation” rather than translating. This implies that to translate one need to be a skilful writer by herself. In fact, she mentions many example of the prominent writers and thinkers who were translating the works from other languages. For example, a famous Russian poet, the Nobel laureate, Boris Pasternak translated a lot of Shakespeare, Goethe and Rilke among others; Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak translated ‘Of Grammology” a huge work by Derrida almost straight after it was published. She wanted the English speaking world to read it as soon as possible and thought she is best placed to write a translation. According to Briggs, Javier Marias, said he would rather put aspiring writers to translate major literary works instead of trying to teach them creative writing.Another theme is never-ending debate between the supporters of literal translation versus imaginative use of the language the work is being rendered into. Apparently, Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter was severely criticised posthumously for the mistakes and interpretations made in her translation. The debate was so heated that her daughters felt the need to support her position with some of her personal letters. But her translation was very well received by the public and it is still in print. I am aware of another recent controversy around Deborah Smith translating “TheVegetarian” https://www.theguardian.com/books/boo.... I am personally of course for creativity, as soon as the general intention of the original is still there. But sometimes, I read something in English translated from Russian and I seriously wonder about the translator’s decision. The recent example is Chekhov’s Драма на Охоте ( literary “Drama during the hunting”). The title is pointing towards a dramatic accident, namely the murder which takes place during the hunting. And this title was rendered as “The Shooting party”. Why?Biggs essay is much wider than the process of translation per se. She muses on writing and reading in general: “The reading offers us occasions for inappropriate improbable identification.”  And, what is more valuable: decoding the words or the time when we raise our heads from the page for a moment and look into the space?For those of us who speak more than one language at home raising bilingual family or use many languages at work, the translation is a daily life as well as a daily magic. This book is giving a wonderful insight into this magic. In my view, the literature in translation enormously enriches and even shapes the literature of the country-recipient.

I liked “Lincoln in Bardo”, the last year Man Booker Winner. And I really like this. It is a wonderful book. It is a novel-kaleidoscope, structured through the fragments of the text, not linearly related, but while combined, the whole picture is shining trough. This concept has been used before. I am surprised no-one compares her work to Milorad Pavić or even Daša Drndić. In her case she uses this vehicle to think about the modern travel. How it affect us, how it adds additional transience to our existence. For many of us, quite a chunk of our life takes place in the planes, airports and other places which are not our home. We seems to be constantly on the move. Do we try to escape from something? do we try to find our destination? or do we simply do not have a choice?The book is like a map of a person’s destinations - each little text is the place. Like in real life, you would come back to some of those places. At this case, there is connection between the texts and also it would be some places you visit only once. But it could remind you about the other destination without the obvious reason. She calls these clusters of related texts “constellations” like on the night sky. And I think, in many cases each reader would find different “constellations” which resonate with her the most. But the author also gives you hints in the text which help you to see the connections are there.She is fascinated with the state of transit from one place to another and how it affects human psyche - airports, buses, Moscow metro, planes - all states of being on the move, or rather being moved without actually moving yourself. I traveled extensively for work and i totally could relate to her fascination. After a while, it is those transit places is the only thing you notice and remember. The places, landmarks and cities blur into one big colourful, but unintelligible mess. But you remember who was sitting next to you on the plane, the desire to arrive; you remember the different airports - they look the same only to people who does not travel that much. You remember fascination with the strangers and realisation that you would not see those people ever again. Her observations and stories could be very analytical but could be extremely lyrical. I was very moved by one story when she describes the come back to a place left behind long time ago. The place which her heroine called home once. She does not think about this city much, she does not regret leaving, but the thing which comes to her mind still, the thing she misses is an image of a deep puddle with the rainbow colours left by a petrol stain. Quite similarly, when i think about my home town, i think about the cracks in hot pavement in the summer, the smell of asphalt and the lonely dandelion sticking its head between the cracks…And she never afraid of the female perspective. Every word in this book tells you it is written by a woman. And the woman who understand her place in the world at that. Another main preoccupation of the author is the human body, our internal map as an analogy of a geographic map. During the course of her travels, she does not visit the art museums, instead she prefers anatomy theatres and health museums. And she weaves the history of exploration of the human body into her little stories. This was not my favourite bit: she goes quite naturalistic sometimes. But i think i understand where she is coming from. A few words on the title. ""Bieguni"" - in Polish mean “the poles” (such as in North and South Pole). There is also Beguni - the Russian sect if 19th century who believed if one stop moving one would be possessed by the devil. They seem to appear in the novel's story set in Moscow. There is the school of thought beguni together with old believers’ sects have inspired the Russian revolutionaries. So there is a whole bunch of meanings in the title. Why “Flights” in English?Call it serendipity, but i think it is just a coincidence, that i’ve recently read two books by the English female authors Break.up (mediation on travel) and Sight(the human body and its dissection from the historical perspective plays a substantial part). There are some similarities between these books, definitely in the subject matter. For example, both Walsh and Tokarzcuk mention Stendhal's syndrome. But Tokarczuk manages to sparkle the match and made a fire for me a few times. While both Walsh and Greengrass made me think a lot, but left me emotionally unperturbed. This novel really got under my skin. When i finished it, i felt as if I am saying good bye to an sensitive and intelligent friend..........I've read in Russian, so below are some quotes in Russian""Почему, уже достигнув достойного положения, не рассказывал о своем пути всем и каждому? Полагаю, что молчание его объясняется твердым убеждением, верой, в которой отец, быть может, не признавался даже самому себе: если поскорее стереть из памяти болезненные факты, они поблекнут и перестанут мучить нас, а мир сделается лучше. Что если люди не узнают, на какую чудовищную жестокость способен человек по отношению к ближним своим, они сумеют сохранить душевную чистоту.""""Она не поехала в общежитие, где жила когда-то. Честно говоря, все ее здесь отталкивало. Она вдруг удивилась: и почему люди так охотно, по собственной воле, никем не принуждаемые навещают места своей молодости? Что можно там найти, в чем убедиться? Что они здесь были? Или что правильно поступили, уехав? А может, они надеются, что педантичная память о местах юности уподобится замку-«молнии», соединит прошлое с будущим в единую устойчивую плоскость — металлическим швом, зубчик к зубчику.""""Новый тип интеллекта, подумала Карен. Не доверяющий цитатам из книг, из самых лучших учебников, исследований, монографий и энциклопедий — отравленный учебой и теперь страдающий отрыжкой. Развращенный легкостью разложения на составные части любой, даже самой сложной конструкции. Сведением к абсурду любой непродуманной аргументации, меняющейся каждые несколько лет модой на «самый современный» дискурс, который — подобно последней разрекламированной модели перочинного ножика — умеет делать всё со всем: открывать консервы, чистить рыбу, интерпретировать романы и предсказывать развитие политической ситуации в Центральной Африке. Это интеллект любителя шарад, интеллект, с легкостью, словно ножом и вилкой, оперирующий сносками и комментариями. Интеллект рациональный и дискурсивный, одинокий и стерильный. Всё осознающий — в том числе и то, как мало он способен постичь, но удивительно мобильный — ловкий, умный электронный импульс, не знающий ограничений, объединяющий все со всем, убежденный, что всё вместе имеет некий — неведомый нам — смысл.""...more",Notes are private!,0,29,2,"May 31, 2018May 31, 2018","Jun 02, 2018not set","May 31, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33301104-flights

So-caIt is the first novel I’ve read by Olga Tokarzchuk and I’ve read it in Ukrainian - the closest to the original Polish from the languages I know. So-called ironic detectives were very popular in Eastern Europe in the 90s. It was sort of sub-genre normally written by a woman with a female protagonist investigating a certain mystery. But the main feature in those books was their ability to make you laugh out loud and their reading accessibility. I remember my favourite books from this genre were by a Polish writer Joanna Chmielewska.I think what Tokarzchuk is doing in this novel is taking the form and using it for more profound purpose: dealing with the serious issues which affect us all but ensuring she reaches a wider audience. The main character and the one who tells the story is a middle-aged eccentric, but instantly likable lady Yanina Duzheyko. She is retired English teacher leaving in a small village in a very picturesque part of Poland on the border with Chezch republic. She lives alone but she has got a small number of friends who are very distinctive people struggling to fit into society or comply with prevailing social norms. But i would not call them misfits - they are just little different, have a tender and unprotected souls. For example, Dionisiy, her former pupil and now grown up man, who works for the local police’s IT dept, but spends his free time translating William Blake. And Yanina helps him at that… In parallel with these idealistic surroundings and pastimes, a series of murders start to happen… But if you look for a thrilling mystery, i do not think it is the main point here. It is more about one person rebellation against the existing world order. It is about challenging the superiority of people above other creatures. It is about our place as a human beings in the world. In a strange way it reminded me The Vegetarian. The style and the way how story is told could not be more different. But the pathos and the values of these two books are certainly shared. This zeitgeist of ecology as vehicle for reconsidering our place in the world is certainly penetrating the literature internationally. There is another recent novel The Overstory by Richard Powers which apparently talks about the power of trees. (I have not read it yet).Another theme is indoctrination of young children into some powerful ideology. It’s used to be communism, now it’s Catholicism in Poland. The novel depicts it in a quite scary way. Overall, the novel takes clear anticlerical stand. I could see how the author could anger the church: she compiles the speech by a cleric in the novel (quite off-putting) from the real speeches of this sort. I do not know why people mention magic realism. I have not notice any magic realism. There are certainly some elements of mysticism with Yanina’s trust in astrology for example. It is a typical eastern european, erudite and poignant little novel which effortlessly mixes Blake, astrology, entomology and many other things; it talks about very serious issues, but does it in a accessible way. Some quotes:“All complicated human psyche has developed in order not to let a human being to comprehend what she sees in reality”“Each thing one can believe in is the certain image of reality”“People could understand only what they imagine themselves.”...more",Notes are private!,1,76,1,"May 26, 2018","May 31, 2018","May 26, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36609308-drive-your-plow-over-the-bones-of-the-dead

AnIve recently read a few books by the English female authors experimenting with non-narrative structure of their novels (Sight, Kudos to name some). And I am really glad this trend seems to be developing in English-writing universe. It is refreshing that some writers dare to step aside from the storytelling and the plots, so much loved in English-speaking world, for the sake of concepts, ideas and self-expression. And, in my limited experience, they tend to be female. Break.up is my first acquaintance with Joanna Walsh and it is her first novel. She is the editor of an on-line magazine and she wrote 2 collections of the short stories before. In this novel, the narrator travels between European cities escaping from the break up of her virtual relationship. The novel is structured around each city she visits while she reflects on the different subjects from boredom to a possibility of a story without a beginning or end. Almost each paragraph of her writing is juxtaposed with a quote from the modern thinkers varied from Michel Foucault to Gayatri Chalravorty Spivak. It seems, the author is inviting the reader to a conversation between the thinker and the narrator. She generally tries to keep the reader involved and even directly addresses her/him a few times in the duration of the book.In general, I think the book has got its inspiration in French literature, especially in Nadja. Though, i would not call it surreal in the content. But the form definitely similar. The text is accompanied by the small photographs taken during the trip and they are framed in a similar fashion as Breton’s pictures in “Nadja”. I really appreciated the photos as a quirky and relevant complement to the text.I liked her transgressions. One thing which did not work totally for me is her preoccupation with the broken relationship. In spite of the narrator’s taking time discussing the roots of her adoration for this man, I could not see what attracted her in him. And the feelings were depicted too cerebral for me to relate to them. Overall it is the book of thinking. I will borrow the one of the quote included in book: “You now begin to see how this lady is: she goes on thinking at all times. She won’t simply cry, she will ask what crying consists in. One tear, one argument: that’s how her life goes on” (Martha Nussbaum) That would perfectly describe the narrator and the book as a whole. I bet some people would find it pretentious. It would be probably inevitable discussion whether it is a novel. But I found it fresh and thought provoking if slightly lacking in raw emotions. But then, should they be everywhere in the female writing? Even if it is about love…...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 17, 2018","May 29, 2018","May 17, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36360626-break-up

From the first page we understand that the main protagonist is a woman who might be Kathy Acker (a feminist icon who died in 1997) or might be the other woman who lives in 2017. Or more likely, it is the woman who strongly identifies with Kathy Acker to the point of not making the difference. It is a very hard premise to deliver in the narrative. And I found the execution interesting, but very confusing.  ""Crudo"" means ""raw"" in Spanish. 'Raw"" in English might mean two things - visceral, strong and undisguised emotions; or unprocessed, uncooked. I guess, the intention by the author was to imply both meanings: the first one - for Kathy's (or the woman-2017's) personal struggles (getting married, finding attachment difficult, fighting cancer); and the second meaning - Kathy's relation to the ""raw"" news stream in August-September 2017. And if the author partially succeed in the first instance, the second is totally unconvincing for me. It is more or less the list of selected news items with the commentary on the level ""Kathy felt sick"" or confused or annoyed. Ali Smith's Seasons' Quartet comes to mind as it deals with the very current political events as well. But there is powerful imagination in the way how she renders these events in spite of their immediacy. Unfortunately, I have not felt it in this book. And the last thing which spoiled my impression of this book was a comment about ""a profile in American magazine about a novelist"" and then it was a verbatim which appeared to be the profile in New Yorker about Rachel Cusk. ( I googled). ""What especially annoyed her (Kathy) was a comparison between the novelist's latest book and an oral history of Chrenobyl. ... Kathy found nuclear war a considerably more seemly subject than nuclear families. Kathy was avant-garde, middle-class-in-flight, Kathy did not like the bourgeoisie"" (!!!) Well, I like Cusk and especially the trilogy. And i am not sure I share this pathos and why Cusk was singled out by Kathy... Kathy in meantime is not against of enjoying a vacation in a very rich villa somewhere in Italy or employing "" three Romanians men, boys really"" to clean her windows. I am grateful to the author for bringing my attention to Kathy Acker whom I did not know before and whose whole life seems to be an act of art. I really admire Olivia Laing's non-fiction writing.

It is the one of the best waltz i knowOn Youtube, I came across on the fragment of the movie I knew since my childhood with breathtaking Waltz music. It is the one of the best waltz i know, including Strauss or Shostakovich. The movie is loosely based on Chekhov’s short novel. I’ve seen it many year ago, but, I’ve realised, I’ve never read the novel. So I’ve read it now. It is wonderful. It is the one of longer works by Chekhov (he did not leave any proper novel and preferred the short form). It feels surprisingly modern: it is structured as a longish novella packed within a short story. And I did not know anyone used the footnotes meaningfully in fiction before David Foster Wallace 100 years later. Chekhov does it here. Also it reminded me Nabokov’s “Pale Fire”. May be some people would find the comparison a bit far-fetched, but Nabokov loved Chekhov (while he hated Dostoyevsky and many others Russian writers).I would not talk here about the plot, or the characters, or the language. Suffice to say, it is Chekhov at his best plus a bit of a twist, which I think is not usual for him. I do not know why they translate the title as “Shooting party”. In Russian it literary means “ A drama during the hunting”. It is quite a bit of a difference. So I am not sure how well the rest is translated. But I really recommend it if you like Russian literature.Btw, this is the Waltz:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mSHQ...По-русскиУдивительно, насколько Чехов умеет создать второстепенные персонажи!

And he sort of gets the feeling that what he can’t describe might be the true reality. “This is the last part of Rachel Cusk’s experimental trilogy. It is the most dense - i could not read it fast and was stoping often to think about a sentence, the idea behind it. But it is simply brilliant! It is the most rewarding of the three novels (“Outline” and “Transit” are another two). I do not know the real reasons she called it “Kudos”, but at this case, it seems to me justifiably self-referential.Unlike ""Transit"" which was centred around more practical observations and domestic affairs, she moves this novel to the discussions of abstract ideas. She does this using her special form developed for the trilogy. And here, she hints why her approach to the form, she thinks, is so effective as a vehicle for conveying intimate as well as philosophic thoughts. So what is the form? Her protagonist, Faye, also a writer, just listens to different people she meets in the course of short periods of time. Sometimes she asks a question, sometimes she replies to a question. But her direct presence in the text is minimal. The readers find out the same stuff about Faye’s interlocutors as she does. Or so it seems at the first glance. She dismisses with the idea of a narrative with the plot arch, composition, characters; and floats in the emptied space within the voices of those people revealing their ideas or personal experiences. I would not even call it “their stories” because, deliberately, they do not have a familiar narrative structure. They go deeper not wider.People try to see the pattern between the events and then, try to connect them into the story. Sometimes, you create a “narrative not to connect things together in meaningful way but unburden yourselves off guilt or responsibility.” But it is pretty obvious that Cusk thinks this inclination takes people away from the truth into their own constructed reality. Therefore, she quite often uses children or animals who do not have this developed sense of narrating. As a result, their words reflect something real more accurate.Cusk often plays with the word “mirror”, “surface” or “reflection”. When one listens to the other person speaking, one would take out of this conversation what he finds either familiar, or shocking or something he would relate to. Therefore, in spite of not directly talking Faye’s personality and her views are very present as being “reflected” in the monologues we read in the book. One of the characters says that while reading Faye’s own work “He has been made to believe he could assume the power of narrator. Usually the novel has the opposite effect on him.” And that what i felt as well. I saw myself reflected in those people relating their thoughts.Her text is this respect is very visual. I take a lot of photos. Photography develops the discipline to “frame” the reality from continuity into the series of the visual discrete fragments (shots). And when I walk along the streets, I catch the glimpses of conversations, momentarily expressions on unfamiliar faces, gestures, colours. All of it is a surface, I do not have time or desire to process it verbally. But there is a picture building inside corresponding to this surface. The same i feel about her prose.Coming back to the novel, she uses this form, among other things, to talk about the feeling that in our times everything we consider new is coming out of some “combustion” - using and reusing something which was there already. One could look bleakly at this as the one of the boys in the book (in the words of his dad):“The forthcoming destruction had now been earned in full by humanity and that even if it meant the lives of his generation weren’t allowed to run their full course it would be for the best. Every time he thought of future he had to remind himself that this sense of his own story was just an illusion because not enough was left any more for another story: enough time, enough material, enough authenticity. Everything’s had been used up.”Or one could search for something positive in it. She comes back in many conversations to the meaning and the purpose of literature:“The work of art could not ultimately be negative: Its material existence, its status as an object could not help but be positive, a gain an addition to the sum of what was.” The novel poses the question “is there a third kind of honesty (in literature) to which no moral bias could be ascribed that is interested neither in debunking nor in reforming, that has no compass on its own and can describe evil as dispassionately as virtue without erring on the side of one or the other, that is pure and reflective as water or glass.”  In other words, could literature be free from trying to convey a personal point of view of the author? Or the author should try to attempt objectivity? It is a very interesting question which i am still thinking about. Is it desirable? Is the author’s view the reason for reading books? But it is certainly opening the whole new layer of the meaning of literature for me.They also discuss the impact of commercial publishing and internet communities on the literature and the authors. She asks could “a reverse kind of snobbery” of assigning to Dante ""1 star"" on a social media be a positive thing. But eventually, “the whole global enterprise (of commerce in publishing) could be gone in an instant leaving the small rock of authentic literature where it always was.”Another big theme for her is separation. In the previous books it was considered more in the context of a private life phenomena. But at this novel, it is taken to the public sphere as well - Brexit. In a very rare direct speech Faye says ”It was true that the question of whether to leave or remain was one we usually asked ourselves in private, to the extent that it could almost be said to constitute the innermost core of self-determination. If you were unfamiliar with the political situation in our country, you might think you were witnessing not the machinations of a democracy but the final surrender or personal consciousness into the public domain.”There are many more challenging discussions in this slim volume: justice; the place of personal freedom; identity and history; the view of the English in the eyes of the Continent (often not very flattering); feminism, the view of the men by the women and the difference between male folk in the South of the continent (“Here men tribe is defined through a fear of women combined with an utter dependence on them”) and the English one (deprived from their mums early due to boarding schools and searching for them ever since). One thing Cusk did not dispose off is the setting of the novel. Her sense of place is perfect and the details she choses to share are extremely enjoyable. The novel is set in two not named cities in Europe. I wonder why she does not name them. Zadie Smith in her recent novel “Swing time” did not mention the name of the African country her story took place as well. I guess, the intention is for the reader to take the ownership of the text and work it out. In the case of Cusk, it is very easy. And her controlled use of the descriptive language is delightful. And the last thing i want to say about this text - silences. It leaves out much more than it says. Again, it is very visual - creating a negative space in a painting could be very powerful… But creating a negative space with the words takes it to a totally different level: “bells on the town’s many churches, striking not just the hours but the quarter- and half-hours, so that each segment of time became a seed of silence that then blossomed, filing the air with what almost seemed a kind of self-description.”...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"May 09, 2018","May 16, 2018","May 09, 2018",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35961705-kudos

But I do not think she is so naive. She is just very sincere and honest with herself. Whether you would like or hate this book comes down to whether you could relate to her experiences and her view on life. I certainly could as I remember my student days and i knew at least two girls like she was. I by myself was not far. For example, she does not understand what people find in drinking.

Just a small example, inside the Hungarian train “it smelled like human condition”. Also she is very interested in the language per se. She studies Russian, and Hungarian, she speaks Turkish and attends the linguistics classes. And she thinks about the role a particular language plays in defining our thoughts and personality.

It is timeless in spite off being put into the proper historical context. It considers the one of those eternal questions of the human nature. And it is doing so in an original, unique way. The first observation that struck me at the beginning is how Roth frames his story. How he embeds the writer (Nathan Zukerman) as a fictional character, into the book to create exactly the novel we are reading. From two encounters and scarce factual information, Nathan Zukerman sits down to re-imagine the life story of a real man, who used to be the role model and the hero of his childhood. So, from the beginning of main story we know that it is not totally true even within the context of the novel. “Writing turns you into somebody who’s always wrong. The illusion that you may get it right someday is perversity that draws you on.” The main part of the novel is created through the consciences of a fictional writer. Why is it important? Because It shows the process of creation embedded in the real life. And it is very effective in blurring the distinction between the reality and the fiction. And the main story. It is simple and powerful. The Swede is everything which people called “American dream”. He is 3rd generation American, gifted sportsman, extremely likable, loves his country, his family and his life. He always tries to think about other people while making decisions. He works hard to deserve his success, but the life treats him well. That is until one day, when his 16 year old daughter decides to become a terrorist and blows up a shop, kills an innocent man and disappears. She does it in 1968 in protest against the Vietnam War. That is all. The rest of the book he is trying to understand why? What did he do wrong? He goes through the circles, probes different rational and irrational explanations what made the terrorist out of his child. He cannot find the answer, but in the process he sees much more that he used to notice around him, and his “American Pastoral” is slowly but inevitably disintegrates in front of his eyes. “He had learned the worst lesson that life can teach - it makes no sense. And when that happens the happiness is never spontaneous again. It is artificial and even then bought at the price of an obstinate estrangement from oneself and ones history.”I think, this novel is even more contemporary today than it was 20 years ago while it was written. We’ve seen the waves of terrorism around the world. I was about to write “motivated by the radical version of islam”. But it is much more complicated than that. And the majority of those terrorists where born and raised to the families in the West who, ironically, moved here to ensure the best future for their children. Some of them many generations ago. These families faced the same tortures of guilt, incomprehension and shame. Metaphorically, and not only, the whole society faces the same question: how is it possible that some young people find the murder as justifiable means for their purposes (even if it is idealistically honourable as it seems to them). Also there is a question whether to cooperate with the authorities. What is better for the child involved? It is an unlikely comparison, but Kamila Shamsie is dealing with the similar dilemma in her recent novel Home Fire. There are many transgressions in this novel starting from the manufacturing process of gloves and finishing with the riots in New Jersey at the late 60s. Roth enjoys his writing process and he seems to not care much whether the reader would follow him all the way. Sometimes i felt slight impatient with him. Also, I think some people on the left of the political spectrum might find some of his observations not totally palatable. But fundamentally, it is a masterfully written novel about the human nature: “The tragedy of the man not set up for tragedy that is every man’s tragedy.”Quotes:There is no protest to be lodged against loneliness not all the bombing campaign in history have made a dent in it.That people were manifold creatures didn’t come as a surprise to the swede, even if it was a bit of a shock to realise it anew when someone let you down. What was astonishing to him was how people seemed to run out of their own being run out of whatever the stuff was that made them who they were and, drained of themselves, turn into the sort of people they would once have felt sorry for....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Apr 24, 2018",May 2018,"Apr 24, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11650.American_Pastoral

I can see how people in the late 60s - early 70s found it groundbreaking. But i was not even born then. I totally get his humour and find his sense of irony quite cute. I felt very self-congratulatory getting his cultural references (though I am not sure whether it was his intention). Other than that, his manner of mixing different media within the plot (a movie, a play, songs etc.) probably innovative then, did not age quite well. I guess, we live in the age which he tried to envisage. For us switching from one media source to another comes so naturally… And we stopped looking for the ideal media or communication channel due to its abundance. The question whether the art should have a meaning or to just entertain is so post-modern that the generation younger than mine does not have time bothering with it.He seems to be preoccupied with the phenomena of entropy. But he made his character saying something which does not sound correct as far as I know: “Two kinds of entropy thermodynamic and informational happened say by a coincidence to look alike when you wrote them down as equations. Yet he had made his mere coincidence respectable with the help of Maxwell Demon. The dead man was a linking feature in a coincidence. “ Informational entropy is called so not by coincidence at all. The name was actually suggested to Shannon (who established the basis of the theory) by von Neumann exactly because both entropies describe the same probabilistic phenomena. Infamously, Von Neumann added that as no-one understand what is all about Shannon would be winning any arguments. I do not know. Maybe I’ve just did not get the joke this time around. But I was not impressed. I was even less impressed by the historical references. Earlier in the book, one character is saying that tsar Nicolas II freed up the serfs in Russia. But the serfdom was abolished actually by Alexander II 35 years before Nicolas has even become the Tsar. It is like saying that president Roosevelt was fighting the civil war! The book works as a puzzle. One can make out of it whatever one wants. But for me, it has lost its relevancy. I can see where David Foster Wallace and even Roberto Bolano drew their inspiration from. But they’ve performed the trick so much better in their own books. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Apr 17, 2018","Apr 26, 2018","Apr 17, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2794.The_Crying_of_Lot_49

It is also such a rarity… The novel takes place during one day in 1958 in Cologne. It is focused on the 3 generation of the family of architects getting to grips with the trauma inflicted on them by their compatriots and by the defeat in the war. It reminds also that the spectre of Evil is never far away; it just reincarnates into different shapes and forms. But the novel refuses to be deductive and does not have any recipe how to fight it though. It asks the question what is better to build or to destroy? To destroy something which has been built earlier, which might have been a wrong symbol… Or the symbol which did not safe anything or anyone… Or is the act of creation and destruction are the part of the same process? Hegel with his unity and conflicts of the opposites comes to mind.But apart from being cold and reflective, the novel possesses a great emotional power. It reminds us that there were many Germans who never supported the Nazis and they were the victims as well as everyone else. But we rare spare the thoughts for them. There is certainly the element of the universal truth in this for any war : we deserve all dignity for the winners. There were a few places in this novel that moved me close to tears, which is extremely rare for me. And the style of the narrative is sophisticated, but not for a single moment feels laboured.

Quite often her internal monologue borderlines with self-analysis (as it would be defined by clinical physiology). It is probably not a coincidence that her grandmother in the novel is a shrink, and she brings up Freud as part of the narrative. Predominantly, she reflects on her relationship with her grandmother and her mother, now both dead, and her own impending motherhood. Her thoughts are intermingled with the insets about certain historical figures who thrived to see inside the human being either physically or emotionally. She talks about Rotgen, Freud and his relationship with his daughter, and John Hunter, the surgeon in the 18th century. Her sentences are long and complex, fronted with length adverbials. But i like how smoothly she moves from one idea to another, how she mixes different periods of her life. I did not read a lot of books by English authors in such a style. Rachel Cusk is only one who comes to mind with her trilogy of “Outline”, “Transit” and what comes next. But Cusk writing is more directed outside, she writes down the encounters with others, she observes. This one is totally introvert of a novel. It is more like auto-fiction of Knaussguard, but less transgressional and more compact.The protagonist’s reflections possess very philosophic undertones. It might be not surprising as the authour has got a degree in philosophy. For some people it might come across as pretentious, but I enjoyed it. For example, she considers the process of growing up “as solitary process of disentanglement from those who made us and the reality of it cannot be avoided but only, perhaps, deferred…” . She even thinks about it while hugging her little daughter: “I respond with agonising gratitude that I must hide from her in case feeling the heft of it, she might become encumbered and not do what she was born for which is to go away from me. It is a balance to show enough love that she is sure of me but not so much that she stays close: the fact but not the size of it - and it is an effort, as I encourage her to disentangle herself from my gaze..” Whilst “disentanglement” is certainly a fact, I was a bit saddened by her stance to limit her closeness to her child for the sake of philosophy, what it seems…Following the necessity of “disentanglement” she has got quite interesting view of knowing the family history: “To pick through dusty boxes. to sift through memories which fray and tear like ageing paper in an effort to find out who we are , is to avoid the responsibility of choice, since when it comes to it we have only ourselves , now and the ever-narrowing cone of what we might enact.” Respectively she discards everything which is left of her mum into the skip. This seems to me very radical view, totally different from the book which I’ve finished before this one “Alone in the classroom” by Elizabeth Hay, where a bit older protagonist is actively searching knowledge of her past which ended up affecting her present…While I enjoyed the main monologue, I found the historical insets less successful. They are really well researched - the author even provides the bibliography at the end of the book. They contain very interesting observations such as the low value of life in the18th century or the impact of phychoanalysis on small children. But overall I found these insets too lengthy to integrate into the narrative. The overwhelmingly strongest theme for me was how she describes the state of pregnancy, the emotional and philosophic transformations which take place during this period in a woman, the insecurities involved in the process of deciding to have a child. Sadly, this phenomena do not have sufficient representation in the literature. Normally the maximum what is mentioned is physical symptoms and them the child pops up and a novel moves on from there. But those 9 moths and the following birth are the one of the most powerful emotional experience any woman (and the affected partner) are going through. I know only one another book which is dealing with this - “The Argonauts” by Meggie Nelson. There, the impact is substantially stronger than in this book. You feel immediacy of the experience, its transformative power. Here, it is more reflective and detached, but still good.This novel would not be everyone’s cup of tea, but enjoyed it and found a lot to think about. The writer to watch.Quotes:“Our understanding of the past we did not inhabit will always be a fiction.”“I had thought that loss would be dramatic, that it would be kind of exercise, when instead it was the emptiness of everything going on as before and nothing working as it ought.”“Without reflection we do little more than drift upon the surface of things and self-determination is illusion. We lay ourselves open to unbalance.”...more",Notes are private!,0,11,2,"Apr 11, 2018not set","Apr 13, 2018not set","Apr 11, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36212526-sight

I put a 3 stars because I do not want to add to the division on such a difficult issue as a race. However, I do not think this book is profound enough. For various reasons, I am interested in the questions of identity and different aspects of it. I thought this book would be good to find out more. It is specifically focused on the race and the black part of her heritage. But I would be more interested to find out how she balances all the richness of her heritage (she is half black, quarter jewish and quarter english). But her Jewish ancestry is mentioned only once, while her white heritage is not considered at all. The part when she writes about her personal experience is the most successful part of the book. But her historical investigations deserve to be much more deep than it is presented in the book. Also her consideration of the class impact on the race is very shallow. It is understandable as she has got a very privileged background by any standards. But it would be more revealing if she would base her investigations on interviewing less privileged black people from around the country instead of a couple of rich black swingers (It would be fair to mention that it is not the only anecdotal story she mentions in the book. There are others, but the majority with her friends or acquaintances). I have a few issues with the logic of her conclusions as well. They sometime just do not follow from her observations. For example, the most banal one: she meets with the black man in an adult club who confirm to her that they believe in the stereotype of black male being super powerful in bed. And they are proud of it. She concludes that they have a low self-esteem if they are proud of such things. It might be or might be not, but it is the conclusion which she needs and which automatically does not follow from her observation.

It reminded me the writing of Alexander Grin, the Russian writer of the beginning of 20th century. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexand...) Unfortunately, he is not well known abroad and the translations of his work are rare. His life was in stark contrast to his writing: in real world he was going through the prisons, revolutions and depravations, alcoholism and illness; while his writing is all set in an imaginary country, close to a sea, populated by people with sun dried faces - sailors, vagabonds and aristocrats and beautiful women- grappling with their humanity… Andey Tarkovsky called him a poet with  ""an awareness of the world, a particular way of relating to reality... a philosophy to guide a man throughout his life.”Coincidently, The Gradual was compared by an FT columnist to Tarkovsky’s movie “Stalker”. “Stalker” is darker.

It is written from the point of view of a young woman, Frankie, who is experiencing a psychologic breakdown and retreats to the countryside boogaloo belonging to her deceased grandma. There she stays through the summer and takes pictures of dead animals, potentially, for her art project.I enjoyed the brisk and energetic prose and the confessional style. The problems of this girl reminded me how it is to be 25 years old, when you start realising that you are not that exceptional and talented as you thought you are; that many things you thought you invented have been done before and done better. And it does not feel very good. In fact, it feels like the end of the world…. And you do not have yet people you are responsible for in your life. So you can indulge in a deep identity crisis while you can rely on your mum who would come straight away on your first request… You do not know yet that it will be a day when it will be no mum to rely on, that you would not have a choice but to pull yourself together for the sake of your children, not your dreams… But the good news is, the fact you are not that exceptional does not imply your life does not have a meaning! I felt for Frankie, but also I wanted her to have a bit more of sense of humour or self-deprecation. The special thing is Frankie’s connection with the animal world, both the dead and alive. She relies on it as a helping hand, the distraction from her troubles and the object of her art. This relationship is unusual as it is a bit ambiguous. It is clear she loves animals. But there are two episodes when I was pushed out of my comfort zone. At the first instance, she found a dying crow and she sits and waits in her car for quite sometime until the crow is dead just to make a photo of her (I do not have a book at the moment so forgive me, if it was another type of a bird). And in another instance, there is another little bird which is in a hopeless state and probably suffering. At this case Frankie just kills the bird with the stone… It reminded me another book I’ve read recently The Story of a Brief Marriage - totally different setting, totally different suffering - the young man displaced from his home by Tamil Tigers after losing everything and everyone, including his mother, finds himself in the jungle at night in a rare break from shelling. He knows he could be killed any minute… And there, he as well comes across at a mortally wounded little bird… But he does not kill it. He sits down and talks to it for some time, trying to sooth it and then, he just leaves it there and walks away… I am not trying to make any moral point here. In fact, I cannot… I do not know what would be the right thing to do.. But the contrast has just affected me.The book is peppered with the references to various artworks as it is seen through Frankie’s eyes. I felt it was important part for the author, but it did not have any effect on me. It is too many of them to google each time. And i did not find Frankie’s thought too profound for the ones I knew. As far as the dead animal photos are concerned, I presented in the book I would want much better quality, so i can see the details (that is if they are required to be there at the first place). Otherwise the effect is really mute.Interesting book, brilliant quality of writing, but commutatively lacked the impact for me. It might be the victim of the second novel syndrome. I am certainly going to read her first novel soon. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Mar 17, 2018","Mar 20, 2018","Mar 17, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30971749-a-line-made-by-walking

The authors compare those examples with the current situation in America. They state that apart from the written laws and established institutions there are also unwritten norms and “forbearance” - accepting the opposition as a legitimate player. And when those things are undermined, the democracy is in real threat. In terms American democracy, they think that Trump is more a symptom than the course. The main reason, as far as I understood their point of view, is the growing gap between the democrats and the republicans. “With disappearance of conservative Democrats and liberal republicans the overlap between the parties gradually disappeared.” They claim that the mutual reconciliation after the civil war was based on the racial disenfranchising of the black population, especially in the South. Ironically, this situation was promoted by the Southern Democrats and eventually quietly tolerated by the Northern Republicans. But since the 60s civil rights movements the situation has radically changed. Black enfranchisement and immigration give advantage to democrats. Both parties’ bases are radically realigned. And now they are “much more than liberal and Conservative party. Their voters are now deeply divided by race, religious belief, geography and even way of life.” The republicans have come to represent more and more white religious Americans who find themselves threatened by the demographics and experiense existential crisis because of that:“If definition of real America is restricted to those native born English speaking white and Christian that it is easy to see how “real Americans” might view themselves of declining.” … “By the end of Obama’s presidency many republicans embraced the view that the democratic rivals were anti American or posed a threat to the American way of life.”The result is all out war launched by the Republicans since the 80s through all possible means (money, media, manipulating with districts voting) undermining the established political norms and challenging opponents’s legitimacy. “If 25 years ago someone describe to you a country in which candidates threatened to lock up their rivals, political opponents accused the government of stealing the election or establishing a dictatorship and parties used their legislative majorities to impeach presidents and steal Surpreme court seats, you might thought of Equador it Romania, but not the United States.”After Trump elections, some commentators recommended the Democrats to step back from so called “identity politics”. But the authors of this book do not think it would be the right thing to do, especially in the racial issues. They consider different scenarios what could happen with the country after Trump; and unsurprisingly the scenarios vary on the spectrum of optimism. But if they are right about the root course of the problem (the perceived disappearing of “real America’), it would be a very difficult struggle until the people are ready to embrace the inevitability of the future which is different from the past. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Feb 19, 2018",Mar 2018,"Feb 19, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/37120307-how-democracies-die

It is about 2 centuries of so called nation building, myths and misconceptions, realpolitiks and enormous bloodbath it has created. This is an informative introductory history of the Balkans. As well as former Yugoslavia, it includes Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania, as well as the relevant information about the Ottoman empire. I was not very familiar with the history of Bulgaria and Romania. This book was quite instrumental in covering this gap. For me, those countries were always satellites of Russia - totally wrong misconception on my part and very far from the truth. So for me this book was full of discoveries. I did not know, that Bulgaria has managed to save the majority of its Jews from Holocaust, in spite of being in alliance with the Nazi Germany.It was also interesting to find out about the formation of the Greek state. Though the book is a bit sketchy on details. Albania is another country about which one hardly hear on the news. There is a brief outline about its history in the book. I was better familiar with the history of ex-Yugoslavia. And my edition of this book ends in 1999. So i found it a bit less revelatory, but still useful for the outline of the events there. All these 200 years or so are pretty gruesome. But two episodes stood out for me even on that beak background. The first is the invasion of Asia Manor by the Greeks in 1921 and subsequent killing of Muslims by them. The second part of this awful story is better known - the Fire of Smirna and the population exchange. But the fact that the Greeks were actually initiating massacres straight after the invasion before 1923 is less well known. The most hard for me to grasp was the Second World War. I could not read more that a page or two at a time. And it is not because “Himmler was determined to reduce the psychological suffering which mass murder inflicted on his executioners.” by contemplating the final solution. This is the horror in its pure form. But what was also shocking in that war the Croatians were killing the Serbs; the Serbs were killing Muslims and the Croatians. And all this madness was justified by nations’ idea.

This book is written by the physicist who spent the last 20 years of his career investigating something which is not directly related to physics. I like how physicists are looking at this world. I sympathise totally with their practical approach and attempts to explain everything with the laws of nature. West has established a quantifiable physical framework how organisms are developing and why. The books summarises his findings. It is written for general public in a rambling and discursive style with a lot of deviations from the main plot. But they are always very curious. The main idea of the book is the theory of scales for studying highly complex systems.Scaling is how complex systems respond with their size change. He comes to the conclusion that “the dynamics, growth, and organisation of animals, plants, human social behaviour, cities and companies are, in fact, subject to similar generic “laws”. He shows that many quantifiable parameters of such system demonstrate an exponential relationship with its size (power law). And such an elegant idea helps him to approach a range of very serious questions:-why we can live for up to 120 years but not a million?-why mice live just 2-3 years while elephant live for up to 75?-why do we stop growing?-why do almost all companies live relatively few years whereas cities keep growing and manage to circumvent death?- can we develop a conceptual quantitive framework for understanding the dynamics of growth and lifecycle of the cities and the companies?- can our development be sustainable?The book is especially strong when he talks about biology and connects the theory of evolution with the underlying physical laws and fractal theory. His explanation of the growth of an organism is vigorous (in spite of the fact that he is not allowed to use maths for general audience). He relates the growth to the laws of thermodynamics and hydraulics. In the process, he talks about a lot of interesting personalities and anecdotes such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel and his construction projects. Also  Lewis Fry Richardson, a polymath who tried to develop a mathematical theory of war. He was trying to investigate the probability of a military conflict as a function of the length of the countries’ joint border. Instead. he was amazed to discover that the measurement of those borders depend on scale. He inadvertently came across the phenomena of fractals. There are a lot of such mini-stories in the book.The application of the scaling framework to social systems (companies and cities) is still work in progress, I felt. However, his findings are very curious and, to some extent, counter-intuitive. The main idea is the companies have a quite limited average lifespan and behave more like alive organism. The period of rapid expansion is followed by the period of a slow growth, stagnation and death. The cities however, are drivers of super-exponential growth - the economic activity in the city grow quicker than its size. Respectively, he considers cities as source of unbounded economic growth which brings the challenge of sustainability. (Or he uses the term “singularity” when the growth shoots to infinity for some finite size of population with all unimaginable consequences). As the number the cities will be only growing he talks about the necessity of the “unified sustainability theory”. Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It is rich in stories and very personal as well as scientific. It felt more like a conversation with a very knowledgable and enthusiastic older friend. Some might find it irritating in a science book, but I liked it. Only minor complaint which I am sure is not his fault - I aways appalled how such books try to avoid even elementary formulas and equations. Surely it is much easier to explain what is power law if you write it down in the language of maths! But it seems to be a taboo in popular science books. And for me, it makes vigorous theories look more muddled than they have to be. A few quotes:""The amount of energy needed to support an average person living in the us is 11k watts compared to just 90 watts for food.""""To maintain order and structure in an evolving system requires the continual supply and use of energy whose byproduct is disorder.""""Because animals obey power law scaling both within individual terms of the geometry and dynamics of their internal structure as well as across species they and therefore all of us are living manifestation of self-similar fractals.""Mandelbrot succinctly put it: “smooth shapes are very rare in the wild but extremely important in the Ivory tower and the factory”.""The behaviour of the stock market is a self-similar fractal pattern that repeats itself across all scales following law that can b quantified by its exponent or equivalently it’s fractal dimension.""...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 30, 2018","Feb 13, 2018","Jan 30, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35119228-scale

All ingredients are there to work out a new, improved taste based upon an extended recipe. But it has not quite finished.The book is about the role of information in the world and it is supposed to take us all the way from the atoms to economies. In particular, the idea was to build up a new theory of economic growth as a result. I would argue, it takes us from atoms to products and social networks required to build those products. But the author either has lost his interest or ran out of explanatory power in relating these phenomena to the economic growth.His interpretation of the information theory and its consequences is very elegant: information is the order frozen in the matter. Respectively when we create something new, we are “crystallising our imagination” in our product. This enables other people use the benefit of our imagination and “augment their capacities” without the detailed knowledge of the process. His example is toothpaste - we do not need to know how to synthesise the chemicals into a toothpaste to be able to clean out teeth. This is because someone has done the synthesis for us. In his view, that we develop out products because we just want to share our imagination with others in such a way. Also as a person is finite, he/she could accumulate a limited amount of knowledge. He calls in “personbyte”. So to develop something more complex than a single personbyte, people would require a social network. Those networks are evolving in terms of the companies and other organisations, predominantly of the large size. The conclusion is that we have production driven societies rather than consumption driven societies. Also the market does not play such a huge role now, as the majority or interactions are either happening inside an large organisation or between them. And we shape our society in response to what we produce.Respectively, “The economy is the system by which people accumulate knowledge and knowhow to create packets of physical order or products that augment our capacity to accumulate more knowledge and knowhow and in turn accumulate more information.” We become rich because “we crystallise our imagination”.Up to now, all of this is consistent and logical. Some of it reminded me Marx’s “base and superstructure”. One can disagree with the conclusions he has reached. But it is based upon his analysis and understanding of the system. But after that the book is much less convincing. For example, he postulates: “Growth of economies is a consequence of the growth of information.” And so? Is the growth desirable? Is it inevitable? Can we control it? Would it stop one day or would it go all the way to a singularity? What is the role of energy (as we need energy to produce information)? How does it affect the growth? All of these questions are not even raised properly in the book.There is a conversation why some countries are growing better than the other. And the answer is the diversity of their economies and power of their social networks. But it looks almost obvious to me, that it would be such a correlation. I am not sure what does it add to the formulation of the relevant policies though….Interesting and elegant first part about the physicality of information.

If you are interested in the alternative views oThis is entertaining, intellectually stimulating and well researched book about complexity economics. If you are interested in the alternative views on economic theory, you would find it worth paying attention to. It is written in 2007, but still stands alone as a popular introduction into this field. I am surprised it has not been updated and there is nothing more recent on the topic.The book is more than 500 pages, but I never felt bored. There is a part where Mr Beinhocker is trying to formulate his own theory of economic growth borrowing from the theory of evolution and applying it to the economy. These chapters and his theory, respectively, I found not very convincing and relatively sketchy. And he admits himself that he might be wrong in certain conjestures. However, the effort to produce any theory within the complexity framework was worthwhile nevertheless. The rest of the book is a delight. He gathers the relevant knowledge from the scientists working in the complexity field and convincingly presents it. He also explains why the traditional neoclassical theory does not quite work.Below is what he is considering in the book:- the economy is complex adaptive system (Complex - contains many agents interacting with each other and demonstrates the phenomena of emergence; adaptive - the agents adapt their behaviour in response to certain feedbacks; There is no long-lasting equilibrium within these systems. The system is also dynamic (evolving with time). - the economic laws should be consistent with the biological theory of evolution and physics (thermodynamics, specifically 2nd law); He describes in the book what does it all mean.- if one models the economy using this paradigm, the results would be much closer to the empirical data but would totally debunk many findings of the traditional economic theory. - the field is relatively new, so there is no complete theory developed so far, but a lot of interesting patterns are emerging.The implications of this are massive of course. He demonstrates it with lots of example and the related models. I will just mention the two of them here, the ones I found quite striking:Sugarscape model:The model has been developed in 1996 by J Epstein and R Axtell. It is a computer simulation of economic interactions between the agents trying to obtain and eat sugar (the only resource available which is spread unevenly within limited landscape). In the simplest model the agents could do only 3 things: look for sugar; move; eat sugar. To do that, they receive randomly a “genetic endowment” for vision and metabolism (the slow the better). So, the one with better vision and slower metabolism would be genetically better off, but the geography where are they would matter as well. For starters, they ran this game with 250 agents. And even at this simplest model they found a striking thing:“At the beginning the sugarscape was fairy egalitarian society with bell-shaped distribution of wealth and with only a few agents were rich and a few were poor, the rest was solid middle class.” And the gap between the richest and the poorest was relatively small. As time passes, however, this distribution has changed dramatically. “Average wealth rose, but the distribution of wealth became very skewed, with emerging super-rich, a long tale of upper class yuppie agents, shrinking middle class, and then a bog, growing underclass of poor agents.”Does it remind you something? Indeed, what the Bible said “For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath! “ And the reason for this is “emerging macro behaviour out of micro behaviour of each agents” - geography, genes, and sheer luck in combination! Beinocker describes the outcomes and the assumptions in a very clear and detailed way. He also shows more complicated models with the possibility of exchange, agents’ reproduction, etc. However, even the basic model is very revealing.Any policy-maker should be familiar with this if she is serious addressing the inequality issues.Stock marketAccording to Beinocker, the stock market is the only place where the economic theories are tested almost in real time and where there is a massive amount of empirical data. The book has been written before the latest financial crisis. However, when I read this book, I was amazed that all the knowledge describing the inherent instability of the stock market were already there! It seems, just no-one wanted to open their eyes and look. And i am not even talking about the financial system as whole. Just pure stock market.The traditional wisdom (well, actually an academic theory by a few Noble price winners) is called “Perfect Market Hypotheses” (PMH):- all information you might know about the company is already in its share price;- therefore, it is impossible to learn from the shares’ past performance. The prices follow totally random walk; - the market will reach its equilibrium;- the price reflects the fair value of the companyAll of it leads to the following conclusions:-that the bubbles are impossible (only might be coursed by exogenous factors, not inherent in the system); - no big money can be made at stock exchange - ha!-the management should care about its share price and maximise the value of the company calculated as per financial results (i am simplifying here, but this is the jest);This is the PMH to you. And it was evident in 2008 already that this theory is total rubbish (excuse my French)! Beinocker shows how and why it is the case through the models of David Farmer, the physicist, turned into a stock broker and then finance theorist. Surprisingly in 2008, against the evidence he himself presents, Beinocker still seemed to agree with Paul Samuelson that “It is not easy to get rich in Las Vegas, at Churchill Downs, or at the local Merrill Lynch office.”. He argues that no single broker would have sufficient liquid funds easily available. But i think, it was more a self-delusion, than the conclusions from his own research. We all know by now know that the broker could easily borrow…The theory of maximising shareholder’s value (i.e. financial result = share price) has created a culture of short-term view with management focusing on the quarterly financial results instead of more strategic long-term vision of the company’s goals. It is evident now that the share price does not reflect the company value and respectively, the management does not have a direct control over it. These are just two examples how complexity approach and the related modelling is changing the traditional economic paradigm.In the last part of the book, Beinocker considers possible policy implications of the complexity economics. Specifically thinks about inequality, development and the role of the government in the economy. He hopes that the theory would put an end to the traditional left and right divide on the economic issues. I would like to hope together with him… However, it seems we are moving backwards not forwards in terms of the divergence between the theory and practice…All of this might sound very dry to you, but the book is not dry. He is fantastic and patient storyteller. He takes time explaining the concepts and models. I have to make a warning though, if you are easily irritated by the management consulting verbiage, you might find bits of this book quite annoying. But it is not intolerable and not everywhere (the majority is focused in Chapter 14 which might be easily skipped).Definitely, complexity economics is the one of the most promising ways of looking at the economy. Complexity and convergence seem to be the trends developing in the natural sciences for quite sometime. I am glad it is starting to reach the social sciences as well....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 16, 2018","Jan 29, 2018","Jan 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth

But I could not find concise introductory book about system thinking for social sciIt is the one of the areas I’ve been interested for quite a while. But I could not find concise introductory book about system thinking for social science and/or policymaking. I think, in spite of its limitations, this book is as close as you could get. It is not technical. It explains the basics very clearly. It could be claimed, that the book is representing only one part of the rapidly developing and diverse field. But I would argue, that it does not go deep into the specifics of any field, while providing the starting point. Donella Meadows, professor of MIT, she has written the manuscript in1992, but never came to publishing it. It has been published after her death in 2001, I believe. While reading, i felt she did not have a chance to edit it properly. It is a mixture of a basic system theory, her views on certain social issues, personal experiences and even sometimes more general philosophic thoughts. So you have to be a patient reader to get what you want out of it. I’ve almost ended up reading it twice. But it is very rewarding at the end. You start see systems everywhere.Some of her examples are obviously very outdated. In spite of this, I did not feel her explanations and approach has aged. She came up with the suggested methodology, how to change social systems and this is already quite a lot. What is the system?It is something which is more than the sum of its parts and it is source of its own behaviour. She gives more formal definition: “a set of elements or parts that is coherently organised and interconnected in a pattern or structure that produces a characteristic set of behaviours often classified as its function or purpose”. The difference between a system and a set of objects: 1) there are connections (called flows) between the elements (often called stocks or agents) in the system; 2) there are certain feedback mechanisms communicated through these connections. Respectively, a change in one part of the system would course the change in another part. The main point here, that the system would course its own behaviour by itself. So it would function in time (“dynamic” is the scientific word).Non controversial examples is a thermostat, or a human body. Apparently, in the 90s to consider an individual, society or economy as a systems examples was controversial to the extent that she uses the word “heretical”…In the book she briefly describes different types of systems. She also brings natural resources into social system. What is thinking in systems?It is a critical tool applying the knowledge of systems to the chosen object of research in order to understand it better or solve related problems. Practically, it is done through building a model of the underlying system. It is just one type of analysis, the “lens” how to understand the world around us. The book delves deeper into how it works and describes the properties of the systems. What are feedbacks?Feedback loop is much easier to understand intuitively than define. But it is a chain of rules or physical laws which defines how the initial change in the element (stock in the system speak) of the system courses the next change at the same element. It comes in two varieties:- balancing feedback - there is a defined goal and the current state is compared to this goal (the targeted temperature in thermostat vs the current temperature for example). This type of feedback makes the system more stable, but more resistant to change as well. - reinforcing feedback loop - it is self-enfacing mechanism when the initial change triggers even bigger change. This type of feedback left alone is leading to the exponential growth or runaway collapses of the system over time. The example could be a bank balance with the compounded interest rate; population growth of rabbits or escalation of a political conflict. Or, I dare say, a rating on GR website - the higher the rating, the more people would read the book, the more people would rate it positively - the more rating would grow - the more people would read and…. you’ve got the picture. But unfortunately, for some wonderful, but underrated books, it works in negative way as well.What a boundaries?“there are no separate systems. The world is continuum. Where to draw a boundary around a system depends on the purpose of the discussion.” It is very important point which illustrates the relevance of systems thinking to our life. She notes: “Ideally we would have the mental flexibility to find the appropriate boundary for thinking about each new problem. We are rarely that flexible. We get attached to the boundary our minds happen to be accustomed to. To think how many arguments have to do with boundaries- national trade ethnic, boundaries between public and private responsibility, and boundaries between the religious ch and poor, polluters and pollutees, people alive now and people who cone in the future.”  This lack of mental flexibility is the source of a lot of unnecessary conflicts and mistakes, systems or not…What are “systems’ traps”?Systems could be counter-intuitive. More often than not a system would “surprise” you - come up with the results which you would not expect. This is because the majority of systems are complex - contain subsystems. And there are a lot of connections and feedbacks. Feedbacks might pull the performance in an unexpected direction. Or, the goals of subsystems might contradict to each other and “may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system of the whole”. The bad “surprises” she calls “systems traps”. She defines about 9 different traps encountered in the social systems and the recommended ways out. They are all very important, but I’ve picked up just three to give you a jest of what is all about:- Escalation - When the state of one stock (agent) is determined by trying to surpass the state of another stock (agent) and vice versa. “It is a reinforcing feedback loop carrying the system in an arms race, a wealth race, a smear campaign, escalating loudness, escalating violence. The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes surprisingly quickly. If nothing is done, the spiral will be stopped by someone collapse.” As the way out, once side could refuse to compete unilaterally. Or some balancing feedback loop could be negotiated to compensate for the reinforcing one.- Success to the Successful - “The winners of a competition are systematically rewarded with the means to win again, a reinforcing feedback loop is created. And if it is allowed to proceed uninhibited, the winners eventually take all, while the losers are eliminated.” One might recognise the monopolisations of the industries and the mechanism for inequality, currently big issues on the social radar. As the way out - diversification, strict limitation of maximum fraction of a winning pie (antitrust law for example); periodically levelling the playing field for everyone; policies that device the rewards for success that do not bias the next round of competition.- Seeking a Wrong Goal - if the system has got a poorly defined or plainly wrong goal, it would obediently tick-tack towards it. Way out - define the goal carefully and redefine if wrong; not to try accept the goal just so it is easy to measure. What to do with all of this?You can answer this question on two levels. On the personal level, the system thinking is a good tool to understand the world around you; that everything is interconnected and some of your decisions might come back and affect you in a surprising way. On the other hand, you always have an ability to learn and to change (to adapt in system speak).On the level of society and social science, it is much more complicated of course:“Self-organising, nonlinear, feedback systems are inherently unpredictable. They are not controllable. They are understandable only in the most general way. The goal of foreseeing the future exactly and preparing for it perfectly unrealisable.” In plain speak, no-one can control such system and no-one would be able to predict what it would do in future. To add insult to injury: “Social systems are the external manifestation of cultural thinking patterns and of profound human needs emotions strength and weakness. Changing them is not simple.”Why to bother then? Because, though the systems cannot be controlled and predicted, but it can be understood (to some extent)! The new system can be designed and the existing ones can be re-designed.Redesigning of the existing systems is probably the most interesting bit. For this she defines “Leverage points”, the terms borrowed from Physics - places in the system where a small change could lead to a large shift in its behaviour.Leverage points (levels of impact from the weakest to the strongest):1. Numbers/parameters - characteristic of rates of flow, levels of stock, buffers. They are the least effective in terms lasting impact on the system behaviour. Examples are tax rates, spending rates, caps on ambient air quality, minimal wage and cap at prices. Even such things like firing people and hiring the new ones, including politicians — but of the structure is the same and info flows are the same would not help. She compares in with shifting chars on Titanic in order to restore the balance. “Whatever cap we put on campaign contributions, it does not clean up politics. The Fed’s fiddling with the interest rate has not made business cycles go away. (We always forget that during upturns and are shocked by the downturns). Spending more on police or education does not make crime go away.”Only one exception is when the goal of the whole system is expressed as a numerical value. But more about it below.2. Nitty-gritty stuff (my term) - basically the other elements embedded in the system:- buffers of stock - more buffer more stability, but if it is too big - lack of flexibility. - physical structures and networks - delays in feedback loops - the system cannot response to short-term changes if it has got a long-term delays; but her advice is counter-intuitive - slow done the system rather than shorten delay in many cases is better. - balancing feedback loops - regulate the strength of them; I liked very much her example for this feedback:“Democracy - system was invented to put self-correcting feedback between the people and their government. The people informed what their elected representative do, respond by voting those representative out of the office.” She farther notes “the process depends on the free, full, unbiased flow of information back and forth between electorate and leaders. Billions of dollars are spent to limit, and bias and dominate this flow of information.”- reinforcing feedbacks are sources of growth, explosion and collapse with they are unchecked - so should have some sort of balancing feedback attached- missing feedbacks altogether - the lack of accountability. The one of her examples is to depose a bit of production waste to the garden of the relevant CEO would add a missing feedback. 3. Self-organisation or evolution - divine creator (if there is one) does not have to produce evolutionary miracles. “He, she or it just has to write marvellously clever rules for self-organisation.” The current development on AI comes to mind here. But she means more social rules i guess. 4. Goals of the system  - to change the purpose of system’s function. She has to put it above self-organisation in terms of effectiveness because of “diversity destroying push for control”. Her example is a corporation (in theory could be any organisation or institution). To make profit is just a rule. The real goal “to make more under control of a corporation so it is shielded from uncertainty.”. It is a goal of any living population but only a bad one when it isn’t balanced by a higher level balancing feedback that never let “an upstart power-loop-driven entity to control the world.” And on the level of the goal, the parameters do have a big impact. The same the individual if he/she can change the goal of the system by her decision. It brings to my mind the old debate about the role of an individual in the historical process… It certainly makes sense from the system perspective… 5. Paradigm is the highest leverage point. It is unstated assumptions in the minds of the society and the deepest set of beliefs how the world works. Her teacher, Jay Forrester came up with this observation:“It doesn’t matter how tax law of a country is written. There is a shared idea in the minds of the society about what a fair distribution of the tax load is. Whatever the laws say, by fair means of foul, by complications, cheating, exemptions or deductions, by constant shipping at the rules, actual tax payments will push right up against the accepted idea of “fairness”.The assumptions are unstated because everyone knows them. So they are shared social agreement about the nature of reality. More examples from her:- One can “own” the land. - Money have real meaning and measure something real; so people who paid less are literally worth less. …I would add from myself two more: - the business profit is real and that measures the added value; - nationality is real and defines the identity. Paradigms are sources of systems. From them the systems are built. How too change it - by building the model of the system which would take us outside the system and “forces” us to see it as a whole. Thought experiments then! Sometimes people like Einstein, Smith, Lenin hit the leverage points and managed to totally transform the system. But in general, it is the hardest thing to do and she talks about it quite a lot.Though one could disagree with her views on certain political issues, it should not stop the reader benefiting from systems thinking she describes. The time was well spent for me.QUOTESWhatever cap we put on campaign contributions, it does not clean up politics. The Fed’s fiddling with the interest rate has not made business cycles go away. (We always forget that during upturns and are shocked by the downturns). Spending more on police or education does not make crime go away.Balancing feedback should be adequate to the goal - The power of a big industry calls for the power of big government to hold it in check; a global economy makes global regulations necessary. If the goal is to bring more and more of the world under the control of one particular central planning system (the empire of Genghis Khan, the Church, the Peoples Republic of China, Wal-Mart, Disney), then everything further down the list, physical stocks and flows, feedback loops, information flows and even self-organisation would conform that goal. Allowing species to go extinct is a systems crime, just as randomly eliminating all copies of particular science journals of a particular kind of scientist would be. The same could be said of human cultures of course, which are the store of behavioural repertoires, accumulated over not billions, but hundreds of thousands of years. They are a stock out of which social evolution can arise. Unfortunately, people appreciate the precious evolutionary potential of cultures even less that they understand the preciousness of every genetic variation in the world’s ground squirrels. I guess that’s because one aspect of almost every culture is the belief in the utter superiority of that culture. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 11, 2018","Jan 24, 2018","Jan 11, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems

He broadly specialises in the field of development economics, but famous for his books “23 Things They Don’t Tell You About Capitalism.”  (I have not read that book).I picked up “the Manual” with the idea of refreshing my knowledge of basic economics. For this purpose, I think, the book is not the best source, but I found a few very interesting and useful parts and ideas in the book nevertheless. He splits the book in two parts. It is the second part, “Doing economics” i've had problems with. Mainly, because it did not add too much to what i already knew. He would not go farther than the knowledge of a layperson with good grasp of the current affairs. And very often his point of view is a bit too obvious. In this part, he discusses the following Macroeconomic areas: Measurement of Growth, Production, Work and Unemployment, the Role of the Government, Globalisation. It would be useful, if one does not know anything about how modern economy function. But if you do, you can skip this bit or read just headings.However, I enjoyed the first part of the book and his views on the subject of the economics per se. He defines the economics as a study of economy (money, work, technology, trade, taxes and other things which we have to do to distribute the incomes generated in the process and consume what it produced.) As opposed to study of rational decision making within the constraints of scarcity.And as a second step, he postulates that the economy could not be separated from the politics, or at least that the boundary is very blur. “Because the boundary of the market and economy is determined by politics. Not by the economics theory of whatever variety.” He argues that the politicians (and sometimes the society) decide what is subject to market and what is not. For example, the human beings are used to be subjects of the market transactions during the slavery. And current emission limits trading is something which was never defined as the market before. Further he argues that “a political argument often presented as a science.” by all involved.Also he argues that the markets might be detrimental to democracy:“Markets run according to the one-dollar-one-vote rule while democratic politics run on the principle of one person one vote. Thus the proposal for greater depoliticisation of the economy in the democracy is in the end an antidemocratic project that wants to give more power in the running of the society to those with more money.”It is a very interesting point worth considering. I personally can see where he is coming from, but do not entirely agree with the view “one dollar one vote” automatically benefits the rich - mass consumption fuelled by the debt is only thing which “trickled down” successfully. So the economy is relying on the masses to buy stuff. If they would stop for whatever reason, their economic vote would be very tangible. But this discussion is very interesting and relevant and should be continued.The book also includes the brief history of capitalism which summarises the economic development up to current time. It is by definition sketchy, and i found it too selective to be helpful. But another chapter is devoted to the history of economic thought. He identifies 9 different schools of economic theories (from Adam Smith to Austrians, Keynesian, institutionalises etc.) and presents their main ideas, strengths and weaknesses. I found this analysis invaluable, the most interesting and unbiased part of the book. The chapter I would come back to reread. As a conclusion, he claims if the economist says to you “there is no alternative”, he cannot be right and not to be trusted.

But it is so perfect, that by the time i reach the second paragraph, i hit the wall. My thoughts stick into each other and become an undistguishable whirlpool of awe. So, you do not need to continue reading what follows; just read the story, and read it now when something is ending but something else is barely beginning just yet… Christmas and New Year, this time..It starts with something very relatable, very traditional - two old ladies, the aunts of Gabriel, the main character, are hosting a Christmas party. They has been doing it for the last 30 years or so. The scenario is familiar, all usual faces of family and friends are there; everyone has got a predictable role naturally evolved during those years. Joyce describes the scene with absolutely delicious prose. A few words by him suffice when someone else would need five pages of the text. His language possess this musicality, totally unique to him. (From the writers I know, Nabokov comes close, but he sounds sometimes a little laboured):“As the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.”But there are people who are not there, though we feel there presence.. I think, in Poland they’ve got this tradition of keeping an empty chair for the family members who passed away. And Joyce keeps this chair as well very subtly for now. Gabriel looks at the portrait of his mum who died sometimes ago. He also makes a joke about his grandad. But the story really goes into the highest gear in the last few pages. By sheer coincidence, Gabriel finds out something tragic and beautiful which existed in the life of his wife a way before him. This revelation totally shocks him; he is in awe with the magnitude of her experience and feels diminished by it. It also derailes his train of thoughts towards the finiteness of life, towards the transience of our existence, especially of the older people we love. When we are young, we think they will be there forever. They are not supposed to age and change, and eventually “become shades”…“His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself which these dead had one time reared and lived in was dissolving and dwindling.”When i think about it, I see the huge limitless stage full of people and decorations with the single source of light. The light moves slowly beaming on a group for a time being and then moving towards another one, leaving everyone else there in shadow, never to come back…And there is another layer there for me. He looks at his wife and realises that she now is not the same person who has had that experience. This young girl is a shade as well. Our old selfs are shades of us, the ones which do not exist any longer here, but the ones we still remember and miss and try to reach sometimes… And a familiar song, or drops of rain, or silent sound of snow could call upon and bring the one of these shades back for a fraction of a moment, and make it real again…Happy New Year!...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Dec 29, 2017","Dec 31, 2017","Dec 29, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23289.The_Dead

It’s nothing wrong with that, but sometimes, you just do not want politics, fight and feathers, you want a miracle which is love… This story collection gives you just that. It contains more than two dozen love stories ranging widely from Nabokov to Miranda July and from Faulkner to Alice Monroe. The stories were selected by Geoffrey Eugenides. The collection is introduced by his essay on the nature of a love story and his choices.“It is perhaps only in reading a love story (or in writing one) that we can simultaneously partake of the ecstasy and agony of being in love without paying a crippling emotional price.” - he says in the essay. And this collection totally brought alive this experience for me. I liked the serendipity of the choices. Normally, if you read a collection by a single author you are getting used to the flow, its themes and the language. It is not the case here: you’ve thrown from Nabokov’s music to the abruptness of Faulkner; from the modern America to Russia in the 19th century, etc. Nothing in common in these stories, well nothing apart from love…If you do not like Eugenides as a novelist, you might not enjoy his choices. But I certainly did (with maybe 2 exceptions which i would not dwell here). This collection has returned me back to the state, long forgotten, when all my feelings were like strings and I coexisted with the myriad of people in this book. It reminded me that still there is fiction worth reading not only for intellectual, but for emotional impact, even if you are not 20 any more…One Russian writer said: “The love analysed theoretically becomes business and sport.” So I tried to keep it brief, but below a few thoughts on my best discoveries in the collection.The Hitchhiking game by Milan Kundera Normally, at the beginning of the relationship we try to idealise our romantic interest, subconsciously create a fiction to live in, at least for a bit. At some point the reality strikes of course.. That was the subject of Cat Person the recently published story in the New Yorker which created a lot of buzz and discussions on the internet. I did not find that story particularly good or profound. But i remembered it while reading The Hitchhiking game because Kundera has done something totally opposite - something scary and unpredictable. He has started with the relationship in perfect harmony, grounded in the real life, and he turned it upside down. The girl in the story for a second imagined herself as a totally different personality just for a sake of a verbal game. And the game took over: “Fiction was suddenly making an assault on real life”. And the result is honest and shaking and brutal, but very realistic as well…I do not like all of Kundera, but this story is a powerful one.Tonka by Robert MusilI rediscovered Musil all again with this story. Musil is known for his giant unfinished novel “A man without qualities”, which I’ve read. It was brimming with ideas and highly intellectual, But for me, it missed a bit of feeling. Everything and everyone seemed to be totally detached. This is not the case in this story. I understood that it is autobiographic and it is about his love with the ordinary peasant woman. Here he manages to combine his analytic gift with deep and heartbreaking emotions, paradoxes of understanding and the lack of it..It reminded me how little verbal communication means in love. His character thinks of a language as a gift and for articulated people “the ability to talk was not a medium of thought, but a sort of capital, something they wore like jewellery to impress others.”. However he looks at “inarticulate Tonka, who could neither talk nor weep.” and feels something which even he cannot express:“But how is one to define something that neither can speak nor is spoken of, something that dumbly merges with anonymous mass of mankind, something that is like a little line scratched on the tablets of history? What is one to make of such life, such being which is like a snowflake falling, all alone in the midst of a summer day? Is it real or imaginary? Is it good or indifferent? One senses the fact that here the categories have reached a frontier beyond which they cease to be valid.”We didn’t by Stuart DybekI never heard of Dybek before i’ve read this story and what a fantastic discovery! His writing is a poetry in prose. His words and sentences makes me feel this weird mixture of longing and melancholy:“But we didn’t, not in the moonlight, or by the phosphorescent lanterns of lightning bugs in your back yard, not beneath the constellations we couldn’t see, let alone decipher, or in the dark glow that replaced the real darkness of night, a darkness already stolen from us, not with the skyline rising behind us while a city gradually decayed, not in the heat of summer while a Cold War raged, despite the freedom of youth and the license of first love—because of fate, karma, luck, what does it matter?—we made not doing it a wonder, and yet we didn’t, we didn’t, we never did.” ""It was the first time I'd ever had the feeling of missing someone I was still with.""Natasha by David BezmozgisThe story is centred around the girl, immigrant version of Lolita, appearing and shaking the life of an adolescent boy and his family. Again, it is a total discovery for me. His voice is very original, prose - economic and unsentimental, humour is dark.And of course, The Dead by James Joyce - It is not included into the European edition of this collection, but it is in the American one.I have a separate  here:https://www.goodreads.com//show......more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Dec 18, 2017","Dec 25, 2017","Dec 18, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3536027-my-mistress-s-sparrow-is-dead

Through her own experience and interactions with the modern students, Kate HThis book is very ambitious, but with a very valid and honourable course. Through her own experience and interactions with the modern students, Kate Haworth realised the economic theory that is taught to the undergraduates is at least 50 years old, based on more or less single paradigm, too technical. Respectively, the policies based upon the theory could be outdated, and sometimes have got a wrong set of goals. Why it matters? For two main reasons: current students are future policy makers and advisers. So they should have much more modern, broad view. I can add that economy is something which affect us all. We are all within this system (so to speak). And. on the one hand, we all think we know a lot to form an opinion; but in reality the mainstream theory is hard to understand without special knowledge. So it creates a vacuum between “qualified” advisers to the policy makers, academia and the general public plus the politicians who are often even more clueless. Kate decided to redefine the goals of the discipline and the approach she proposes to educate the future economists and the general public. She is “lucky” with the timing as she is writing a decade after the financial crisis, when the mainstream economists totally discredited themselves by “not seeing it coming”. So currently there is more opportunity to challenge the dogma which existed around so-called “neo-classical” model of economics. In preparation of the book, she seemed to plough through a substantial amount of literature representing a variety of current alternative economic paradigms. The ideas per se are not absolutely new, but they have new relevance and she puts them all together. The result is lively and coherent text which represents these ideas in the form understandable to anyone. I can see the big influence of the so-called sustainability economics theory (Herman Daily, Donatello Meadows) on her writing, which is a good thing (IMHO). Also she tends to use the pictures and diagrams to introduce her concepts claming that “one picture is better than thousands words or equations”. (I like the equations very much, but it is just me).The book in its current form is unlikely replace the infamous Econ-01 (Introductory Economics course for the undergrads), but it is a fantastic starting point for this discussion. Personally, I also benefited from updating my knowledge of the modern economic thinking through her Bibliography and found a lot of interesting areas to investigate. The book lacks academic vigour. Some areas are weaker than the others. For example, the areas about theory of money, trade, unemployment are barely touched; the suggested policies for redistribution are vague. I hope she would expand on this or someone else will produce a similar quality book updating the thinking in these areas. Also the Austrians (evolutionary approach) are not mentioned apart from Hayek. And he is mentioned only in the role of devious neoliberal. It is a pity as they would fit her general paradigm. Some people might consider her views as a left-wing leaning.However, her approach is certainly more heterodox and broad than the traditional textbook. Amazingly enough, I found out from different sources the current economic students are not taught the history of economic thought. So they are not exposed to a wide range of ideas (sometimes contradictory) within the historic context. Therefore, this book is the move in the right direction for educating the future economists and stimulating the new debate. It is also a refreshing, well presented and interesting read. Appendix:The best place to receive a quick intro into her ideas is at her website. There are very short animations:www.kateraworth.com/animations/But I will quickly summarise the main point here as well. She calls them “Seven ways to think as 21 century economist:1) Change the Goal - she claims the goal of the current economics is maximising GDP. She says is too narrow (even might be wrong) and she is proposing something which she calls “Doughnut” - finding the balance between sustainable environment and thriving for all the humans (social justice). Strictly speaking, we are talking here more about the goal of economic policies, not the economics as a science in the normative sense of the world - the objective study of the reality. But here we come to the debate whether economics is a science indeed and can it be objective of the abstract human values. Fortunately for us, this is beyond the consideration of her book.2) Tell a New Story - broadly criticising neoliberal script about the dominance of free market and expending it to “embed” the economics in the context of society and nature. She considers the commons, household and the government as important in the economy as the market. She also considers the solar energy as a key production factor which feeds all economic activities. 3) Nurture the Human Nature - This chapter addresses what traditionally would be called “Microeconomics”. It starts with criticising the idea of “Homoeconomicus” - the model of an individual, rationally maximising his utility in economic decision making. She introduces some behaviourist and heuristic ideas about the individuals within the context of economics. Also she demonstrates that in some situations money is not the best way for motivating people within the economy. Though her argumentation is not always clear and one can disagree with some of her statements, this chapter is really a good starting point to find out about the alternative views on the microeconomics assumptions. 4)  Get Savvy with Systems - Broadly addresses the subject of what traditionally called Macroeconomic theory. The orthodox approach is the static model when the economy eventually would achieve an equilibrium of aggregate supply and the demand. She shows why it is the unrealistic model. Her recommendation is to change the approach and move to modelling the dynamic systems; also to look for an analogue of this system in the nature. Again, this approach is shimmering within the environmental economics theory. Also applying the physics theory of thermodynamics has becoming popular between the economists and in finance. I found this chapter the one of the most interesting and plan to read more on this approach.The three last chapters are devoted to the economic policies more than the theory. Also they cover the basics of the theoretical foundations as well. However, I found them a bit more hazy in terms of their practicalities. She admits that it is just a starting point though, and there are a lot of new ideas as well as the traditional ones. 5) Design to Distribute  - She argues the economy should be redesigned in a such a way that there would be embedded mechanisms of the income and wealth redistribution. She criticises the traditional theory that inequality would grow at the initial stage of the economy growth and then would subside by itself in the later stage of the development. (Kuztnets curve). It is not confirmed by the empirical data. She opines: “Far from being a necessary phase, rising inequality is a policy choice.” She also underscores the inequality’s impact on the decline of democracy. Her conclusions are referenced to the modern research and thinking which is included in the bibliography (including Piketty - the french economist who wrote the bestseller “Das Capital in 21th century”. ). Apart from the traditional role of the government, she hopes that the modern growth of creative commons economy through the networks would translate into something bigger like zero marginal cost production and distributed R&D, for example. There are many other ideas and examples of diversifying the economic system.6) Create to Regenerate - She discuses the challenges and progress made to redesign the economy from being degenerative (in relation to the Planet) into the regenerative one.7) Be Agnostic about Growth - probably the most controversial chapter in the book. She argues that the rich countries might think about limiting economic growth to achieve the world’s sustainability. She contrasts the “green growth” vs no growth for the the rich developed economies (while the rest of the world is still targeting economic growth). By “post growth” economy she does not mean that no value is created. Rather, she talks about value creation which is not necessary measured in monetary terms and/or are not created in terms of financial profit (which is basically what GDP is). “We will still generate product and services that people enjoy, but far less of that total value will flow through market transactions.” She appreciates though that our society does not yet know how to live without economic growth. And, in my opinion, she does not have a developed theory (or proposal) on this front as well. She appeals for “many sectoral transformations, including a strong contraction of industries such as mining, oil and gas, industrial livestock, demolition and landfill, speculative finance to be offset by a rapid and lasting expansion of long-term investment in renewable energy, public transport, commons-based circular manufacturing and retrofit buildings.” - That sounds good, but a bit too naive. Nevertheless, it is a certainly relevant area to think about for 21th century economist. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 12, 2017","Jan 10, 2018","Dec 12, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29214420-doughnut-economics

Specifically, i was intrested in the arguments pro and against it and, preferably, an analysis how it is possible to implement, the impact of automation and which steps might be taken right now. But this book is much broader in scope, and at the same time, pretty shallow. The book is more about the current state of the world with inequality, too much work for some and no for the others, the climate change etc.. It states that we need to have some new ideology to tackle these challenges. But it does not go far enough to define this ideology. It proposes 3 broad areas which hypothetically might improve the current state of the world:- basic income; - shorter work hours;- open borders;I am very sympathetic with all three of them. That was partly the reason why I’ve picked up this book. But though it provides the reader with some historic anecdotes, it does not go far enough to specify where are we specifically in terms of those 3 areas; and what has to be done to get us where we want to be. There are some interesting observations and facts. For example, there is a story how president Nixon was on the verge of introducing the basic income in the US but was stopped by another story of the nineteenth-century English Speenhamland plan. There is also information about the experiments in the 70s Canada and Seattle. But what about more current situation - not much! The main illustration is 13 homeless people in London in 2009. 9 of them apparently has reformed their ways (not sure what happened with another 6). There is no information about Swiss referendum on basic income (overwhelming rejected with 77% against) or the Finland experiment which is currently underway. They’ve just briefly mentioned at the end of the book. These discussions would be much more useful going forward than Nixon’s fiasco. It is not even totally clear whether the author proposes to replace all welfare state wth a regular lump sum payment (quite radical libertarian view) or he wants to give people money on the top of everything else.On the shorter work hours, quite a bit of a narrative is focused on criticising “bullshit jobs” (bankers of course, but also the lawyers (hopefully only the corporate ones), consultants, marketers etc - journalists as well?). vs very useful jobs of the NY cleaners. I am sure NY cleaners’ job satisfaction is great and they are all happy as ever. But would this very useful and fantastic job satisfy a bright young person on the basis of bringing the huge public value? I know that the bright kids should all start doing research how to solve the global problems instead of doing “bullshit jobs”. But the main question is “how” and “who would pay for it”? I did not find the answer in the book.The question of open borders is very close to my heart as i seriously believe in it. He is a bit more constructive. He defines 7 perceptive myths about the emigrants. And this discussion is a bit more concrete. But unfortunately, I did not find all of his debunking arguments very convincing. And in this case i cannot see how he can convince someone who is really against this idea. For example, he “debunks” the misconception that all immigrants are criminals. Specially, he talks about the youth crime of the second generation Maroccans in the Netherlands. Apparently, there is no correlation between the ethnicity and the levels of the criminal activity. But that was not the question! The question was is there a correlation between the status (second generation immigrant) and the criminal activity. It is not the same is it? I hope the answer is “no” as well. But such confusion undermines the whole credibility of the debate. And after all “debunking”, he is appeared to be not really very ambitions at all:“Opening our borders is not something we can do overnight, of course - not should it be. Unchecked migration would certainly corrode social cohesion in the Land of Plenty.” (That is after a few pages ago he debunked the misconception that the immigrants are undermining the social cohesion!”) So he is thinking just “making a crack in the door” - increase it on 3% (annually?) or something like that.I do not want to continue listing what i found unsatisfying about this book - you’ve got the picture. There are a lot of pathos and good rhetorics, but that is about it. Apart from a few interesting anecdotes and observations, it was useless for me. It definitely would not make you any wiser if you are interested to find out more about the current theory and practice in the area of basic income. And there are much better books on the state of the world.

I’ve read so far just 3 books by her and she is still to win me over. But the Winter is the best out of three. I had a difficult relationship with this book. I did not want to read it until later when all the hype would subside. But i’ve come across it in my local library at least twice and decided to pick it up then. Even after that, the first 50 pages or so I really did not like it; it felt so bleak - a middle age woman is haunted or befriended by a severed floating child’s head. The word “head” often rhymes there with “dead’. I was tempted to add “mad” from myself. And with the dark-grey short day through my window (I am getting into a rhyming groove here), I was about to put this book aside with its “heads” and “deads” and its self-absorbed misery.But then the new character has appeared - a Croatian girl called Lux who has changed the dynamics of the story and made the characters to wake up towards each other’s company. And from there on, the story has become charming, and whimsical, and hopeful etc. etc. etc.The novel is centred around the unusual family Christmas including two sisters in their 70s; the son of the one of them called Arthur but know as Art (yes, she plays a lot with this); and already mentioned girl, Lux which is hired by Arthur to play a role of his girlfriend (he has had a major row with the real one beforehand). It is appeared to be a bizarre, but very touching set up.Obviously it helped that I shared Smith’s view on the politics with Brexit. Her observations in this respect are pleasantly stingy. For example, she refers to the infamous speech by Teresa May:“You are citizens of the world who’s been working with other citizens of the world to be told you are citizen of nowhere, to hear that the world’s been equated with nowhere by British prime minister Ask them what kind of vicar, what kind of church brings a child up to think that words like very and hostile and environment and refugees can ever go together in any response to what happens to people in the world.”Or about the truth in politics: “Not even you with all your wisdom, all your business acumen and all your natural intelligence can make something not to be true by just declaring it not true.”Being Smith, she is real wordsmith (no pun intended) and she plays with the words, their meanings and lexical allusions with pleasure, excitement and joy. Also as her other novels, this one is brimming with the cultural references. Next time I count how many names and objects of art she mentioned. But it is never excessive or patronising. I can see a pattern in a way how she structure this in two first instalments of the Quartet. She picks up a female visual artist (not very well known) with very interesting life and some involvement in politics. Last time it was Pauline Boty. This time it is Barbara Hepworth (1903 - 1975). (I did not know her at all and the book made me to find out more which I guess was intended.) She picks up a Dickens novel and a Shakespearian play. She also picks up a decade of the 20th century for her political references. This time it is the 80s with non-nuclear protest movement. The last time it was the 60s with Profumo’s affair. All these elements together create the rich tapestry of each novel. And it is never far-fetched or schematic. I also liked that she introduced the plot connection between the two books. Being subtle, it is very poignant, and made me feel more committed to the whole.But what really has won me over, is the relationship between the two old sisters and the grown up son. I can easily relate to the situation as I was growing when my mum and my aunt (who did not have her own family) were playing the similar roles in my upbringing. Both has contributed a lot but in a very different way. In the book being a businesswoman, the mother was a bit detached while Art was a little boy and her sister, the opposite in many ways, the free spirit and political protester, was his main carer. This dynamics of rivalry and competition, sometimes healthy, but often not so healthy is depicted by Smith so poignantly, that it made me almost cry. Especially, because behind all of this eternal bickering and contradictions there is a huge power of love and devotion. And the quote to end:“It would be good to be full of holes… then all the things you can’t express would maybe just flow out.”...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Dec 05, 2017","Dec 11, 2017","Dec 05, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34516974-winter

So I was interested in this comparative analysis. But the book has appeared to be much narrower in the scope. It focuses on the empires’ interaction within the Eastern Anatolia and Caucasus during the Great War of 1914-1918. Also one can tell that the author is more familiar with the Ottoman Empire as the material is presented from its perspective. Apart from stating the fact, not much attention is paid to the crumbling of the Russian Empire. Nevertheless, the book is still very informative and I’ve taken a few important lessons from it. Nationalism in the region “is best understood as a form of geopolitics not as a phenomenon that springs from some non political base”. In other words, the nationalism, which has initially weakened the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and in the Eastern Anatolia did not have a strong local grassroots source in many cases. But instead, it was instigated by the rival states which either wanted to increase their influence within the region or go for the territories’ grab. The situation in the Balkans is more well known while the Bulgarians considered themselves to be Greeks based upon their orthodox religion during the Balkans Wars. Less well known is the situation with the Kurds in Eastern Anatolia. They shared the territory with the Armenians. The Kurds associated themselves with different tribes rather than the Kurdish nation. However, Russia was helping certain local chiefs to raise the revolts against the Ottoman administration (obviously the Armenians were attacked and robed in the process). Reynolds writes: “Ubeydullah (local chief) did not have a nation but he understood the utility of speaking as if he did.” At the same time Russia together with Britain and France required the Ottomans to protect the Armenians often under the threat of military actions. “Now Russia was eroding Ottoman sovereignty in Eastern Anatolia from within and simultaneously attacking that sovereignty from without by calling attention to Istanbul inability to govern the region.” In summary, the nationalism never was a driving force for discontent in the region, instead the nationalism was played as a geopolitical card to help to destroy the rival state. And the irony of the situation, Reynolds underscores, that the most nationally conscious Armenians ended up with just a ramp of the state (which has become the Soviet Republic).The book discusses the facts related the Ottoman Empire’s decision to participate in the World War I and the Armenian genocide in 1915 (though Reynolds never uses the word.) It was really insightful to have a balanced account of the situation. Of course, there is no any justification to what has been done. However, there were factors which made the situation more complicated than it is often presented. The Armenians were revolting at the city of Van which at least facilitated the Russian occupation and cut the important supply roots. The Ottoman administration also witnessed the destruction of 45 thousands muslims in Chorocki by the Russian cosacks just before that. Under the threat of their sovereignty and evidencing that it was possible to shift the borders to suite certain ethnicities elsewhere by other states, the Ottomans reasoned that it should be possible to shift ethnic population around to suite the certain geographic borders. “I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interests, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks it is moral. I am ready to die for what i have done and I know that i shall die for it.” The words belong to Mehmed Taalat, the one of three Pashas of the Young Turks administration, directly responsible for the genocide. He indeed died in Berlin in 1921 from the Armenian bullet…But it seems, this conviction has unfortunately outlived him; and it is rather alarmingly, but continuously used in the higher echelons of politics of nowadays (2016 is full of illustrations to this fact). ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 27, 2017","Dec 06, 2017","Nov 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10196885-shattering-empires

Solar Bones is an internal monologue of a man, Marcus ConIn one sentence, this is “The story of the ordinary life decently lived.” How does it sound? Solar Bones is an internal monologue of a man, Marcus Conway. It is a book written in one sentence. It has received the sufficient amount of recognition in the UK. It was long listed for Booker 2017 and it has won the Goldsmith's prize. It was not the first book written in one sentence I’ve read. I admired Zone written in the same form. In general, I love the stream of conscience writing when the subject matter is fluid and the narrator often goes on tangent. So I thought I would love this book. But I have got a very mixed feelings about it actually.First of all I’ve read the edition with the blurb which gives away a certain significant detail of the plot. The writer wanted it to be that way. There are a lot of discussions on the GR and elsewhere whether it adds to the reader’s experience. For me it certainly did, but I am not sure in a way it was intended. I was reading with quite a strong feeling of foreboding and at the same time impatience. The death and sickness is tangibly present throughout. For example, he and his wife has got a habit to listen to the daily list of people died on the radio before the midday news. I could understand where he is coming from, but it unnerved me quite a bit. Secondly, I like the internal monologues very much, but the narrator’s thoughts should be interesting as well as the narrator’s personality. It is not totally the case here. Marcus is a very decent man who loves his family and cares about his job. But when you’ve got this, he does not have much else to tell really. There are a poignant stories about his relationship with his father and his wife; but his children through his eyes look very schematic. He certainly cares for them, but he does not try to understand them that much. So, it sort of stalls the story. He works as a civil engineer and we are invited into his conversations with politicians, his subcontractors and employees. The main theme, i guess, to show how he tries to be honest and decent in otherwise cynical and corrupted environment. But again, it gets a bit too much: a few pages on construction foundation in a white verse prose… So, after the first half I felt a little restless. The text is carrying you through. In fact, it is difficult to find the place where to stop. And fantastic insightful moments are intermingled with the drudgery expressed in a poetic language. A few times i got a strong temptation to get out of his head. But i am glad i’ve stuck with it as the last 20 pages are the most powerful and beautiful part of the book.Overall, the book has split my thoughts in halves: there are things about it i did not like at all, but there are the last 20 pages as well. Ideally, it would be short enough to read in one sitting. That would certainly make the impact stronger on me.4 stars them (2.5 starts plus 1.5 more for the last 20 pages)...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 23, 2017","Dec 04, 2017","Nov 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29773751-solar-bones

It is structured around dialogues and, sometimes, soliloquies by scores of voices saying a few lines each. There is no “he said/ she said” or even worse “she mumbled slowly” type of stuff. It brings a tremendous space and speed in the narrative. These dialogues are intermingled with the snippets from the real historic accounts and newspapers of the day (America, 1862). First, I had my doubts about those snippets and why does he needs them. But after a while, i realised, they created an additional voice which allows to distance yourself a bit from the immediacy of the rest; also it shows how unreliable our recorded history is.. People remember differently even the shape the Moon on the same evening: some say it was crescent; some say it was full and the other say there where no Moon at all! And later we call these reports “a fact” and trying to teach it to our kids…I would not divulge on the setting, whom the voices belong to, or the plot. There are millions of s out there. And the book is the best place to find out. I only can say that something similar has been done before. “The following story” comes to mind by Gees Noteboom (from the relatively recent fiction). But what is very special here - how he carries you through the sweeping changes of mood, transcended through the language. The language which is sharp as a blade. Each single word you end up caring about. He talks about the dresses which are turned into “Dust. As are the women who wore them so proudly in that transient moment of radiance”. He talks about a rare moment of togetherness between people:  “now, through this serendipitous mass co-habitation we found ourselves (like flowers from which placed rocks had just been removed) being restored somewhat to our natural fullness.”He talks about reconciling with the grief  “that his current state of sorrow was not uniquely his, not at all, but, rather, its like had be felt, would yet be felt, by scores of others, in all times, in every time and must not be prolonged or exaggerated, because, in this state, he could be of no help to anyone..”And he talks about little moments, the grains of reality, which we often do not even register…. until it hits us over sudden how precious and fleeting they are:“The way a moistness in the eye will blur a field of stars…Tying a shoe; tying a knot on a package; a mouth on yours; a hand on yours; the ending of the day; the beginning of the day; the feeling that there will always be a day ahead.”...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Nov 15, 2017","Nov 17, 2017","Nov 15, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

The writing is atmospheric, but slightly overwritten for my taste. For example: ""But right now, with a bright white sun shedding its light onto my pale, thin arms, and thick crispy backon held between two slices of soft, warm bread, I could not have been happier."" This is the sentence which would make my 10 year old proud with the double adjectives attached to each noun. But I found it a bit tedious.

(Nothing wrong with this per se. But it just affected how i perceived the book).

The events take place in a displThis short novel is set within less than 24 hours time frame during the last months of Sri Lanka’s civil war in 2009. The events take place in a displaced people camp on the coast of the ocean. These people physically do not have anywhere to go anymore - they face water. They are Tamils pushed out of their villages by the Government forces fighting Tamil Tigers. They are under constant shelling being methodically annihilated. But there is no politics in the novel. It could happen anywhere where people are made to run from war. The novel starts with extremely graphic scene. It ends with the graphic scene as well. There is a lot of violence throughout. But it is not about violence. It is a study of silence, study of the moment. It tries to investigate what a person, totally traumatised, depraved of any dignity or hope would do or feel. And it is utterly beautiful and successful in it. Dinesh, a very young man, alone in the camp, is bestowed a girl by her father to be his wife. The father does it with a faint hope to protect her as he no longer can himself. And those two young people are awkwardly trying to become closer. Initially Dinesh is not sure he wants to get married as he is not sure how it is the best to spend his days in the presence of death:“Didn’t dying at the end meaning separation from other humans, after all, from the sea of human gaits, gestures, noises, and gazes in which so many years one had floated, didn’t it mean the abandoning the possibility of connecting with other human that being among others always afforded? Unless on the other hand, dying mean being separated from oneself above all, being separated from all the intimate personal details that had come to constitute one’s life. If that was the case should be spend his remaining time committing to memory the shape of his hand and feet, the texture of his hair, fingernails and teeth, appreciating for the last time the sound of his breathing, the sensation of his chest expanding and contracting.”But then he goes for this marriage. This triggers the emotions, the existence of which he has totally forgotten. The author shows how “ the small window of consciousness” suddenly opens for a short period of time in the boy’s traumatised mind. But there is no soapy sentimentality at all in this, just psychological insight. For example, Dinesh thinks about togetherness as a momentary mood which is very easy to scare away, as opposed of loneliness, which is there to stay:“Having put them at last at the presence of such mood such conversation always … had to end… not even a movement could be made, for just as butterfly perched on the edge of a blade of grass, so lightly that the blade quivers slightly but does not bend, can be approached only up to a certain distance before it folds its wings nervously and twitches, after which the slightest noise….will prompt it silently flit away, so they were aware that the mood… could slip away, leaving them stranded once more in their own separate worlds, leaving each one of them once more alone.”Alongside, the novel describes a lot of physiologic details which I would find normally off-putting. But within the context, and with the skill he does it, they seem totally relevant and necessary. Many novelist are trying to write the book set firmly in the “Present”, in the fleeting moment. Not many succeed, but this one does. I cannot imagine how hard it is to write something like that. One has to always balance on the edge not to succumb totally to the state the main character is in. But equally to keep this compassion… The novel read like a series of beautiful and terrifying stills. But notwithstanding the subject matter, violence, realism and brutality, there is sense of if not hope then a glimmer of light in in the book:“He would gaze disbelievingly at the razor-edged vividness that everything around him acquired, as though he’d been lifted somehow from his environment, sifted out of the small section of the world in which he’d been absorbed as though he’d been made aware for a brief moment, of a world vaster than and more independent of him, a world that he had the chance, in some way, to encompass in its entirety.”If Proust would write about the displacement and violence, he might write something similar.

There were beautiful phrases and ideas to think about. But overall, Hamid goals where too ambitious. The issues raised in the novel are quite important and real. But he has not quite succeeded in the depth of his consideration. And the novel has lost its focus after the first part.I liked the style of the novel - he has chosen the fairy-tale type of narrative to deal with the horrors of conflict and misplacement. I liked the first part, especially how he shows the place slowly but surely slides into the conflict zone with people realising it with almost a time lag. They stubbornly try to lead their normal life even after it becomes impossible. I liked also that he has chosen a couple as a vehicle to depict misplacement.But unfortunately, I did not like much else. The narrative becomes much less convincing when he start to mix up misplacement with immigration; tragedy with the impact of globalisation. All these are very acute and current issues. But in my of view, they all deserve much more serious analysis and should not be all mixed in one pot.I could find neither credible nor logical his utopian/dystopian part about the life in London. And then, the couple’s love story did not feel true or credible either. It is difficult to discuss it without spoiling, but I did not feel relevant in which form they did or they did not have sex; and how many times Saeed’s parents used to do it. In my view, the novel would be much more successful if Hamid would narrow down the scope and would lead us to more profound analysis of any of the themes briefly touched there.However, i liked a few quotes below:About sliding towards the war (one might apply it to the politics in general as well):We are “Pottering about our errands as usual and the next we are dying, and our eternally impeding ending does not put stop to our transient beginnings and middles until instant when it does.”On migration:When we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind.On religion’s role in globalisation I guess:Advocating a banding on religious principles, cutting across divisions of race or language or nation, for what did those divisions mattered now were between those who sought the right of passage and those who deny them passage, and in such a world the religion of the righteous must defend those who sought passage.On love:Even if he understood at some level, that to love is to enter into the inevitability of one day not being able to protect what is most valuable to you.Overall, If it would be a debut novel, I would give it 3 starts. But it is not a debut, it is a Booker shortlisted and it is big in his ambition.

And while she is very good describing the feelings of adolescent girls, she is a bit out of her depth when it comes to mothers, babies and the profound transformation of motherhood. I would not blame her for that as she is still young, but for me it was very noticeable. Men in these stories are a little more than the decorations, it seems. (And in one stories they are literally used for food).Two stories which stood out for me were “A bruise the Shape and Size of a Door Handle” where the house appeared to be jealous of the first love of the girl living in it; and “The Superstition of Albatross” about waiting without hope. Another story worth noting is ‘Starver” which is about a girl with anorexia and her sister. The story conveys the powerlessness of anyone to help her and it is deeply moving. However, I’ve seen very similar symbolism in “The Vegetarian” by Hang Kan. And there, it is more beautifully crafted and explored.Overall, it is a promising writer and a worthwhile debut collection.

Though it is beautifully translated I will start with the observation: This is the book that made me regret again that I do not know French or Latin. Though it is beautifully translated into English by Yourcenar’s long time companion, I could feel, that English is not the language for it. The sentences, craftily stylised, all follow the similar structure - main clause followed by a myriad of subordinate clause. In Russian (my native language) it would work fantastically. And, I am sure. in French or Latin it would read beautifully. But in English is it somewhat monotonous - you have to work hard to get to the layer of meaning. However, it is a very rewarding effort at the end.Yourcenar has managed to get into the mind of a person leaving 2 thousands years ago and to write on his behalf. The book is written in the form of the letter from Hadrian, nearing the end of his life, to Marcus Aurelius. Normally, in fiction one can see the writer behind the characters, writing style or even descriptions. One also can see the hindsight knowledge. Not in this book (with minor exceptions described below). The result is really unique - it is not a historical fiction - it is a recreated historical document. While starting reading it, I was asking myself while she picked up Hadrian for this. Fortunately, she gave the answer in the notes. She was reading Flauber’s letter where he mentions the time in the civilisation when the humankind disenchanted themselves from many gods, but the Christianity has not yet filled in the vacuum. So she became interested how people where dealing with the existential problems in that period. The book is very philosophic, dealing with the questions of immortality, love and the morality of empire; all of course from the perspective of Hadrian. It is interesting that in political spheres Hadrian was a supporter of piece and leaving the peoples of the empire to their own devices. Any cults and religions would be tolerated as soon as they do not offend the other. Sounds like a version of a modern religious tolerance in the democracy, I guess. He did not enjoy wars as much as Trajan, his predecessor. But there was one exception: the Jews“No people but Israel has the arrogance to confine truth wholly within the narrow limits of a single conception of the divine, thereby insulting the manifold nature of the Deitry, who contains all; no other god has inspired his worshipers with disdain and hatred for those who pray at different altars.” His generals has fought the campaign and suppressed the Jewish rebellation and made the Jews leave Jerusalem. It is shocking for me to read this (especially knowing what happens in the following two millenniums). However, I believe Yourcenar, that is how a Roman Emperor judge the situation. This ability to believe makes this book so powerful.It is also striking how much the Roman empire was directed to the East. Hadrian has spent the majority of his life dealing with Syria, Egypt, Judea and Greek territories. Yes, he visited Gaul and Britain, but they hardly played any role in the life of the Empire. This is very important to remember, when we study history and all European countries’ myths (including Russia) claim the inheritance of Rome. Only once i’ve managed to see Yourcenar’s silhouette behind the line: “I had long since made comparable exemptions everywhere for doctors and professors in the hope of favouring the survival and development of a serious, well-educated middle class. I know the deficiencies of this calls, but only through it does a State endure.” I do not believe Hadrian talking about the middle class role in the State. However, it might be just my limitations.In all other places Hadrian voice is very lucid. On the meaning of life: “each of us has to choose in the course of his brief life between endless striving and wise resignation between the delights of disorder and those of stability, between the Titan and the Olympian…”. On the destiny of humankind: it needs “perhaps of a periodical bloodbath and descent into the grave. I could see the return of barbaric codes, of implacable gods, of unquestioned despotism of savage chieftains, a world broken up into enemy states and eternally prey of insecurity.”On immortality (in the absence of one God): “Catastrophe and ruin will come; disorder will triumph, but order will too, from time to time… Some of men will think and work and feel as we have done, and I venture to count upon such continuators, placed irregularly through the centuries, and upon this kind of intermittent immortality.”And to finish on the lighter note, this book has reminded me a poem by Josef Brodsky, the Nobel Prize Winner, “The letter to a Roman friend”. The poem, as well as the book, is written in the form of the letter from a Roman leaving somewhere in the provinces to his friend, Postum. Brodsky is genial poet, perfect stylist as well. Respectively he is extremely difficult to translate. This is the best translation I found:Maybe, chicken really aren’t birds, my Postum, Yet a chicken brain should rather take precautions. An empire, if you happened to be born to, better live in distant province, by the ocean. Far away from Caesar, and away from tempests No need to cringe, to rush or to be fearful, You are saying procurators are all looters, But I’d rather choose a looter than a slayer. The full poem is there:https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/lette...PSYourcenar was a very colourful interesting character by herself.

The same laborious writing and the mix of historical fact with fiction when you cannot really make a difference what is his opinion what is the fact. Also i found irritating that there is no dialogue, instead the encounters between the people are described through the internal monologue of the main character in the chapter. It works once or twice, but then it feels pompous.There where are few stronger parts. The complexity of romantic feelings of the main character stuck between two women - his wife and his new lover- is very honestly and emotionally depicted. I did not like the man. But I believe that such man does exist, then and now.From the historical perspective, the novel has nudged me to look for more information about Parvus. He appears in the novel in conversation with Lenin about financing the Bolsheviks and moving back to Russia from Zurich. I did not know about his existence at all. He appeared to be quite a character who took part together with Trotsky in masterminding the revolution of 1905 and later was collaborating with the Germans in financing under-cover operatives on the Russian territory. I certainly will try to find out more about his role. But unfortunately, Solzhenitsyn was not very helpful in terms of the facts in this area either. Apart from it his historical narrative is represented by lengthy extracts from the Duma's sitting protocols and reminded me the notes from a lecture by a diligent, but not very proactive student.I think i had enough of this epos and try to read the proper history about the period instead. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Oct 12, 2017","Oct 23, 2017","Oct 12, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18490558-november-1916

It is designed to be 10 volumes' chronicles devoted to the events which has lead to the Revolution of 1917. So the parts about the fictional characters are alternated by the parts about real historic figures and events. The construction is complex and really awkward. Initially the fictional parts were relatively lively with interesting set of characters and several story lines. But the gaps between dropping a particular line and coming back to it are too big to emphasise with the characters. So i stopped caring about the fictional parts.The historical chronicle is meticulously detailed and relatively slow moving. His method is to pick a historical event or a figure and drill so dip that it becomes overwhelming after a while. This book is devoted to two main themes: the beginning of the First World War from the perspective of the Russian front; the personality and the achievements of Pietr Stolypin, the Russian Prime Minister and strong leader, who was assassinated in the Kiev Opera in 1911 by a terrorist (at the same time the informer of the police), Merdco Bogrov. Those two historical figures are juxtaposed to each other for obvious reasons. But if Stolypin's life seems to be based on numerous sources, Bogrov's life and his motivation seems to be presented in more fictional way - it is unclear how Solzhenitsyn has compiled it. Solzhenitsyn presents him as a lonely, evil revolutionary who wanted to outsmart everyone (including the Okhrana) and succeeded. While for me, with the hindsight of another century, it seems more likely that he was the hand of the state secret service. There is a little episode about Lenin travelling to Zurich and this one is more readable. That is the only reason why I would try to read the second instalment of these chronicles. However, if one even manage to ignore monarchist, nationalist ideology (Russia is unique country in which democracy should be very different from the Western one - sounds familiar isn't it?) which is streaming from every page, it is still not very well written book.I've never read Solzhenitsyn before, so my view is based only upon this book. I've started the second part already (November 1916) and it is going a bit easier sofar. I do not think i plan to finish all 10 volumes. I will finish the second book and then probably dip into the rest. I read in original Russian.PSAbout the war - that the part i was not particularly interested, so I might misinterpreted some details, but the general story is relatively traditionally told - courageous soldiers, especially from the peasant backgrounds, treacherous, cowardly and incompetent HQ. Lies at the papers. I think the readers who are interested in the detailed description of the war from the Russian point of view and possess the initial knowledge on the subject, might find it more interesting than i did....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Oct 04, 2017","Oct 12, 2017","Oct 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18490537-august-1914

Though it might, if my book would have the opposite order as I did not like the second story that much. However, the first story was very poignant, natural and vividly told - it was about the 16 year old girl who has just lost her mum to unexpected allergic reaction. And it is how she copes with her grief. Profound, sincere and penetrating, it touches the themes of identity, the healing power of art and friendship. And I really enjoyed to be in the company of this quirky girl, her brother and her friend. But relatively suddenly at the middle her story has been converted into the story of the 16th century painter. And it did not work for me at all. Initially I liked the tone of the almost Faulkneresque introduction with abrupt sentences. But then it has all whizzed out into a period piece which was not very interesting and authentic. As I said, there was a connection to the first story, but i wanted the girl to be back properly. The common theme through the whole book is the fluidity of gender. I think, three years since the publication made quite a difference how it reads. I think, if i would read it in 2014, it might be more cutting edge.

It is incredibly difficult for me to confess, but I did not like it as a whole. Having read Anna Karenina or even Eugene Onegin, I subconsciously compared the main heroines of these novels to Emma. And she did not stand a chance with her capricious and self-absorbed character. Through all her life, I do not think, she has loved a single person, including herself. At least, it is how I read Flaubert’s rendition of her. It is the one of those books written by a man about a woman to give the audience some kind of a moral lesson. But i did not want to be lectured, even in an indirect way.I liked the social observations in the novel and descriptions of the provincial life in the 19th century’s France. I like the black humour and the satire element of the book. I know the lesson I should have from Emma's downfall - this bourgeoisie society with its stale moral has created her as she was. But I do not believe it. Emma came across as neurotic, confused, reckless and spoiled woman. Or it might be, I am spoiled by the complexity of female characters in Russian classic literature.Unfortunately I do not know French. It might be another explanation why i did not like the book.

Different inHave you ever listen to a piece of music when there is this reoccurring theme which repeats, but each time sounds different all the same. Different instruments taking a lead, different pitch and harmony of sounds, but the same measured rhythm, the same notes.  It sucks you in like a whirlpool, in spite of you knowing more or less what comes next. And each time it sounds fresh.  This is how this book feels.  It is structured into 13 chapters corresponding to 13 years, each with the broadly similar cycle of events. There are many individual characters each is acting like a very short instrumental solo and then going back into the background to give the place to someone else. It is interesting study how you can develop a character fully with a few sentences devoted to them every 20 pages or so. But that is how the main character- the collective consciousness of the village - comes alive with the foxes mating, grass growing, stones falling and people going through the different stages of life and relationships. He does not even use the inverted commas for the dialogue (did Joyce called them “perveted” commas?). I think, it is to underline this wholeness of the narrative, the wholeness of that collective being.    Having read “If nobody speaks of remarkable things” so many years ago, I cannot refrain from comparing these two books. And I still like the first one more. But maybe, because it is set in urban environment and I am totally city person, or maybe i was different and it felt more dramatic. But this book is quietly wonderful as well.McGregor is inventive without being pretentious. This poignant narrative shows how, whatever we do, the life tends to be repetitive but random at the same time.

It would not be a problem per se, but too many adjectives related to a cloud or a sunset often distracts from the imminent action. Also if I would drink and eat ,and smoke so many different things as the characters do within 24 hours, I would probably not be able to write any s for very long time.The plot is a bit far fetched - everyone is hunting everyone in the book. Sometimes even the author is “hunting” for a swiping generalisations and metaphors which do not totally make sense to me: “The Khmers did not have time to lecture themselves or others. They were young and wounded, but their wounds were so deep, that they could be ignored for a while.” ???I did not like the main character, though I easily can imagine such a type. I guess, I try to say i did not like the author sympathising with him by making another character calling him “innocent”. The minor characters are more vivid and 3 dimensional though.But I liked the social observations featured in the book, especially the axis of interaction between the locals and the expats and their mutual perceptions. For example, the main character, Robert is reflecting on a person he has met the first time: “Davuh, he felt, was much deeper than himself because he had lived the most dangerous life. The gift of dangerous life, swiftness of thought, a fine capacity for hatred. You did not meet that type in the developed countries anymore.” At that moment Robert does not know that the man is corrupted violent policemen and former teenage soldier in Khmer Rouge. This misplaced awe by the expats of the locals’ “authenticity” sounds very familiar to me based upon Russia’s 90s. On the other hand, a local, well-to-do, doctor reveals how he perceives the West: “You destroy people in order to make the idea live. Its a uniquely Western kind of behaviour”. Although i would disagree it is a uniquely Western behaviour, I understand why it seems like that to him.It was my first book by Mr Osborne. It did not put me off. But equally I was not totally wowed by this book either. It seems, his recent book “Beautiful animals” is better and I plan to read it at some stage. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 18, 2017","Aug 24, 2017","Aug 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25387388-hunters-in-the-dark

The first 20 pages are really promising, and I am interested in the subject matter. The novel is set in the modern day Pakistan. But after a good start it went downhill for me. The violent act after violent act, the horror, after horror, after horror - and all of this without deeper psychology or desire to analyse each of these acts. There is a clear divide between “good’ characters and “bad” characters which seems as a simplification to me. Some characters seem to appear only to be killed or commit suicide in the next page. The main characters do not seem to have very deep feelings related to those endless deaths. Maybe because of the sheer amount of violence and the characters’ attitude I stopped to empathise with anyone in this novel pretty soon. For the realistic rendering of the situation it is too much in one go which makes the novel grasping for coherence. If it is used as the symbolism, it is not subtle enough. Some visual images Aslam creates in the novel are really beautiful. There are some interesting ideas as well. For example, the one minor character says he does not despair yet about his country because he does not feel he made enough for this country be better place. I would be interested to read more expanded discussion about it. Some facts he shares are really interesting. But the novel as a whole has got too much symbolism and lacks the depth for me. The novel mentions that in spite of all the horror the ordinary Pakistanis “finding pockets of love and comfort within the strict laws governing them”. I wish these quite human emotions would be more visible in the book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 14, 2017","Aug 17, 2017","Aug 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32490642-golden-legend

He approaches this subject from the variety of angles: logic, neuroscience, mathematics, music and visual art and finds a lot of analogies in these areas.

If you deprive people of the infinitely great, then they will stop living and die in despair. "" Demons, F. DostoyevskyI was reluctant to start this book. There is so much hype surrounding it. Plus, I’ve read DFW’s two collections of stories, and they did not impress me as a whole - some of them are gems, but some of them where totally unreadable. You could see, he struggles to contain himself within the space of a short form fiction. The most importantly, I knew quite a lot about him. Somehow he resurfaced in different places and different sources, especially after his suicide, and he fascinated me enormously as an individual. I stared into the black abyss of his intelligence combined with the fragility of his personality and felt really insecure to pick up this book. You know, very rarely, but sometimes, you meet a person who is not simply smart, but has got this depth like a well - you look there and you see - it is deep, so deep that it is almost invisible where the water starts; and you know you would never be able to see the bottom in a dark water. It is not that you feel stupid in comparison, you simply feel scared and overwhelmed… Overwhelmed probably in the same way, as if you would be thrown into the Space, and see these endless galaxies getting closer, but never close enough. And you cannot explain yourself, why it is so terrifying, while it is so beautiful...I did not know much about the novel though. I’ve forbidden myself to read anything about it before I started actually reading it. I knew of course “addiction and entertainment” bit and the cult status (which was actually a bit off-putting). But eventually I decided the moment has come: and here I am - on the other side of the cover. And I am really grateful I’ve done it. It was totally unique experience. I never read a book which triggers such a combination of frustration and awe that the frustration becomes the awe by itself.As any great work of literature, it could be perceived on many levels mixing together the writer’s and the reader’s unique experiences; provoking the continuum of emotions, feelings and thoughts. For me there were two important ways of looking at this book:Existential level  “It now lately sometimes seems like a kind of black miracle to me that people could actually care deeply about a subject or pursuit, and could go on caring this way for years on end. Could dedicate their entire lives to it. It seemed admirable and at the same time pathetic. We are all dying to give our lives away to something, maybe. God or Satan, politics or grammar, topology or philately - the object seemed incidental to this will to give oneself away, utterly. To games or needles, to some other person. Something pathetic about it. A flight-from in the form of a plunging-into. Flight from exactly what?”This is the quote from the novel and the question which seems to be the central one for DFW. He would not give you the answer, but he would make you desperately search for it… Maybe, it is a flight from unhappiness and loneliness… Exactly not to happiness but from unhappiness. He makes this distinction between prepositions “from” and “to” (applying it to the classic phenomena of positive and negative freedom) in the novel. And, I think, here it is important. This “flight from” would be a motivation to lose yourself in someone else creation and sometimes to misstep the thin line between entertainment and addiction. This novel for me is a map of the huge, complex and tragic being of DFW himself. I think, it is not random that he uses the noun “map” to signify someones head and more broadly - personality. Borgesian conundrum comes to mind ""whether the writer writes the story, or it writes him”. No writing could be more personal than this novel:- his experiences of tennis as more broad metaphor for desire to achieve, beauty and ability to face with your own physical limitations, ability to look beyond the fame; the fact that when you achieve any goal, it rarely brings the feelings of relief you hoped for… - depression - I’ve never in my life read such a powerful description of the Black Dog. The precision and ruthlessness of his language makes you really feel this abyss. He’s fought with this the whole of his adult life and eventually lost.- even his tendency for excessive sweating is reflected in the novel. There is a character, some kind of a guru, who literally helps tennis students to solve their life issues by listening to them while licking their sweat. - addiction and recovery - again, only person living through it could write about it with such lucidity. You can see, that he finds, at least partially, a solace among these simple people at AA meetings and half-way house; each of them with their own story of struggle. You can see, how he is surprised that their non sophisticated and not coherent philosophy is somehow more powerful than any mathematically rigid and philosophically cold reflection the humankind as a whole has come up with. But most importantly, this novel is a scream to be understood, to expose yourself as complex, vulnerable and defenceless as you are, to share yourself with other people. Not to be lonely:“Forget about so-called peer pressure. It’s more like peer-hunger. NO? We enter a spiritual puberty where we snap to the fact that the great transcendent horror of loneliness, excluded encagenent in the self. Once we hit this age, we will now give or take anything, wear any mask, to fit, be part-of, not be Alone.”But DFW does not want or just cannot “wear any mask”. He writes this book instead… he does not try at all to make it easy, he is not thinking about people who will read it. He badly wants them to get it, but he wants the readers to get it on his own terms without dumbing it down or chew it for them.Is it so different from what Rilke felt almost 100 years before him: “In everything which so dear and vital to us we are undescribingly lonely” ? The eternal curse the humanity is struggling with carrying away the great literature as its shield…Loneliness, to some extent, is another side of the individualism; or rather of the perception that each of us is totally unique and very complex. We really want to believe in it, especially, when it is so much propagated through our culture… Of course it is true, to some extent. However, there is this something which is bigger than any of us individually, which come to the existence only when we come together. As all our complexities can exist only if there is at least one other person who can understand them, or something different, something greater than a single human being…It is certainly a unique novel. However, it is very traditional great novel in terms of the questions it asks. Dostoyevsky was looking for “something bigger”. He’s founded it in Christian God. DFW is not so certain. He keeps searching…“But you never know when the magic will descend on you. You never know when the grooves will open up. And once the magic descends you don’t want to change even the smallest detail. You don’t know what concordance of factors and variables yields that calibrated can’t-miss feeling, and you don’t want to soil the magic by trying to figure it out, but you don’t want to change your grip, your stick, your side of the court, your angle of incidence to the sun. “ It is about tennis, it is about any creative process, it is about this novel and it is about life…Trickster levelNow, forget about everything above. I am starting again. Why “Infinite Jest’ as a title? Yes, Shakespeare’s Hamlet. But also there is this another matter. DFW plays with you all the way along. All through 1000 pages. And he does not let you settle into the text at all. The Beginning - you do not understand what is going on, you do not understand who are those people and voices. It does not make sense. It becomes frustrating and boring. If i would not find the audio of the novel on Youtube and if i would not need to iron 20 shirts, I would probably give up. But after around 100 pages it suddenly becomes to make sense: “You never know when the magic will descend on you”. And then, I picked up the proper book again and it has been with me for the next few weeks.The Plot - I was almost disappointed when, 400 pages in the book, i’ve realised there is a plot and the very tight one indeed (even if a bit too melodramatic in parts). By that time, I’ve started to enjoy the novel without a visible story line or gradient.Overall his approach is very cinematic. The structure is very disruptive - he moves from one seemingly unconnected scene to another exactly at the moment when you at least expect it. He also uses micro views, which i absolutely admired. He would describe some detail in a way as if you can see through the lens, framing. A fragment, that we are used to perceive with our eyes, but never form a conscience thought about:“He sits in the blue chair with a trembling Styrofoam cup of coffee and a paper plate of brownies into which he taps ashes from the cigarettes whose smoke the air conditioner blows straight back over his head.”And such stuff just keeps you in the book reading each single word, even though sometimes in becomes frustratingly boring, but very rarely for long. And you never know when something boring or technical is going instantly to turn into something shockingly brilliant.I would not talk here about the lexicon and the footnotes - a lot said about it elsewhere.And yes, the novel as a whole sounds like “it was real life’s real egalitarian babble of figurantless crowds, of the animate world’s real agora, the babble 342 of crowds every member of which was the central articulated protagonist on his own entertainment.”The Ending - where is the ending? Here the substance and the form of this novel really unite. And you understand the “infinite jest” quite literally. I, as many before me, went to the beginning. And those, the most frustrating first hundred pages, would start to make so much more sense that- i dare say- they have become the core of the novel! Though the second time around, it has filled me with such an existential sadness, that it is the time to come back to the beginning of this .PSJust a few thoughts:- this is certainly the one of the top 5 novels i’ve ever read. And it is the one of the hardest top 3. The other two were “The Man without qualities” and “Magic mountain”. However, in both of these cases i did not enjoy it 1/10th as much as I’ve enjoyed IJ.- if i’ve read the foreword by D Eggers beforehand, it would put me off for life. I do not recommend to read it before the book.- i wonder why no one really compared this novel to Bolano’s 2666. I felt a lot of similarities, not at least the presence of a trickster who exists somewhere beyond the novel and beyond the reality in a forth dimension, but directs the novel from there.- probably a banality, but he’s certainly influenced the generation of modern writers, and now his voice is disseminating through them. I now recognise it, for example, in a “Brief history of seven killings” by Marlon James which i’ve read much earlier. - just two more quotes:“No matter how smart you thought you were, you are actually was less smart that that.”“It’s always seemed a little preposterous that Hamlet, for all his paralysing doubt about everything, never once doubt the reality of the ghost. Never questions whether his own madness might not in fact be unfeigned.”...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Apr 06, 2017","May 12, 2017","Apr 06, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest

I’ve read the book in Russian, and normally I would  it in Russian as well. But I think the Demons are unjustDemonsFirst of all, a little note. I’ve read the book in Russian, and normally I would  it in Russian as well. But I think the Demons are unjustifiably overshadowed in the West by other Dostoevsky novels. So I wanted to write something to change the situation a bit.It is the most powerful novel by Dostoevsky. It is more profound than schematical “Crime and Punishment” and much less preaching than “Karamazovs Brothers”, though the later one is building upon the “Demons”. It is the only big novel by him which contains a strong political element along with the traditional psychology and his religious thinking. Some of the main protagonists are revolutionary terrorists. The similar people would kill the Russian reformist tsar Alexander II just a few years after the novel was finished. Among other things, Dostoevsky demonstrates, how the pure desire of power could corrupt soul. I do not have sufficient knowledge of the world’s history, but I think the revolutionary sects in Russia of the second half of the19th century have become the pioneers of using the terror for their purposes in its modern meaning of the word. Anna Geifman, the American scholar, in her book ""Death Orders: The Vanguard of Modern Terrorism in Revolutionary Russia"" shows a lot of similarities between the Russian terrorists and nowadays’ terrorists:“Converting concrete grievance into messianic aspirations and practical purposes into holy causes, they operate within distinctive parameters of a theology of Armageddon a final battle between good and evil in which at stake in no less than universal salvation.”It is a very modern novel in many other ways. The methods those terrorists (on the radical left) use could be a primer for the radical right who supported Trump in the recent elections: fake news; making everyone confused and disoriented; spread rumours as true facts and play on liberals’ impotency in certain issues; marginalising and discrediting the authority - all these ""tools"" are described in the book. I was shocked to find so many analogies with our time. However, the main purpose of the novel (imho) to show what a spiritual emptiness can do to a human nature. How unresolved individual existential crisis and the search for completeness might lead to a disaster. For those who read the novel for the first time, it is an imperative to read the chapter “At Tikhon’s” after the end of the part ii of the novel. Currently, they publish it as an Appendix. It was censored out by the Russian authorities at that time on the basis of its “unbearable realism”. It is a shocking and revelatory chapter summarising the essence of the novel. And it is impossible to understand and appreciate the novel with leaving the reading of this chapter to the end. In spite of all the bleakness, it is a very funny novel. I’ve read it for the first time when I was 17. And then it was shocking and tragic. When I’ve read it now, it has come across more like a farce. Generally, one needs to read Dostoyesky novels during the one’s teens, while you ask all those big questions about the meaning of life and look for the answers…. I think that is why Nabokov was quite cold about Dostoevsky: according to him, Dostoyevsky is not an artist.. May well be, I personally do not totally share his religious and historiographic views. But his work creates a huge impact on a different level - it is not about language, it is about daring to go deep into the darker side of human nature and coming back from there constantly balancing…I finish with the quote from the article by Rowan Williams: “What makes it (the Demons) so well worth reading now is its unsparing vision of what destructive forces come into the world when there is a vacuum of spiritual understanding. “По-русскиИзвестное высказывание, что история первый раз происходит как трагедия и повторяется второй раз как фарс.

But, I guess, the author is pioneering the new area in a wider public discourse. I could not find any other mainstream, relatively impartial and newer book on the subject. What I liked about the book was the detailed and clear analysis of the current economic trends, such as the decline of labour share in GDP, inequality, inability of recent graduates to find suitable jobs etc. What i did not find so convincing was the casual link between the exponential technology development and the depicted future apocalypses (aka feudal society with closed-gate communities and the crowds of savages around it). I’ve read thoroughly the described trends in the automation and the AI. They actually appeared less scary than I thought. For example, I thought 3D printers could in future replace all production lines (silly me). Apparently, they would be used more like our home printers now for small unique objects. The book of course talks about much bigger variety of technological advances and which jobs potentially would go. But overall the scale of the evidence presented is not matching with the bleak social scenario depicted in the later chapters.The main risk according the the author is the lack of jobs would lead to the sharp drop of mass consumption which would initiate the downward spiral. in the economy. I would argue though, that a bit less consumption would not hurt. We all complain about consumerism and its impact on our culture and the environment. I know that the impact should be monitored, and stopped at some stage, but per se, it is not such a bad thing.Fortunately, when i was getting closer and closer to the end of the book, feeling more and more desperate and grim, the author came to my help and gave me the glimpse of hope:“While the machines clearly seem destined to take on more and more work over time, there is no question that the economy will remain heavily dependant on human labor for the foreseeable future.”I personally think, the inequality, or climate change, or geopolitical issues (how silly is that in the 21st century!) might get us to that bleak feudal reality quicker, unfortunately, if we do not tackle them. Fortunately, the suggested remedies offered by the author might (if taken seriously) help to solve the current economic issues: universal income; investment into infrastructure; increased productivity (especially for the UK). He is a bit more sceptical about education - he considers it as a minimum requirement not to fall behind the curve. But imho, the school education level in maths and computer science in the UK and in the US is so primitive that by improving it one would definitely increase productivity. The book has also brought me some revelation: apparently Hayek was supporting the universal income in some form. There is a proper reference on his work in the book. I just put a quote here:“A society that has reached a certain level of wealth can afford to provide for all.”I cannot imagine Koch brothers or their tea-party grassroots quoting this one.

Jane Mayer has invested a lot of her talent, courage and energy in investigating and telling the story of systematic attempt in privatising the democratic process in the US. The book tells the story how Koch brothers and a few others from 1% of 1% billionaires in the US has built the whole infrastructure of influence in the politics. Eventually, they’ve almost succeeded supplant the Republican party (according to the author).They’ve started 30 years ago from building the network which would allow them to start the battle of ideas (extreme free market ideology). In the 30 years they managed to build up the whole system - think-tanks; nonforprofit organisations through which they can donate money without the trace; grass root movement (allegedly tea-party is their creature). This network has helped them to win the majority in the Congress and totally derail Obama’s agenda while he was in the White house.Of course the book is not balanced - you can see only what drives the process from the right. But there is no comparative picture from the left. So it is difficult to form an opinion why (and if) the democratic institutions in the US do not represent the public any longer. However, the lack of transparency in the network of this people, indoctrination of the academia, influence on the rewriting the borders for congress election and many other things are simply shocking and cannot be right. They preach the entrepreneurial spirit and demonise the government. They quote Hayek and think that anyone is free to chose to be rich or poor. That would be wonderful. But characteristically, there is not a single first generation millionaire in this book - all of them are heirs to the huge fortune. On these grounds, I am not surprised they wanted to stay in the shadow of their creation to keep it credible. The attitude of these people towards the environment and the poor is simply selfish. Reading it I felt how Jane Mayer hates this bunch. Initially I was cautious, because in theory there is nothing wrong to expose people to different ideas in a pluralistic society. But the more I read the more I started to feel the same thing. Especially, hateful I found the story about the North Caroline where these people have managed to gain the control over the local legislature. They slashed the taxes and the spending. But not simply that. They had a go at a decent public education system (and this I find the most abhorrent):“The assault was systematic. They authorised vouchers for private school but put a vice squeezing on public schools budget. They abolish the incentives for teachers to earn higher degrees and reduced funding for pre-school in spite voters will. “it’s sad and blatant” (said - the Professor of English in the State University) - Pop (the local billionaire who got elected) “succeeds in getting higher education defunded, and then uses those cutbacks as a way to increase the leverage and influence over course content.” They also sponsored history project, which aimed to reorient state’s teaching by providing online lesson plans for high school teachers that downplayed the roles of social movement while celebrating “the creation of wealth”. So much for critical thinking in education.A few days ago Betsy DeVos (prominently features in the book) has become the educational secretary in spite of sheer demonstration of ignorance throughout the confirmation hearing. Lets see how she fairs.Some people said they feel sad after reading this book. I do not feel sad. I feel angry, but a bit hopeful as well - Mr Trump, being just blatant populist and the lier (no respect for him) has managed to win against all these money. As did Obama in 2012. So in spite of being immensely influential, this network did not appear to be 100% effective.

It is a rarity to come across such an extremely clever, emotionally intelligeFirst of all, I have to say that I absolutely admired the author’s work. It is a rarity to come across such an extremely clever, emotionally intelligent and compassionate researcher. To be honest, I always believed that sociology is pretty useless as a profession and the field of study - some hybrid spin-off from the anthropology mixed with economics. But Mrs Hochschchild has proved me wrong. This book is based on 4 years of her research into the lives and beliefs of the republicans’ supporters in Luisiana, (most of them are tea party members). She came across paradox - Luisiana is highly polluted state with high record of dreadful industrial accidents and environmental disasters. Some people she talked to were the direct victims of this. However, they do not consider this issue as a cornerstone of their political demands, even if it would be totally in their economic and health interest. Mrs Hochschild takes this issue as a tool for helping to understand how is that possible. She courageously attempts to break “the empathy wall” between her and these people. (Which is a risky business - i would definitely suffer either from the cognitive dissonance or Stockholm syndrome).During her research she came to the conclusion that the values and beliefs of these people are the result of their feelings rather than their economic or other rational self interest: the feelings of their sense of honour, pride, but also anger, humiliation and fear. Mrs Hochshild constructs a metaphoric visualisation which she calls “a deep story”. “A deep story is a feels-as-if story -it’s the story feelings tell, in the language of symbols. It removes judgement. It removes fact. It tells us how things feel.”Imagine a long queue to get to American dream. Those people were told all their life if they work hard and obey the law, they would get their eventually. So they are patiently standing in the middle of this line (They are predominantly white, middle aged, male, Christian). The line has stopped moving and it feels even that it moves backwards. But they are not complaining (complains are for the “poor-dears” on welfare), though they feel stuck. They are used to endure the difficulties. And now they see people are cutting in front of them: “Black, women, immigrants, refugees, brown pelicans - all have cut ahead of you in line. But it’s people like you who made this country great. You feel uneasy It has to be said: the line cutters irritate you. They are violating rules of fairness. You resent them, and you feel it’s right that you do. So do your friends. Fox commentators reflect your feelings…And now you’ve been asked to extend the sympathy to all the people who have cut in front of you.” So they feel betrayed. They feel patronised, as in their view, they are told what they should feel, without naturally having those feelings. “Liberals are saying your ideas are outmoded, sexist, homophobic, but you are not clear what their values are”.Their daily reality and political views are constructed on the basis of this story. Of course social- economic factors exist: demographics (less and less white people), religion - belief in rupture for example, disappearing of blue colour jobs. But it is appeared to be secondary to their perception of the world.Mrs Hochschild describes quite a few of individual cases. Some of those people are easier to relate to than the others. Some of them are really the victims of circumstances around them, such as dreadful environment. Although you cannot call them “victims” as they do not like that word. But for certain cases, I have to admit, even reading their perceptions is very hard. For example, there is that woman in her early 60s, college educated with the stable white collar job. She thinks: 1) “Liberals do not give personal morality is full due, probably because they are not churched”; 2) to give some people jobs America needs to dig up veterans’ graves from WWII and bring them from France as “it has not been a good friend” 3) “there is a positive side of the war- manufacturing missiles, Humbles, sewing uniforms - it’s work.” 4) to create democracy on the Middle East everyone there should be handled the gun. “If the government takes the guns away. The same thing as the Middle East would happen here as people would no be able to stand for themselves.”It is difficult to get over the state of shock and anger when you read such a view. But it is very necessary, as otherwise the whole democratic way of life might be at stake. Mrs Hochschild thinks that there are ways to bridge this abyss - there are issues which could unite people from the different side of the empathy wall. So it is worth trying.Initially, I thought that people who support populists and demagogues are uneducated, ignorant bunch, misguided by the media (some of them are plain stupid). But this book has revealed much deeper roots of the problem.

According to the author, the one of This book is about how the rhetoric affects the quality and the effectiveness of the political and social debate. According to the author, the one of the reasons of the crisis in the mainstream politics is the crisis of public language.Through the history of the political discourse from the 70s (of the last century) and up to now, he manages to build a convincing argument in favour of this hypothesis. He analyses the changes through looking at the language and attitudes of the politicians, the press and the general public. All his examples are based upon the UK and the US process (however, often they have a global angle as well). He manages to stay politically impartial in the vast majority of cases through the book. Additionally, he talks about the theory of rhetoric, persuasion and the snippets of the Western Philosophy which impacted the subject. I've never read anything about the rhetoric, so it was really fascinating to find out the meaning of many greek words and their application.I liked the chapters about the modern language of war, science and the freedom of speech. I do not want to retell here his insights, but they are sufficiently revealing and thought-provoking.

In these 20 years it did not lose any urgency. Is 20 years such a short term for the civilisation or dThis book has been written almost 20 years ago. In these 20 years it did not lose any urgency. Is 20 years such a short term for the civilisation or does the author touch upon the eternal issue? I do not know… But I found this little book very thought provoking . I’ve highlighted probably the half of it. So it was difficult to choose what to mention here… Mr Maalouf’s language is lucid, the ideas are profound, even if some of them might seem simple. I think, this is because they are very well articulated. I admire author’s courage and persistence of working through them patiently. The main premise is that our identity is multidimensional. There are numerous parts of it. And only its entirety makes every human being unique. However, if any part of our identity is threatened externally (be it ethnicity, nationality, class or religion), this part becomes domineering and might lead to many irrational and ugly manifestations. With this phenomena, he explains the bloody conflicts throughout the history of 20th century and our time.He points out that reciprocality between different human beings and between the person and the society would help to diminish this risk. His main illustration is the relationship between an immigrant and the host nation. (He is a Lebanese adopting France as his host country for the last 40 years.) He considers immigrants as bridges between the two worlds which ideally would help to cement the relationships between different nations. But he talks about two extremes: 1) immigrant thinks he could establish his little world and impose his traditions on the local population; or 2) the host country tries to make the immigrant totally reject his own cultural heritage. In both cases the person involved would face with severe contradictions within his own identity which would lead to a crisis. I’ve read recently a book where the main character was a girl of a mixed race. She posed herself constantly with the question “Which tribe do I belong to?” Following Mr Maalouf’s view of the world, it would be much easier for her to embrace both white and black “tribes”- or even better - to forget about the “tribes” all together and embrace herself as she is as a whole human unique being. I know that it is easier said than done. Especially when in the developed world, the identity politics is so fashionable and gives the politicians so much power to hypnotise people with rhetorics and then divide and rule…Mr Maalouf reflects on the phenomena of the globalisation a lot. He thinks, the globalisation makes literally everybody in the world feel marginalised to a certain extent (sorry for a lengthy quote):Everyone nowadays felt himself to be living to a certain extent in a minority, in exile. This is because all communities and cultures have a sense that they are up against others stronger than they, a feeling that they can no longer keep their heritage safe. Looked at from the South and the East, it is the West that dominates. Looked at from Paris, it is America that holds sway, But if you go to the United States, then what do you see? You see minorities reflecting all the diversity in the world, all needing to assert their original allegiances. And when you have met all these minorities and been told a hundred times that power is in the hands of white males, or of Anglo-Saxon Protestants, you suddenly hear the sound of a huge explosion in Oklahoma City. And who are the people responsible? Some white male Anglo-Saxon Protestants who regard themselves as members of the most neglected and despised of minorities, and who believe that globalisation is sounding the knell of “their” America. In the eyes of everyone else Timothy Mc Veigh and his supporters belong to the same ethnic group as those who are supposed to dominate the planet. In their own eyes they are merely an endangered species, with no other weapon available to them but the most murderous terrorism.Mr Maalouf’s response to the complexity of the world is by trying to reconcile all complex allegiances within oneself and try not to threaten others. “Everyone should be able to recognise himself in the symbols and no one feel excluded in the global narrative. Neither on a world scale nor within any society should anybody feel scorned, depreciated, mocked or demonised or be ashamed of his colour religion, language, name or any other ingredient of identity.” And, in future “Identity would then be seen as the sum of all our allegiances and within it allegiance to human community itself would become increasingly important until one day if would become the chief allegiance though without destroying our many individual affiliations.” It is just a vision of course. But I find it much more palatable than any alternatives which are so trendy nowadays.There are a lot of other issues discussed in the book: the role of islam in the modern day’s insurgencies and terror; the language and identity; modernism etc. I would pause only on one more remark he makes:“It would be terrible for the country have more reverence to its past than to each future”.How incredibly urgent it sounds when Russia is building its ideology on the nostalgia over the country which does not exist for a quarter of the century. And the the next American president has won the election by proposing “making America great again”. Mr Maalouf is very profound thinker and this book deserves a broad readership so everyone could pick up something enriching her/his world view (even if he/she disagrees)....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 05, 2017","Jan 13, 2017","Jan 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/212932.In_the_Name_of_Identity

Apologies!3.5 starsI picked up this novel because, I heard, it was inspired by Elena Ferrante’s NeapolitaOh gosh, I did not want this to be soo long! Apologies!3.5 starsI picked up this novel because, I heard, it was inspired by Elena Ferrante’s Neapolitan Quartet. I practically lived inside those novels, and the idea to read another story about friendship appealed to me. We are approximately the same age with Zadie and her two heroines were supposed to be our contemporaries. I has grown in a totally different social set up in a different country. So I was intrigued to find out, how their childhood experiences, their feelings, their concerns were compared to mine. In this respect the novel was a slight disappointment. Both main characters are not particularly interesting. If there is complexity in them, it is not easy to find. Tracy, the narrator’s friend, is relatively stereotypical based upon her background - white obese mother; black father in and out of jail; learning difficulties and the lack of respect for others. But she has got this gift of dancing, alas she does not use it properly. As a result, she “meets” all the expectations of failure and becomes nastier by the page. Smith muses: “Their speak of Tracey took a tragic dimension, for isn’t it only tragic heroes who have not choices before them, no alternative routes, only unavoidable fates?” But in spite of all the difficulties Tracy faces I was not convinced by the novel that she is indeed “the tragic hero with no alternative routes”. It looked to me more that she did not use her talent due to lack of simple persistence. The narrator is as well somewhat passive and flat. She observes other people doing something, making mistakes, enjoying their life, falling in love, fighting for their ideals. While she seems to be feeling not much, or totally unable to acknowledge and describe her feelings even to herself. She dumbs her boyfriend with the letter through the door - not very personal even by modern standards. Other her relationships are devoid of love, it seems.Respectively, the friendship theme in the novel feels very unfulfilled. There is no passion or care for each other between those girls, there is no driving force or even no competition; just nastiness from the one side and bitterness or indifference from another.Sometimes it seems, Smith tries to compensate for the lack of feelings by intellectualising: “Katherine Hepburn’s famous Fred and Ginger theory: He gives her class, she gives him sex. Was this a general rule? Did all friendships - all relations- involve this discreet and mysterious exchange of qualities. this exchange of power? Did it extend to peoples or nations or was it a thing that happened only between individuals?” But I found difficult to relate this particular theory to the forces driving friendship. The other plot line is the narrator’s celebrity boss and specifically her project in West Africa to build the school for girls. Surprisingly, I found this part more alive. After the novel has moved to West Africa, I was initially sceptical Smith would make it believable. But I think she succeeded more that i would give her credit for. She renders the locals as fascinating and multi-dimensional. The problems the project faces are authentic as well. Almost unexpectedly I liked Aimee, the celebrity. (In real life I would struggle to sympathise with any part of celebrity culture.) She at least tries to do something, even if she makes mistakes in many cases. It is supposed to be the novel of ideas: the relationships between children and parents; the idea of time swinging between different people, countries, lives; celebrity culture; dance as the way of expression.Within those ideas the domineering theme is question of race. Smith’s main heroin and people around her constantly think about this. The girls compare their skin - who is darker (they are both of the mixed race); the narrator says: “i was born half right and half wrong” implying her white part is wrong. And there is this feeling through the novel that contemporary black people feel the victims of cruel awful injustice done to their predecessors. And they sometimes make this feeling define them. Is it the best thing to do? It would take probably a separate essay to give any justice to this complex and painful question. There is no resolution at the novel as well. Only the narrator finds eventually that even her race is very relative as the african people consider her being white.Smith touches upon more broad question of identity: “Friendship rings began to form and harden around me, defined by colour, class, money, postcode, nation, drugs, politics, sports, aspirations, languages, sexualities… In that high game of musical chairs I turned round one day and found I had no place to sit.” I feel so sad that we need to define ourselves by all these boxes in modern age. Actually, i do not think it is totally like that. I never thought about any of my friends to be defined by these categories. And in majority of cases it is impossible. If you try to do this, you definitely end up like the narrator - unfit in any of these group and lonely.The narrator constantly thinking about which “tribe” she belongs to. Tracy’s dad just fresh from a jail talks about the brutal “tribalism” within it. But does tribe suppose to define more primitive societies?The politicians recently use the identity issues in constructing their policies and election campaigns. I think, the crisis of the Western values we experience now is partly related to this - we learned how to divide ourselves into groups and subgroups. We learned to find the differences and forget about the common matters. As a result we learned to look for enemies. One literary critic I know has got this idea of classifying the novels based the number of subplots. According to him, practically anyone can write a story with the single plot and linear time frame. Only a good talented writer can combine two subplots. Three subplots are unimaginably hard, and four are for geniuses (see War and Peace). Here Zadie Smiths is trying to work with the two and you can see how hard it is. She does not always keep them equally interesting. Two main protagonists have not got much in common throughout the story - similarly there are not many connections between the two subplots. And the structure tends to fall into two detached story quite often. I enjoyed her smooth silky writing. I can see that she is still experimenting with the form. And I hope her next novel would be more vivid and self sufficient. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Dec 05, 2016","Dec 15, 2016","Dec 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28390369-swing-time

Как многие здесь уже говорили, первая часть книги очень хорошо написана - интересный сюжетный трюк, который позволяет посмотреть глубже в природу памяти. Очень хорошо создана атмосфера детства и взросления в начале двадцатого века. Трогательные детали, оживляющие ушедший мир, зарождение чувств и платоническая страсть.

Я просто не верю автору. Не потому что все было по-другому, а потому что это такая огромная трагичная и монументальная тема, что она не впихивается в этот сюжет вот так просто. Про это, мне кажется, нужно либо отдельно писать роман, либо оставить это тем, кто это все пережил.Потом еще хуже - зачем-то еще одна героиня с одинаковым именем и родственными связями, какое-то нагромождение голосов - непонятно, должны ли они отличаться или сливаться. Теория ""дерьма"" как движущей силы переворотов и преступлений. Наблюдение со слов главного героя, что может быть русскому человеку нужна тоталитарная система иначе - хаос. И много другого-разного в этом ключе. И в конце мы дошли даже до Федора Михайловича с его ""тварью дражащей или право имеющей"". Ну, он потратил по крайней мере целый роман, чтобы этот вопрос как-то убедительно для себя решить.

He cares only about his craft, the process of creation and the satisfactionMy initial strong impression was - Nabokov does not care about his reader. He cares only about his craft, the process of creation and the satisfaction it brings. His ability to squeeze the aesthetic effect from the language is magical. He plays with the words, their musicality - the amount of alliteration in this short novel is more than i’ve seen in a volume of poetry. His character says: “One can harness words like performing fleas and make them drive other fleas.” And this pretty much sums up what he does - His possession of the language is the one of a virtuoso jazzmen.He plays with the structure as well- not many writers would manage to weave a perfect poem, a fictional literary criticism and two parallel storylines into the canvas of a novel with slightly more than 200 pages. Although he does not particularly care about his plot either - it is almost a parody on a plot driven fiction with a darkly comic villain and slightly pathetic, a bit creepy main character.Yes, I thought, he does not care about the reader. I heard recently an interview with a modern, very talented writer. She said she always wanted to write a perfect short novel. But while she was writing she was thinking: “My reader would understand that and this based upon his/her preconceptions of the world. But it is not the case in my novel. So I should write more to explain this”. And her novel grow and grow. It is definitely not about Nabokov. He does not care whether and how he would be understood by the reader. He cares much more how his sentence sounds. So, I thought, this novel is more for writers. They surely would love it. But I could not relate to it.But slowly the magic of his work has put a spell on me. I read the poem twice and once aloud. He managed to rhyme 999 lines perfectly without any single stutter. His poem is very lyric, but it contains very profound themes as well. And simply it is amazingly beautiful.And the notes, apart from all these literary effects, contain unlimited cerebral themes. Below, there are just few which i liked, but you can pull out as many more as you wish really:- nature of violence: “The one who kills is always his victim inferior.”- “As many people of little culture, Gradus was a voracious reader of newspapers, pamphlets, chance leaflets and multilingual literature that comes with nose drops and digestive tablets; but this summed up his concessions to intellectual curiosity…”. This is the perfect description of a tabloid reader! And now we have a social media to deal with. How unfortunate that these people are exercising their democratic rights based upon this cocktail of information!- Russians’ character: “There is nothing metaphysical, or racial, about this gloom. It is merely the outward sign of congested nationalism and a provincial’s sense of inferiority - the dreadful blend so typical of Zamblans under the Extremist rule and of Russians under Soviet regime.” - not much changed there under the current regime, I am afraid. Again, nowadays it affects not only the Russians unfortunately.But overwhelming theme of the novel is the nature of creation. Can it be influenced from outside or imposed on the creator? Can its mystery be resolved at all?So I started from the premise that Nabokov does not care about his reader. But I changed my mind to the opposite at the end. He cares very much. He wants to lift the veil, even if ever so slightly, from the world we normally do not see. He wants us to look beyond the usual pleasure of reading and have a glimpse of this dark mysterious miracle of creation. And if he succeeds at least in a few cases, that is more than any writers could dream for.“We are absurdly accustomed to the miracle of a few written signs being able to contain immortal imagery, involutions of thoughts, new worlds with live people, speaking, weeping, laughing. We take it for granted so simply that in a sense, by the very act of brutish routine acceptance, we undo the work of the ages, the history of the gradual elaboration of poetical description and construction, from the freeman to Browning, from the caveman to Keats. What if we awake one day, all of us, and find ourselves utterly unable to read? I wish you to gasp not only at what you read but at the miracle of its being readable.”...more",Notes are private!,5,109,1,"Nov 23, 2016","Dec 02, 2016","Nov 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7805.Pale_Fire

They honestly thought that divergences between nations and religion faiths would gradually flow into a sense of common humanity, so that peace and security, the greases of goods would come to all mankind… Today, now that the word ‘security’ has long been struck out of our vocabulary as a phantom, it is easy for us to smile at the optimistic delusion of that idealistically dazzled generation, which thought that technical progress of mankind must inevitably result in an equally rapid moral rise.”“Yet paradoxically, at the same time as our world was turning the moral clock back a thousands years, I have also seen mankind achieve unheard of feats in the spheres of technology and the intellect, instantly outdoing everything previously achieved in million years.”Reading this gives me harrowing and haunting thoughts. It feels like that for two reasons: how contemporary it sounds today; the person who wrote it, the European writer and cosmopolitan, had sent the memoirs containing this quote to his publisher and the next day, took his own life together with his wife in 1941 (in Brazil where he was escaping the Nazies). His name is Stephen Zweig.Amid awful darkness of the war, not being able to escape its shadow even after running to Brazil, from his beloved Europe, he remembers the times of his happiness and happier times for the whole world. He does not say so, but you can feel that he cannot forgive himself being so away from the tortured continent, like when he left his very old mother in Vienna just before it was occupied.The biggest part of the book is not about the dark days in his life. He talkes a lot about his childhood and youth during the belle epoch in a cosmopolitan Vienna. His voice is very engaging. He describes the places he visited, and he travelled widely, the people he had met. Many of them respectively famous like Rilke, Gorky and many contemporary politicians. His observations are very acute and sincere, sometimes humorous, sometimes critical, but always interesting.For example, he attributed the following to Rilke “People who spout their emotions like blood exhaust me, and so I can take Russians only in very small doses, like liqueur”.Or, in the times of hyperinflation “Incredible as it may seem, I can vouch for it that for a long time the famous, de luxe Hotel de l’Europe in Salzburg was entirely booked by unemployed members of the English proletariat, who could live here more cheaply than in their slums at home, thanks to the generous unemployment benefit they received.” But the book is the most poignant when he is tortuously and desperately trying to understand the reasons for the horror, why everything went so wrong, everything which was dear to him like his ideals, his culture, his friends has melted or had been physically destroyed in a matter of a few decades. He also blames himself for that: “But that overconfident faith in the future which, we were sure, would avert madness at the last minute, was also our own fault.”He never understood the necessity of passports or nationality, he always thought that there is something bigger that a nation, like the idea of Europe, humanity, culture. But as a victim of tragic irony, deprived of his country, stateless and haunted, he could not survive. He said “Bitterness - citizen of the world turned out refugee. “ And this contradiction as well as inability of escaping from the news about horrific reality, cost him his life.“Thanks to our new methods of spreading the news as soon as it happens, we have been constantly drawn into the events of our time…. There was not shelter, no safety from constant awareness and involvement….there were no way you could buy peace and quite; all the time, the hand of Fate took us and dragged us back into its insatiable game.” This as well seems to be the problem my generation faces.I know that history does not teach anyone any lessons unfortunately, but reading this made me once more aware how fragile our present and future was and how similar we were to the people who lived a century ago....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Nov 17, 2016","Nov 25, 2016","Nov 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/629429.The_World_of_Yesterday

In general, books without words, unless they are art reproductions, leave me totally cold. But this is an exception. It is not a movie, and it goes deeper than words. That is why it is so hard to verbalise the emotions it triggers. But I think everyone who has moved from one country to another would relate to this little book very easily and would be deeply moved (no pun intended).It reflects so well on a whirlpool of feelings on arrival at foreign land: excitement, hope for the new life, painful or wonderful memories from the past and thoughts of people you care left behind. However, at least at the first stage, the prevailing sense is insecurity: you have to rely much more on the others, you do not understand many things around you, at least, no-one is interested in who you are… Why should they? At most, they feel aggressive towards you. You want to belong; be understood, but at the beginning it is a relatively lonely road.“you feel less confident, more distrustful of yourself. And I do not hesitate to confess that since the day when i first had to live with papers or passports essentially foreign to me, I have not felt myself anymore. Something of my natural identity has been destroyed for ever with my original, real self. And today, I am former cosmopolitan- keep feeling i have to offer special thanks for every breath of air that I take in a foreign country, thus depriving its own people of its benefit.” These are the words of Stephen Zweig, ” A man used to have only a body and soul. Now he needs a passport too, or he won’t be treated as a man.”I think many of us who changed the countries once or twice, even without dramatic reasons, felt this way sometimes. The images in this book have revoked in me those feelings from more than a decade ago. I did not know how powerful these memories could be.However, the dominating message of this book is hope. It does have a happy ending. It celebrates the differences between people, cities and habits; and it shows how those differences could unite people, not separate them. How all of us could understand each other and stay unique and special at the same time.The images to dig into in the minute of despair after watching the news…....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Oct 18, 2016","Dec 30, 2016","Oct 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/920607.The_Arrival

It is a bit strange as it is a travelogue rather than a history book. But it is very well researched and beautifully written. Inevitably it touches upon the history and the Silk Road. And it does so based upon Iranian and sometimes Russian sources.The author travels around the area investigating small and disappearing communities. But he does it in the context of this region's ancient and modern history. I found out a lot of new, sometimes shocking issues about the regions. For example, the story of Aral sea. I did not know the scale of ecological catastrophe caused by careless, malignant Soviet central planning in the 80s. The result of diverting water from the two main rivers - sources for the sea are painfully evident and sad. The sea has almost totally disappeared for all practical purposes taking with it the climate, ecosystem, people. I googled the images of this place and it looks terrifying. But strangely enough I was growing in the Soviet Union in the 80s and I never heard about it, even when the Soviet Union empire collapsed in the 90s of the last century. Or maybe it is not that strange at all. This is the one of too many examples how self-destructing and harmful was that country together with its ambitions, the absence of the value of human life and crashing, misused power of the state.Another example of the relatively recent history is misplacement of the Russian Germans by Stalin. This and the story of the Crimea tatars equates to genocide. But it is not a popular topic of the discussion in modern Russia. The story Daniel tells is about the woman in her 90s living somewhere in Kazakhstan who lost all her family in the process. You cannot imagine what she has been through, but the way she talks about makes it even more poignant. The resilience and kindness of those people who survived was limitless. Daniel also visits the Jews of Bukhara, the Sogdians - these people were a total enigma to me and I am really grateful I know a bit more now about them, the Hazaras of Afghanistan and the Kalashas of Hindu Kush. I felt that the first part of the book (devoted to ex-Soviet sphere) was much more thought and developed while the last few chapters are more like a travelogue.

I have a great interest in this region simply because it constitutes a gap in my understanding of the history of the world. Also there are not many books available in english to fill it. This region is often treated as a part of Middle East, which creates additional problems for any person intrested to know more about. Therefore this  is written from the perspective a curious reader not weathered professional historian.I was driven to this book after reading ""The Silk Road"" by Peter Frankopan. Which I found well written, but not very relevant. This book on the contrast is much more relevant, scholarly, but sometimes quite difficult to get through. In spite of this, I learned quite a few things, especially in respect of the historical reasons (according to the author) of the current state of the region. The most interesting part of the book was about the ancient period of history up to 15th century.I appreciate the author trying to give much more balanced view on the history compared to the recounts when the nomad tribes considered as a ""barbarians"" vs settled ""civilised"" societies of the period. However, I think this book is almost unbalanced into other direction: big chunks of it are written in defence of the ""barbarians"". But some negative facts are not considered in sufficient details. For example, a sacking of the cities and killing off almost all the population indiscriminately were used like a legible tactic (eg Baghdad by the Mongols). Also it is unclear from the book whether those tribes had developed its own literacy.But my main criticism of this book is that nearly the quarter of it is devoted to the author's rant against Modernism. There are a lot of definitions of modernism in the book. But according to the author it is an overwhelming evil. It created Russian revolution, Chinese Modernisation, Hitler and you name it. Neither TS Eliot, no Stravinskiy is spared in the process of this long and angry rant.The author takes lots of time and space philosophizing whether Modernism is real art, and compares the old day to the current situation:""Life undoubtfully has always been difficult for creative people, but it used to be that there was a fairly foxed socioeconomic slot for artists and artisants, because the aristocrats needed them. The aristocrats, bad as they sometimes might have been in reality or in practice, represented an ideal, not only something people could look up to but something the aristocrats expected of themseleves, too. Looking upward, they demanded perfection or as close to it as they could get, so they hired the best artistists to produce it, and those working for them tried their best to achieve it. If artists were not looking up and doing their best to serve God, they were doing their best to serve men they thought were ""better""; it had nothing to do with the Church or the aristocrats really were somehow better. Trying to upend things, so the basest type of man above the others, cannot actually replace the old order - no one can look up to someone who is by definition as low as can be - so the result is elimination of order itself. Today the artist socioeconomic slot not longer exist, and nothing has really replaced it. But the entire purpose of art or goal of art is largely gone anyway. The total victory of Modernism meant consciences rejection of the traditional values of Reason, artistic order, and Beauty.""This is just an example how far it goes from the Central Asian history. If it would be written by some post revolutionary offended Russian exile a century ago, I would totally sympathise. But to generalise so grossly at the beginning of the 21th century looks simply ridiculous and even unfair. And it is not relevant for me as a reader....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 02, 2016","Jun 07, 2016","Jun 02, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4308027-empires-of-the-silk-road

Everything is vivid, unexplained and unexpected, sometimes terrifying . You are trying to understand it - it does not always makes logical sense. But it is beautiful and pulls you in nevertheless. And you are not sure you want to wake up. But when you do, some of those images form the first thoughts of your day. You try to remember more, you try to connect the colourful patches of those thoughts. But they slip through your fingers. Only thing which remains is the whirlpool people, places, calamities and feelings; the whirlpool of terrible beauty.There is no coherence in this novel. There is no beginning, middle or the end in a classic sense. So if you like that type of narrative, you probably would not like this. But there is life, elegance of language and sheer poetry on each page. You can see the poet writing this. And if you dare to follow him and imagine “the sunset as carnivorous flower”, you probably would like this book.It is not a shallow text as well. It consists of five parts, only loosely connected. In the last part he talks about the most traumatic and tragic events in the 20th century. There are a lot of allusions in his stories to real people and facts. But he never breaks the line from fiction. His observations about different parts of the world are incredibly sharp. He talks with equal ease about the Black Panthers movement in the US and about Russian troubled first decades of the 20th century. The pages about Russia reminded me “Dr Zhivago” - the same readiness of the characters to meet their fate, and no pathos. It felt a bit too much of information about the individual victims of femicide in Santa Tereza. It was like reading the police report. So that was the only part i needed to make an effort to get through. But I think i know why he has done it this way - just to remember those girls. In spite of all the historic events, violence and facts, this is a huge poem written by the hopeless romantic and wonderer for people who still can imagine themselves romantic and wondering, and maybe a bit hopeless… ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"May 13, 2016","May 26, 2016","May 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5759089-2666

And magic tends to happen to you because of that. You still believe in fairness, your own power, power of your friends, and that all people around you should love you.The novel is nostalgic, written with gusto and care for the main character. I found some allusions to ""Tom Sowyer"" by Twain, obviously adapted to Alabama's realities of the 60s. But the book is much more than this. Among other matters, the book touches upon very profound idea about remembering. Someone says to the Boy, when a person dies is like a whole library burns down. ""I wished there was a place you could go, and sit in a room like a movies theater and look through a catalogue of a zillion names and then you could press a button and a face would appear on the screen to tell you about the life that had been. It would be a living memorial to the generations who had gone on before, and you could hear their voices though those voices has been stilled for a hundred years. It seemed to me, as I walked in the presence of all those stilled voices that would never be heard again, that we were a wasteful breed."" I remember when I was 12 or 13, looking through the pictures in the family archive I was thinking something similar. Not so well formulated, but I had the strong feeling if only I would be able to ask these people on the pictures some questions and they could answer... This novel is written at the beginning of the 90s. Now the time has changed with the internet. Future generations would probably be able to do just what the Boy is describing. But would they treasure and know their past better than we do, just because it is available within a click? I do not know the answer to this. Written on a sort of intersection of the genres as many good books are, it has got an element of mystery in it. It is extremely poetic and wise. Also there are supernatural powers and some mystic. But what stroke me the most - the scathing feelings of injustice, real grief, loss and the questioning of the meaning in life - all of them happening for the first time in the Boy's life. Those strong tremors of emotions were really powerful. They reminded me how it is to be 12 again. And I thought I forgot it forever.Strongly recommend. Quotes:""We all start out knowing magic. We are born with whirlwinds, forest fires, and comets inside us. We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. Bu then we get the magic educated right out of our souls. We get it churned out, spanked out, washed out and combed out. We get put on the straight and narrow and told to be responsible.""""What word in English language would speak of youth and hope and freedom and desire, of sweet wanderlust and burning blood? What word describes the brotherhood of buddies, and the feeling that as long as the music plays, you are part of that tough, rambling breed who will inherit the earth?""""When you look at something, don't just look.

I liked this novel more than ""Infatuations"" and you can trace the allusions, albeit subtle, to the ""Your face tomorrow"" trilogy which i consider the best of his novels.This novel is a profound, deeply moving mediation on the nature of truth; whether it really exists; whether people always like to know it. Also it is about what is more important - revenge or forgiveness and whether they ever come together. As always his characterisation is brilliant and language is enigmatic.I read all his novels and always wait with impatience for his new work. So for me it was not difficult to predict the plot of this one. He admits by himself in the book that the types of his characters always existed both in fiction and real life and always will. But the plot is still striking, makes you really coexist with the characters.It is another brilliant translation into English by Margaret Costa!The quotes:About the fiction vs reality:""The photo I like best is like a still from a film, but one made not in 1961, which is when the photo was taken, but even earlier.

Так тяжело писать о нем. Я прочитала все четыре тома очень внимательно, и моя голова сейБлагодаря сериалу ВВС я решилась перечитать это произведение. Так тяжело писать о нем. Я прочитала все четыре тома очень внимательно, и моя голова сейчас похожа на пчелиный улей. Я полна впечатлений, но не могу отделить важные от мимолетных, или даже составить какую-то структуру того, что я хочу написать. Это наверное, одно из последствий от романа - хаос и непредсказуемость, мне показалось, является частью его, хотя многие возможно увидят в этом скрытый смысл. Роман безусловно монументален. Он сильно подействовал на меня - некоторые сцены тронули до слез своей искренностью и смелостью, в некоторых философских рассуждениях я запуталась - мне показалось, Толстой ходит кругами вокруг весьма очевидных истин и пытается доказать что-то в вопросах, на которые не может быть однозначного ответа…. Но во всем романе красной нитью проходит ощущение этой тяжелой внутренней борьбы Толстого как человека, его метания, поиска той силы, которая поможет ему ответить на все вопросы, объяснить, понять, разрешить все противоречия… а проще говоря он ищет смысл, Бога или сверхъестественную силу в которую он сможет поверить, не идя на компромисс со своим умом. Но на момент написания романа, мне кажется, он вместо одной цельной идеи нашел много разных, и не был все таки до конца уверен в правильности ни одной из них.То самое, чем он прежде мучился, чего он искал постоянно, цель жизни.Когда я решила перечитать Войну и Мир, я прежде всего хотела сравнить свои впечатления, когда я читала его в 16 лет, с тем, что я чувствую сейчас, больше 20 лет спустя. И решить для себя, стоит ли делать такое произведение частью школьной программы для 15-них молодых людей. Честно говоря, в 16 я его и не читала полностью - надо было знать сюжет и некоторые сцены для сочинений в школе. Я прочитала эти сцены и составила свое мнение о романе, базируясь на них. Война в романе казалось мне чем-то жутко абстрактным, скучным и не имеющим никакого отношения к миру, окружающему меня. Философские рассуждения казались сухими и бессмысленными. Школу в основном занимал ""подвиг русского народа"", и я прекрасно знала, что надо писать и говорить об этом, безотносительно видела ли я это в романе сама. Что безусловно меня притягивало тогда - это любовная линия - блестящий и холодный, трагический и бесстрашный Болконский; восхищающаяся, влюбляющаяся, легкая и радостная Наташа; ну и где-то с краю - странный, но добрый Пьер. Вот в поисках событий связанных с этими персонажами я и сканнировала роман, пропуская большую часть всего остального. Что я помню до сих пор - Наташи бал - радость и гордость быть впервые взрослой. Помню, как дальше я была разочарована - почему Наташа не захотела продолжать эту жизнь, зачем ей было принимать предложение Андрея? Зачем Анрей делал это предложение, если он сразу же уехал на год? Я в 16 лет не могла этого понять (впрочем как и сейчас), но тогда год казался целой жизнью! По-этому все Наташины приключения с Курагиным я полностью оправдывала. А вот ее женитьба на Пьере и идея семьи - я просто не могла этого принять, что восторженная, полная жизненной силы Наташа превратилась в это: ""теперь часто видно было одно ее лицо и тело, а души вовсе не было видно. Видна была одна сильная, красивая и плодовитая самка"".Других героев я просто там не заметила.Когда я читала роман сейчас, все было совсем по-другому. Меня гораздо меньше интересовала личная жизнь героев, даже их внутренние искания. Меня интересовала война во всех ее проявлениях. К сожалению, в силу последних геополитических событий, мне пришлось часто думать о войне. Она оказалась гораздо ближе и совсем не абстрактной. Понятия бесстрашия, защиты своей земли (или каких-то идеалов с ней связанных), цены жизни и смерти, к сожалению, приблизились на некомфортно близкое расстояние. И мне хотелось увидеть, как Толстой решает вопрос, что такое война. Глазами Толстого война - хаос. Если и существует план, то ничего не идет по-плану. Описание сражений, как снежный ком. Все куда-то бегут, ничего не видно, слышно только свист снарядов. Героизм больше в рассказах. В сражениях его нет - только стечение обстоятельств и привычка умирать без вопросов. Война - разрушительная стихия, которой, когда она уже развязана никто не может управлять кроме ""целесообразности свыше"" и ""духа войска"". Невозможно постичь смысл событий с ней связанных. Пьер во время отступления французов чувствует эту силу, которая заставляет людей убивать друг друга. При том, что еще вчера те же самые люди были почти друзьями и делили горести. Он чувствует ее почти физически, но не может объяснить ее, просто покоряется ей. Это очень мощный и глубокий образ, мне кажется. Конечно, можно не соглашаться с выводами Толстого, что даже без участия армии, особенно нерусских генералов в русской армии, саморазрушение французов и ""дубина народной войны с глупой простотой, но с целесообразностью"" ""гвоздившая"" французов, выиграли бы эту войну все равно. Это, мне кажется, наивно. Но картина войны, особенно сражений, и чувства людей непосредственно принимающих участие в них, мне кажется шокирующей и очень точной.Говоря о ""дубине"", это единственный раз, когда Толстой романтизирует роль масс во всем этом процессе. В советские времена было очень удобно использовать это для мифа о доблести простого народа, в лучшем случае под руководством Кутузова и об остальных ""инностранных"" царских генералах, которые более заботились о своих личных целях. Но Толстой совсем не так однозначен.Да - народ безусловно фигурирует в романе как очень важный фактор. Но его роль, мне кажется, не так уж и героична. Он говорит о мужиках, которые не хотели пускать княжну Марью и ждали прихода французов. Он говорит о мужиках, которые грабили Москву до и после французов. Он говорит о ополченских полках Пьера и купцов, которые грабили усадьбы. В конце концов он говорит об озверелой расправе над Верещагиным.Я позволю себе весьма длинную цитату на эту тему:""Рассказы и описания того времени все без исключения говорят только о самопожертвовании, любви к отечеству, отчаяньи, горе и геройстве русских. В действительности же это так не было. Нам кажется это только так потому, что мы видим из прошедшего один общий исторический интерес того времени, и не видим личных человеческих интересов, которые были у людей. А между тем в действительности те личные интересы настоящего в такой степени значительнее общиз интересов, что из-за низ никогда не чувствуется интерес общий…. """"..Большая часть людей того времени не обращали никакого внимания на общий ход дел, а руководились только личными интересами настоящего. И эти люди были самыми полезными деятелями того времени. Те же, которые пытались понять общий ход дел и с самопожертвованием и геройством хотели участвовать в нем, были самые бесполезные члены общества; они видеди все навыворот, и все, что они делали для пользы, оказывалось бесполезным вздором, как полки Пьера, Мамонтова, грабившие деревни… """"Та барыня, которая еще в июне месяце, с своими арапами и шумихами поднималась из Москвы в саратовскую деревню, с смутным сознанием того, что она Бонапарту не слуга, и со страхом, чтоб ее не оставили по приказанию графа Ростопчина, делала просто и истинно то великое дело, которое спасло Россию.""То есть ""барыня"" спасла Россию еще в большей степени, чем народ? Мне бы было интересно, какую бы оценку я получила бы за сочинение с таким выводом 20 лет назад. И, более того, чтобы поставили школьнику сейчас.Вообще, что поражает в русской литературе и просто в жизни русского общества того периода, и наверное, сейчас тоже, что существует этот народ, всегда отдельно от массы образованных думающих людей, которые его не понимают, и с которым они сталкиваются либо на страницах романов, либо, когда у них появляется какая-нибудь миссия. И тогда у них появляется этакое умиление, как у Пьера от Каратаева. Но сами себя они этим народом никогда не считают…И немножко о моем взгляде на героев сейчас. Самыми привлекательными мне неожиданно для себя показались Николай Ростов и княжна Марья. Я не буду вдаваться в детали, почему. Но я поговорю о трех главных героях. Кстати, еще одна вещь, которая поразила - как честно пишет Толстой. Он абсолютно не пытается сделать своих персонажей такими, чтобы они нравились бы читателям. Ему совершенно все равно, что читатель о них подумает. Поэтому этот роман по-прежнему свеж.Пьер - добрый - да. Ищущий - да. Но как-то поверхностно. Например, если ты масон, и решил освобождать своих крестьян, то неплохо бы было поинтересоваться, что с ними происходит на самом деле. Все его откровения о смысле жизни и тд какие-то очень уж юношески-банальные: ""Отсутствие страданий, удовлетворение потребностей и вследствие того свобода выбора занятий, т.е. образа жизни, представлялись теперь Пьеру несомненным и высшим счастьем человека."" А самое страшное, что он мне показался малодушным, несмотря на свою доброту и все свои благие намерения. Все его восхищения Каратаевым, как что-то ""круглое и русское"" очень абстрактны. Когда Каратаева убивают, он даже не пытается подойти к нему и попрощаться или просто пожалеть. Он опять носится со своими идеями, а не с живыми людьми. Жаль, что Толстой не написал про Пьера-декабриста. Было бы интересно, как бы он поступил после краха восстания.Андрей - эгоист весь роман думающий о себе. Но на общественном фронте он добивается гораздо больше, чем Пьер. Проблема только в том, что его убеждение в своей правоте, фатализм и обреченность не позволяют ему ничего и никого по-настоящему полюбить, даже себя.Ну а Наташа - просто девушка, рожденная для счастья. И она его найдет в любой ситуации. Посkе 20-го века философская часть романа о личности в истории и природе власти, свободе как осознанной необходимости мне показалась несколько наивной. Но видно сколько внутренней работы Отстой вложил в эти искания. А в целом, роман завораживает своей силой, современностью и ощущением живого дыхания, исходящего с его страниц. Две самые мощные сцены для меня были встреча Андрея со смертью и бессмысленная гибель Пети Ростова с последующей реакцией матери и всей остальной семьи. Но об этих сценах у меня просто не хватит слов, чтобы что-то выразить.Я рада, что перечитала роман. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 12, 2016","Mar 02, 2016","Feb 12, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19210361

Maybe because I had very different expectations about it. I've read the title and the introduction by the author, and I thought that it was exactly what I want - to know more about the people of this region over the centuries. I wanted to find out about their way of life, religions, political systems, culture and economy. I wanted to know more about their interactions with each other and (only at the last place) their interactions with the other parts of the world.As a result of reading this book I barely got the answer on the last issue and the sense of chronology, which I knew anyway. I think to say the book is dealing with the complexity of this region in the historical perspective would be overstatement big time. It deals more with the Europe's and later the US's policies, predominately at the Middle East region and their mistakes over the centuries. So if this is your main interest in the book, you might be satisfied. For me the book was as West centred as many other World Histories apart from that normally you have too much of Europe's praise. While here it is Europe and the US bashing. You barely hear about China, the Ottoman empire has almost mentioned in passing (apart from Senan's architecture). But we are treated to the detailed consideration of the courses of the Irangate in the US. I agree that it is important. But I rather read a separate book about this. While here I wanted to find out how the Iranians were leaving before and after the Islamic Revolution for example.The Early Europe has got a rough treatment. For example the fact that the Arabs stopped their conquest at the borders of the modern France is explained that they had nothing to gain from going further, the military resistance by the local population is mentioned but in passing. The same situation with the Mongols five centuries later - really? What a coincidence! The renaissance should be called ""naissance"" as Early Modern Europe had nothing to do with Rome - i totally missed this point. Those people in the 15th century thought differently. Also I did not get what is new about this ""New History of the World.""As a summary, if it is your first book about the world history, go for it, if you are ready to skip China, the South America to name a few and have a flavour for the Modern Middle East's politics (especially blunders made by the US in treating Iran and Iraq). Also if you are interested to hear quite a bit of the author's judgements in the area - go for it.If you are interested in the history of peoples of the steppe, like I was, you would probably not be satisfied.

The English fiction is more descriptive, character and plot driven while the Irish is more poetic, lyric and experimental. I cannot explain myself why is that, but i feel it with the books i read again and again. I cannot say that the one is better than the other, but how it could be so different I still cannot explain to myself…This novel is not an exception. It is very original, but still when I was reading it I was thinking about Jon McGregor, Colum McCann (who has actually endorsed the book on the blurb), Paul Murray… It actually touches on the creative writing style - the narrator is writing his book to recover from post traumatic disorder, and his psychologist is helping him with the writing advice which he first sincerely tries to apply and then rejects in major cases. It is very easy to summarise what the book is about - it has done perfectly on the cover ""..modern Romeo and Juliet told by a compelling and original voice"". Lots of bad things happened in this book and there was a sense of foreboding which sometimes becomes unbearable almost. The last 100 pages were really a bit too much for me - a bit of pedalling on the same spot. But on the other hand, there is this narrator who is fragile, but very whole in spite of all he went through, in spite of him being so different from any norm created by our society. Also there is goodness and power if youth there. It reminds you about the smashing force of feelings when you are young, when stuff happens to you the first time, when you feel as if there is little detonator inside you ready to explode, and you really believe you can die from love, when all the world around you looks like recently washed sparkling window on a sunny day - so clear, so colourful that it hurts… Quote:""You wonder what has delusion got to do with love? Or what has belief got to do with fear. Or what has sacrifice got to do with pity.""...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 23, 2016","Jan 27, 2016","Jan 23, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16059401-the-gamal

However, I was not sure it benefited from the complicated structure as it was. I normally enjoy the multiple points of view. But here you have a novel within the novel on the top of it and I found it a bit distractive. Also I think the main character, Sam could be more developed. I did not understand his relationship with his wife. It came across as he uses her rather than loves her. But I was not sure whether it was the impression the author wanted to create. On the other hand, Clare's character is wonderfully developed and very original.So for the part of this novel did not add up to something whole. But I enjoyed it anyway and it made me think, especially about the choices the creative people have to make under the repressive regimes.Quotes:""Political orientation is an ellipse, not a continuum.

It is brief as it states on the cover, but, I would say, it is more about anthropology than the history. I can see the appeal of this book - it explains the evolution of humanity in easy digestible steps with lots of interesting facts. However, I cannot see people, who are seriously interested in modern understanding of historic and political development, being very excited by it. Even I knew the majority of theories in this book already. At the same time, I can see its mass-culture appeal. I compare this to the difference between classic and pop music. Not everyone could appreciate the classic music without being exposed to it since childhood, or proper music education. But pop-music does not require any work to appreciate it - just some good repetitive tune and preferably catchy lyrics. It might be the stepping stone for some of the listeners to the higher level, but equally it might be enjoyed by itself and felt even revelatory sometimes. So this book is the ""pop-music"" of the modern world anthropology. I found the first part of the book about prehistoric societies the most interesting. The path to evolvement of Homo Sapiens as the only specie of its kind reads almost like a thriller. Starting from the agrarian revolution some of Mr Harari's theories appealed to me, and some I did not find sufficiently convincing:- the grain domesticating the humankind and making them more miserable then they've been before. I could see the analogy with the ""selfish genes"" here. But it is much less convincing. The same with the theory that agriculture has lead to the rapid population growth - there are views that the population growth actually has lead to agriculture, not other way around. And how this theory would explain the existence of pastoral tribes which were not involved in constant grain processing? Those nevertheless were quite successful in submission of some settled societies. The emergence of the state is not discussed at all in the book.- ""Without industrialisation of agriculture the urban industrial revolution would never taken place -there would not be enough hands and brains to staff factories and offices."" Really? Some other historians say that peasants were migrating to cities and towns because they did not have enough to eat at the villages. Everything I read before on the subject of the world economic history was stating that industrial revolution took place in the cities and factories while agriculture was dragging much behind with the remainders of pre capitalism arrangements. What appealed to me is the author's theorising on the nature of liberalism, communism and other modern ideologies. I would agree that there is no substantial difference between them and any religion. All of them are based on the core believes which are impossible to prove. The discussion of the capitalism, free markets and their role in the development of modern civilisation was interesting. I learned a few new facts. But overall on a theoretical level it was not revelatory. I did not particularly enjoyed the last part of the book discussing consumerism. It felt a bit like hitting a dead horse. Everyone knows about it. You can pick up a random newspaper, especially on the left, and this type of discussion would be there. The discussion of happiness was more profound. But it deserves much more space, maybe a separate book. It also went a bit in circles from chemical basis of happiness through social, back to chemical. Overall it is an easy read, could be quite thought-provoking, It would give you a few topics to discuss with your friends and colleagues, and the confidence to do it. But do not expect more than quality entertainment out of it.

I understand how it has got Booker's prize this year. And this is why I've read it actually. Overall the Booker's Prize shortlist this year possessed this social issues and wide spread of geography flavour. So out of the six books it was very rational and relatively neutral choice. I understand also why many people like it. It is well researched and well written without doubt. But I could not personally relate to it. I liked the idea of writing from the multiple perspectives and the characters having its own distinctive voices. But sometimes I found those voices slightly repetitive, especially in the first part of the book the voices of different gang members. I understood the necessity of Jamaican dialect, lots of expletives and swear words. It is not difficult to get into that kind of speech and understand it. But after a while I founded it tiresome and repetitive as well. And I did not fully appreciate Bob Marley role in the story. Yes it is evident he is/was iconic figure in those lands. But still I found the connection of the main characters to his attempted murder quite superficial at some cases. Set aside the history of Jamaican political process and gangs' evolution, my reading was driven by the desire of revenge over the deeds by the one of the main anti-heros in the book. And the evil has been punished. But i was left with the feeling, that the message of the book is that the evil eventually would be punished, but only by the forces of more sophisticated. more organised and bigger evil.

Интересная форма - роман написан по типу старорусского жизнеописания - бытия. Мне также очень понравились вкрапления маленьких эпизодов из разных времен. Меня только не убедила третья часть - паломничество в Иерусалим. Я не очень поняла, зачем она была нужна. Там конечно есть сильные сцены, но в общем и в целом это напомнило мне этакого средневекового Паоло Коэльо, к которому, я, мягко говоря не испытываю сильных чувств. Также сентенции типа : ""Не люблю расставаться. Жизнь состоит из расставаний, но помня об этом полнее радуюешься общению"" кажутся слегка банальными при всей правильности этих слов. А, ""Наш Бог ближе и теплее. Их же выше и величественнее"", сказанные в католическом соборе Арсением наводит на теологический когнитивный диссонанс.

It is the one of those books which drags you in whether you like it or not, and does not let you go until you finish - when you lift your head up from the page and you do not totally realise where are you and what are you doing here. When very familiar surroundings look unrecognisable for the first few seconds. For me it did not matter what the author wrote about, it mattered how she wrote. Her way of observing, constructing the sentences, revealing the psychology of her protagonists are very special and poetic. Her description of friendship is profound and sincere. And the way how she renders New York is super poignant: ""The evening had turned cold, and he walked quickly, almost trotting, enjoying as he always did the pleasure of walking by himself, of feeling alone in a city of so many."" I liked also the construction of the book - that there is no set time period in it, there is no linearity as such. Some people complain that the story could not be credible. It probably could not, but it did not bother me at all. I think what those people do not get that it is more like a dark, fairy tale where you probably know the end, but that is not what you are looking for. The theme she touched could very easily lead her to moral pornography or misery memoirs in the best case scenario. She managed to avoid both, but keep the power through out. The book is made up of 7 parts, each of them are different in the tone, the rendering of main characters, even the style to some extent. I liked the first 5 parts - they created for me the most impact. And I did not like the last two at all. I felt offended on behalf of Jude's friends and I felt offended at the author that by one more tragic twist of the plot she managed to turn for me the story into something much more real and ordinary than I expected it to be. I did not expect any good ending at all. But I think without this twist the main message of the book, that there are people who just cannot be cured, would be more revealing. But as it is, those two last parts did not add anything new for me and I was just grudging through the book thinking, when it was going to end for good. However the first 5 parts definitely justified my reading it.I am really fascinated what would be the author's next book. I really hope that she will apply her evident gift to some totally different subject matter and would manage to surprise readers again, but with something totally unexpected after this book....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Sep 15, 2015","Sep 21, 2015","Sep 15, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22822858-a-little-life

It is not total stream of conscience, but quite close to it; and the writing as such is very slow and good. Apart from visible (to me) aversion towards men as a species her reflections are entertaining and profound.I think it is for the readers, who like a novel where not much happens, but the narrative is based upon the thoughts, conversations and observations. Many of them are interesting, many others might trigger personal associations. A few lengthy quotes:""It was a funny idea, writing in a language not your own. It almost makes you feel guilty, she said, the way people feel forced to use English, how much of themselves must get left behind in that transition, like people being told to leave their homes and take only a few items with them. Yet there was also a purity to that image that attracted her, filled as it was with possibilities for self-reinvention. To be freed from clutter, both mental and verbal, was in some ways an appealing prospect; until you remembered something you needed that you had had to leave behind. She, for instance, found herself unable to make jokes when she spoke in another language.... So it was not she imagined the question of translation so much as one of adaptation. The personality was forced to adapt to its new linguistic circumstances, to create itself anew: it was an interesting thought. There was a poem, she said, by Beckett that he had written twice, once in French and once in English, as if to prove that his bilinguality made him two people and that the barrier of language was, ultimately, impassable.""""I said that, on the contrary, I had come to believe more and more in the virtues of passivity, and of living a life as unmarked by self-will as possible. One could make almost anything happen, if one tried hard enough, but the trying - it seemed to me- was almost always a sign that one was crossing the current, was forcing events in a direction they did not naturally want to go, and though you might argue that nothing could ever be accomplished without going against nature to some extent, the artificiality of that vision and its consequences had become - to put it bluntly - anathema to me.""...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"May 11, 2015","May 28, 2015","May 11, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21400742-outline

This year, I thoughtUpdate after the 2nd reading (February - March 2022)I always wanted to re-read Ulysses in conjunction with Homer's ""The Odyssey"". This year, I thought it would be a good way to celebrate 100 years since Ulysses was written. And, I did it. But it was a very different experience from what I thought it would be. It took me a long time to finish reading and each episode is now associated in my mind, not directly with ""the Odyssey"" but with a certain tragic and devastating or, on another day more hopeful event in the current Russo-Ukrainian war. For example, the initial disbelief and shock coincided with Episode 3 ""Proteus""; Bombing of children in Mariupol with Episode 6 ""Hades""; and horrific massacre in Bucha - with Episode 17 ""Ithaca"". The last one is really dreadful association as it is the one of the most cerebral episode in. the book conceived in the form of questions and answers like catechises or like a children encyclopaedia. It was incredible cognitive dissonance trying to focus on this chapter but constantly coming back to scrolling the news. Bloom and Stephen are contemplating the stars in the book. And here I am trying to comprehend the limitless human cruelty on the little screen, next to the opened book. And then - I switch to ""The Odyssey"" and read there Chapter 22 ""Slaughter in the Hall"". And there:""Quick, report in full on the women in my halls-who are disloyal to me, who are guiltless?""""The women crowded in, huddling all together...wailing convulsively, streaming live warm tears.First they carried out the bodies of the dead (suiters - K.)and propped them under the courtyard colonnade.....and stern Telemachus gave the men their orders:""No clean death for the likes of them, by god!Not from me - they showered abuse on my head, my mother's too!You sluts - the suitor's whores!""With that, taking a cable used on a dark-probed shiphe coiled it over the roundhouse, lashed it fast to a tall column,hoisting it up so high no toes could touch the ground.Then, doves or thrushes beating their spread wingsagainst some snare rigged up in thickets - flying infor a cosy next but gristly bed receives them - so the women's heads were trapped in a line,nooses yanking their necks up, one by oneso all might die a pitiful ghastly death...they kicked up heels for a little - not for long.""And the red swirling horror thread of 2000 years have just linked a circle in my head: women of Ithaca dead for their perceived sins by the hand of angry cruel men; women, children and the old of Bucha... and James Joyce in between asking all those questions. ""The episode is rife with errors made by the undefined narrator, many or most of which are intentional by Joyce."" (from Wiki).That was the short summary of my long re-reading experience. The literary refined observations I wanted to acquire have not quite formed. But one thing I've picked up this time more than the first - how the style has totally dominated the second part of the book. The sheer scale of Joyce experiment is staggering. I am not sure whether any original innovation in English language stylistic choices is still possible after this novel. He was quite methodical in his experiment, almost scientific. But in some of those episodes, he has lost a bit in his human message, in my eyes. However the others - such a harmony and daring!Maybe it will be a third time for me and Ulysses one day. If it happens, I would read a specific episode in my chosen order, not necessarily in order he wrote them. Initial  @2015Many times I picked up that book at a bookshop but put it back on the shelf after flipping through. At the first glance it seemed like confusing, chaotic, wordy pile, which might be of special interest to a linguist, but not to a general reader. But after reading some background about the book and its history, I decided to take the plunge and I did not regret it. There are plenty of literature about this novel. So this  is very personal and not comprehensive. I just pointed out what I've taken from it and what resonated with me.It is a simple idea beyond the complicated structure of the novel - every human being is a wanderer and for a journey you do not need to go far. The book is a one day from the life of Mr Bloom - just a man, who leaves his house at the morning and comes back after midnight bringing with him his alter-ego, young Stephen Dedalus to crash for the night. In meantime he wanders along Dublin's streets, visits pubs, a library, a maternity ward and other places; meets different people, looks, remembers… There are a lot of conversations and encounters, but there is no more plot to it. For me this is a very profound feature of a book: ""Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.""What i found very original, how he depicts the internal monologue a human being is having every second: how an external, fleeting detail we see is converted into our thought, not necessary verbal one; how a taste, a smell or a piece of music triggers some special, long forgotten memory… And how millions of these thoughts form the mosaic of our life, almost without us registering it consciously. He beautifully verbalised something which all of us experience every minute, without putting it into words. He made a poetry out of it:""Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping:sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.""Another side of this phenomena how he notices small details in others and thinks that it is reciprocal: ""Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad boozer's eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us."" How many times you were having similar thoughts looking at someone at a restaurant, but how many times you managed to write it down in a such a beautiful way? There are a lot of things to find in this novel, even on a superficial level: the allusions to legends, greek mythology, Ireland, Dublin, love, fidelity, etc. But for me the biggest attraction was the virtuosity and beauty of the language. He jungles the words with such an ease. It seems, for him the words are much more than simply meaning - he uses them as a composer would use the notes - putting them together, rearranging, testing the sounds and harmony. When you read the result, the word ""meaning"" becomes meaningless by itself: ""She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea."" But equally the novel has got the best characterisations I've ever read, so economic and visual at the same time: ""The brothel cook, mrs keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.""Without any doubt it is very difficult and sometimes frustrating book to read. It requires a lot of commitment. I struggled especially with the second part. For example, I felt totally lost, when in the ""Oxen and the Sun"" he starts to use different literal styles evolving in the Anglo-Saxon literature for the last thousand years. But in spite of all the struggle, I found it a rewarding experience.They often mention Ulysses as the one of 3 modernist novel-giants among ""In the search of the lost time"" by Proust and ""A man without qualities"" by Mussel. I've read all three and I find them very different. While Joyce is the most enigmatic and arguably the most artistic, Proust's novels are more psychological, and Mussel's is more cerebral, full of ideas. I would rather compare it with ""St Petersburg"", the Russian novel by Andrei Bely's. It is also based on a one day story. And though I find it less complicated and more plot based, still it creates the same aura of transience of life and the language.And a few quotes at the end:""History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.""""Beware what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.""""We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.""...more",Notes are private!,0,48,2,"Feb 02, 2022Apr 17, 2015","Apr 29, 2022May 11, 2015","Apr 17, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10545.Ulysses

The author is masterfully painting the setting through wonderful descriptions and period details. People who enjoy the rural settings would probably be delighted. But for me the life of a village or a diary farm at the end of the 18th century was not particularly interesting. Also I was not sufficiently touched by the sad destiny of the main heroine. She seems to me too much of the victim of the circumstances, playing too much subordinated role to the people close to her. I understand the huge differences in the perception between now and then. But there are heroines created by George Elliot for example, who are much more alive and rebellious. As far as the male characters are concerned, I am not sure whom I despise more Angel or Alec. And actually the former seems to be much more off-putting with his cartoonish principles and the absence of compassion. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 20, 2015","Feb 25, 2015","Feb 20, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32261.Tess_of_the_D_Urbervilles

But i do not mean it. It is cinematic in a way one reads it - you see the visuals even before you comprehend the words. Sometimes they call a photograph cinematic - it creates a similar feeling - it is stand alone, but at the same time it looks like a still from the movie. This novel is a collection of those beautiful, weary and deeply touching stills. The flashbacks and the shifting from one character to another, even within one scene, amplifies this feeling - the close ups made by the camera revealing a small detail and then moving away to show a bigger picture. But after that you remember that detail and assign it specific meaning…I never was a big fan of dystopian novels. In fact i have not read even 1984 because of that. But with this one it is an exception. I am not sure why. Maybe, because Emily St John Mandel creates this bridge between the ""before"" and after the world ends. She traces some characters from ""before"" into the ""after""; or maybe because her imagined post-apocalyptic world does not look so unreal.Initially I preferred the parts happening in the ""before"" world. She touches upon many areas of our existence. And some of her observations feel incredibly personal to me. The one of the examples of such observation is how she shows the inability by her main character to describe to his current circle of friends the small place he has come from, the place he left behind at 17. They won't understand that mixture of desire to get away and the authenticity of memories when it has been done…Another example is about Miranda, another main character: ""She puts on the clothes that make her invincible, a life where the moments of emptiness and disappointment are minimal, where by mid-thirties she feels competent and at last more or less at ease in the world, studying foreign languages in first-class lounges and travelling in comfortable seats across oceans, meeting with the clients and living her job, breathing her job, until she isn't sure where she stops and her job begins, almost always loves her life but is often lonely…"" Reading this I was struck how much I could relate to this. Both Miranda and me made our choices notwithstanding how different they were. Both of us have no regrets. The accuracy of such observations and the virtuosity of their expression make this book very special. The girl who has written it definitely is in tune with the world we live in. There is also another theme which she brushed off against - modern corporate world and its impact on happiness and self-fulfilment of the people within it. In an episode the one of the characters is working on 360 assessment (no need to explain what it is to anyone who worked for a big company). And his correspondent comes with the ""sleepwalker"" terminology talking about her boss. ""I am talking about those people who ended up in one life instead of another and they are just so disappointed… They've done what is expected from them. They want to do something else but it's impossible now, there's mortgage, kids, whatever, they are trapped"". In is not a new idea. In fact it is almost a cliche now discussing that many people do not find satisfaction in their job and are not able to change. But I was thinking why we are talking about business again? Isn't it more broader than that? What about writers, actors, doctors for that matter, who thought they had a talent, had great aspirations but ended up to be wrong? Are they sleepwalkers as well? We all make many compromises in our life. We compromise our work with our relationships, our hobbies with our children etc., etc. So where does the compromise end and ""sleepwalking"" start? I do not think the author has got the answer for this question. It was not her main theme anyway. But she continues to observe when her character is back on the street after the interview he thinks: ""When the last time he'd been truly moved by anything? When had he last felt awe or inspiration? He wished he could go somehow back and find the iphone people whom he'd jostled on the sidewalk earlier, apologise to them - I'm sorry, I've just realised that I'm as minimally present in this world as you are. I had no right to judge."" That last sentence made the difference for me compared with other debates about ""sleepwalking"". We should not judge. Initially I did not like the parts of the book about the ""after"" world. I am very far from post-apocalyptic literature and survivalist debates. And it seemed like another version of the ""Hunger Games"" - a girl running with the knives. But further in the book and especially the final scenes made it much more profound. So what would survive after the end of this world? The Music, Shakespeare and religion… The latter is revealed in some extreme form, more fanaticism and cults than faith… But pure physical survival would be always ""insufficient"".I think, the one of the main messages of the book was how fragile our world is, but equally how beautiful. Sometimes we need a reminder about this. And traditionally a few quotes:""No one had an idea, it turned out. None of the older Symphony members knew much about science, which was frankly maddening given how much time these people had had to look things up on the internet before the world ended.""""Those previous versions of herself were so distant now that remembering them was almost like remembering other people, acquaintances, young women whom she'd known a long time ago, and she left such compassion for them. ""I regret nothing"", she told her reflection in the ladies' room mirror, and believed it.""...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 06, 2015","Jan 08, 2015","Jan 06, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20170404-station-eleven

Usually I would not go for such a book based upon the blurb. But i got hooked from the first I picked up this novel at the bookshop purely by chance. Usually I would not go for such a book based upon the blurb. But i got hooked from the first page. Not so much on what it was saying but on the way how it sounds, sincere, confessional and fiendishly clever. I did not buy the book then. But the words and ideas from those five pages I read were coming back to my mind unexpectedly and I wanted to continue reading. Then I searched who was the author. It appeared to be a man born in Bangladesh, moved to England with his parents as a little boy, raised in relative poverty, read Maths at Oxford, further educated in Yale, worked for Goldman Sachs, then became a human rights lawyer. That intrigued me enormously as I was curious what such a man wants to tell to the world. I started to read the book properly and I am very glad I've done it.It is difficult to talk about this novel. On the one hand, it is a very complex novel sparkling with the ideas, theories and knowledge. But on the other hand it is a simple, but deep and bitter love story, and the fight of the person who is very sensitive to the fact that he cannot fit into the canvas of the British class society. The story is told by the friend of the main character. It is clear that the narrator writes his manuscript not only to tell the story of his friend, but to understand himself better, or to use it to help to decide what to do next with his life. And when i was reading, it felt much more like listening to a person talking to you directly. Talking about the modern world, its perception by an individual, wars, anger, love, betrayal, literature and financial crisis. And all of this, in no particular order, intersects with the story of the main protagonist, Zafar. Although I was familiar with many ideas, it does not spoil the experience, as it gives one a chance to reflect on them once more and see the protagonist's point of view.Main themes raised in the book, which made me think:Ability of a human being to know the world around, and especially himself. Zafar came to the conclusion we only can learn something new in the light of what we already know. That we are just not able to know yourself fully and there is this abyss of darkness which we cannot perceive. Godel's incompleteness theorem is central for the whole book. I've got an impression when Zafar realises the meaning of it, he stops looking for his perfect world in maths. And this adds to his disappointment with the world surrounding him. But the message the book delivers is broader - some see uncertainty as limitation and others as opportunities.The work of developmental organisations in war zones and the relationship with the locals. ""He, like many of them, came from that breed of international development experts unsparing in its love for all humanity but having no interest in people"". And more broader the West-East conundrum: ""West's enlightenment, and they call it human rights, and on that rock they have founded their new humanity, and in its name they act with clear conscience. Bush and the neocons, God bless them, might have wanted their natural resources and strategic positioning, but the liberals were always after their souls."" You might not share this point of view of Zafar. But it definitely makes you look deeper from the point of view of the ""recipients"" of the benefits of the ""Western civilisation.""Financial crisis - we have got this image built up by media of greedy bankers ruining the financial system for their personal benefit. But this novel looks at this from the perspective a banker. He questions why the bankers need to feel guilty about what they were doing. And it is appears to be not that straightforward question as we are made to believe. Issue of belonging. Bitterness about inability to break class divide. Britain is still a class society. You might not notice it if you are in the middle. But if you are really aspire to be a high flyer, like Zafar, you would inevitably face with the issues related to your upbringing. He feels he cannot break through. But the interesting thing that the class both attracts and repulses him. He watches the privileged kids at Oxford. He falls in love with the girl initially just by picking up her fancy name on the message board. And when she is what she is, he is still hugely attracted to her. He never tries to change her, argue with her, he just takes everything in and converts it into more suffering and anger for himself. The novel directly does not say it, but the impression is he feels hugely inferior and he does not know how to fight this feeling. More important he does not know whether he wants to find the place for himself in this society. I was not totally satisfied with the ending. It did not seem to me following from the novel. But it did not stop me to enjoy the book. The novel certainly builds up heavily on the author's own life and experience. And he certainly has got a lot to say in this respect. So I was not disappointed. There are quite a few of literary influences mentioned elsewhere but for me personally the style of writing reminded Javier Marías - this slow, reflective conversation which flows without worry about the final purpose.I look forward to the second book by this author if it is forthcoming. Though it would be not easy to keep up with his own achievement.Traditionally a few quotes:""I had a friend at Princeton, a Russian graduate student. He had a cute message on his answering machine, delivered in his thick Russian accent: Who are you and what do you want? Some people spend a lifetime trying to answer these questions. You, however, have thirty seconds.""""You know what a metaphor is? A story sent through the super distillation of imagination"".""I wonder if our experience of a novel is enriched by our experience of life"".""Listening to people is hard because you run the risk of having to change the way you see the world. We'd sooner destroy them.""...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Dec 17, 2014","Dec 28, 2014","Dec 17, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17934468-in-the-light-of-what-we-know

But all three of them would stay with me for a long time.I think I've never read the book with the main theme of female friendship. Normally the friendship will be a subplot to support the love life of main heroine and her need to talk to someone about it. Here everything is different. The friendship is shown as consuming, passionate and intelligent life-long relationship. It is much more difficult to express, but it is much more deep and sincere.It is written from the point of view of the one of two girls and later women. She tries to be very honest with herself about what she feels. And you can feel how difficult it is sometimes. But even the main event in this part which has deeply shaken and fundamentally changed them both, which anyone else would consider as a betrayal, she does not see at all that way. So much more complex is the connection between the two of them.There are times when this friendship brings enormous pain, inability to distinguish yourself from each other, crushing lack of meaning in the absence of each other. ""I felt that without her nothing truly important happens to me yet I felt the need to go away"". When the ways of the two girls diverge due to the reasons beyond their control, they still think of each other all the time when they are doing something important to them. They are eager to impress each other with their achievements without realising that inadvertently they end up hurting each other: ""I recognised in her fulfilment the reverse of my emptiness"". But it is this Gift of friendship which, in spite of all the pain, helps them to be themselves and to thrive to be better… This relationship brings them both enormous joy and self-fulfilment. Their conversations, things they share and do together mean for them more than anything else: ""there were no comparison with exchanges I had with Lila, how they ignited my brain, and in the course of which we tore the words from each other’s mouth, creating an excitement that seemed like a storm of electrical charges.” And that is how real happiness feels, momentous and short..The story of this series of novels develop over the backdrop of a poor Neapolitan neighbourhood. It is much more than just this one relationship notwithstanding how absorbing it is. It is about surrounding violence, cruelty and possessiveness of men, and also it is about thriving for something different, for the way out from this reality. It is not bleak at all, it is emotional, passionate and profound narrative…Reading this is like looking into abyss - it is at the equal measures scary, mysterious and joyful… and if you want to come out at some stage you feel that you really do not know where the safe ground now stands. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Nov 17, 2014","Nov 19, 2014","Nov 17, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17465515-the-story-of-a-new-name

Believe whatever you believe by day, but at night argue against the propositions you hold most dear. Don't cheat! To the greatest extent possible you have to think as though you believe what you don't believe. And if you can't talk yourself out of your existing beliefs you'll know a lot more why you believe what you believe. You'll be a little closer to a proof.""Such a simple and such a brilliant idea, but it is really hard to do because you have to be so brutally honest with yourself, that you might not like it:...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Nov 06, 2014","Nov 06, 2014","Nov 06, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18693884-how-not-to-be-wrong

The main point for me in the book was how often we could end up being cruel to our won children while we are simply trying to pursue their best interests... or so it seems to us.IMHO, the long closure and reconciliation story at the last part of the novel is not necessary.

Может, кто-то не согласится, и фабула другая… Но много параллелей. Особенно - владение юмором. Когда в исторической реальности того времени зло - настолько масштабное и жуткое, что уже не поддается осмыслению иначе как абсурд. И тут фантасмагория и юмор работают лучше, чем что либо другое. В некоторых местах я просто смеялась в слух. Но в других сложно сдержать слезы.И, конечно, это - гимн предвоенному Львову, целому миру с его людьми, местами, речью и запахами, который бесповоротно исчез почти в одночасье, как Атлантида. Читая такие книги понимаешь еще больше, почему для всей Восточной Европы, и особенно западной Украины, Прибалтики и Польши, все советское: люди, солдаты, идеология, насилие, пришедшие в их страны в 39 году, ничуть ни лучше, а во многих случаях даже хуже фашизма. Разница только в том, что немецкий фашизм был уничтожен. Немцы, даже следующие поколения, каялись и жили с комплексом вины. А вот вся эта гэбэшная мразь прочно укоренилась на одной шестой части земли почти на генетическом уровне, и всплывает на поверхность с периодичностью раз в 20 лет. И покаяния никакого похоже не предвидится. Но все равно хочется надеяться. По крайней мере, неизбежно границы этого зла отступают на восток.Возвращаясь к роману, в нем нет большой политики. Просто жизнь людей на фоне. И есть мистическая составляющая, которая добавляет надежды.Я читала на украинском, и, не уверена, как это будет читаться на русском или другом языке.

As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me.""

And this becomes quite hard work - I ended up reading with the pencil in my hand- but it is really rewarding if you are up to 1000 pages of ideas. This novel, Proust and Ulysses are deservingly considered to be three pillars of the modernist literature of the 20th century. I have not read Ulysses yet but this novel is quite different from ""In a search of a lost time"". Proust investigates more the subconsciousness of people and their psychology. While Musel is more interested in the ideas and causal explanations of the reality. In my view any book has got his optimal age when you would enjoy or benefit from it the most. For example I think to read Anna Karenina before you 30 is not to get the maximum out of the depth of the novel. You ought to have life experience to resonate with the story. Of course it is rather subjective. But in terms of this novel I regret I have not read it when I was 20 as a student at the University. Early 20s is the age when you start to rationalise the reality around yourself and try to explain it. Plus you are like sponge absorbing new knowledge and ideas. I am sure I would enjoy it even more than I enjoyed it now.This novel is very modern and relevant today. The book can be practically split into the quotes. Here there are a few:""There is no longer a whole man confronting a whole world only a human something moving about in a general culture medium.""""People use words only to hide their thoughts and use thoughts only to justify the wrongs they have done.""""Ideas have curious properties and one of them is that they turn into opposites when one tries to live up to them."""" In these last hundred years we've become much better acquainted with ourselves and nature and everything. But as a result the better we understand things in details the less we understand the whole. What we get is a great many more systems in order and much less order overall.""...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Aug 27, 2014","Sep 04, 2014","Aug 27, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/527756.The_Man_Without_Qualities

But it requires real talent and craft to create a masterpiece… It is the first collection by G. Saunders I've read, and it leaves me slightly unsettled but craving for more. To the usual ingredients of sadness mixed with irony he added his unique signature of the absurd of daily life. Each story in the collection is very different: some of them made me laugh, some touch very sad themes without making them gloomy. But all of them make you sympathise with the characters. Initially i was slightly put off by the sci-fi element in some stories, but quickly it seemed natural.The last story which gave the title of the book is my favourite. I do not think this collection is everyone's cup of tea, yet if you would like it will stay with you for long time. And two quotes:""They were their own little people! You were just a caretaker. They didn't have to feel what you felt; they just had to be supported in feeling what they felt.""

Это - вдумчивая и своевременная книга. Мне кажется, автор провел колоссальную работу в процессе ее подготовки. И это несомненно дает свои плоды.Самое ценное - это конечно истории живых людей. И, хотя автор осмысливает из по-своему и преподносит нам свои умозаключения, все равно остается много пространства составить свое личное впечатление и сделать свои собственные выводы. Не создается ощущения, что автор навязывает свое мнение. И это очень ценно. Я не буду тут особо делиться своими выводами. Скажу только об одном социальном феномене, который, мне кажется не был рассмотрен достаточно глубоко. Почти в каждой истории - пьют. И пьют мужчины, мужики, мальчики - в общем все представители мужского пола вне зависимости от благосостояния и сословной принадлежности. Я знаю, что это факт. Почему из покон веков?На тему собственно вымышленных героев. Персонажи и типажи созданы четко. И ясна роль каждого. Федор, мне показалось, скорее напоминает Алешу Карамазова, чем Мышкина. В нем недостаточно страсти, что бы напомнить князя. Мне не очень понравилось, что в конце автор попытался сказать нам, кто хороший, кто плохой совершенно однозначно. Мне например, во многом симпатизируют взгляды Белявского, даже, если мне не очень симпатичен он сам. И я бы смогла определиться сама в своих симпатиях. Любовная линия в финале тоже не весьма правдоподобна и прямо-таки слащава до нельзя.Однако, я очень благодарна автору за то, что он вернул мне надежду на возможность качественной и осмысленной современной русской прозы....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 09, 2014","Jan 15, 2014","Jan 09, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17405471

И неужели нет ничего светлого вообще, особенно, если ты одарен, как главная героиня. Или в этом светлом нет смысла?Все умозаключения этого произведения весьма умозрительны, да и только. Они могут импонировать только очень молодым людям, ну лет так до 25. В том возрасте кажется, что ты уже много прожил, все знаешь и можешь сформулировать универсальные печальные законы бытия легко и просто с кружкой пива в руке.Книга ничего не сделала, чтобы развеять стереотип о русских мужчинах (мальчиках, как чаще всего называет их автор). Они в большинстве своем пьяницы, слабаки и трусы, предпочитающие ничего не решать в своей жизни, а находиться у женщин под каблуком. Неужели это правда? Ссылки на Евгения Онегина как-то не чувствуются уместными. В Пушкине много легкости и света. Здесь этого нет совсем.Еще откуда такая привязанность автора к повторению однотипных вводных конструкций: ""А дело было так:"" Или это уже в честь русских народных сказок? Меня лично это только утомляло. Английские слова, написанные русскими буквами очень режут слух. Хорошо, что их не очень много. Но ""леп-топ"" или ""мессидж"" - неприятно просто! Ну ладно не хочется использовать раннее руссифицированные слова типа ""компьютер"". Но дефис-то зачем? Про ""мессидж"" мне даже сказать нечего.Единственным светлым пятном для меня были зарисовки Питера, которых, к счастью, достаточно много.

I could see his ambition and I hoped the story itself would develop from the style. But it did not happen for me at all unfortunately. All the characters, especially the male ones seemed to me morally damaged and emotionally mute. I did not feel sympathy to any of them. Phoebe is the most fake and the most off putting one. Male characters are so similar to each other as if they have been cloned from a single template. The most sympathetic and plausible as a human being is Yinghui. But at the end i think the author has overdone her character as well. I could not believe that any business woman with such long experience would not check the financial side of a deal before leveraging herself up to the head with the bank loan. It did not feel plausible enough even considering her growing emotional attachment to the man in the centre of it. The pace of the novel as well was tiresome. It has started well, but slowed later and felt almost repetitive by parts until the final twist. The quotes from Walter's self help book as a chapter headings I found plainly irritating and meaningless. Some s pointed out on the strong sense of place. The novel is set in Shanghai. There are a few fine descriptions, but overall I did not feel it. For me it could be Moscow, Rio or even New York some 20 years ago - any huge, busy, emerging metropolis will have similar characteristics. I've never been in China and I did not feel I got closer to know it based upon this novel. Overall it created an impression of the relatively unsuccessful attempt of Chinese Monte Christo story in a modern urban setting. If it would be factually based it might work as a piece of reporting in the FT Weekend or a similar publication. But it did not work for me as a fiction. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Dec 15, 2013","Dec 17, 2013","Dec 15, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16071831-five-star-billionaire

It was the feeling which it was addressed directly to me and it felt intimate and personal. I liked the language of the diary and the dynamics of the story evolving in it. Initially i even welcomed the idea of introducing the main reader so to speak in the character of Ruth. But the more I read the more i felt Ruth's part of the book really dragged the whole quality of the story down for me. She is a middle aged writer apparently in a state of a writer's block. It is not exactly clear whether she is satisfied with her life on a secluded island or she wants to change her life and come back to New York. Her relationship with her husband seemed to me lukewarm at best. You could see why those two people were together but how deep is her love for him was unclear to me as well. All this barely touched me but left me confused.Overall it is a book of ambitious scope touching the major events of the recent decade from 9/11 to Japan's earthquake as well and topical themes starting from ecology and finishing with Zen Buddhism with the quantum physics thrown for good measure. All of it is leading to rather eclectic patchy pastiche. Parts of the book look like essay (in Ruth's chapters) more than the fiction.. I'd prefer the depth of the narrative to such a width. Especially it is pity that at the decisive moment of the story the writer needed quantum physics to change the destiny of the girl and her father. I simply stopped believing the book at this point. And it is a shame as the diary up to that moment was very authentic poignant part of the book. I really wanted the girl to find the way out of her dreadful situation, to show the strength as her great grandma has done through her life or naturally succumb to the situation at worst case scenario...

But definitely a rewarding experience if you would dive into it. It is written in my favourite narrative way - the Very complex, long and slow novel. But definitely a rewarding experience if you would dive into it. It is written in my favourite narrative way - the the stream of consciousness, mainly by the main heroin and her boyfriend. But besides it has got a plot as well. The narrative takes place in two time periods: WW II and its aftermath in Western Ukraine, and before the Orange revolution in Kiev. Two lines are constantly intervene which creates the third dimension of the novel.It feels that the novel is written by a philosopher who is desperately trying to understand the history and destiny of her own Land. The language is sincere and very imaginative. I did not like initially the main heroin but slowly she has grown on me with all her honesty, courage and vulnerabilities.Although I started to read in English quite soon I switched to the original. It is my first book in Ukrainian since I finished school many-many years ago. But i really enjoyed the language. So if you have an ability to read in Ukrainian you might as well do it. However I thought the English translation is quite good actually as it renders the original quite truthfully when it is possible.Only one thing i did not like - the book is a bit biased against the Russians. There is no single character there who is the Russian and not KGB agent or oligarch. Everything bad seems to be coming from the East as if Ukrainians themselves were just passive victims through out. It feels a bit one-sided. However i can understand the anger which seems to be a partial motivation for the novel. The good thing - by far this is not the most deep and meaningful theme of the book. It touches a lot of much more eternal ideas of love, friendship, death, metaphysics of the time, what is history, interconnectedness of everyone and everything and the role of 6th sense.I really would recommend this book if you can cope with the volume and the style of the narrative.A few quotes:""I have come to think that a person's life is not so much, or rather is not just, the dramatically arched story with a handful of characters (parents, children, lovers, friends, and colleagues - anyone else?) that we pass on more or less in one piece to our descendants. It's only from the outside that life looks like a narrative, or when viewed backwards through a pair of mental binoculars we put on when we have to fit ourselves into the small oculars or resumes, late night kitchen confessions, and home-spun myths, trimming and shaping life into orderly eyefuls. When seen from the inside, life is an enormous, bottomless suitcase, stuffed with precisely such indeterminate bits and pieces, utterly useless for anyone other that its owner. A suitcase carried, irredeemably and forever… Maybe a handful of odds and ends fall out along the way and remain to roy in the minds of witnesses, so whenever I stumbled into one of those lost, disowned scraps I was filled with a vague bit insistent shame of my inadequacy, as if this piece, this accidental survivor, contained the key - the lost secret code to the deep, subterranean core of the other person's life - and now I have it but don't know which door it unlocks or if such a door even exists.""""Taking cruelly for strength is the most common mistake of youth.""""This is the reason people have children, darts through my mind, with them, you live through all this one more time, and nothing can replace it!""4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Nov 05, 2013","Nov 13, 2013","Nov 05, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9916169-the-museum-of-abandoned-secrets

But I very much enjoy McCann poetic prose, so I thought I give it a go. I cannot say unfortunately it's met my expectations. I do not want to criticise too much - it is a debut novel. And the girl who is writing it definitely has got determination and desire to tell the story. But i was not convinced it's achieved the bar which it has targeted at.Firstly - what i liked - metaphoric language was quite successful. Also the author conveys a great feeling for New York. Initially I thought it would be an urban fairytale where the happy end is expected and predictable, but it makes the book only better… Unfortunately for me it was not the case, as the latish plot twist has made it somewhat much darker, but much less convincing.Now, what i did not like - characterisation! I thought two main protagonists and their voices in the book were not bad, especially at the beginning (later their monologues seems to be a bit repetitive). But i did not understand at all who was Lorca's mother- what was her underlying motivation, why Lorca loves her with such a puppy's love? Her character in the book is very sketchy, but I think without her it is difficult to believe the whole story. On the other hand, I thought too much space were devoted to Joseph, which did not feed organically to the main story, but was not enough to make a second independent line of the novel. Also all post mortem revelations about him were really not convincing and frankly unnecessary in my view. Also I was a bit irritated by often use of the phrases such as : ""I was tired but not. "", ""I was ready for it, but also not ready."" etc., etc. I understand that it is supposed to be a literary way how to convey the character's feelings. But the novel is literally peppered with it and it is just getting on your nerves too much.Overall I would use the author's way and say about this novel: It is too much but not enough.But I will be looking forward to her second novel.

I certainly was not, and frankly I found it the one of the most boring areas compared only to the gardening pages of Sunday newspapers. Not any more… I think the same transformation has affected Amanda Ripley, the author of this book. I understood she has got 6 year old boy and that might be a trigger. In any case this is a very well researched journalistic investigation comparing the education systems in the ""education powerhouses"" as the author called them and the US. The fact that the US is used as a benchmark does not spoil it for the European readers, I think. The successful countries are South Korea, Finland and Poland. She visited all 3 of them and also used 3 exchanged students from America into these countries as her informers.The conclusions she is making is that the excellence of the education you can achieve either through ""pressure cooker"" approach used in Korea or through ""well trained teachers"" approach in Finland. But in both cases the prerequisite of the higher achievement is rigor in curriculum and approach to learning as well as a very high expectations of what the average pupils can achieve. I think the last two key factors are lacking in the US and certainly here in the UK based upon my limited observations. The educators in the US are so obsessed with idea of not letting children to fail that sometimes it results in a just delayed much bigger failure which is much more difficult to fix. Children should face with the routine small failures to be able to learn to overcome them. And with the time they would stop to consider them as such and would think of them as just a part of the challenge. This is possible only if they are given relatively difficult tasks to deal with.I liked very much the quote from Winston Churchill Amanda uses to stress this point: ""Success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm.""That was for me the main message of the book. But there are many more issues discussed in the book and lots of interesting facts. For example:- spending per pupil does not correlate with the quality of education;- the same could be said about the teacher's salary - apparently the highest paid teachers are in Spain which is far behind in PISA tables;- putting children in classes by ability - the earlier it happens the worst it for the country's educational outcome as a whole. (But to be honest I personally believe that it is better for the higher ability kids).I liked also her story about Korea tutoring industry - sounds like something from another planet all together! I felt a bit more sceptical about Poland's ""miracle"" . But i hope that the time will prove me wrong. I found also useful the advice How to spot a good school in the Appendix.Only thing which I did not like is sometimes too much of descriptive writing about the kids she talked too and other people. It disturbed the flow of the story for me. But other than that - breezing read on the interesting topic.

I found it heavier and less fresh that the first books of the cycle. The main topic of these books is the stage of the relationship when both parties do not see any future in it, but still do not dare to think seriously about the break up. Also huge part of the volume is devoted to jealousy of a pathologic scale experienced by the narrator. The narrator spends all his energy reflecting on the possible scenes of betrayal by his lover and the ways of limiting her freedom to the absurd suffocating boundaries. In all of it Proust seems to create a character which totally proves the maxim of his compatriot Francois De La Rochefoucald: "" Jealousy contains more of self-love than love"". And overall I found him rather off putting in this respect. When the book moves beyond this main theme, I found it more interesting with Proust thoughts about the nature of genius, Dostoevslky and the literature in general, music and many other matters. Also I liked the chapter about his long awaited trip to Venice, his views on architecture and travel, especially.Through the book I had a feeling that Proust was really struggling with reconciling his own sexuality to the common standards of the society. And in my view it had put a heavy tall on this book. It is great place to discuss the nature and diversity of sexuality, but i found it a bit excessive to the point of being repetitive. You do not need to turn a supposed womaniser to a homosexual man to prove the point..Overall I think I preferred the earlier novels to these two. And i definitely would not recommend them as a starting point to get familiar with Proust. Having said that, it is still a book of the grandiose scale.A few bits of golden dust at the end:"" But what we call experience is merely the revelation to our own eyes of a trait in our character which naturally reappears, and reappears all the more markedly because we have already once brought it to light, so that the spontaneous impulse which guided us on the first occasion finds itself reinforced by all the suggestions of memory.

Rarely you meet with such a vivid story telling! I would join in with the numerous people who compare ""MC"" and ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" . Only the latter is full of penetrating sadness while the former creates an impression of absurd, irony and dark humour even in the saddest parts. Amazing how Rushdie ""owns"" his words. His ability to create images inside your head is striking. That is how he describes the meeting of lovers, for example: ""hands flickering like candle-flames, creeping forward across reccine, then jerking back; next a woman's hands, black as jet, inching forwards like elegant spiders; hands lifting up, off reccine tabletop, hands hovering above three fives, beginning the strangest of dances, rising, falling, circling one another, weaving in and out between each other, hands longing for touch, hands outstretching tensing quivering demanding to be - but always at last jerking back, fingertips avoiding fingertips, because what I'm watching here on my dirty glass cinema-screen, is after all, an Indian movie, in which physical contact is forbidden…"" And he has not finished his sentence yet.Only problem I had with the book was that for me it has got two endings - the first one is the end of the part 2 and the second is the End somewhat 200 pages later.

It starts with the author retelling the story how he aged 9 was severely punished in a private school for using the word ""orgy"" as an example of a word starting with a vowel in class in 1963. It wonderfully illustrated how stiffened the atmosphere was in England of that time. I was hoping he would carry on telling the Profumo's affair story with the same amount of personal insight through the whole book. But he has moved on to more traditional way how the history is told. The book is split into two parts: ""The Cast"" expanding on different contributors to the scandal and its historic background; the second part is ""Drama"" - the events as such. The author has put more emphasis on the first part. It is understandable, but I would prefer vise versa.

I think it is mainly due to the difficult moral dilemma at the centre of the plot. However the style of a very diligent creative writing student is too obvious. For a example, lots of adjectives and varying length of sentences occasionally look too laborious, inclusion of letters between the characters which supposedly should make the text more ""interesting"" sometimes looks unnecessary. But the most irritating I found is the use of both past and present tenses to deliver the narrative and almost random switching between them. I know that in theory it should add to the pace of the story etc. But for me all of these ""niceties"" were rather distractive from the main plot.In terms of the characters and the resolution of the main dilemma, I did not always feel for them. There are a lot of references to their feelings, but only rare I found that the words conveyed immediately strong emotions without naming them. Overall already dramatic plot feels overdramatised and too sentimental very often.

For example, I never paid any attention how many pages/books i read in a week/month/Nowadays we are surrounded by the data whether we want it or not. For example, I never paid any attention how many pages/books i read in a week/month/year. Moreover, arguably i cannot see the value of this information. But I am definitely able now to get this data from this website as well as the analysis by genre, my ""preferences"" and many other things based upon my reading history. And the same picture is valid for any on-line activity we do… So I was thinking what it means for myself and how it affects my behaviour. That lead me to the question how these data were used by the others. I read Nate Silver's recent book, but was not very much impressed. He seemed too vague in many areas except for sport. But he mentioned how Bayesian statistics is preferable compared to the traditional one while making predictions. That has lead me to this book. I wanted to refresh my knowledge of the probability theory underlying both applications and to understand the difference between them. After reading the book I can tell that it certainly helped to satisfy my curiosity. It is a well organised textbook with a lot of practical exercises. Also the book is structured in an unique way - the first part is supposed to give you an ""intuitive"" understanding of the probability theory and related issues, while the second one is supposed to be more mathematically vigourous. But I personally found them the same in terms of difficulty and using similar maths apparatus. I have to mention that I am familiar with the subject from university, but I never used that knowledge in practical way. So my knowledge were very dusted. The book is very low on visual help. The graphs are rare, and more formalistic and practical approach seems to be dominant. I struggled with that until I found another little book ""Statistics without tears"" by D Rowtree. With its help my reading was much more fruitful and it flew at the end. I found some answers about Bayes vs frequentists approach. And I do not think there is such a contradiction between those two techniques like I felt from the Nate Silver's ""The Signal and the Noise"". Overall it is very interesting area and I plan to continue reading about it.Since university I forgot, how logical is the probability theory and how beautiful it is! This book has helped to refresh this feeling as well as hunger for knowledge. But this science and its applications is far from intuitive in many ways, especially the conditional probability! I think Daniel Kehneman had a great discussion about that in his superb ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" without using any high level maths. Personally I still struggle to accept the solution of the famous Monty Hall dilemma:-)Overall I am sure this book would be great for a student starting the Probability Theory course but the good knowledge of maths up to calculus and some algebra would make his/her read much more enjoyable. Any other person like me needs to be ready to refresh all relevant apparatus as well.

It was partly due other things i was doing but the major cause was the content of this book. It is packed with really great facts and ideas. And you do not want to speed read without savouring many of them. Many books are trying to address similar areas but they are quickly sliding to stating the obvious, at least in my experience. This book almost never does! And some of the facts are as amazing as they are counterintuitive! Also the book is written in wonderful very accessible conversational style.I liked as well some foundations of the rational choice as a part of microeconomics being challenged. I was about to list a few ideas which i found the most interesting or new (to me). But then i gave up as it would make me to restate here at least 40% of the book:-)Only one small wish I had reading this book is to have more occasional formulas and mathematic /statistic formulation of some problems.

And if it is read under such an angle it is interesting and informative. In terms of the theories, what defines a successful student and respectively successful person later in life so to speak, I did not find anything particularly new there. My teacher of physics when i was 15 used to say: ""The talent is made 99% of sweat and only 1% of gift."" This would be an accurate summary of this book main message in this area. Though it have been quite a few years since i finished school. I suppose there is a plenty of new scientific research summarised in the book in this area, but it does not change the message. And it is not new, at least to me and I suppose to many others.But what i liked this book for is the analysis of the problems with educating the poorest part of society. Here I think the message is much more powerful and modern. No one in the US or I think in any country for that matter succeeded in this area. Based upon the research which the author has done there is a huge potential how these problems could be decreased only if it is properly addressed. I think this together with the author's passion for the subject cannot leave you indifferent. Another thing which touched me deeply how the author talks in passing about his own little toddler. He wants him to succeed and naturally protective but he wants him to know how to fail. And this second bit does not come naturally at all.... That definitely deeply resonates with me. Also I personally liked very much the story about the chess game/school and how that influences the character. Overall if you are not looking for a manual or self help book, I think this book definitely will make you think about the modern society and its values....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 06, 2013","Feb 08, 2013","Feb 06, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13435889-how-children-succeed

Their view tends to be ver Being Russian but leaving in the UK generally I am trying to avoid the fiction about modern Russia written by a foreigner. Their view tends to be very one dimensional and rarely based on the first source. So when this book has come out and was even nominated on Booker i still did not have any intentions to open it. But I've read a small piece in the Economist by the same author about fictional meeting of the Prime Minister with the journalists, and I liked it. So that has lead me to the book. This book made me angry. But this book made me feel nostalgic and touched something insight me as well. It is interesting because it is even not a good novel in terms of the literary quality. The dialogues are plainly bad. Especially when the Russian language transliterated by the Latin letters. The form which the author has chosen for the novel is very awkward in my opinion. It is told by the protagonist in the form of a letter to his English fiance. Presumably he does not like to talk about it or even does not dare. And i found this form unnecessary and even distracting and artificial. But if you look at this book as a piece of the journalism it is very good. His observations are sharp, sometimes angry and very opinionated, but very honest as well. Also in them the language comes back with all its power and hits you with its precision.It is a story of an expat corporate lawyer working in Moscow and his meeting with a Russian girl, her friend and an old woman whom they called their aunt. The story is sad and unfortunately is quite typical. Also in parallel runs a story of a deal he is working with Russian crooks. The author seems to be not afraid to follow very traditional basic perceptions of an average foreigner about the Russian women, the Russians, weather etc. But in the process he also creates a character of an archetypical expat foreigner working in Russia. His protagonist is a looser in relative terms who came to Russia to get through his middle life point, to forget for little bit who he is and where he is coming from. And of course also to get a partnership in his firm which he would not get otherwise back home. And his thoughts, his views and his mistakes really speak for the whole of these Moscow expats male community I think. This is the strongest theme of the book for me.The character observes many details of the life in Russia which rings the bell. For example ""Notaries are one of the staple Moscow professions, like property developers, Georgian restaurateurs and prostitutes. .. Any Russian who has power over you (notary, ambulance man, waiter) is obliged to make you wait before they help you, so you know they can.""But in many cases the main character got to that level when he thinks he knows enough to generalise and he does it a lot. For example about the Russians: ""They could wallow in mud and vodka for a decade, then conjure up a skyscraper or execute a royal family in an afternoon, if they put their minds to it and the incentives were right."" ""Because' along with the fatalism and the borsch, the snow is part of what makes them them and nobody else."" ""Maybe to be this immoral you've got to have religion somewhere- some decrepit gods lurking at the back of your mind, gods you are determined to defy""… But the problem with all of this is - yes it is mainly true and he got far to understand it but he will never be able to go farther to find the whole pinnacle of other things which the word Russia and the Russians imply…At the end after being totally complacent both professionally and personally he also realised that he is not that different from what he calls barbarism. ""I'd somehow become the sort of person who would go along with it, whatever it was, sensing but not caring that it was no good, fixing the forms and smiling so long as i got what i needed. The kind of person I never knew I could be until I came to Russia. But I could be and I was."" Did Russia do it to him? Or was it there always? Overall for me it was great experience reading this book and it brought lots of memories I forgot existed.Oh! and what a wonderful almost phenomenological analysis of snow - so beautiful!...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 18, 2012","Dec 21, 2012","Dec 18, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9579671-snowdrops

That is how i came across it as well.Deborah Levy definitely loves writing and does it wonderfully. The language is beautiful and poetic. Some of the images she creates definitely stay with you, even visually when the book is finished. An FT er mentioned that she tried to connect continental postmodernist literary tradition with the british storytelling.. (not exact quote). I think this attempt is very welcome and needed. But i think it falls just about short of being totally successful. The atmosphere is there but the story did not totally convince me. I did not feel the connection with the characters. May be only at some point with the wife of the poet but that did not last until the end of the book as well. And it is not about sympathising or understanding their actions... It is more for me about intuitive image they form in my mind. And this one was quite obscure...In the afterword Tom McCarthy says ""she read her Lacan and Deleuze, her Barthes, Duras, Stein and Ballard, not to mention Kafka and Robbe-Grillet..and was putting all this characters to work in new .. ways"". Also i think Freud needs to be included into this list as well... But for me the symbolism she uses in this little novel is really not subtle enough. The main antithesis between Eros and Thanatos is too much on the surface for me to appreciate it. And Kitty's character reminds too much very real Sylvia Plath. And the last thing i did not like is why the Holocaust needs to be in any novel including a Jewish protagonist? It is a general remark relating not only to this novel. May be i need to think about it more and ask my Jewish friends...Overall this little book definitely made me think a lot trying to find the reasons ""why"" certain characters acted as they acted.

The time it takes to read this novel is paced by the narrative itself. One cannot speed it up or slow it down. It possess its own life, its own time span and one needs to live it through if one is to read it. I’ve tried to read it once before and got out of its hermetic world before properly getting in. I did not have Hans Castorp’s patience, fascination or purpose. I got in this time and it is a tremendous structure. Mann wanted people to read the book twice if one is to get the most of it. And I might do it - I might read it again and then talk more about it.I would talk then about the depiction of death; its macabre side, but also its certain peacefulness Mann brings about.I would tell that Eros and Thanatos stop fighting with each other when they join in the service of Love and …. Care.I would talk about that this novel contains the accumulation of wisdom of the proceeding epochs as well as the idea of impossibility of this knowledge.I would talk about what kind of state of mind, collective and individual, makes a war possible if not inevitable. How the words stop become just that and become weapons. How those same words lose all the ability to mean anything at all. And only a wordless animal remains in the human being.I would ask wether a quest novel is possible if the main character spends the most of his time horizontally.I would talk about how a special sense of humour is the one of the main drivers of this book.

Sometimes the story dragged a bit for my taste on the description of the parties and other ways of high classes entertainment of that period. But it was fully compensated by many thoughtful insights which I found refreshingly well formulated... I cannot refrain from finishing with the one long quote:""It is a bit of cliche to characterise life as a rambling journey on which we can alter our course at any given time -by the slightest turn of the wheel, the wisdom goes, we influence the chain of events and thus recast our destiny with the new cohorts, circumstances, and discoveries.

And he suspects from the start that solving the mystery would not bring him any relief. However, it might just get him closer to understanding who he is.  [image]This novel is like a city it is devoted to. It cannot be easily put into a box of any categorisation. It is a love story or maybe more the story of longing for love. It is a search but it is not easy to decide for what. It is comprised of a myriad of illusively connected tales. In this respect, it is clearly inspired by 1001 nights and that delicious tradition of the eastern story telling when the overall thread of a plot is not as relevant as the vibe keeping these stories alive. On the other hand, it treats the city as a metaphor of human thoughts, it is meandering. And this reminded me of Modiano Patrick. What he has done for Paris, Pamuk is doing here for Istanbul. And those who love the city would not regret escaping into its streets through this book.  [image]How is that possible to preserve one’s self? That is the preoccupation of the novel. How to stick to it under pressure of external influences and internal changes? Is it even possible? Is it a good thing? And it is not the question only about a person, it is the question about a city while it tackles the constant change. It is a question of a nation (as much as I hate this word). Is it the only way to be yourself is to shut yourself in the empty palace and burn all the books so no thoughts, that are not yours would influence your inner selfhood? There is a tale about doing just that. Or on the other hand, does one need to totally merge with another personality, replace your own selfhood with someone”s else? And where are those famous boundaries?“The only way for a person to become herself is to become the other, get lost in the story of this other.”The shadow of a Sufi poet Farid ud-Din Attar, of the 12th century is always on the background. Famously, he wrote a story about 30 birds that were looking for a magic Simorgh, the god and the king who would solve all their problems. After the long quest, they reached the mountain Qaf where he was supposed to be and the birds learned that they themselves were the Simorgh. “If Simorgh unveils its face to you, you will find that all the birds, be they thirty or forty or more,are but the shadows cast by that unveiling.What shadow is ever separated from its maker? Do you see?The shadow and its maker are one and the same, so get over surfaces and delve into mysteries”(quoted based upon the translation by Sholeh Wolpé)Reflections as shadows and the mirrors that reveal something deeper than the appearances, the symbolism of this poem spills into the novel.   [image]Pamuk has managed to bridge the Western and Eastern storytelling tradition. Moreover, he manages to challenge the existence of this artificial separation. Rumi, Hurufism, Dostoyevsky and Proust share the pages in these stories. And the writing is very special, detached but moving and very lyrical, a poetry in prose by parts.There is this an anxiety in the novel about something irreversibly disappearing, melting away. I think we all feel it sometimes. It is often being replaced with something new, but it is not how it feels. “It is appeared to be that to see how the world has changed it is sufficient to comprehend that you yourself have become a different person”.  [image]There are places on this globe where I feel this transience more acutely. And Istanbul is the one of them. This novel is drenched in the memories and in nostalgia for something which has not happened yet, but is in the process. It was so sad to find out that they are again converting some museums that used to be churches centuries ago into mosques. It has started another circle of time. Anyway I think I know how these places survive for so many centuries. They keep changing, but stubbornly they keep preserving something that other cities have long lost.

I understand why there is such a hype in the UK around this projected trilogy. I think the strength of the novel is how it shows the formation of the English modern national character in general terms. Also the prose is imaginative and the characters are well crafted, even the minor ones.However IMHO it lacks the emotional side of things. All emotions do not somehow feel alive. And this feeling is not even helped by using the present tense for the story. I would put rating higher if not one minor point which makes me stumble sometimes through the sentences: Mantel uses ""he"" to address his main character. And this by times becomes to repetitive. Often for this she uses ""he, Cromwell"" and it often feels very distractive.Would I read the sequel and the projected third novel? I certainly would. But i will wait until the third book is out.Also I think the good idea for the new novel would be a prequel;-) It looks like the most exciting things in Cromwell's life and his character formation all happened before he came back to England and definitely before the start of Wolf Hall. And i think the book about this by Mantel that would be interesting read:-)...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 29, 2013","Feb 02, 2013","Jan 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6101138-wolf-hall

The present tense is used as a writing tool. I think this helps to build up and keep the tension through the novel and makes it really easy to visualise. Of course David Mitchell is a master of conveying the voices of different characters through their manner of speaking. This is fully revealed itself in this book as well as in his earlier novels. The novel is gripping and full of interesting historical details. I enjoyed ""Clouded Atlas"" very much. Inevitably and out of my will i compare those two novels.

I actually prefer The Corrections to this one for its clarity and purpose.I think the author has overwritten this book and if he would stop earlier it would benefit the whole book and the story. Also all the characters it seemed to me where acting like double faced Janus. They appeared one personality and later changed to the almost opposite. I appreciate the trick and it would work in a metaphorical sense, but not for all of them inho. Having said the above I enjoyed the reading and read this thick book in less than a week.
