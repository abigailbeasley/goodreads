No return address was written, however, it had my correct address; but the wrong name. So I took this package in, opened it up carefully to ensure there was no danger and found this slim yellow book with weird red lettering and some furry creature that was up to no good. I knew right then and there I was going to have to read it.Read it I did.

I had never read a book by this author before this one, and out of all her titles, this one spoke to me, as books sometimes do.This was a good story. I really liked Ophelia and Annie's relationship, and I can relate in a lot of ways to Annie's back story, since these last few years have been difficult for me as well, with lots of changes.I also liked the concept of a memory house and only keeping things that speak to you personally. As well as, listening to them in order to get the story of the object. This was where the magical realism took place, and reminded me a bit of Sarah Addison Allen, another author who's books I have enjoyed as well.What I didn't like so much was the preachy tone it sometimes took on. It seemed to me as if something happened and then the next paragraph was an explanation of what just happened. This is one of my major pet peeves in modern literature, as I can figure out the connections on my own and draw my own conclusions, thank you very much. After I finished this story, I realized that this is a series, and I could see myself reading the next story, in a little bit, after I read some other things.All in all, a decent read by an interesting author. Just to let you know, I joined the author's ARC club, and the e-book of this title was given to me, in exchange for an honest .Thank you and happy reading!...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jan 16, 2016",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/25064835-memory-house

I have ed other issues of this journal here on GoodReads as well. This  is a home for my personal opinions and in no way is a reflection on the literary magazine itself, Amazon, nor GoodReads.Now, onto the :I really enjoy being a lounge lizard on the few and far days I have to myself. I only need to be outdoors with my sunglasses, sunscreen, a large cup of iced tea, a comfy chair, and a good read, to make me a happy camper.I must admit here that this literary journal gets better with each issue I read. Don't get me wrong, I liked the last issue, but I REALLY enjoyed this issue. To me the overarching theme was the tenaciousness of life, and something that I can personally relate to. This year alone, I feel I have undergone far more personal transformations, then any year past, so far. Some were good decisions, others not so much, and some were totally out of my control. So, reading about characters just trying to stay afloat when their inner and outer selves clash and/or their hopes and dreams are smashed by their own doing or circumstances beyond their control, was kind of cathartic for me in a lot of ways.This issue is jam packed with a ton of well written short stories. I just wanted to take a minute and tell you the titles that stood out for me:- Ayesha Miller- Floaters- Swimming With The Sharks- Oddly Precious Melancholy- Dog Days and Wet Dreams- Best Work- On Bread Alone I liked these stories the best because they all featured very flawed characters, and I am a sucker for realistic characters that may or may not reach their desired conclusions. So, if you enjoy these kinds of stories as well, pick up this issue. It just might be the kind of writing you've been looking to read.I also enjoyed the poems more in this one as well, as they had a more narrative flow. The two poetry titles that stood out for me were:- Lightnin' Hopkins Emerges from the Woods at Mooresville, IN- Todd's MomFrom the first line I was hooked and it only got better from there. For example, the opening line of Todd's Mom is: ""She smelled like Dr. Pepper..."" Finally, what's not to like about interesting art work? The featured artist, Justin Duerr, not only has the coolest bio, but his artwork, especially the ones in full color, were so intricate and amazing, I couldn't help but keep flipping back and looking at them throughout the reading process.All in all, if you're looking for a good ""beach"" read, you will NOT find it here, but if you are looking for well written material that you can get lost in within a space of a day or two, you've come to the right place.

Up next: I'm going to tackle my other favorite author, Haruki Murakami, and his big book IQ84. This is broken up into three sections, so expect three exciting updates and then my original .

Since it was written by Wally Lamb, I thought I'd give it a go, as I really enjoyed some of his other books. This one was different than his other works, in that it was more light-hearted. However, it failed to wow me.It really didn't have a plot to speak of and it was written in way that's meant to make you feel nostalgic for a different era, but failed. Instead I felt as if I was being beaten over the head, with the writing saying: 'see how quirky and loveable people used to be?' Ugh, sorry, so not for me.The only redeeming quality for me was that it was a quick read.This is just my opinion, and I can see that others have read and enjoyed it, quite a bit. I'm going to recommend this to my mom, since she grew up in 1964 and probably could relate to the characters better. I would also recommend this one to anyone who has a funny play story or had to deal with catholic school, then you too might find this one enjoyable as well.Anyways, regardless of liking or not liking this book, I wish you all a very happy Holiday season!

It's the busiest time of the year, so I decided to forego all my expected obligations, and sat down with this delightful read instead. I'm really glad I did because this was just what I needed!This was one of those rare books that spoke to me through it's wonderfully flawed adult characters (hint everyone's KRAZY in his or her own unique ways!) and made me LOVE the narrator Bee, who's adventerous, intellegent, and comes to her own conclusions about the chaos that swirls around her on a daily basis.I also really liked how the book was laid out. The information comes to the reader via emails, letters, logs, and confidential FBI documents that Bee has collected to form her version of the book. Brilliant on Maria Semple's part for letting the reader connect with Bee from the beginning, as well as, to set the stage for the mystery; the disappearance of Bee's mom, Bernadette.Bernadette's fabulous too! She's the kind of person I could be friends with. She comes across as being flaky, but in reality, she's brilliant. She's the most influential architect no one's ever heard of, since she's constantly disappearing in different ways throughout the book. It takes courage for Bernadette to go on the Antarctic voyage by herself, in order to come back around to appearing again, for Bee, as well as herself, by putting the experience in her own words for perspective at the end.Highly recommended for readers who have wished to disappear (either literally or figuratively), have relocated or even stayed put geographically but had to adjust to a new way of life, have called into question their sanity, have felt like an outsider, or are just looking for a fun and hilarious read that's different; then this book is for you!I leave you now with some breath taking views of Antarctica that can be viewed on my BookLikes page: http://kpaone92.booklikes.com/It makes me wish I was there....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 16, 2013","Dec 23, 2013","Dec 16, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15790857-where-d-you-go-bernadette

I have been an active member since 2009 and haveThis book was excellently researched and well written, but at the same time it made me extremely sad. I have been an active member since 2009 and have met a lot of awesome people - readers, authors, bloggers, publishers - some that I have met in person (which have turned into good personal friends in real life), and others that I have not met yet, but we all share one thing in common - our LOVE of reading. Reading is such a subjective thing, which is exactly why it's so wonderful. Everyone has an opinion and is entitled to it for better or worse. I don't think anyone's s should be censored or removed because it's considered ""off-topic"", or talks about an author in a negative way. Neither should someone have the administrative power to delete shelves, since the naming of this convention is a very personal matter. Quite frankly, here in the United States, it's a violation of our first amendment rights. We have freedom of speech, and we should not take this liberty lightly. I'm glad to see that so many people have written in on this topic and together I believe we can make a difference by standing strong and making our collective voice heard. It's certainly a 'Brave New World' out here on the interwebz and I'm not so sure I like or agree with it (which is why I'm not as active of a librarian as I once was), but I'm certainly glad for the chance to connect with others, share opinions (especially conflicting ones), and grow as a reader, thinker, and writer. I wouldn't of had the courage to get on the writing path, like I have recently without your support and encouragement, and for that I thank you all with tears in my eyes.I am a little late to all of this, and it's amazing to me to see how in a blink of an eye everything has changed. In my real life I was hit by a car while walking, and it's been a long and slow recovery process. My lifeline has been reading my GR friends updates, reading good books in general, and writing in reflection on all that has happened. I don't do a lot of social networking, and the stuff I do choose to put out there is chosen very carefully. I chose GR because it was a great way to keep track of my never ending to read list, discover new content that I probably would of never found otherwise, and to exercise my writing muscles. I don't want to leave GR because I still have some cool peeps to follow, but that number is getting smaller and smaller everyday, which makes me very sad and angry. However, if I do eventually decide to leave, I now know how to transfer my s into a document that I can take elsewhere, but I really hope It won't get to that point. I hope GR gets their collective heads out of their a$$e$ and realizes that losing good people is more detrimental to their business model then making a profit.I won't hold my breath because I might turn blue in the process, but I thank you all for being your awesome selves, and letting me get up on my soapbox for a minute to share my thoughts on this subject.

Being old fashioned, I chose to read this one instead of listening, and for once I wish I had listened to it instead, as it is a story that is very much dialect based.The narrator is fifteen year old Alesha and she grew up in the endz during the riots in South London. I really liked Alesha, as she's honest, forthright, and doesn't sugar coat anything that she does or has happen to her throughout the story. It took me a little while to get into the story as there were a lot of words I didn't really know, so I was thankful for the glossary. After a while, I picked up on the dialect easier, and the story went by much faster.My favorite part of the story was the middle, when Alesha's struggling between the life she knows and going legit. I thought Ms. Merfield was a wonderful mentor for Alesha and she's there for her through her incarceration because if her involvement in the riots, JJ's death, and even helps her get a straight job and a nicer place to live. I thought the ending was wrapped up way too nicely and wished this part was more fleshed out. However, all in all, this was a well written book on a difficult subject that everyone should read or listen to.

Everyone experiences flow from time to time and will recognize it's characteristics: feeling strong, alert, in effortless control, unselfconscious, and at a peak of their abilities. This book reveals how this pleasurable state can, in fact be controlled, and not left to chance, by setting ourselves challenges - tasks that are neither too difficult nor too simple for our abilities. With such goals, we learn to order the information that enters conciousness and thereby improve the quality of our lives. Sounds too good to be true, right? I thought so too, so before my accident I had started to catalogue the things I enjoyed doing that matched the definition of flow. These activities for me are: making art (any kind and includes coloring), writing, reading, cross-fit, cooking, sky-diving. Then after my accident, I started doing some of the execises to improve myself and found the effects profound. I re-read the section entitled, Cheating Chaos, and found that like a lot of other people interviewed for this book, that after a life changing event, they too felt like it had a more positive and beneficial effect than a negative one.

Karen commits suicide, and the rest of the story reads like a haunted, surreal love letter trapped in a never ending nightmare. This is Jack's descent into madness through little vignettes of his tortured mind. Prose poetry told from the perspective of a monster caught inside his own personal hell. There is a perplexed, dis-jointed feel throughout the whole of this short novella. Disgusting yet beautiful imagery and fantastic illustrations sprinkled though out. A hard one to put down once you start the journey and so many wonderful quotes, one of which I will leave you with:""They called our usual excursions into these nights of infinite danger suicide. But what they didn't understand is that the blue light of these modern dream machines had colored not only their nights but also their days a frozen hue of darker-than-the-deepest-seas blue.

A slim book that makes the most out of every single word written. With a wonderful introduction by Studs Terkel and a brilliant afterword by Algren himself, I found that once I got started I had a hard time putting it down.I loved Algren's use of colorful language and felt that he made many statements that still hold true today. Such as: ""The hard necessity of bringing the judge on the bench down into the dock has been the particular responsibility of the writer in all ages of man. In Chicago, in our own curious span, we have seesawed between blind assault and blind counter-assault, hanging men in one decade for beliefs which, in another, we honor others.""Algren is a witty, smart man, and a wonderful writer.

This story reminded me of my own loss of shoes when I was in Utah, going white water rafting for a week, with my dad and brother. The first night on the water we stopped at these amazing cliffs and our guides told us we could jump off of them as long as we had good shoes and life vests on. I didn't hesitate to have this experience and when I hit the water one of my good Teva Mary Janes was missing. It sank to the bottom and the current took it away. After that the only shoes I had left were my Teva flip flops, which weren't good for the boat - too slippery, nor hiking. Somehow I managed to survive and enjoy myself, but when we returned to civilization, the first thing I had to do was spend some money on a nice pair of shoes. I purchased a pair of Keens which I still have to this day and they were totally worth the money.I also need to read some of the books Cheryl read on the PCT trail like:- 'The Dream Of A Common Language' By: Adrienne Rich- 'Complete Stories' By: Flannery O'Connor- 'A Summer Bird-Cage' By: Margaret Drabble- 'The Best American Essays 1991' Edited By: Robert Atwan and Joyce Carol Oates- 'The Ten Thousand Things' By: Maria DermoutAll in all, a must read if you like tales of travel, wilderness, and transformation.

Even if you don't agree with everything Laura Kipnis has to say in this short, but gripping tome, I think it's an interesting social commentary that everyone in our post modern world should read. We've definitely made progress, but there's still a lot more progress that needs to be made, and maybe a good place to start is looking within ourselves.I am intrigued to hear her lecture at Elmhurst College on Narcissism: A Defense once it's rescheduled, (It was originally supposed to take place March 5, but we had a big snow storm so it was cancelled) as I like that she speaks her mind no matter what. The lecture was rescheduled for today, April 24, 2013. It was an easy commute by Metra to Elmhurst College. It's a small but beautiful campus and Laura Kipnis was great! In her speech she said that narcissism is an anxiety about ourselves and our relationships at the moment. She deconstructed the clinical definition of narcissism and said as our society and sense of self shift, so does this word and how it's defined. Which also raised an interesting question: Does leisure = narcissism? The simple answer is no. Having time to explore other activities isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's how we discover new things about ourselves and reinvent ourselves in a way that just might surprise us. How much work does it take to uphold a societal system? Why do we have to work so much when we have so much abundance out there that just needs to be redistributed evenly across the board? Again, there are no easy answers for these questions, but I was glad she started this conversation and that I could be a part of this dialogue. I hope to attend another of her lectures in the future and in the meantime, I need to read her other books....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 17, 2013","Mar 08, 2013","Apr 24, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/283773.The_Female_Thing

The story is certainly sci-fi and ahead of its time. The story is heavily psyhonalitical (a psychological and psychotherapeutic theory first laid out by Sigmund Freud in the 19th Century) and poses questions regarding children's development, in particular how they learn. I liked the symbology of the story and how ""Through The Looking Glass"" gave insight into this new learning style X, that is very different from the Euclid theory that all the adults in the story have been conditioned to. I am very interested in watching the movie to see how it's different from the original story, which I will report on later.So, I finally got around to watching the movie and I wasn't really surprised that they changed the story line quite a bit from the original story, but it was a pretty good movie none the less. Basically, they ""happied-up"" the ending in true Hollywood fashion, added some environmental aspects, and changed the psychological aspects to mental/psychic abilities.

The book hinges on two events; the twins b'nai mitzvah, and Edie and Richard Middlestein's thirty plus year marriage falling apart due to her not taking care of herself and eating way too many processed foods all hours of the day and night.

In 2013, I made the executive life decision to leave the corporate world, in order to pursue my artistic goals. I had outgrown my position and there was no where else for me to move up within the company, so I gave my three months notice. Since I was the only person in my position, I wanted to make sure that I gave the higher ups enough time to hire someone new and get them trained. I felt like I left on a good note.I knew that following my artistic passions was going to be a hard and rocky road. However, with the help of this book, I feel like I have been given a tool box that has helped me to cultivate my abilities, in order to use my whole self, best skills, and have what this book refers to as 'emotional employment'.I really enjoyed reading this book and doing the writing exercises. My favorite, and most valuable writing exercise was, writing my career narrative. This gave me the power to transform, re-organize my relationship to the information, and allowed me to accept my past a bit better. I realized that every step I have taken so far has given me the skills needed to be able to succeed on my own.Other take-aways from this book that I learned were:* My real passion wasn't what I was doing for a job.* Fear sometimes holds me back, but I can't let it.* Some of my dreams are more conscious than others.* The difference between leading and managing is important. I like to lead, but really hate managing others.* Making a commitment to finding myself, as well as work that expresses myself is a powerful decision, with tremendous potential, but great care must be taken to re-learn new messages about my self worth, in order to grow authentically.I have also taken the time to cultivate my intuitive guidance system; by turning up the volume on that little voice, as well as, have a care system in place for all my negative inner critics that keep popping up.I feel like I have just started my journey and am excited to see where it will go in 2014. I wouldn't of been able to feel confident in this journey without the help of this book, and all of the podcasts that I have listened to this past year. I also feel like my accident at the end of this year was important, as it gave me the space to re-start everything, and get all my ducks lined up for further success next year....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 08, 2013","Dec 07, 2013","Mar 08, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1965872.Back_in_Control

The most interesting part to me is that my original thoughts still ring true with this one. It's one heck of a hair raising novel that has a ton of interesting discussion points. Can't wait to hear what others think of it as well.So, this book concludes my reading for 2011, and what a horrific way to end the year!It's not that the writing was bad, it wasn't, it was just the topic of this book in general that made me sad. All Jack (a very intelligent and imaginative 5 year old boy) knows is Room and the things in it, which are his friends. Everything else he doesn't really understand are only on TV, which means they are not real. His mom does the best she can considering the circumstances. She reads to him, tells him stories, plays games, cooks whatever she has available, and tries to provide some amenities whenever possible called Sunday treats. The only adult books available to her are The Shack, Twilight, and The Da Vinci Code which sounds like hell to me for sure.""Old Nick"" is their captive and he's a real piece of shit. He turned his old shed into Room and ensured they will never get out by building in chain link fences into the walls and floors, as well as, sound-proofing the walls and skylight. Ma has tried to escape, without much success.However, when you think it's totally hopeless for Jack and Ma, there is a bit of hope that happens. I also liked the realistic ending, and I thank Emma Donoghue for not wrapping up the story in a feel-good, simple ending, which she could have done.I do agree with other ers that the first half of the book was better crafted than the second, and I too wanted more perspectives than just Jack's. I would have liked to of heard Ma's inner voice and feelings on what she was going through when Old Nick would pay her visits, what she felt when the electric went out, what her hopes and dreams were. I also would have liked to have known in some demented way, why Old Nick did what he did. Not that I would be able to wrap my head around it, but still an explanation would have been nice.All in all, this was a fast paced read that hooked me and kept me up, reading and wondering to the very end....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 07, 2011","Dec 30, 2011","Mar 07, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7937843-room

We've definitely made progress, but there's still a lot more progress that needs to be made, and maybe a good place to start is looking within ourselves.I am intrigued to hear her lecture at Elmhurst College on Narcissism: A Defense once it's rescheduled, (It was originally supposed to take place March 5, but we had a big snow storm so it was cancelled) as I like that she speaks her mind no matter what....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 17, 2013","Mar 08, 2013","Feb 17, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/353393.The_Female_Thing

The substance itself, or the technique of chewing it?""This book is equal parts philosophy, Russian literature (I really want to read Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina again), Japanese influences, friendship and life lessons, all laid out in an enchanting tale that swept me away and was hard to put down once I started. I definitely would recommend this one to others and might even revisit it again myself. I sort of wish I was fluent in French, so I could read this tale in its native language, as I'm sure it's even more beautiful that way, but this translation was very well done.

It also brought a quaint charm to the story as well, and reminded me that it's okay to live at a slower more thoughtful pace in today's super fast paced society. My goal for 2013 is to slow down and stop to smell the roses more.My favorite character's were Elizabeth, Isola, and Juliette - in that order. Elizabeth was my favorite because even though she's not alive, her personality and sense of duty come through very clearly through other's stories, as they explain the impact Elizabeth's actions had on their lives.Isola is my second favorite because she's just very much her own person. She has a parrot named Zenobia, rides a motorcycle with side cart, and spies on others Miss Marple style. Even though she gets it all wrong, she still brings people together with her wicked sense of humor.Then there is Juliette. She is the narrator of this story and it's through her letters to others - particularly Sidney and Sophie - that the reader learns the history of Guernsey during The Occupation and how The Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society was accidentally formed, but saved lives and gave others hope and courage through literature. Also, some predictable but awesome events happen to her while in Guernsey writing Elizabeth's story, but I'm trying not to spoil too much here so I'm not going to mention what they are.All in all, an excellent read that shows how wonderful people can be to one another, even in a war torn society....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 29, 2012","Jan 07, 2013","Dec 29, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2728527-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society

Well, I'm really glad I did.Andrew Vachss is a child advocate lawyer who writes. He didn't want to read anything from any of his novels. He didn't want to talk about his writing process or any of that other lofty crap that other writers like to talk about during public readings. He wanted to connect with the audience and have a discussion. Question and answers. I felt as if he was the most down to earth person I had met in a while, which was super refreshing. He was opinionated, passionate, and quite funny. All great things.Once the ""reading"" was over, I understood why Kevin admires him so much because I did too. So, I picked up this book that night. Andrew signed it and I took it home. When I finally got around to reading it; the story line was gritty, raw, and in your face. It's not a pretty story by any means, but what's presented is needed in order to make a point, which I liked.

Plus, I found this great  of the book on an online blog that I really liked, so I'm copying here with italics - as it's not my words, but I liked them none the less.Natural disasters, partisan rancor, unspeakable acts of violence around the world — what's not to worry about? It may sound silly, but this children's classic will offer you a sliver of comfort in this scary world. The bunny's mother, who will ""walk across the air"" to find her son at the circus, is constantly wise and reassuring.

So, she went to the store and asked the clerk if they had a fridge that she could just plug into the outlet and it would start working, nothing fancy because she didn't need it. Well it turns out, according to Betsy, that they don't make fridges without bells and whistles any more. The one she ended up buying came with a 500 page manual and when she couldn't get it programmed properly the first time, she had to actually read the instructions. Three hours later, she sighed and said ""I think it would be easier if they just made a web enabled fridge."" I said, ""be careful what you wish for,"" and proceeded to tell her about this story:It's a satire on how dependent we've become on technology, especially the Internet. Our lives are lived out on Tumbler, Facebook, Twitter. It's impossible not to have an Internet persona these days. However, what would happen if the Internet went down for an undisclosed amount of time, due to a higher being called Zathir, that communicates through your web-enabled fridge in different but effective fonts, took over? How would you react? Would you turn into a zombie or would you make the most of it and try to have an adventure? My favorite character in this one was Lyca. She loves to read and makes the most out of the mess. She's the one that handles the situation the best and isn't annoying like some of the other characters.

It's about a 32 year old bi-polar man named Wally, who leaves everything behind - his job, his medication, and his wife - in order to go on a mission to find and be honest with himself about his past.What was fascinating to me about the story was how it unfolds. Wally has written it all down in letters that have been mailed back to his wife Elizabeth. Thus, the reader is able to be in both Wally's and Elizabeth's shoes. Wally has not been a great husband, but he makes for a fantastic narrator. I also enjoyed the way the back story of his boyhood was weaved into the letters via philosophical discussions, literary references, and even a bit of genetics here and there. Even though the journey doesn't end happily, it ended as it should of, raw and to the point, which was why it took me so long to figure out my own twisted emotions regarding this story.So, in conclusion, if you like well written and thought out literary pieces that may leave you emotionally train wrecked for months after you put the book down, then you should definitely read this one.
