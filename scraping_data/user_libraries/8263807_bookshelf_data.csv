I also think it was a brilliant concept to turn the metaphor of the Underground Railroad into a postmodern, steampunkish actual railroad. Something about the way characters and events were presented, however, left me feeling like things were happening slightly below the surface and Cora's story never felt very real for me. Perhaps this was an intentional device to make the tone of the book mirror the railroads. For me, though, it just left me feeling a bit disconnected and sleepy throughout the whole read.

Every time I thought of reading it, this thought went through my head: ""I don't feel like reading a book about a hermaphrodite right now."" Then, when I finally started reading, I thought: ""Well, this isn't really about a hermaphrodite as much as it is a family saga and a personal history."" It wasn't until the end that I really got it. Callie/Cal isn't just a hermaphrodite, s/he is a person with a family and a history and a complex story to tell.  This book is beautifully written. It is dense and complicated and lovely to read. My only issue is that I found Callie/Cal's decision to live life as a male a bit abrupt but I think that was done intentionally to show that it actually wasn't an enormous, torturous decision for her/him but rather a natural one when the time was right.  In general, I would also say that the pacing felt a bit off.
