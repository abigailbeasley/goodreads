It doesn't pack the same amount of sheer love of literature that seeps through the sentences of Wind (although there's plenty of that here, too), but in terms of plot and thrills it might be even more engaging.I can see the ending as especially divisive - I adored it, but it's the kind of conclusion certain readers are bound to despise, and not necessarily for bad reasons.Must read for fans of Wind, or for people looking for an engaging novel in a Gothic vein....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,not set,"Sep 29, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4912857-the-angel-s-game
