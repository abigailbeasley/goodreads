I liked it, I did, but in trying to be the anti-Harry Potter/Narnia/Earthsea, the book didn't do it for me on a certain level. Being the ""anti"" book can make the story a bit predictable in some ways. Also, Quentin has to be one of the most unlikeable protagonists I've ever encountered. Yet, I did enjoy the way Grossman turned the genre on it's head and the realism of (some of) the interactions between the characters, and I'm interested in seeing how the characters have grown and changed (if they have at all) in The Magician King. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Aug 24, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6101718-the-magicians
