As someone who thinks Self-help books is a scam and thought this book was a scam because of some quotes I have heard about this book was a total no-no. But I did, gave it a fair chance and I was highly surprised. This book just broke my mold of what I thought I liked, challenged me. Never judge a book by others opinion.And the two quotes that has irked me - turns out it was taken out of context. The first one was sarcastic clearly and the next one - No he wasn't telling a grieving father to take responsibility for his son's death, moreover he was ashamed about it - he didn't go back and counter his tragedy with one of his own but said sorry which actually show growth.This book isn't perfect but it is the kind of tough love I feel I need. With social media with so much opinion about everything going around where you are expected to be offended at every little thing, it's important that we choose carefully what we should give a fuck about, what's actually productive and important to us. Take responsibility for ur own life because no one is going to come in to fix it. Give a fuck about yourself and only ur self. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 11, 2024","Feb 11, 2024","Jan 07, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck

This book was fast paced and till first twist for me it was a 3 star reads. It was predictable but not boring but then she goes completely unhinged. Here is the thing this book does use lot of domestic psychological thriller tropes nothing too out of the ordinary what I genuinely liked was most if the traditional published ones don't go completely unhinged, I am always waiting for something more, like you're not writing literary fiction just go completely unhinged. Also yes this has some plots similar to The Wife Between us and Behind close doors of abusive husbands that looks perfect from outside and women trying to get rid of him some way, so I won't say it's exact copy-I mean these are very common plot points. I would say McFadden executed it better, she kept them short and crisp. No beating around the bush and straight to the point. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 23, 2024","Jan 23, 2024","Jan 07, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60556912-the-housemaid
