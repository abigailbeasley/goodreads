Arthur Prescott teaches literature at a glass and concrete English university in the town of Barchester, but his passion is to be in the library of the local cathedral which houses books and manuscripts dating back centuries. When Arthur is in the library, he is in his element as he researches the history of the cathedral to complete a guidebook that is long overdue. He is convinced that there is a lost manuscript about the original founder of the cathedral and is determined to find it. Arthur is also a secret enthusiast of the legend of the Holy Grail, and is convinced not only that the Grail is real, but that it has a connection to Barchester Cathedral and that perhaps, the missing manuscript could contain clues concerning the Grail. But when Bethany Davis, a young American researcher arrives charged with the task of digitizing all of Barchester's manuscripts, Arthur's world is turned up side down. Not only resistant, but downright unaware of, of modern technology, Arthur is determined to thwart Bethany's efforts as much as possible. That is until he finds out that Bethany is a Grail enthusiast as well. As sure as opposites attract, Arthur and Bethany combine their individual talents to the search for the manuscript and, along the way, discover how each compliments the other. An adventure and a mystery, wrapped around an improbable love story. With well crafted, easily readable prose and characters that are likable and well developed, Lovett has given us another book about books that both entertains and informs.

More than 1400 others have done so, and I doubt that mine will reveal anything new. Suffice it to say that this one will stay with me for some time. Abraham Lincoln's son, Willie, died at the age of eleven in early 1862. The nation is less than a year into the Civil War and it has become apparent that it will not be over as easily as many had predicted. Lincoln has already come under criticism for his conduct of the war and he is under constant pressure to resolve the conflict. Willie's death devastated his father, who is reported to have visited his dead son's tomb to sit and grieve over the body. From these historical facts, George Saunders has crafted a story so unique in its telling as to leave the reading wondering ""what have I gotten into?""As Willie lays in his crypt, he finds himself in the ""bardo"", a purgatory, or limbo-like state between life and whatever lies beyond. Others inhabit this space, and it is through them that the story is told. All have died, but refuse to accept their deaths, convinced that their ""sickness"" will end and they will return to their former life. But only through accepting death can they escape the bardo. While at first longing to remain and see his father, it is Willie who recognizes what he must do to ease his father's grief so that he may address the seemingly insurmountable tasks that face him as President. Engaging and confusing; heart rending and humorous; realistic and magical; some readers may give up on this one. But whether you give up or embrace it to the end, you will not forget it, nor see its equal for some time to come....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Feb 22, 2017","Feb 28, 2017","Jan 04, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

Soon, Walter has proven to be a hopeful and helpful addition to Laural and Hank's world. But Walter bears a secret and, that, along with the misplaced fear and prejudice of the townspeople, threaten to destroy all of Laural's dreams. Simply put, Rash is a writer's writer. His characters are developed so completely the reader has no doubt who they are. His prose can mesmerize. As you read of climbing the cliff blocking the sun from the cove, you feel the warmth of the sunlight at the top. His stories do not always end totally happy, and this one is no exception. But they do end with a certain hope and justice, and the journey to those endings can be unforgettable....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Feb 18, 2017","Feb 22, 2017","Jan 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11807189-the-cove

This book was enchanting, and what's great is that there are more to come from this gifted author. Set in medieval Rus, or Russia, the book spins a tale of Vasilisa, the youngest daughter of a well to do land owner. Her mother, the daughter of royalty, who died at Vasilisa's birth, was thought to have magical insight into the realm of creatures who are believed to protect home and forest from evil, particularly Frost, the blue-eyed demon who steals unsuspecting souls. As Vasilisa grows, she discovers that she too can see and communicate with these protecting creatures.When Vasilisa's father goes to Moscow and returns with a new wife, things change. Her step-mother, devoted to the ""new"" Christianity, is haunted by the ancient spirits and immediately forbids the household from making tributes to them. She demands that Vasilisa embrace the new beliefs or spend her life in a convent. Fearing for her family and village, Vasilisa is faced with yielding to her step-mother's demands, or using her special powers to defeat the evil that threatens. Based on an old Russian folktale, Katherine Arden has crafted an exciting and engaging story that leaves the reader wishing for more. I am looking forward to what comes next. ...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Feb 13, 2017","Feb 17, 2017","Dec 10, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25489134-the-bear-and-the-nightingale

I had a few issues with George's first book, ""The Good American"". It started out great, with a strong story and two engaging and well developed characters. But about half way in, it started to drift. The main storyline got lost among a number of side stories that seemed to be dropped in for comic relief. But here, George stayed on course with a well written coming-of-age story that examines the bonds of friendship, particularly when opposites attract; the recognition that adults make bad choices too, and can be forgiven; and the power of memory to heal.

It is New Years Eve, 1984, and she has reservations at her favorite restaurant for an early dinner and then home to bed well before the ball drops. But as the night begins, Lillian decides to engage in a favorite pastime. She decides to take a walk. As she passes many of the landmarks in the city she has lived in and loved for more than sixty years, Lillian reflects on the landmarks of her life. A highly successful career in advertising and as a poet, built on her own independent spirit, a marriage, built on a deep love and a divorce arising from the betrayal of that love, motherhood, mental breakdown and eventually a reconciliation with the past. Along the way, Lillian encounters a host of characters. A restaurant owner who is giving up on the city, a limo driver concerned for her safety, a bodega clerk wise beyond his youth and young friends whose lifestyle is both bewildering and intriguing. In all of this, Lillian engages people with tolerance, a sense of humor, grace, and a civility that has become rare in the changing city. In Lillian Boxfish, who is based on a real person, Kathleen Rooney has given us a remarkable character, not soon forgotten.

Anil, born in Sri Lanka, but educated as a forensic anthropologist in Britain and the US, returns to her homeland as part of a human rights groups effort to investigate atrocities being committed during the years long civil war that ravaged the nation in the late twentieth century. Participants in the war have seemingly lost contact with ""causes"" and the conflict has reached a point where ""...the purpose of war becomes war"".Teamed with a well known Sri Lankan archeologist, Sarath, whose true loyalties become suspect at the outset, Anil must navigate a dangerous course to uncover the truth. Along the way, she meets Sarath's physician brother and an alcoholic artist who each have been touched by the ravages of the war. The detective story is rather standard, but with Ondaatje's engaging and lyrical prose, and his descriptions of the country's rich and centuries old past, the reader is rewarded with a particularly good experience.

His stories my end with redemption; with justice; with reconciliation, but usually not with happiness. This latest effort is a case in point. In the late sixties, two teenaged boys living in a small town in North Carolina fall under the bewitching spell of a young girl who is visiting from the Florida coast. A full-fledged member of the counterculture which is sweeping the country, but has not yet reached their town, she entices them with ""free love"" and all that it entails. This encounter not only contributes to the arc each brothers future will take, but also permanently alters the relationship between them. When, some forty years later, a tragic incident comes to light, the brothers are forced to revisit and confront what happened during that long ago summer.With his usual well crafted prose, Rash provides just enough about the present, as well as the past, to keep the reader wanting to know what happens next. I did not find any of the characters particularly likable, but I still wanted to know how they all turned out. This unique quality in Rash's writing, which invests readers in characters they may not particularly like, is I think what sets his stories apart.

Simply an engaging, well written story of a family, not what I would call disfunctional, but certainly complicated. Not so far removed from families everywhere. When Asst. DA Bert Cousins hears about a christening party at the home of Fix and Beverly Keating, he decides to crash the party. Bert and his wife Shirley have three children with a fourth on the way, but for some reason, he wants to get away and, hence, becomes the gate crasher. Before the night is over however, he has kissed and fallen in love with the stunningly beautiful Beverly Keating. Before long, Bert has left Shirley with their four children and married Beverly with her two and the have moved across country to Virginia. Over the next forty years, as the six siblings grow into adulthood and their parents move on to other relationships, we see the far reaching effects of that kiss at the party. There is hate, but also love; there are mistakes in judgement, but also reconciliation with the consequences. Over time, we learn about each of the major characters, as well has a host of minor ones. Each have their flaws, but they are all, in one way or another, likable individuals. Like I said, complicated. But highly entertaining.

Could the author really pull off a story with an unborn fetus as the narrator?Well, McEwan did it, and then some!! With exceedingly elegant prose, he takes a rather standard murder thriller and makes it a page-turner while the reader totally suspends any disbelief as to who is telling the story. How he did it, I will never know, but I'm glad he did. Trudy, pregnant with her first child, has thrown her husband, John, out of the valuable town home that was his inheritance, explaining that she needs ""space"". Actually she has a continuing affair with John's brother, Claude. Together, Trudy and Claude begin to plot John's murder. Listening to all this plotting is Trudy's fetus, who has become remarkably intelligent and aware of the world by listening to television and the podcasts Trudy has a tendency to leave on while she over imbibes with her favorite wine. How the fetus copes with his(her) own need for ""space"", deals with an evolving love/hate relationship with his mother, and pauses along the way for brief commentary on world affairs, makes for some interesting reading. While the story may be inspired by Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" and the prose often evokes the Bard, McEwan has given us a thoroughly modern story that should not be missed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 14, 2016","Sep 17, 2016","Aug 02, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29752912-nutshell

Peppered with observations and the occasional asides about any number of current events and cultural references, the book had me chuckling with every page. By then, I was hooked, and that's when everything changed to what can only be called a ""coming of age"" story with a unique twist. Most coming of age stories involve a child or teenager, faced with an event that informs their journey into adulthood. In ""The Nix"", however, the ""coming of age"" involves a thirty something college professor-failed writer and his sixty something mother who abandoned him some twenty plus years before. Samuel has not heard or seen his mother, Faye, since she abandoned her family. When she is thrust into the national spotlight by an overblown criminal act involving an aspiring presidential candidate, he is forced to confront his memory of her, as well as the apparent contradictions this current event has on that memory. Samuel and Faye have both spent their lives dealing with a ""nix"", or, to be more precise, many ""nixes"". Those ideas, infatuations, courses of action, that promise so much happiness and success, only to betray one in the end. How they both resolve the mistakes they have made and come to an understanding of who they really are forms the heart and soul of this remarkable book. Many have criticized, or at least lamented, the length of the book, coming in at more than 600 pages. To be sure, there are a few sections that could well be stand-alone stories in themselves, and might have been shortened or left out entirely. I think this would have been a mistake. Samuel and Faye are on a long journey, so too the reader. Beyond Samuel and Faye, Hill introduces us to a broad range of well developed characters, that, at first, seem to be incidental to the main story, but are all brought together in a remarkably satisfying ending. An exceptional first novel, by a skilled and astute writer who I look forward to reading in the future.

A retelling of Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"", here we have a Kate a little less ""shrewish"" than the original; Pyotr, her suitor, a little softer than Petruchio; Bunny, her sister, just as ditzy and self absorbed as ever; and her father, equal parts brilliant and bewildered.

I often think that there is a hole in our American history, or at least in my knowledge of it. It seems that history books, literature, movies and other media skip over the twenty or thirty years spanning the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first fifteen years of the twentieth. It's like everything slowed down after that gunfight in Tombstone and didn't pick up again until World War I. Yet this was a time when the country was coming of age. The survival of the Union was assured, the continent had been settled all the way to the Pacific, there were forty-eight stars on the flag, and the US was becoming a player on the world stage. It was a time of transition, the blending of the fading old with the emerging new. With this book, Winston Groom has gone a long way to provide us with the sense and ""feel"" of this often overlooked period in history. With well crafted, easily readable prose, he spins a western yarn of the ""good guys pursuing the bad guys"", while at the same time, in episodic fashion, alludes to many of the historical events of the era. John Shaughnessy, known as the Colonel, has built a railroad empire. As he has grown older, he has passed much of the management of the business along to his adopted son, Arthur. Like many of their contemporaries, the Shaughnessys also own and operate a large cattle ranch in central Mexico. With the Mexican Revolution raging around them, the American owned ranches have enjoyed a ""hands-off"" approach from the revolutionaries. That changes when the forces of Pancho Villa kidnap Arthur's daughter and son, the Colonel's grandchildren. With no help coming from the US government, the Colonel and Arthur mount their own rescue mission with a small band of daring cowboys. As they pursue Villa into the Sierra Madre, we meet a host of characters, some historical, others imagined. A rip-roaring, hell-bent for leather tale set in an exciting time in America's history. Don't let this one pass you by. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Sep 03, 2016","Sep 07, 2016","Jul 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28789655-el-paso

Augie, a highly accomplished astronomer and researcher, is alone at an Artic research facility after voluntarily refusing to be evacuated. Something has happened in the outside world, the airwaves have gone silent, no communication from anyone. He is alone. Shortly after the evac however, he discovers a ten-year old girl, apparently missed in the evacuation. Together, they face an uncertain future. But, more and more, Augie finds the past occupying his thoughts. Ever committed to his work, Augie has spent his whole life shunning everyone, toying with the emotions of others, and rejecting companionship of any kind. Now, as he sees his life coming to a close, what has he missed? Was the success of his work, the praise and accolades, worth the loss of love and companionship? At the same time, Mission Specialist Sully is hurdling through space as part of a six-person crew of astronauts who have just completed a mission to explore Jupiter. As they begin their return to Earth, Mission Control, indeed the whole world, goes silent. What will they find when they return home. Will there even be a home. Caught in a similar environment of vast emptiness as Augie, Sully also finds herself reflecting on the life she has led and the losses she has endured. A failed marriage, a daughter she hardly knows. Has her successful career provided the reward she sought, or is something missing? Can this missing piece ever be found?In well crafted, easily readable prose, Brooks-Dalton tells a story that seeks to understand what is important for human survival. What makes us what we are? What drives humanity to continue? Certainly, one of the best books of the year.

When his son asks him to come home for two weeks to watch his two grandchildren while the son and his wife are out of town for the wife to have an operation, he grudgingly agrees.

Convinced by their local minister, they undertook the extraordinary step to quarantine themselves to prevent the further spread of the disease. Based on this true story, Geraldine Brooks has crafted a well written, engrossing novel of how the people of this village faced the terrifying year that followed. Told through the eyes of a young housemaid, the story reveals both the best and worst of human behavior.If Brooks does anything well, it is her research, and her amazing capability to convert that research into well crafted, easily readable prose. We see not only the nature of the disease and its effect on people, but we learn how people lived their daily lives, how the spoke, dressed and earned a living. Some s have been critical of the pace of the writing, but I found it fitting to the story. Imagine living during a time when days are marked by who among your friends or family has died, when weeks are marked by how many fewer people attend Sunday worship.

Reggie Kendell is a thirty-five year old native of Boston's well-to-do. Married to a highly successful and respected attorney and mother of two young girls, she should be happy with the future. Yet her nagging feelings of unhappiness and lack of purpose, turn serious when they start affecting her marriage and family and she becomes obsessed with ""what could have been"" after spending her fourteenth year in a small Arizonia town when her anthropologist father was studying the Hopi Indians.

Both a story of coming of age and returning to youth, Parry weaves a story of real and imagined love, the power and weakness of memory and the discovery of purpose and redemption. And throughout the story, almost as characters themselves, are the high deserts of the Southwest and the spiritual foundation of the Hopi Way of Life.

Despite these differences, they fell in love and, until recently, have enjoyed a happy and loving relationship. But Robert is haunted by an incident he experienced during the war which he has yet to confess to his wife. Robert's younger brother Jimmy, on the other hand, chose not to fight in the war and, with his eventual wife, Linda, fled to Canada to avoid service. The two brothers have not spoken to each other for some forty years. Their father, William, a veteran of WWII, revels in his own service and , by all appearances, that of his older son. For Jimmy however, he feels nothing and has shunned him completely. His wife, Peggy, torn between an ever distant husband and the virtual loss of her second son to exile, continually resorts to manipulation to satisfy her own wishes. When William suffers a serious injury, two generations of one family must confront the choices they have made, the lasting effects of those choices on themselves and others, and how each will continue with their lives. With skillfully crafted writing, Butler has provided us with a story of a family divided, a glimpse of a nation divided, and a thought provoking account of the long lasting costs of war. If you lived through that era, and particularly, if you did not, don't let this one pass you by. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 19, 2016","Aug 21, 2016","May 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28819020-perfume-river

In this case the London Blitz.Mary North, fresh out of finishing school, volunteers for war service with high expectations only to be assigned to teach children not evacuated from London at the beginning of the war. She apparently falls in love with her boss, Tom Shaw, and they become engaged. When Tom's flat mate, Alistair Heath, who joined the Army shortly after war was declared, returns from the British defeat in France and the evacuation at Dunkirk, he is smitten with Mary as she is with him. The uncertainties created by this triangle of love and the tragedies of war, both at home and abroad, form the basis of a multilayered novel that is next to impossible to put down. With exceptional prose, Cleave provides us with characters, not always likable, but always real. Characters who withstand unimaginable hardship and loss, and yet maintain a sense of humanity with courage and love, and more than a little wit and humor. Five stars, to be sure. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"May 06, 2016","May 14, 2016","Apr 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25814512-everyone-brave-is-forgiven

Then, about a quarter of the way in, it picked up the pace and became a very enjoyable read. In the early nineteenth century, James and Sadie Goodenough move their family from the northeast to an area of Ohio known as the Black Swamp in hopes of starting a new life on what was then the frontier of the country. James, determined to plant the fifty apple trees required to claim the land, becomes hardened and obsessed by his orchard. Sadie, on the other hand, is overwhelmed by life on the swamp and becomes more and more embittered toward James and his trees. Over the years, the relationship between the two turns into a hateful, never ending feud. When this feud reaches a tragic ending, Robert, the youngest of the five Goodenough children, abandons his family and starts a years long wandering westward, eventually ending in the redwood groves of California. Here he must confront his past in order to find the life he so dearly wants. As I said, the first quarter of the book, with it's decidedly unlikeable characters of James and Sadie, seems to drag, but as the story turns to that of Robert, it picks up substantially. Too, with the background of the area surrounding the redwood and sequoia groves of California, it gives us a glimpse of a little known part of American history.Robert's story gets four stars, but I have to make it a strong three with that ponderous beginning. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jul 08, 2016","Jul 22, 2016","Apr 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24611681-at-the-edge-of-the-orchard

A slim volume of three long short stories, I was by no means disappointed. All three stories involve recollections of youth by the narrator as he grew up in the Tidewater area of Virginia. In the first a young Marine, trained to kill, and outwardly anxious to enter combat, silently acknowledges his relief to find out that his unit will not take part in an upcoming invasion. The second story recounts an episode involving a family, who on the surface appear to be ""poor white trash"", but who ultimately display a compassion and humanity rarely seen. The title story is a heartwrenching account of a thirteen year old, navigating his transition into manhood, while coping with the terminal illness of his mother and the affect it has had on his parents and himself.With exquisite prose and a host of memorable characters, Styron provides us with insight of how our lives are not only effected by the experiences of our youth, but by their memories as well....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 27, 2016","Mar 04, 2016","Feb 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1901434.A_Tidewater_Morning

A relatively minor character, we learn she is set in her ways, highly critical of others, and someone who is not particularly likable. Here, we learn the full story. How she has spent almost all her sixty-three years in the shadows of other people, and done so voluntarily. At last she has left her philandering husband of forty years and finds herself on her own and manages to find a temporary job as a caretaker of a recreation center in the run down village of Borg. ""Borg is a community built along a road. That's really the kindest thing one can say about it. It's not a place that could be described as one in a million, rather as one of millions of others.""As Britt-Marie navigates through the cast of eccentric characters she finds in Borg, we see her slowly acknowledge her own feelings, her ability to act for herself, to ""make the jump"".Often laugh-out-loud funny, we also encounter passages of warm affection, incredible tragedy, the power of friendship and the elation of victory.Like I said, I don't know how Backman does it, but I look forward to him continuing to amaze me with his wit and wisdom. Don't let this one pass you by. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jun 19, 2016","Jun 24, 2016","Jan 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27406704-britt-marie-was-here

Still a great second installment of the series featuring the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. While many of the characters here were first introduced in Shadow, this is a separate story and can be read and enjoyed by itself. Gothic tales require a spooky mansion and this one has at least two, along with plenty of spooky alleyways and neighborhoods. There is also the required damsel in distress, sinister police, and plenty of apparent madness and insanity. Unlike Shadow, this one also touches on the supernatural as well. Zafon takes all these elements and, with a generous dose of humor, wit and banter, provides us with a narrative that will keep the pages turning while wondering what will happen next.

Spanning some eight decades, from the late 1930's to present day, this is the story of a forbidden, but lasting, love affair between Alma, a San Francisco sophisticate, and Ichimei, the son of her family's Japanese gardener. Now in her eighties, and living in a retirement home, Alma begins to share her long-kept secret with Irena, her Moldovian born assistant, who is haunted by her own tragic past. As the story progresses, we recognize the abiding power of love. Using more narrative than dialog, Alende skillfully takes the reader through many of the major historical moments of the 20th Century. While this approach may have left some of the characters less than fully developed, I still found them all to be real enough to drive the story, which never falls into melodrama. All in all, a very good read. I will look forward to adding Alende more and more to my ""to read"" list. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 21, 2016","Mar 24, 2016","Dec 03, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25152052-the-japanese-lover

A bombing, claimed by Irish terrorists, has destroyed Scotland Yard, and others are threatened. Thaniel, a telegrapher, finds himself caught up in the investigation of a Japanese watchmaker, Mr. Mori, who makes things far more complicated than watches. But does he make bombs?As Thaniel becomes more convinced that Mori is not the bomb maker, he meets Grace, a would be physicist, who neither likes nor trusts the watchmaker. With these well developed characters, the story proceeds to a satisfying ending with just enough of a twist to make the reader grin at the last page.

Much more than just a thirty second incident involving righteous lawmen and insidious outlaws, the gunfight, and its aftermath, marked an era of political posturing, media frenzy and a country trying to mature.As complicated as the story is, Russell gives us a well rounded picture of all the main characters, the Earps and Doc Holliday and the Clantons and McLaurys.

Here we meet Flynn, who is asked by her brother to stand in for him to beta test a video game.But it is not a game, but another reality, some seventy years in the future, in which she witnesses a murder!This time is marked by economic warfare, by corporate entities that will stop at nothing to win. There is no ""time travel"" in the classic sense, but people have found a way to transfer information from one time to another. People from the past can be brought to this future, not in body, but through ""peripherals"", and Flynn finds herself caught up in this future war as she moves back and forth between these worlds.Heavy Sci-Fi for sure, but after those first fifty or so pages, the story takes on the trappings of a good old fashion murder mystery, or perhaps a international thriller, or maybe a suspense tale.

They study and work together. They share their secrets, their dreams with each other. They support and encourage the individual talents of each member.But, as supportive and inclusive as the group is, Tazaki continually feels that he is the lesser of the group. For one thing, each of the others have colors in their names, but Tazaki's name is ""colorless"". Each of the others has a unique talent, but he can find no such talent of his own. All he can do is dream of building train stations, but that can't compare to the talents of his friends.After graduation, Tazaki is the only member of the group to leave their home town for college. The others all attend school close to home and remain in a group. But Tazaki is still considered a member and visits whenever school permits.But in his second year one of the group tells him they no longer wish to associate with him. No reason given, no explanation, no elaboration. Tazaki is devastated and considers suicide, or at least the thought of dying. While he makes it through this period, he becomes more and more convinced that his ""colorlessness"" has led to his banishment from the group. Sixteen years pass and Tazaki is an engineer building train stations, what he always dreamed of doing. But he continues to perceive himself as ""colorless"" and finds it difficult to recognize any success in his life.Then he meets Sara, and while previous relationships have come and gone (certainly due to his lack of ""color"") he desperately wants this one to succeed. He shares his story with Sara and she suggests that it is time for him to recontact his former friends and get to the bottom of why they shunned him. He agrees, and embarks on a journey to find not only the truth, but also is own self worth.As complex as the themes and emotions of the story are, it is amazing how easy this book was to read. It took me longer than I had wanted due to work, but it could easily be read in three or four good sessions. Murakami's prose is simple, but complete. You feel the emotions of the characters. You will want Tazaki to find his ""color"". An overall good read and a strong four stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 07, 2014","Oct 13, 2014","Sep 02, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/19288239-colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage

Let's hope it does not take her that long to provide us with more of well crafted prose. Here she has given us characters who can be likeable and unlikeable, often at the same time, and a story that is universal in describing what a family can be. The family is the Eapens, surgeon Thomas, his wife Kamala, who, with their son, Akhil, emigrated from India to New Mexico some thirty years prior. Their daughter, Amina, is born shortly after their arrival. We also meet Thomas' mother and brother in India and a variety of extended family in both countries. Through the first half of the book, we see all the dysfunction that impacts this family. Mothers who attempt to manipulate their children; fathers who concentrate on work at the expense of family; teenagers who rebel against authority; siblings who feel jealous and abandoned; young adults who defy the traditions of their parents. But as the story continues we see that, with all the hurt, heartache and regret, there is a balance here. We find acts of loyalty and respect; of compassion and support; of humor and joy. There is love here, and it binds this family together. Late in the story Amina reflects that she ""...found solace in the idea that some things could just fade gently away instead of be analyzed and rationalized and validated. Sometimes, things could just get better."" That's how this book should be read. Don't get too hung up on the dysfunction. Cry when you have to, laugh when you can. Relax and let the story happen.
