The woman eavesdropping on all this finds out the young men have just been released from prison. What to do? After gleaning all the necessary information to make a call and warn their parents, the woman agonizes over whether or not to meddle and ultimately does not make the call.

TrulI have read three other Ann Patchett books (""The Patron Saint of Liars,"" ""Run,"" and the award-winning ""Bel Canto""), and I have loved all of them. Truly loved them. They were very different from each other- the settings, the themes, the tone, the pacing - and yet, I connected with all of them and often recall scenes and moments that still speak to me and move me. ""State of Wonder,"" on the other hand, was so devoid of authenticity from start to finish that it felt like it wasn't even written by Patchett, and I am a little heartbroken to have to give it a bad . (There may be spoilers ahead.)The story centers around Marina, a middle-aged pharmacologist working for a large pharma company (and entwined in a secret relationship with the CEO) whose lab partner and friend is sent to the Amazon to track down the brilliant and headstrong elderly ethnobotanist, who is being generously funded for her research into a remarkable new drug, but has not been reporting back on her progress for months at a time. When the lab partner sent to track her down is subsequently reported to have died there, the CEO decides to send Marina to the Amazon to do what her friend could not. Do you see the problems with this scenario already? Why is an elderly ethnobotanist being left to her own devices for months, sometimes years, with virtually no contact whatsoever (she could be dead for all they know) by a pharma company who continues to foot the bill for all of her needs despite having no idea how far she has come in the drug development process? [Note: I have worked for big pharma - this would NEVER happen.] Why are two people wholly unequipped for difficult passage in the Amazon sent ALONE to scope out the situation? [Note: A wealthy pharma company would provide a team, a guide, a plan of some sort. A middle-aged sedentary lab doctor would not be the first choice for this mission.] And why would...Let me stop myself here. This was the problem with every sentence of ""State of Wonder."" Not a single scenario made any sense at all. Every plot contrivance was so ludicrous, in fact, that I started to wonder if this were not a straightforward narrative at all, but a set-up, and that I would discover somewhere in the middle of the book that this was some existential dream - the fever dream of a woman in the Amazon or a woman in an asylum or some sort of drug-induced delirium. I started to actually hope that it was, because that would have made the book far more interesting and believable. I won't go on. You see my issues here. I gave the book two stars, because despite it's ridiculousness, I kept reading, which is something I rarely do when contrivances bother me this much. I still wanted to see if something unexpected would redeem the story, some greater point would be made or some hint of genuine connection would surface to remind me of the writer whose books I have come to love over the years. Unfortunately, that did not happen. If you don't mind suspending disbelief over and over again, by all means, read this book. The prose is still captivating and the characters hold a weird mystique. But if you like a well-crafted, thoughtful book with genuine depth and enough realism to create a connection, try one of the other Patchett books mentioned above. They are far superior to this one and shine a better light on an author I otherwise highly recommend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 10, 2020","Feb 24, 2020","Feb 10, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/10288116-state-of-wonder

When my list turned out to be largely just a list of places to which I had not yet traveled, I was told to choose at least one thing I have always wanted to do, regardless how improbable it might seem. I've never wanted to jump out of an airplane or swim with sharks, but I'm just a big enough nerd that I have always wanted to solve a mystery - a cold case crime or a strange occurrence that many have puzzled over but no one has ever figured out conclusively. Donnie Eichar, the author of ""Dead Mountain"" appears to be a kindred soul in that respect. Upon hearing about the Dyatlov Pass Incident, a tragic mystery that involved the deaths of nine young Russian hikers in 1959, he became obsessed with the case, burying himself in research, contacting Russians with ties to the story, and depleting his own resources to make the trip to the Urals to retrace the steps of the ill-fated hikers. The mystery itself is fascinating, and when Eichar follows the timeline of 1959 and these fresh-faced college students, eager to conquer the challenge of a harsh terrain, unaware of the fate that would befall them, the tale is riveting. It is when he tries to flesh it out with the story of his own attempt to recreate those conditions that the writing occasionally bogs down, much the way a really good short story writer may turn out a middling novel just by overreaching.Here are the basic facts that make the Dyatlov Pass incident a mystery for the ages, causing almost everyone who has ever heard of it to ponder its many facets:1) Nine healthy, young, experienced hikers are all found dead in two separate groups and areas of the frozen Ural tundra after failing to return home on time.2) Their bodies are found only partially clad, none of them is wearing shoes or boots.3) Their tent is found in perfect order, boots lined up neatly, stove partially assembled, fully stocked with food, dinner having been prepared and eaten.4) The back wall of the tent appears to have been slashed open with a knife from the inside in order to allow panic-stricken hikers to exit.5) Strange orbs of light had been seen in the area that month by other hiking groups.6) Government testing was thought to be done in that region, some of it nuclear on occasion, and the clothing of the hikers is found to have higher than usual radiation.7) One hiker is found with her tongue missing and another with no eyes.8) Several hikers have apparent blunt force trauma, despite official cause of death for most, if not all, hikers being, ultimately, hypothermia.9) The area has other potential real or imagined threats, including a logging camp, a prison camp, a Mansi enclave, and the usual wild animals.Donnie Eichar does a nice job at the end of the book, by going down the list of every viable longstanding theory in this case and effectively debunking each one. His vast knowledge and research supported this rejection of accepted theories, and I found it very plausible. Like Sherlock Holmes, he had told himself that ""when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" The problem being that once Eichar had eliminated what he believed to be the impossible, nothing was left. And here, maybe because he felt compelled to solve this mystery or maybe because his editor had told him he had better solve this mystery or the book would not be published, Eichar came up with a theory of his own. A theory that has some interesting science behind it and makes for yet another facet to this tragic riddle surrounding young lives lost. The author seems certain he has solved the mystery, but I came away just as convinced that this was not the answer. In the end, perhaps no one will ever solve the Dyatlov Pass Incident. For those who read the book and wonder why I may not be on board with the author's final conclusion, I point again to the boots that not even one experienced hiker chose to put on or even grab on the way out of the tent that night, knowing he or she was about to encounter sub-zero temps on a harsh, windy night. In addition, his theory rests on the idea that all parties responded similarly to the phenomenon detailed, an assumption I find outlandish. And ultimately, I find it interesting that no theories ever took into consideration human interaction or the possibility of turmoil or threat within the group. Regardless, for me, this mystery remains unsolved, although Eichar has laid out the details of the trip (and the many solid theories that survive to this day) very well in a book that is fascinating and a quick read. So, check it out. Maybe you will finally be the one to solve what really happened on Dead Mountain. I will most likely think about this tragic conundrum off and on forever, while I seek yet another mystery to solve....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 08, 2020","Jan 27, 2020","Jan 08, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18881732-dead-mountain

Twenty years ago."" - (Chinese saying)In ""The Overstory,"" Richard Powers has given the world a love story to nature, and even more specifically, to trees. But fear not, reader, this is not some extended Joyce Kilmer poem or Hallmark card to our dwindling natural world. It is a series of thought-provoking character studies - linked vignettes that take a hard, sometimes gritty, look at human interaction (with trees and with each other) - that offer a dire warning to the inhabitants of earth, as well as a plan of action for possible salvation. Powers makes a strong case for what should be the obvious fact that if those of us in the ""understory"" do not preserve the ""overstory,"" only one of these will cease to exist, and it won't be the latter. The trees and the natural world have thousands, even millions, of years to rebound, (years they will need after we have decimated so much forest land), while we may have only scant years left to practice optimum conservation and save ourselves in the process.Powers is smart enough to know that facts and figures and a preachy didactic tome will never get his point across. He takes the advice of one of his own characters who declares, “The best arguments in the world won't change a person's mind. The only thing that can do that is a good story.” And a good story is what we get. In fact, we get a series of good stories, as Powers introduces us to nine main characters, many of whom will find that their lives intersect later on in the book. It's a clever device. One I was not sure was effective at first, because I did not know these separate, seemingly isolated stories would connect later on, but I came to appreciate this bit of craft as I moved deeper into the book and saw that the lives of our characters were made to mimic the lives of the trees, interconnected, communicating with each other, anticipating each other's needs, sometimes directly, and sometimes in subtle, unseen ways. The author knows we are vain, self-absorbed humans who need to focus on human needs or anthropomorphize the world around us, so he makes us care about nature and the need to protect the trees by making us care about a collection of people who care about the trees. He admits this ploy late in the book when a character tells us, ""To be human is to mistake a satisfying story with a meaningful one, and to mistake life for something huge with two legs. No: life is mobilized on a vastly larger scale, and the world is failing precisely because no novel can make the contest for the world seem as compelling as the struggles between a few lost people.""Among these ""few lost people"" in ""The Overstory"" we meet an artist with a tragic past, a jetsetting businesswoman, a young psychologist from a dysfunctional family, a married couple facing challenges, an injured soldier turned Johnny Appleseed, a brilliant computer game designer, a college coed who comes back from electrocution with a gift, and my favorite character in the book, the organic chemist Patricia Westerford, who gives us the important scientific component of this dire ecological equation, while also giving us one of the more emotionally compelling and tender stories in the book. Powers wants us to know that we are always going to be exposed to the stories other people tell and some stories may have more passion or be more enchanting or just feel truer, but unless they are backed up by science, they are just fiction, and we should know the difference. As a girl, Dr. Westerford learns to love nature and the language of trees from a kind, attentive father who explores botany with her in childhood experiments: ""She hears him, and understands. This is science and worth a million times more than anything any person might ever swear to you.""In addition to this scientific component, Powers introduces a powerful psychological component to our seeming inability to act on what should be an urgent issue. The fallacy that consensus is truth. This is introduced in the story of our military man turned forest savior: “In fact, it's Douggie's growing conviction that the greatest flaw of the species is its overwhelming tendency to mistake agreement for truth. Single biggest influence on what a body will or won't believe is what nearby bodies broadcast over the public band. Get three people in the room and they'll decide that the law of gravity is evil and should be rescinded because one of their uncles got shit-faced and fell off the roof.” And while this seems anecdotal, we later learn from our psychology professor that study after study confirms it. People act based on the beliefs of the crowd. Even if the crowd is very, very wrong.As a final example, I'll mention the story of the computer programmer, who builds a world more lush and plentiful than the world we know, a world that causes its players to sit huddled in basements for hours at a time trying to build a better version of their existence. While our own world is being torn down around us, the world of this game lures players with its endless paradise -until one savvy player complains that there is no point to it. There is no endgame. Players just amass more and more meaningless things to no avail. The programmer is forced to admit he has a Midas problem - ""Everything's dying a gold-plated death."" The name of the game: Mastery.I could write a  as long as the book itself, but that may be the greatest gift of ""The Overstory,"" because despite the fact that it is a bit too long and sometimes confusing, and builds on many stories told by other authors in other books (Bill Bryson, for one, taught me about the chestnut trees long before Powers did), it is a book that forces you to think, and maybe even to act. For that alone, it may deserve a five star rating, because you may read other, more compelling stories about a few lost people in your lifetime, but few will make you contemplate what that lifetime means and whether or not your species should be the only star of that history.Lastly, I fully understand the irony of having read this book in a hardcover format (I think it would have been a brilliant move to make it only available in downloaded versions), but as Dr. Westerford tells us, “To solve the future, we must save the past. My simple rule of thumb, then, is this: when you cut down a tree, what you make from it should be at least as miraculous as what you cut down.” ""The Overstory"" has accomplished that feat, and then some....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 20, 2019","Dec 04, 2019","Nov 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40180098-the-overstory

It is a letter he knows she will never read because she cannot speak or read English, and it is the only way he feels able to reveal the details of their story while she is still alive, a story full of nightmares, memories, confessions, and the many ways there are to feel displaced in the world. The son, called Little Dog, now a man in his late twenties, admits to his mother: “I only have the nerve to tell you…because the chance this letter finds you is slim – the very impossibility of your reading this is all that makes my telling it possible.”There is no way to adequately describe the impact of this novel in a ; you really just have to read it. Maybe it is because Ocean Vuong is a poet first, the imagery he conjures is both delicate and raw, but also potent and unexpected at every turn. He is able to juxtapose beauty and brutality in the lives of his characters and find a way to come to terms with both, often in prose that is somehow both lush and concise, gorgeous and sparse, a tightrope walk of paradoxy. He has managed, in a relatively short book, to capture the whole world. Family bonds, war, abuse, goodness, cruelty, race, class, sexual orientation, beauty, kindness, addiction, culture, grief, sex, love and loss – all of it. Literally all of it. And he does so with a fierce economy of language that makes the reader sit pondering the enormity of each sentence for a long time afterward.I could open the book to any page and quote any line and it would most likely be meaningful. All I can do is offer a selection of moments, as Vuong does, in a story that is really a series of snapshots, memories from his youth and the stories he has been told about the lives of others. I was often struck by his apt descriptions of the people he encountered:On his mother: “What do we mean when we say survivor? Maybe a survivor is the last one to come home, the final monarch that lands on a branch already weighted with ghosts.”On a customer who wanders into his mother’s salon: “About seventy, her hair white and windblown across a narrow face with mined-out blue eyes, she has the stare of someone who had gone beyond where she needed to go but kept walking anyway.”On his friend Trevor: “There was something about the way he looked when lost in thought, his brow pinched under squinted eyes, giving his boyish face the harsh, hurt expression of someone watching his favorite dog being put down too soon.”“It seemed the boy was always looking at a plane wrecking itself midair. That’s what I saw that first day. And although I knew that nothing behind me was on fire, I turned back anyway and saw the coiled summer air, sputtering with heat, rise over the razed fields.”“I did not know then what I know now: to be an American boy, and then an American boy with a gun, is to move from one end of a cage to another.”I was also taken with the way Vuong often used animal imagery to comment on human frailty:Discussing veal: “The children, the veal, they stand very still because tenderness depends on how little the world touches you. To stay tender, the weight of your life cannot lean on your bones.”Or making a startling acknowledgment about family while watching television with his colorful grandmother Lan: “We saw a herd of buffalo run, single file, off a cliff, a whole steaming row of them, thundering off the mountain in Technicolor. “Why they die themselves like that?” she asked, mouth open…They don’t mean to, Grandma. They’re just following their family. That’s all. They don’t know it’s a cliff.”There are some haunting scenes in the book that will linger in my mind, and some insightful observations that I will be mulling over forever. But mostly, I am grateful that Vuong has offered us this extraordinary work and this vulnerable young man named Little Dog who is bravely visiting those parts of himself that most of us tuck away and refuse to share. Mining the past can be scary business, but Vuong seems to be reminding us that when you dredge up memories and commit them to the page, your past becomes art and your artistic medium is one of pain but also of beauty....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Oct 09, 2019","Oct 23, 2019","Oct 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41880609-on-earth-we-re-briefly-gorgeous

She had promised herself that her children would never have to worry what sort of mood she was in; they would never peek into her bedroom in the morning to see how their day was going to go. She was the only woman she knew whose prime objective was to be taken for granted.”This is how Willa Drake, the protagonist of Anne Tyler's novel ""Clock Dance"" sees herself in the world, as a placid, obliging, neutral force who never wants to cause a fuss. Tyler takes us through a few defining moments in Willa's life to let us know how she has come to be a 61-year old woman, unsatisfied with her life but unsure how to change it, yearning for some sort of purpose and usefulness. This is why we have a whirlwind of life changes and snapshots in time thrust at us in the beginning of the book in a few patchy chapters that catapult Willa from schoolgirl to senior in the blink of an eye with no real chance for us to truly get to know her family members or experience their lives in any meaningful way. We meet Willa in 1967, the eleven year-old daughter of a volatile, melodramatic mother (given to fits of abuse) and a mild-mannered obedient father too unassuming to confront her (a man ""so mild-mannered that he thought it was impolite to pick up a telephone in mid-ring”). Willa assumes her lot in life is to be like one or the other, so she chooses the path of her father, the mediator, the practical calming influence, not fully realizing that this is also the path of the voiceless doormat, never speaking up, never taking any initiative. We see this even more clearly when the book jumps ahead to 1977, Willa's college years, and we meet her take-charge boyfriend, Derek, who is ready to graduate and has a high-powered job lined up in California. Willa has a year left and a coveted opportunity with her favorite professor to look forward to, but when Derek presses her to marry him that summer and then stands up to her aggressive mother, she chooses one difficult life partner for another and the years fly by. 1997, an unexpected life change occurs, and Willa is left to pick up the pieces and make choices that could change the course of her life entirely, but all too soon it is 2017, and Willa is the same unassuming woman, now married to a man who is just another version of Derek, living a life she never asked for but which she has obligingly settled into. “Sometimes Willa felt she’d spent half her life apologizing for some man’s behavior. More than half her life, actually. First Derek and then Peter, forever charging ahead while Willa trailed behind picking up the pieces and excusing and explaining.”Once we get to this point, though, the meat of the story really begins here, in 2017, when Willa receives an unexpected phone call and makes a rare snap decision to travel from her home in Arizona to Baltimore to help the former girlfriend of her son, Sean. Here, we are introduced to a rag-tag neighborhood of quirky, interesting characters all revolving around the home of Denise (the former girlfriend and recent shooting victim) and her daughter Cheryl (a precocious and endearing eleven year-old, who provides Willa the opportunity to feel like a grandmother for the first time in her life). The people we meet in Baltimore just pop off the page, and are so vividly described you can picture them as clearly as if you were watching a movie. Tyler's descriptions of each of them and their interactions with each other are the most engaging part of the story and her fondness for the shabbier suburbs of Baltimore found me almost rooting for Willa to abandon her upscale home in AZ to live in Denise's twin bed guest room for the rest of her life. Willa's immersion in this new cast of characters gives new life both to the character and the story, and her relationship with young Cheryl reminds her of the dreams she had as a girl. ""She had felt that way during her own childhood; she’d felt like a watchful, wary adult housed in a little girl’s body. And yet nowadays, paradoxically, it often seemed to her that from behind her adult face a child about eleven years old was still gazing out at the world.”This is a book about determining for oneself what makes a life worth living. The way Willa and others in the book address this question makes us consider it as well, and may make some readers ask themselves whether or not change is even feasible - at any age or at any point in a life. Can someone on a steady path decide to upset the apple cart and set a new course, and is it worth the risk? Tyler has always dealt with this subject. Characters who find themselves in unexpected situations, desperate for change but also clinging to the security of the lives they know. ""Clock Dance"" isn't her best book. She tackled these subjects far more effectively in books like ""The Accidental Tourist"" and ""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant."" The first few chapters of this book seem like an almost unnecessary slog to get to the far more engaging scenes in Baltimore. But maybe that's the point. Like Willa's, some lives seem like a bland slog through endless days of the same old thing unless you decide to shake things up a bit and consider a new uncertain road. So, I marginally recommend this book, especially to fans of Tyler, who will feel like they are revisiting an old friend and who will see some of her flashes of brilliance in the second half of the book. And after meeting the gang at Denise's neighborhood in Baltimore, you may feel, as I do now, that I ought to make an effort to talk to my neighbors more often....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 09, 2019","Oct 15, 2019","Oct 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36645972-clock-dance

Like every Hoffman novel, this one is part character study, part chronicle of a time and place, and part fairy tale - only in this story the fairy tale is darker than some others she has told, and we follow her characters into the woods like Hansel and Gretel, wondering who will survive and who will be lost forever. I am not going to offer a long synopsis of the plot. You can read that online and we all know the horrors and atrocities that befell the Jewish community and the Resistance fighters in the war. This, as well as other facets of the story, may make a reader apprehensive or unwilling to invest themselves in a tale they may feel they already know, especially when magic and religion are along for the ride. But I urge those readers who are unsure to take the plunge. In Hoffman stories, there is always some sort of magical element: a ghost, a tangible fate, an angel, a demon, signs and symbols, but somehow they are never unbelievable or figments born of the realm of fantasy. They are the everyday magic of ordinary people. Every person you know who has told you they have a ghost in the attic or get signs from their dead loved ones or believe an angel delivered them from harm. They are everyone we know. And ourselves. People who want to believe in something even when belief is hard to come by or impossible to support. This tale gives us a golem, a being born of clay that is foretold in the darkest lore of Jewish mysticism. Only a rabbi is supposed to be able to create this life, but our golem is created by his strong-willed daughter in a pact made with a desperate mother to find a protector to care for her daughter when she no longer can. The golem is usually made in the image of a man, but these women create a woman protector, whom they name Ava, reminiscent of ""chava,"" the Hebrew word for life. The golem is brought to life with the word ""emet"" written on her arm, a word meaning ""truth."" Whether you want to believe in a golem or not, what is happening here is a parable of maternal love and protection, the strength of women to create life and to protect that life with all their might. The women characters in this novel prove to be fierce and protective warriors, in both love and spirit, independent thinkers who know they must depend upon themselves for salvation in a world turned upside down. This does not discount the male characters at all, a mostly sympathetic assortment of decent men trying to protect their families and survive in a France they no longer understand. Especially compelling is the story of young Julien, dutifully staying in Paris with his parents who are in denial about how unsafe it has become and how much danger they are in until the officers come to the door and march them away (""His father had put on his hat, as if he were going to a meeting and must look his best.""). Julien's many brushes with fate throughout the story tear at the fabric of our understanding of why some people survive and others do not and seem to convey the idea that in a world that has become evil, good people cannot allow themselves to be lambs led to slaughter, believing that rules are made to keep them safe. They must do whatever is necessary to survive.The subject of religion comes up often, as it should in this context, and is handled in beautifully delicate exchanges that convey the ways religion can be a foundation for good deeds or twisted to become a weapon against others. In a telling exchange in the story between a Jewish grandfather and his Catholic granddaughter, he asks her to recite the Lord’s Prayer, which she does. He then recites for her a Jewish prayer, which is strikingly similar. “They have the same meaning,” she said to the old man. “Yes, they are the same, and a world apart. Say one and you are applauded. Say the other and you’re condemned.”Hoffman’s descriptions of nature, of a field of improbable silver roses or a majestic heron in love with a woman or a black wolf with yellow eyes who lets a child live, are among some of the most enchanting prose you will ever read. She has a way of reminding us that everything from the rosemary and lupines blooming in a garden to the wild wind in the branches of lime trees are so often the images that bring us joy and comfort, the images that make being human easier to bear, because the world is cruel but also beautiful.It is difficult to live in the world in 2019 and not see parallels of the treatment of Jews during the war to the treatment of other marginalized groups being demeaned and blamed for a country's ills today. People in camps having children separated from them, living in squalor without appropriate care or decent treatment. People being sent back to places where they are immediately killed. ""The World That We Knew"" speaks to what makes us human in a world that is so often filled with evil and cruelty and wrestles with the ways some humans ever decide to look upon other humans as lesser or undeserving of kindness. “This is what it was to be human, to be at the will of fate. This is what it felt like to lose a child you loved who had loved you in return…She was helpless against time, the owner of a fragile heart…This is what love did. It was a miracle and a sacrifice.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 03, 2019","Oct 07, 2019","Sep 19, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43822062-the-world-that-we-knew

At the time, “Once a story you’ve regarded as true has turned false, you begin suspecting all stories.”I read ""The Handmaid's Tale"" when I was young. At the time, I thought it was brilliant, well-written, and complete science fiction - something that was an important cautionary tale and certainly an homage to the many woman (and men, but mostly women) who fought bravely for equal rights in this country, but unthinkable in a country that had come so far on its trajectory toward more inclusive legislation. It was outlandish in the 1980's to think of a world where women were just property and vessels for children, devoid of any power over their own lives, subhuman in the eyes of male leaders. Not here in America. I read ""The Handmaid's Tale"" again recently, and thought ""Oh my god. It's all happening. If this administration had its way, we would be living in Gilead, and this nation would be a corrupt theocracy, serving the desires of rich white men to the exclusion of all others, especially women.""Suddenly, what I once thought science fiction has become terrifyingly real. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" was originally published in 1985. Thirty four years later comes its sequel, ""The Testaments."" Why thirty four years later? Look around you. In a world where Social Darwinism appears to have been a dream, and society does not seem to naturally progress toward a better, more egalitarian mindset, a sequel to ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is more necessary than ever. And who better to warn us of the dangers of a corrupt theocratic patriarchy than Margaret Atwood, a woman whose life's work has been a monument to social justice while still bringing us unforgettable characters in some of the finest prose in the English language. ""The Testaments"" does not focus on the Handmaids this time - oh, they're there, still toiling away, exploited little vessels of forced reproduction - but Atwood's focus this time is on three characters whose lives will intersect in surprising and powerful ways. There is Agnes, the young Commander's daughter being forced into a despicable marriage with a pedophile; Daisy, a Canadian girl who unknowingly harbors a dangerous secret, and the now elderly and infamous Aunt Lydia, who may be on a cunning and calculated path for redemption. Switching back and forth between these three narratives, Atwood gives us a glimpse of how a corrupt government might be subverted if just a few brave people are willing to risk themselves for the greater good. Of course, it really helps if at least one of those people also has a brilliant plan and some power to wield in this sacrificial strategy. And, as it turns out, one of them does. I won't get into too many spoilers here, and although you can read this novel as a standalone, it does help to have read ""The Handmaid's Tale"" first or some of the odd rituals of Gilead will make little sense to you, but I will say that this sequel is as compelling and forceful as the original, in my opinion, and is also brimming with something the first novel did not have - hope. As we have all seen in recent months, when the gears of a big political machine begin to work against the needs and aspirations of the very people who depend upon it, and corruption and cruelty seep into every facet of that system, the average person has little power to change the situation. Those in an ever-evolving totalitarian state are wrapped in a cocoon of helplessness, forced to accept the rules put in place by oligarchs who control all of the resources. Toppling such a regime when all of your rights have been taken away seems virtually impossible. Unless you have a network of resistance and a powerful ally or two. Such is the precarious position of Atwood's theocratic nation of Gilead since we first set eyes on it, now rotting from within, plagued by scarcity and decay, a haven for pedophiles and abusers given free reign due to ""God's will,"" and a place of unrest as its citizens learn more of defections and life in neighboring free states.To read a synopsis of the political impact of Atwood's novels without having read the novels themselves might make less politically-minded readers shy away from them. That would be a pity. Atwood writes like a dream and her characters are vibrant, engaging people with depth and startling inner dialogues, whether they are mulling over their fates or undertaking perilous acts to save the world, despite their otherwise ordinary lives. (Atwood startlingly even makes us feel compassion for our former villain, Aunt Lydia, by giving us a horrifying glimpse of how she became who she is - a glimpse that asks us to consider whether we ourselves would have chosen a similar path in order to survive). Aunt Lydia tells us “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and I took the one most travelled by. It was littered with corpses, as such roads are. But as you will have noticed, my own corpse is not among them.” And later, she challenges us “How can I have behaved so badly, so cruelly, so stupidly? you will ask. You yourself would never have done such things! But you yourself will never have had to.” The power of ""The Testaments"" comes largely from our own understanding of what good people are sometimes forced to do in a world that will eliminate them for non-compliance. So, if you are worried about the state of the world and are concerned about disturbing trends toward the crumbling of democratic ideals and the quashing of human rights and values, you should be. And Margaret Atwood is, too. But unlike you, Margaret Atwood has a plan. Let's hope none of us ever needs one....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Nov 08, 2019","Nov 15, 2019","Aug 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42975172-the-testaments

This story, uJane Harper comes through once again with a character-driven, atmospheric mystery set in the unrelenting heat of the Australian outback. This story, unlike her two previous books featuring Aussie detective Aaron Falk, is a stand-alone novel about a cattle ranching family grappling with the mysterious death of a family member - a death that might be an accident, or possibly a suicide, but could even be murder, and if the death is somehow the latter, then it is an act that defies the unwritten rules of its locale: you never leave a man to die alone in the outback.Cameron Bright, middle brother to ranchers Nathan and Bub is found dead, literally baked to death, at the foot of a legendary landmark called The Stockman's Grave, a headstone in the middle of nowhere that has lent itself to various local ghost stories for decades. His fully stocked and functional vehicle is found a few miles away, and there is no sign of violence or trouble. Thus begins a twisted little tale that unfolds gradually, subtly, like a shadow winding its way around a headstone in the harsh Australian sun. For me, Harper's sparse but evocative writing lures me in from the first page, every single time. Her stories are always character-driven, and those characters are relatable, even if they are not always easy to like, as in the case of Lost Man protagonist, Nathan Bright and his brother Bub, both of whom are plagued with deep flaws, dark pasts and questionable behaviors. The dysfunctional Bright family history unwinds alongside the details of Cameron's unusual death, and Harper uses the interplay between current loss and youthful memories to fashion a timeline of inevitability - something bad was bound to happen - if not this death, then something else. This is also seen in the juxtaposition of Cameron's death and that of the legendary stockman - everyone in the area has a different version of what happened to the stockman, just as everyone is forming their own opinion of what might have happened to Cameron. Harper's use of the stark existence of people living in extremes of isolation and a brutal climate only heighten the reader's anxiety - ""people were either completely fine, or very not."" The landscape becomes another character, its influence so pervasive and influential. Harper's other books were five star gems for me, and this nearly received the same rating, but in the end, much as I adored the writing, the pacing, the flawed, authentic characters, the cunning revelations as they unfolded, and the all-encompassing feel of the remote desert setting, I had an issue with the final reveal that has been gnawing at me, and so I have ticked off the tiniest bit due to my own issues with its believability, (an issue very few other readers seem to have had, by the way, so take it with a grain of salt). But one thing I would like to point out is the exceptional job Harper does at handling issues like domestic abuse and sexual assault and human frailty in a way that is even-handed and realistic without once being exploitative or didactic. As it turns out, this book is really a book about hard choices. Each character in the book has a hard choice to make, a life-altering choice, in fact, each one different and of the utmost importance. And each choice is tied to this mysterious death that has affected them all. The fate of every character in ""The Lost Man"" can be summarized in one telling quote from the story itself, “Someone can decide it’s in their best interests to agree to something, but a choice is only really a choice if there’s a genuine alternative.”...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 16, 2019","Sep 23, 2019","Mar 19, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39863488-the-lost-man

""Force of Nature"" sees the return of Australian financial agent Aaron Falk, as he and his new partner tackle the disappearance of a prime witness in an ongoing money laundering investigation. A financial investigation might sound bland to some, but this one is different: our witness disappeared in the bushland while on a corporate team-building camping trip with a host of suspicious colleagues. Is the woman alive or dead? Was this an accident or foul play? Could a legendary bushland killer be involved? Could our witness have run away rather than turn over evidence? Harper juggles all of the possibilities and the many potential suspects in a perfectly layered mystery told in a riveting narrative mixed with intermittent flashbacks of the camping trip. Through it all, she never loses sight of our main character Falk, interspersing memories of his father into the current situation and analyzing the way his past has informed his present task at hand. (It is not necessary for a reader to have read ""The Dry"" prior to this novel, but it does help to understand certain references to Aaron and his past.)I am not a fast reader. I read this book in two sittings, staying up all night to do so. Harper writes with such a natural voice that the resulting book seems effortless, a style I find all the more remarkable in a mystery novel because, with Harper, you never see the craft behind the plot, there is never an obvious contrivance or an instance of taking the easy way out. If Jane Harper had 365 novels in print, I would have to quit my job for a year, because I would feel compelled to read one a day. That said, I hope she is writing a new Falk novel right now. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 25, 2019","May 26, 2019","Mar 19, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34275222-force-of-nature

I got a couple of chapters in, and I couldn't keep going. The plot became unnaturally contrived, the players were stilted caricatures, and things started happening that defy both logic and statistics. So....I happened to have this Jane Harper book I had picked up somewhere....From page one, I heaved a sigh of relief. This book was already significantly better than the previous novel I had thrown to the side. Jane Harper has an easy way with language and can evoke a mood and a setting almost effortlessly. This novel is set in Australia during a long heat wave and drought. That setting is necessary to the storyline, but Harper doesn't beat you over the head with it. In fact, other than some reasonable local color, the book could be set almost anywhere that mirrored the necessary conditions. This is a story set in rural Australia, but isn't rife with mentions of kangaroo and vegemite. Harper knows better. She is taking the specific and making it universal.Aaron Falk is the protagonist of ""The Dry,"" and apparently this is the first of other novels that will feature this likable police officer (specializing in financial crimes), but I didn't know that at the time. Nor did I need to. This book has no loose ends that need to be tied up in other books. It is whole and perfectly fashioned as is. Falk has returned to his hometown after many years away in order to attend the funeral of his childhood best friend. The death of his friend appears to be suicide (and there is much more to that element of the story that I will not give away here), but Falk agrees to investigate a bit for the sake of the man's parents, who were close to him throughout his early years. Falk has tremendous baggage as he returns to this place where he is notorious, because, as a teenager, he was accused of a close friend's death, a death that may or may not have been caused by him, or by someone else, (perhaps even his recently dead best friend) - or by the victim herself. Are the two deaths related? Are either of them what they seem to be? This is the premise our author sets up for the reader as she leads us deeper and deeper into a rural farm town, reeling from economic hardship, suffering through years of barren crops and insufferable heat, and simmering with secrets and lies. I am not a fast reader. I like to savor each word. But I flew through this book, only putting it down twice, and that reluctantly. Some authors, like the one whose name I will not reveal from the book I tried to read prior to this one, take a premise and try to fit it with unnatural elements and colorful characters, whether or not they have to cram those square pegs into the round holes of their outlines or not. Jane Harper, on the other hand, takes a compelling premise and lets it reveal itself naturally, like an inevitable unfolding, showing just a bit more of the truth with each new angle or revelation our characters encounter. To tell you more would spoil that unfolding. Discover this wonderful author for yourselves, the way I did and then look forward to knowing more about Aaron Falk in book two and beyond....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 14, 2019","Mar 19, 2019","Mar 18, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/27824826-the-dry

His book ""The Dog Stars"" is among my favorites of all time, largely because Heller captures the poignancy of human survival in its pages and expounds on what constitutes a life worth living, while also showing us both the sweetness and ruthlessness of nature and humanity. In that regard, ""The River"" is very similar. This intimate tale of two friends on a camping trip in the deep woods of Canada gives us a glimpse of the best and worst life has to offer, both from human interactions and from nature in all its wild glory.Jack and Wynn have been friends since college, when they discovered that not only do they both have a love and aptitude for wilderness treks but also a love of literature and the arts, sculpture, music, mindfulness and philosophy. Their complementary natures seem to be the perfect fit and they share mutual admiration and respect for each other's abilities and sensibilities. We meet them on their way down the titular river in the midst of their last big trip before work and winter sideline them. This trip, however, is about to become far less idyllic as the duo pick up the scent of a giant wildfire mere days away and happen upon a few sketchy characters in their effort to put as much distance between themselves and danger as possible. First of all, if you have a love of the outdoors and an affinity for the woods or are enraptured by tales of mountain men or modern day Thoreaus, you absolutely have to read this book. Heller's descriptions of the wildlife and scenic landscapes the friends encounter along the way are visually stunning and his detailed descriptions of the camping/fishing life are sheer perfection. (If the outdoors interests you not at all, you may not find the prose nearly as enjoyable as I did, but I could have read page after page about this trip, even if no perils or plot points had intervened.) A good portion of the book is largely a character study, in which we get to know two people of substance, each with rich inner lives and interests, doing what they love most together.As is so often the case when everything is going smoothly and people put their guard down to bask in the pleasures of seeming synchronicity, life rudely intervenes. Our friends' leisurely nature trip becomes a harrowing experience in which they have to navigate (literally and figuratively) raging rapids, an unexpected wildfire, a rescue mission, and a possible murderer, as well as the murkier problem of assessing human intentions, perhaps the most dangerous element of all. There are those who see this as a straightforward adventure tale with the added heft of the fully formed characters involved. That may very well be all that it is, and if so, it is still a perfectly worthwhile, riveting little tale. But as someone given to over-analysis of pretty much everything, I feel Heller is offering us more than just ""A River Runs Through It"" meets ""The River Wild."" Heller has given us two characters, Jack and Wynn, who love literature, have deep thoughts, discuss philosophical concepts and delve into cultural belief systems. Heller himself is a product of the Iowa Writers Workshop. How many books have you read that have a river as their central metaphor? If you are a Goodreads reader, probably quite a few. So, it might be remiss not to see the river as the spooling out of a human life, dotted with the simple pleasures and the ensuing perils that constitute every life. Jack and Wynn seem very similar, until you are told that Jack is the realist, the pragmatist, an engineer with the soul of a scholar, who has a bit of a temper and is more likely to see the darker motives at work in the world. Wynn, on the other hand, is the gentle soul who wants to see the best in everyone, the sculptor with the heart of a poet, who forgives easily and makes art for art's sake. Their values are the same, but their responses to the world at large can be quite different. At one point, Wynn tells us about a favorite poem of his by W.S. Merwin:""Merwin describes the sun going down believing in nothing and how he hears the stream running after it ""It has brought its flute it is a long way""...It killed him. The one and only sun without belief in anything and the little stream believing so hard, believing in music even."" I don't think this poem was chosen at random. Jack and Wynn. The sun and the stream. So, without too many spoilers, I will just say that Heller seems to be asking us with each new danger and each new choice our protagonists must face, ""How should we approach the world, with skepticism or with altruism? Is it ever acceptable to break with our core values, even if it means we may not survive? Are we foolish to aspire to values that others may not even hold? Does living a life of integrity and optimism make us vulnerable or evolved - or both?"" Early in the book one of our characters mentions that Thoreau used to do his laundry at Emerson's house. It seemed like a throwaway line at the time, but I think it was intended to illustrate that even those, like Thoreau, who spurned most human interaction and the trappings of modern life still had to break down and join civilization and its social mores every once in awhile, whether he wanted to or not. I think in this excellent tale of two men reveling in nature until nature fails to cooperate, Heller shows us that idealism is an excellent concept, until it isn't....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 23, 2019","Nov 04, 2019","Feb 26, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40216324-the-river

Before this extraordinary book, much of our understanding of this time remained hidden, concealed within the walls of so many Belfast flats, secrets kept close to the vest out of fear, guilt, or protection from others. IRA members, especially Provos (members of what is known as the Provisional IRA, a breakaway faction dedicated to violent means) were sworn to secrecy, and those with loose lips traditionally ended up dead on a sidewalk or ""disappeared."" So how did Keefe manage to write a book that not only utilizes exhaustive research and modern interviews, but is filled to the brim with intimate details of the lives of IRA members, their organizational structure, their crimes, their sacrifices, their loyalty and betrayals, often verbatim from the members themselves? Oddly enough, the answer is Boston College.In 1998, after thousands of casualties and decades of The Troubles (centuries, depending upon your interpretation, but decades if you trace the organized fighting to the modern IRA), Northern Ireland and the UK agreed to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement (Irish people are very big on Good Friday, I can tell you from experience. In my own family lore, my Irish great grandfather is said to have willed himself to die on Good Friday, weeks later than his doctor gave him). The GF Agreement was, in essence, a long-awaited ceasefire and hope for the future brokered in large part by Gerry Adams, controversial president of Sinn Féin, the IRA’s political wing, and a member of the British Parliament (more about him to come). That is when some researchers at Boston College decided to compile a series of oral histories of IRA members and other key figures of the Troubles that would be kept secret and not released until after their deaths. Some of the most notorious of the IRA's Provos were persuaded to sit for hours of interviews and divulge information they had never previously discussed, even with their families or each other. The readers of ""Say Nothing"" are the beneficiaries of that knowledge, because thanks to a lack of legal protections (and a host of British subpoenas) much of this treasure trove of intimate knowledge was released early, and Keefe crafted it into an amazing book that reads like a murder mystery. In 1972, widowed mother of ten Jean McConville, was taken from her apartment in Belfast by masked intruders, in front of her children, and never seen again. Keefe sets out to unravel this mystery and the fate of McConville while giving us a history of the provisional IRA and its very colorful cast of characters. We meet the Price sisters, Dolours and Marian, who were indoctrinated into a world of violence through family history and through the violence inflicted upon them for their Catholic faith, and who became two of the most dangerous IRA members as well as the popular face of the organization. We meet Brendan Hughes, the high ranking IRA mastermind, brash and fearless, who later feels left behind as the politics become more of a priority than the struggle. And, among others, we meet Gerry Adams, the suave sociopath, who rose to a place of prominence in Irish politics, but clearly also directed the Provos in murder and bombings and all manner of IRA missions, although he denies any involvement to this day, (even though Keefe makes clear in the book that McConville's ""disappearing"" was most likely on his orders). Keefe deftly navigates the story of the IRA, the British military, and the victims of both sides, while allowing us to feel both horror and sympathy, fascination and disgust. He also briefly touches on the misplaced pride sometimes felt by Irish-Americans for the IRA, a phenomenon I have seen myself, having been raised Irish-American in a mostly Irish-American town in Massachusetts, where old timers often hinted that one of my relatives was a ""runner"" for the IRA as a teen. It is said with a twinkle in their eye, but has always left me cold as I learned the violent history of that era and the many tragic stories it has spawned. By telling us the tales of actual characters on both sides of the Troubles and by delving into their lives, often through their own words, Keefe has brought to life this time period in a way no other book I know has ever accomplished....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,Jul 2019,"Jan 08, 2020","Jan 23, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40241779-say-nothing

My first observation is - Charlotte Bronte is a wonder! And every observation beyond that is pretty much the same. Having read “Wuthering Heights” years ago, I assumed this book might have a similar bent and the same soul-shredding themes of lost love and tortured existence, but although young Jane certainly goes through her share of cruel circumstances and difficult challenges, (and is given to as many long walks on the windswept moors as Catherine Earnshaw was), there is an optimism and brightness of tone that Charlotte infuses into her work that is absent in that of her sister Emily. There is also a kindness of spirit and sense of practical resolve not found in the former work. One is a Gothic tale of passionate but cruel obsession, the other a surprisingly feminist take on the triumph of an independent mind and the rewards of living a decent life. On first meeting the ten-year-old Jane, an orphan begrudgingly taken in by a rich aunt and abused by her spoiled cousins, we find her a marvel of resilience and will as she suffers one unkindness after another only to somehow maintain her self-esteem. When her aunt, Mrs. Reed, unjustly commands that she not be allowed near her cousins, Jane blurts out, “They are not fit to associate with me!” and our love affair with the character has begun. When sent to Lowood, a strict boarding school characterized by ascetic conditions and near starvation of the pupils, Jane finds a beloved friend in Helen Burns, a bright, accomplished child who is even more emotionally abused than Jane, but who suffers in silence believing the cruelty is deserved and designed to make her better. Jane tells Helen what she thinks of that approach when she says, “…you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way; they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should - so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.” Quite the bold statement for a little girl in the 1800s! And this novel is populated with dozens more instances of Jane’s independent thinking and bold resilience. Bronte makes much of Jane’s plain appearance, letting us know this is a woman who will not be pursued by avid suitors attracted by her loveliness. She also lets us know that Jane is not a frivolous person desiring a husband to care for her. She wishes to remain an independent woman, with or without a future husband. For an era when making a suitable match was more often an economic necessity for a woman and a form of legal slavery for a man, this struck me as a radical mindset, and one that surely would have shocked polite society of the day. It is also no doubt a reason this book has survived and remained popular for more than a century and a half. That, and the fact that Bronte writes like a dream. Her descriptions are vivid, her dialogue snappy and well-paced, her inner thoughts a delight to know, and her depiction of even the most tragic events made more startlingly real by their honest rendering and lack of melodrama. It is as if Bronte is saying, through Jane, “This is life. You deal with it and pick yourself up again and move along or you cease to be of use to the world.”Her relationships with both Rochester, and later St. John Rivers, are both fascinating and troublesome at the same time. As for Rochester, he’s an unforgettable character and one I could both praise and condemn in an equal number of pages. Since the existence of books, I doubt any publisher has wanted for stories of proud, manipulative, brash cads who need only meet their perfect match in life to reclaim their inner goodness and be “tamed.” It is the familiar trope that has ensnared generations of women into believing that cruel men can become good if only loved well. Domestic shelters are currently filled with women who have bought into this recurring mindset. But in Rochester’s defense, I will say that he is not bewitched by frivolity or superficial charms but by depth of character and self-awareness, and he supposedly falls for Jane due to her equality of spirit and frank nature, which is perhaps why we are able to somehow tolerate his many atrocities against her throughout the book, ones that she bears more easily than we do, as he plays with her affections, tests her resolve, and hides a really nasty secret in the attic. (For a feminist take and interesting historical perspective on poor Bertha Mason, check out the far more recent prequel “Wide Sargasso Sea” by Jean Rhys. Rhys says what I would like to say about the treatment of this character far more effectively than I could.)When forced to leave Rochester (by her own sense of integrity), Jane suffers some true hardship in her ill-planned escape from Thornfield. Penniless, unconnected, starving, the description of her reduction to drifter and beggar - and her eventual salvation - is some of the best prose you will ever read. That said, the coincidences that occur in this portion of the book are among its weakest elements. That she would happen upon just this remote home in just this part of the country with just these inhabitants and be needed for just the perfect job at hand and discover that just the exact person who…well, if you’ve read the book, you know the rest, and if you haven’t, I won’t spoil it, but as much as I still loved the story and its new characters and the twists and turns it took, I also said in the back of my mind, “Oh Charlotte, come on, even you can’t be buying this part.” Still, if only to highlight the nature of Jane’s relationship with St. John, these later chapters made for a strong and fitting contrast between that dynamic and the relationship between Jane and Rochester, in that it illuminated her resolve to approach even romance on her own terms. She, a woman with few prospects and little beauty, could have made an excellent match (by society’s standards) with a man respected and handsome, (who had saved her life and given her employment and a home), but she could not allow it of herself because she refused to marry a man who did not love her, who viewed her as a workhorse of noble character, a practical partner, an employee with benefits. Heady stuff, for its day, considering that rejecting such a proposal might be the source of economic hardship for most women - and might never come again.The resolution of the story, I admit, will bother me forever. Largely because it delighted me as much as it disgusted me. There is no way this amazing, strong-willed, independent force of nature should waste her youth shackled to a crabby old wreck of a man, consumed by insecurities and jealousies, and more in need of a nursemaid than a wife. But dammit, by the end of the book, I want this for her as much as she seems to want it for herself. I know in my heart it’s a terrible match, but it’s the match she wants, it is what makes her happy, and even in real life, what looks good on paper doesn’t always work. So, we revel in Jane’s terrible choice, and wish her joy and feel relieved when Rochester seems to have made himself worthy of her by the book’s end. “No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.” So, if Jane is happy, we are happy. Reader, I forgave him....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jan 13, 2019","Jan 27, 2019","Jan 13, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/18626853-jane-eyre

Twenty years ago."" - (Chinese saying)In ""The Overstory,"" Richard Powers has given the world a love story to nature, and even more specifically, to trees. But fear not, reader, this is not some extended Joyce Kilmer poem or Hallmark card to our dwindling natural world. It is a series of thought-provoking character studies - linked vignettes that take a hard, sometimes gritty, look at human interaction (with trees and with each other) - that offer a dire warning to the inhabitants of earth, as well as a plan of action for possible salvation. Powers makes a strong case for what should be the obvious fact that if those of us in the ""understory"" do not preserve the ""overstory,"" only one of these will cease to exist, and it won't be the latter. The trees and the natural world have thousands, even millions, of years to rebound, (years they will need after we have decimated so much forest land), while we may have only scant years left to practice optimum conservation and save ourselves in the process.Powers is smart enough to know that facts and figures and a preachy didactic tome will never get his point across. He takes the advice of one of his own characters who declares, “The best arguments in the world won't change a person's mind. The only thing that can do that is a good story.” And a good story is what we get. In fact, we get a series of good stories, as Powers introduces us to nine main characters, many of whom will find that their lives intersect later on in the book. It's a clever device. One I was not sure was effective at first, because I did not know these separate, seemingly isolated stories would connect later on, but I came to appreciate this bit of craft as I moved deeper into the book and saw that the lives of our characters were made to mimic the lives of the trees, interconnected, communicating with each other, anticipating each other's needs, sometimes directly, and sometimes in subtle, unseen ways. The author knows we are vain, self-absorbed humans who need to focus on human needs or anthropomorphize the world around us, so he makes us care about nature and the need to protect the trees by making us care about a collection of people who care about the trees. He admits this ploy late in the book when a character tells us, ""To be human is to mistake a satisfying story with a meaningful one, and to mistake life for something huge with two legs. No: life is mobilized on a vastly larger scale, and the world is failing precisely because no novel can make the contest for the world seem as compelling as the struggles between a few lost people.""Among these ""few lost people"" in ""The Overstory"" we meet an artist with a tragic past, a jetsetting businesswoman, a young psychologist from a dysfunctional family, a married couple facing challenges, an injured soldier turned Johnny Appleseed, a brilliant computer game designer, a college coed who comes back from electrocution with a gift, and my favorite character in the book, the organic chemist Patricia Westerford, who gives us the important scientific component of this dire ecological equation, while also giving us one of the more emotionally compelling and tender stories in the book. Powers wants us to know that we are always going to be exposed to the stories other people tell and some stories may have more passion or be more enchanting or just feel truer, but unless they are backed up by science, they are just fiction, and we should know the difference. As a girl, Dr. Westerford learns to love nature and the language of trees from a kind, attentive father who explores botany with her in childhood experiments: ""She hears him, and understands. This is science and worth a million times more than anything any person might ever swear to you.""In addition to this scientific component, Powers introduces a powerful psychological component to our seeming inability to act on what should be an urgent issue. The fallacy that consensus is truth. This is introduced in the story of our military man turned forest savior: “In fact, it's Douggie's growing conviction that the greatest flaw of the species is its overwhelming tendency to mistake agreement for truth. Single biggest influence on what a body will or won't believe is what nearby bodies broadcast over the public band. Get three people in the room and they'll decide that the law of gravity is evil and should be rescinded because one of their uncles got shit-faced and fell off the roof.” And while this seems anecdotal, we later learn from our psychology professor that study after study confirms it. People act based on the beliefs of the crowd. Even if the crowd is very, very wrong.As a final example, I'll mention the story of the computer programmer, who builds a world more lush and plentiful than the world we know, a world that causes its players to sit huddled in basements for hours at a time trying to build a better version of their existence. While our own world is being torn down around us, the world of this game lures players with its endless paradise -until one savvy player complains that there is no point to it. There is no endgame. Players just amass more and more meaningless things to no avail. The programmer is forced to admit he has a Midas problem - ""Everything's dying a gold-plated death."" The name of the game: Mastery.I could write a  as long as the book itself, but that may be the greatest gift of ""The Overstory,"" because despite the fact that it is a bit too long and sometimes confusing, and builds on many stories told by other authors in other books (Bill Bryson, for one, taught me about the chestnut trees long before Powers did), it is a book that forces you to think, and maybe even to act. For that alone, it may deserve a five star rating, because you may read other, more compelling stories about a few lost people in your lifetime, but few will make you contemplate what that lifetime means and whether or not your species should be the only star of that history.Lastly, I fully understand the irony of having read this book in a hardcover format (I think it would have been a brilliant move to make it only available in downloaded versions), but as Dr. Westerford tells us, “To solve the future, we must save the past. My simple rule of thumb, then, is this: when you cut down a tree, what you make from it should be at least as miraculous as what you cut down.” ""The Overstory"" has accomplished that feat, and then some....more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,not setnot set,not setnot set,"Jul 13, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35187203-the-overstory

The latter character, as we know, participated in a very ill-fated fishing trip, and the novel at hand is called ""The Fisherman,"" so the implication might be that whatever big fishing trip this story involves, it is probably not going to go particularly well for those involved. Let me just say without adding any spoilers, that the crew of the Pequod had it easy compared to those in this book. Our protagonist Abe, a recent widower plodding through life and doing his best to cope while managing his grief, is a truly likable and sympathetic character. Spending time with him is a pleasure. As he takes to fishing to fill the void, he finds it soothes his soul in ways no other activity can, and when a colleague at work loses his wife and children in a horrific car accident, Abe realizes that fishing may help Dan cope with his grief, too, so after awhile, he invites him along to gain some peace and forge a friendship. They begin to travel to various rivers and fishing holes in rural New York, and while Abe finds the trips rejuvenating, Dan seems to be spiraling ever further downward, displaying erratic behavior and disturbingly dark moods. Then one day Dan asks Abe to try a new fishing spot he has found, Dutchman's Creek, which is nearly impossible to find on a modern map and appears to be tinged with secrecy. This is where the story changes in ways the reader might not have seen coming.The meat of this book consists of a legend told to Abe and Dan at a diner, a cautionary tale told by the proprietor when he discovers they are planning to fish at Dutchman's Creek. This twisted tale is meant to recount the ""true"" story of some ill-fated turn-of-the-century immigrants, a dark stranger, and a woman who may have been brought back from the dead by occult means - all of their paths converging at Dutchman's Creek, of course, which is said to harbor an alternate reality of dark waters filled with the souls of the dead and housing a serpent-like fish of gargantuan proportions (think Leviathan) whose power is only loosely contained by dark magic. The legend is an interesting one, as if H.P. Lovecraft had a baby with the Brothers Grimm and its nanny was Edith Hamilton. But, sadly, this is also where the book nearly lost me. I don't mind a book that is a story within a story; it is a clever framework that has been used effectively time and time again. But we are meant to believe that this legend is told to two diners over an early breakfast before fishing, when it goes on for chapter after chapter and could not have conceivably been told to anyone without a few afternoons to spare. The detail is exacting, the story rich in atmosphere and vividly evoked settings. Not a single thought of any of the legendary figures is left out, not a blink of the eye or a turn of phrase. I could only surmise that the legend had been formulated before the novel, and the novel had been formed around it to give it a framework. That's fine, too, except it is Abe's story and Abe's voice that interests me, and for a massive part of the book, Abe is nowhere to be seen.When we finally rejoin Abe and Dan, they are back to their fishing trip, and we now know that things are about to get really, really strange. Dedicated fans of supernatural horror will not find the plotline unacceptable, but those, like myself, who prefer not to have to suspend disbelief too much for the sake of any story will find the rest of the book tough to swallow. In fact, until Abe finally returns to the semblance of a normal life, near the end of the book, I took little pleasure in the fantastical tale, despite the fact that it was very well written and filled with true depth and erudition. Langan is not just relating a lurid fantasy here, he is trying to expound upon our common mythology, our shared fear of mortality and desire to know the secrets of our existence, especially our need to harbor the concept of an afterlife in order to deal with the grief over those we love and lose. It is no small feat to write a horror novel that is this cerebral and filled with allusions to religion, lore, and literature. That alone left me contemplating the novel's imagery and themes for days after having read it. Our main character ultimately finds that grief, that even the dead themselves, can come back unexpectedly on any ordinary day, and can take us to the depths if we let down our guard. As with any conceptual framework, we are left to decide for ourselves what happened and what may happen. A fitting end to any fish tale.I just wish there had been more of Abe. And please, don't call him Abraham....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jun 28, 2018","Jul 28, 2018","Jun 26, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/30525379-the-fisherman

Yes, it's a serviceable little thriller and a quick read that clearly tries very hard to be good, but it was also full of details that didn't ring true and more than a few irritating anachronisms. Somehow, that didn't keep me from reading to the end to see where this tale of a young woman with a ludicrous double life was heading, but here's the issue: I didn't believe a single moment on a single page. Not one. I didn't believe the backstory, the front story, the many, many contrivances, and worse - I didn't believe that the characters were real. They weren't people. They were characters. The dialogue was unnatural to the point of distraction, the coincidences practically lifted from the page so that you could see the grid of the author's plot outline beneath it, and the ending was both outlandish and pat at the same time. How can I recommend a book when I feel I could have written a better ending? I realize I'm being harsh and it is possible to enjoy this type of suspense novel (formulaic and soap opera-infused, with a twisted idea of romance and class structure underneath it), but I feel there are many truly great thrillers out there right now with heft and depth to them, intricate character studies with clever plots and thoughtful dialogue that tackle familiar ground in interesting ways. I've read several in the past few years alone and, given the choice, can't fathom choosing this type of novel instead. Was it a complete waste of time? No, it was mildly engaging and moved at a brisk pace. On the other hand, I could have been reading something better....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jun 25, 2018","Jun 27, 2018","Jun 25, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/28017976-the-vanishing-year

Anna Fox, the protagonist, lets us know from the very beginning of this book that she is an aficionado of old films. Thrillers, Hitchcock movies, black and white classics, film noir. She watches and rewatches them daily, as they form the backdrop for her now cloistered life. Living alone in a massive brownstone in a high-end park in Manhattan, Anna has little to do but watch old films and spy on her neighbors. When a new family moves across the way, trouble ensues, as, in true ""Rear Window"" fashion, Anna may or may not have seen a murder committed while half asleep and drunk one fateful evening. I won't give away the rest, but what makes this mystery work is the maddeningly unreliable Anna, who drinks a steady stream of merlot with her prescription medications throughout the novel, as well as the many nods to classic films that populate the plot and make you wonder which film this will ultimately become. Will it end like Rebecca, Vertigo, Rope, Spellbound? There are those who might complain that this book is filled with cliches, but I submit that cliches are the point of the book. The classic films referenced throughout the story are films that have shaped our conceptual framework about how a mystery is meant to progress, and by mashing all of the tropes together, the plot leaves us open to any and all of the devices we have seen before. We just have to guess which ones are at work. And while there were no real surprises in the story for me (I've probably seen a few too many of these films too many times myself), the experience was a good bit of fun just the same. My only gripe is that the author wasn't able to find a way to work into the plot a creepy motel or a menacing flock of birds....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 08, 2019","Jan 11, 2019","Jun 20, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40389527-the-woman-in-the-window

The research for this paper meant that I had to read every textbook case I could get my hands on, (pages full of the most cruel and brutal acts ever perpetrated by sociopaths in any culture), in a fruitless attempt to explain human horror by virtue of its sheer volume and consistency throughout modern history. I don't think I succeeded in demonstrating anything other than the fact that serial murder is not just an American phenomenon and sexual sadists are everywhere in the world, something we could all probably have surmised with little or no research at all. But one thing did come of my immersion in deviance. I started to view personal protection in a very different way. I took more visible routes at safer times of day, I locked and double-checked every door and window, I scoped out my environment, held my keys between my fingers, trusted no one.Most women take these precautions as a matter of course. It is something that is merely a given from the time you are old enough to have incorporated beneficial habits into your routine. Brush your teeth, take your vitamins, grip your bag, walk with purpose, avoid that shortcut. Upgrading the advice to ""don't get killed"" is a natural progression. The semester I wrote that paper upped the ante for me. I looked at every experience differently, saw potential predators behind every shrub, scrutinized the motives of every flirtation, booby-trapped access points, sprinted to my car at night. I knew that a woman in the world only has so much power, but I was not going to be an easy victim. My research had taught me that. Eventually the semester ended, and although I was still given to excessive caution (and have been ever since), my heightened sense of fear lessened a bit. I relaxed into the mindset that most citizens of the world accept: ""I can only do so much, and otherwise, what happens, happens."" Life went on, as it does, for the next couple of decades. And then I picked up ""I'll Be Gone in the Dark"" by Michelle McNamara and met the predator known as the Golden State Killer. I haven't had an easy night's sleep since. There was never a doubt that I was going to read this book. I'm a huge Patton Oswalt fan, and a devotee of true crime stories, so whether this was good or not, it was going to be read. As it turns out, Michelle McNamara is a revelation. She is that rare writer who can obsess over staggering amounts of research, distill it all down into workable themes, synthesize those themes into something cohesive, and then write about it in a way that rivals the best novelists. Not only that, but she spearheaded some of this research herself, working closely with law enforcement agents who investigated the case of the Golden State Killer back when he was being called the East Area Rapist or the Original Night Stalker. (He only became known as the Golden State Killer when McNamara herself dubbed him as such in her true crime blog.) In fact, McNamara is as much a part of this story as anyone. In writing about a killer she became a force for propelling the case forward. She became the only person able to elicit interviews from several victims and their families, she became the mouthpiece for a collective of retired investigators and amateur sleuths all dedicated to capturing this elusive criminal, and, ironically, her untimely death highlighted a case that had long gone unpublicized, possibly leading to its eventual solution (GSK was apprehended last month, more than four decades after he first struck). McNamara obsessed over the case for years, spending every available minute tracking new leads or poring over historical data, visiting old crime scenes with retired detectives, writing in hotels, coffee shops, lobbies, never wanting anything other than to contribute to the capture of this man who haunted her every waking moment. But in so doing, she became as integral to this story as any other participant, even the investigators, the victims, and the killer himself. She is able to write effectively about the obsessions of a rapist and killer, and the obsessions of those who have sought justice for those crimes, because she is well acquainted with obsession and knows the toll it has sometimes taken on her own family and her quality of life.McNamara is a brilliantly engaging writer. By incorporating her own curious, upbeat, matter-of-fact personality into the pages, she elevates this material from what could have been a stark rendering of case after endless case of people brutalized in middle class homes throughout California into a deft rendering of the lives of the victims, a character study of those who have worked the case, and a fascinating look at the many techniques utilized to capture serial predators, all while never turning away from the details of the crimes themselves and the way they instilled terror in every home from Sacramento to Santa Barbara. The fear she chronicles was well warranted, as this particular killer's methods were precise and effective. He stalked, he learned, he devised a plan, he controlled the situations, violated hundreds of people in their own homes, and then slipped away as if he had never been there, rarely seen, never accurately described, leaving no usable evidence - a phantom in the night. McNamara wanted you to know that people like this exist, but also that they are human, they are not monsters with superpowers, but average people with perverse obsessions, and because they are human, they can be caught. They can be caught with research and investigation and hard work and with people pulling together to brainstorm and never giving up. That was her superpower, that was where she fed her obsessions. So, when I read in the news that the Golden State Killer had finally been caught, I was pleased, but not surprised. My first thought was of a woman I did not know who had spent a good portion of her life hoping for this one result. Michelle knew all along that this was possible, and told us so in the book that will now be her professional legacy. I just felt badly that she was not around to see it. My second thought was, ""Did I lock the front door?""...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 29, 2018","May 06, 2018","Sep 18, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35714058-i-ll-be-gone-in-the-dark

The author was able to capture my attention on page one and lead me Not long ago, I took a chance on a suspense novel called ""All the Missing Girls."" The author was able to capture my attention on page one and lead me into the life of a protagonist who felt real and vulnerable, someone I worried about, someone who had made a few wrong turns and now was unsure of who she could trust and what secrets might have followed her from her past. The storyline appeared free of contrivance, unravelling in front of us, as if it were inevitable. There was a flow, a cadence to the book that just worked. The author of that book was Megan Miranda, and while ""All the Missing Girls"" succeeded on every level, her follow-up novel, ""The Perfect Stranger,"" only succeeds on most. Leah Stevens, a disgraced former journalist, decides to escape her failure by leaving the city and moving to western Pennsylvania with a former acquaintance. She takes a teaching job and tries to acclimate to her new life, but soon the mysterious murder of a local woman pulls her into a web of danger and deception, causing her to reassess everything in her life that she believes to be true. It is a compelling premise, populated with a host of sketchy and unreliable characters, filled with twists and turns in almost every chapter, some of which are wholly predictable and others that are truly surprising. Miranda has a way with dialogue. Conversations between her characters (or ones the protagonist has with herself) seem genuine and appropriate for the situations at hand. One of my biggest literary pet peeves is reading dialogue and thinking to myself ""No one talks like that. No one would respond that way. This doesn't feel real."" To date, I have not had that problem with Miranda. It is, perhaps, her greatest strength as an author. She also has an eye for the details that make a character or a scene feel fully realized and authentic. So, bearing that in mind, it was easier for me to forgive her when she took a few liberties with the plot and forced some scenarios that didn't seem quite believable. I don't want to give too much away, so I will just say, the problems I had with this book are common ones. The hackneyed twist of the character that may or may not really exist. This concept works occasionally, but lately has been done to death and if you're going to take it on, you better crush it. The even more unfortunate and commonplace device of two characters becoming romantically coupled under suspect circumstances in far too short a time period. I know how the real world works. Not like that. There were also characters that felt like stock characters, designed solely as red herrings. Yes, every mystery/suspense novel needs these characters, but I prefer them to seem like actual people rather than stock characters from Sketchy Potential Villains 101. I realize these criticisms seem to loom large and may make it seem as if ""The Perfect Stranger"" is unworthy of your time, but, in truth, it is a fairly well-written, interesting genre novel that is better than most, despite its shortcomings. The voice is clear, the descriptions are excellent, and despite its occasional contrivances, the story itself is a sinister little stew that holds your attention until the end. Miranda is obviously a very good writer. I think, in this case, she took on a plotline that outgrew her natural cadence and required a certain level of complexity that became difficult to contain. She made a valiant effort, and succeeded on many counts, but in order to be able to wrap all the plot developments up at the end in a nice big bow, Miranda sacrificed some credibility for closure. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 07, 2017","Aug 06, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32190153-the-perfect-stranger

Bryan Stevenson is a lawyer and founder of the It has taken me quite a while to collect my thoughts enough to write a  of this remarkable book. Bryan Stevenson is a lawyer and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit organization, based in Montgomery, Alabama, that provides legal representation to prisoners who may have been wrongly convicted of crimes, poor prisoners without effective representation, and others who may have been denied a fair trial. “Just Mercy” is his recounting of the tremendous failings of the justice system and the few glimmers of hope that may exist for changing that situation. His work on behalf of death row inmates, often African-American and almost always poverty-stricken, has been a godsend in the Deep South for many who have been accused of crimes, sometimes erroneously, and often due to obvious racial profiling, and who have been denied access to proper legal representation or due process. Ironically, no book , particularly not mine, could ever do this book – or Stevenson’s work - justice. One would think that the depiction of Alabama’s justice system in “To Kill a Mockingbird” might have triggered changes to that system long ago. It appears, however, that in the ensuing years, Alabama took that depiction as a challenge, deciding instead to double down on their agenda to halt the progress of the civil rights movement and impinge upon the civil liberties of countless citizens. We meet several of these men in the book, some wasting away on death row after unfair proceedings that often resulted in inaccurate sentencing, some incarcerated without being charged, without proper counsel, without any hope. And we meet one man, Walter McMillian, who is faced with execution despite being innocent of all charges. His story forms the arc that connects all the others and best defines the import and necessity of Stevenson’s work.I won’t give you a synopsis of these cases here. Each one was as disturbing and heartbreaking as the next. In fact, it took me much longer to read this book than it should have, largely because I had to keep putting it down in order to calm my racing heart and quell the fury I was feeling at the injustices it depicted. Injustices which should have been eradicated by now in a prosperous and well-educated nation. Those of us who naively believed in a linear progression for social justice, a social Darwinism of sorts, have been sadly mistaken. Human capacity for cruelty is very much alive and well, and the conceptual framework of justice and mercy adheres more to chaos theory than any other. Bryan Stevenson and those like him may be our greatest hope in dark times. One person, willing to risk the trajectory of a life and a career in order to help the most downtrodden and vulnerable in our society is the definition of a modern-day saint.I highlighted several quotes as I read this book. The following three should sum up the contents well enough to demonstrate why everyone should read it:“The state had nearly a hundred people on death row as well as the fastest-growing condemned population in the country, but it also had no public defender system, which meant that large numbers of death row prisoners had no legal representation of any kind.”“My work with the poor and the incarcerated has persuaded me that the opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice.”“We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated.”If, like me, you fear our nation is undergoing a horrifying regression and that injustice and bigotry have been empowered and allowed to run rampant again, this book will accomplish at least two goals: 1) the knowledge that injustice and racism were never gone, and that uncovering the places where they thrive allows us to do the work needed to ensure fairer systems and create a better framework for government and law enforcement, and 2) If one man can do as much as Bryan Stevenson has done to seek justice for those the system has harmed or neglected, then there are surely more Stevensons in the world, doing their part, following a calling to change the world for the better. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 27, 2017","Jul 23, 2017","Feb 27, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/23418947-just-mercy

I guess it's happened to all of us at one time or another. Ah....good times. So, obviously, this hasn't happened to any of us. At least, I hope it hasn't. But, Donna Tartt is not telling a story we have necessarily heard before. At least, not on the face of it. She is telling a unique tale about a peculiar group of friends who pride themselves on being unlike anyone else of their acquaintance. They are young, wealthy, privileged, New England college students, Ancient Greek scholars, taking all of their classes with a similarly eccentric professor who has taken it upon himself to mold their beliefs and ideologies, to the exclusion of all other influences. They study separately from all others in their peer group, secreted away in a hidden chamber of the university, unencumbered by the rules others must follow. Into this strange symbiosis wanders our protagonist, Richard Papen, a California native trying to escape his mundane suburban existence by heading to chilly Vermont. He becomes fascinated with this odd bunch and manages to find a way into the exclusive group. Taken by their lifestyle, their elitism, and their excursions to a mansion hideaway, Richard is willing to transform himself into whatever he needs to be in order to be one of them. In his willingness to fabricate a past that is not his own, he slowly learns that all of his new friends are fabrications in one way or another, but that they are also currently hiding one monumental secret binding them all together. This secret will lead them all to murder one of their own. This is not a spoiler. We find this out on page one. The unfolding of this act is the meat of the story. Tartt has woven a mesmerizing tale of casual sociopathy. She gives us a group of people, so bound by their own sense of identity, their own need to be special and separate from the average world that they trade in their sense of decency for a glimpse of eternity. By rationalizing that they are somehow better and smarter than everyone else, they go on a quest for deeper truths, deeper meaning in their lives, but their quest leads them to negate the importance of anyone outside of their cloistered existence. This indifference to the outside world leads to inevitable tragedy, as expected, and an unraveling of the bonds and friendships that have held them together. It is a story that can only get worse before it gets better, if it even does indeed, get better. As the plot unfolds, we find Julian, the professor who encouraged their exclusivity, left to the realization that separating his gifted children may have only led to teaching them a callous disregard for society, an outcome he never intended but should have foreseen. Did he create this situation or merely facilitate it? Would they have found this darkness without him or did they find it because of him?Tartt uncovers each new realization deftly and elegantly, with an eye for imagery and a turn of phrase that leaves the reader more than willing to follow this group of unlikeable characters anywhere. And for however long is necessary. By the end of the book, we begin to see that despite its eccentric characters and odd plotline, this is not a tale unique to this group, but an all too familiar tale, told hundreds and thousands of times in every possible language, especially the ancient Greek studied by our main characters. In fact, in many ways, the story is quite relevant to our current experience. Small groups in blind allegiance to a misguided leader who promises that ""he alone"" can save them, can show them the way, only to lead them down a dark and treacherous path due to his own narcissism and sense of self-importance - it is an old story, but one that never seems to go away. It is the story of every mythology, every cult, every demagogue, every motivational directive, every separatist political group. And many, including myself, would say it is the story within which we in America now find ourselves. Casual sociopathy. A story that always gets worse before it gets better. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 04, 2017","Jan 24, 2017","Aug 30, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13054604-the-secret-history

Until now, I have never had to question that choice. The Atticus Finch we all knew prior to 2015 was a nearly perfect person, a high-minded lawyer from a small town, defending a falsely accused African-American man against both the charges leveled against him and the racism of the townspeople. Pre-2015 Atticus was a mild-mannered, soft-spoken widower, lovingly raising two children, teaching them tolerance and kindness, urging them to do good service and not to judge others too harshly. And it didn't hurt that he had the nobility of a king, the patience of a saint, and the face of Gregory Peck. Now, thanks to the release of ""Go Set a Watchman,"" I will have to rethink my answer. That said, much as I wish my little house of cards had not been toppled by a new perspective, I have to say that this book was neither a travesty nor a masterpiece. It had its shortcomings, yes, but it also had its moments. For one thing, Harper Lee has a lovely way with language. Her clear, familiar voice brings up a hazy yellow-tinted image of the Southern landscape so vivid and nostalgic you almost feel as if you might have grown up in Maycomb County, Alabama, right next door to the Finches. Throughout her depiction of the transplanted Jean Louise Finch, returning to her hometown for a visit after having lived in New York City for the past couple of years, Lee gives us glimpses of the Scout we remember from ""Mockingbird"" through a series of recollections that Jean Louise describes for us, scenes which transport both the character and the reader back to the days of the novel we still cherish. There are some charming and humorous tales of playtimes with Dill and Jem as children and recollections of her father as a younger man, the father she (and we) looked up to and admired. These sweet remembrances, though, are juxtaposed with a disturbing social and political atmosphere winding its way through the community. Jean Louise has discovered that the town has become polarized in its views on race and that her father and boyfriend are both involved in the segregationist forces permeating the town. This discovery has made her rethink everything she once believed about her beloved father and her erstwhile fiance. She spends the rest of the novel wrestling with this knowledge and trying to come to terms with it all. Along the way, she has encounters with her eccentric Uncle Jack, her prim Aunt Alexandra, and her former nanny Calpurnia, resulting in various exchanges and debates, all of which inform her inner conflict, even if they do little to comfort her. Each character becomes a mouthpiece for the different perspectives in the town, but all of these perspectives are abhorrent to Jean Louise, who feels she has entered into a Twilight Zone of incomprehension and betrayal. In ""Watchman,"" it seems that Jean Louise is meant to be the champion of civil rights that her father was in ""Mockingbird,"" but unlike that book, which succeeded on every level, this book does not, largely because Jean Louise is too apoplectic in her approach to convince us that she is a viable voice of reason and also because the small-town South of that decade was so rife with this type of commonplace racism that Jean Louise seems almost naive to be surprised by it. And yes, the characters suffer a bit due to being forced into pigeonholes, expected to represent certain belief systems and opinions, with little deviance from their appointed states.Moreover, I had a problem with the choppy nature of the narrative. Many of the scenes that involved recollections were inspired vignettes of humor and charm, but they often had little to do with the story as a whole, and seemed to be anecdotes that had just been wedged into a story where they did not belong. Still, I was happy they were there, because they added so much warmth and nostalgia to a dark and confrontational subject. Additionally, I had a big problem with a scene near the end of the book where Uncle Jack deals with Jean Louise's defiance by literally ""smacking some sense into her."" In the book, this is accepted as a kind of necessary tactic Jack needed to use on a hysterical woman (and even Jean Louise seems to imply it was to her benefit), but I found it a disturbing occurrence of outright physical abuse, and it unnerved me almost as much as the debate about race and the talk of how ""backwards"" the ""Negroes"" were. Which leads me to the final criticism of the book. Jean Louise purports to be the ""good guy""of this book, the champion of civil rights, the voice of tolerance and equality, but, good as her intentions may be, she's a lackluster spokesperson. When Atticus challenges her late in the book about her own beliefs about race, she admits that the African-Americans are ""backwards"" and ""like little children."" This is disconcertingly just accepted as a given. She merely disagrees with him that it should preclude them from having equal rights. Not exactly a champion for the ages. So, although my Atticus is no more, those of us who loved ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" are able to find a little solace in the plight of Jean Louise in ""Go Set a Watchman."" Like her, we too have come back after many years away. We have grown up and our views have changed or solidified. And like her, we have had to face the fact that a man we loved and idealized is no longer what we thought he was. Can we love this flawed, sullied, thoroughly human character now that we have seen his dark side? Or will we have to replace him with a new ideal? If the years between ""Mockingbird"" and ""Watchman"" have taught me anything, it is that nobody is perfect. But where will I ever find another Atticus? ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 16, 2015","Aug 12, 2015","Jul 01, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24818632-go-set-a-watchman

It is a detailed account of two men, one who changed the world with a hopeful message of non-violence and equality, and one who changed the world with a gun. It is also a book that acts as a window onto another time, the late 60's in American culture, swirling with all of the defining elements that made this history possible. We get portraits of all the players: Johnson, Hoover, Abernathy, Bobby Kennedy, DeLoach, Wallace, Clark, - and a truly unflattering look at Jesse Jackson. It is a true crime book, giving us a victim and a villain, a murder and a manhunt, trace fibers and fatal mistakes. But, what I discovered while reading this book, was that it was also a haunting look at our own current national crises, a book that makes obvious the stains we have not yet erased and the lessons we have not yet learned. Yes, the book is much too unnecessarily detailed at times and certain parts are overly long while the ending seems strangely rushed, but these are minor flaws in a book that does so very many things - and does them well.I did not experience the life and death of Martin Luther King, Jr., and what I know of his impact and greatness came largely from history lessons and news clips. Hampton Sides remedied this for me. In an even-handed and meticulously researched account, he painted not the portrait of a saint, but of a man. Sides made sure that his portrait of King included his flaws and weaknesses (infidelities, long absences from home, misplaced affinities) as well as showing us his many amazing features (fierce loyalty, grace in the face of overwhelming odds, inability to hate, calming presence, inspirational demeanor, and eloquent message) - all the things we thought we knew to begin with and which proved to be more than accurate. Likewise, the author's portrait of the assassin James Earl Ray, proved to be layered and complex. Ray turns out to be an enigmatic character, equal parts uneducated racist hick and unexpected criminal mastermind, a fastidious dresser who takes dance lessons and reads self-help books, but who also routinely stays in flophouses and seeks the company of cheap prostitutes. Twice this bland, forgettable man who seemed to fade into the walls wherever he went managed to escape from maximum security prisons! Had those walls contained him the first time, maybe King would have lived to a ripe old age. We will never know. The author was clearly determined to give the reader a full journalistic account of each man, the good with the bad. And yet, not surprisingly, King still emerges as more saint than man, while Ray emerges as a man so twisted by bigotry and ignorance that he could never have escaped its warp. What really hit home for me, though, is the way that divisive views in the country helped to color and incite the already vitriolic temperament of Ray and his ilk. That a horror of a man like George Wallace could have held such power and popularity at the time - and that so many other politicians and entrepreneurs could have espoused the same beliefs openly, and with pride, lends an ominous tone to the events, a prescience that this murder was destined to occur, something even King seemed to know would happen sooner or later. I like to think modern sensibilities find it unconscionable that a climate of hatred like this could have been allowed to flourish in our so recent history. And then I look around at the current political landscape and hear people talking about building walls to keep out immigrants, refusing to understand the sad significance of confederate flags, refusing to bake a cake for a gay marriage due to ""Christian"" values, or balking at those who wish to assert that ""Black Lives Matter."" The parallels to modern society in the book were impossible to ignore. I was particularly struck, in fact, by a passage that spoke to another current topic:""As [U.S. Attorney General Ramsey] Clark sped toward Washington, he thought about America's historical penchant for gun violence...he hoped that the King assassination might quicken the debate on Capitol Hill, and he vowed to push for a policy requiring a permit to own a gun- especially high-powered rifles like a .30-06. ""We are virtually unique among nations in our failure to control guns,"" he would write.""What a sad irony that now, almost half a century after the assassination of one of the most beloved (and to some, polarizing) figures in our history, the same issues still plague our nation and divide us as to our values and political beliefs. We are still beset with inadequate gun control laws, rampant inequality, racial discrimination, and violence of all kinds. Civil rights issues still dominate the headlines, stricter gun laws face powerful resistance from well-funded lobbies, and the ramifications of both issues continue to escalate. In a climate of intolerance, we seem destined to breed more men like James Earl Ray. If this book has only one takeaway - that we need to heed the message that Martin Luther King, Jr. gave us all those years ago or suffer the same unrest and violence that should have been left in our past by now - then it is well worth the read. A culture that allows a man like Ray to exist and thrive is a tragedy, and we are not so far removed from that climate right now. Ray pulled that trigger. There was no conspiracy. No powerful group funded his actions. No one hired him to do this evil deed. But make no mistake, many were complicit in the crime. As King's widow, Coretta, so aptly said at the time, ""There were many fingers on the rifle."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Jul 2015,"Aug 30, 2015","Jul 01, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8161006-hellhound-on-his-trail

When I read his novels, I often find myself overcome by the inner lives of his characters. He has a way of breaking your heart I love Kazuo Ishiguro. When I read his novels, I often find myself overcome by the inner lives of his characters. He has a way of breaking your heart with his insight, the way he uses dialogue - or perhaps, more accurately, omits it - to convey the regret and sadness of everyday life and all of those things that are left unsaid. It has served him well in his previous novels, and I was looking forward to ""The Buried Giant,"" although, I have to admit, I was a little concerned when I heard it was a novel written in the fantasy genre. How would an author given to minimalism and an economy of language fare in a genre so often given to the other extremes? As it turns out, not so well. The story of Beatrice and Axl, an elderly couple taking a perilous journey on foot to see their long lost son, is a bittersweet tale. Along the way, they meet a warrior and a charmed boy and an Arthurian knight, all of whom figure into this enchanted little legend and make up its main characters. There is talk of a mist that has clouded their memories, a mist created by a dragon named Querig, that keeps the people of the land from remembering important details from their pasts. To tell you more might ruin the story, but know that, as is often the case in a tale such as this, all of the characters are shrouded in mystery, things are not always what they seem, and characters are more likely than not merely symbolic embodiments of events and ideas from the collective lore of humanity. Sounds pretty good, right? And it is. It's pretty good. It's just not very good. And I believe the reason for this is because Ishiguro was not meant for this style of writing. A bold statement for someone who reveres him and who also has no business questioning his skills, but...there it is. Ishiguro has written stellar novels that hinge upon the spare emotional relationships between repressed people and the small risks they take along the way as they approach their fears. He has done this largely through extremely accurate dialogue and the desperate absences of eventfulness that often make up a huge portion of real life. Fantasy, on the other hand, is a different animal altogether. The fantasy reader requires a certain richness of detail, a lush, brash, magical turn of phrase that allows the reader to suspend disbelief and enter a world unlike one's own, but with an undeniable authenticity. From the very first chapter, I noticed the plodding pace of the book, the matter-of-fact way this supposedly enchanted land was described, the lengthy set-up, and the feeling of constantly waiting...waiting...for something to happen. I understand why all of that could have been intentional, but it didn't make for a fantasy page turner and it wasn't ""alive"" enough to draw me into its narrative. For a book containing Arthurian legend, ogres, dragons, charms, perils, and a strange curse, it was, well...kind of boring. And I don't bore easily. I've watched ""Howard's End"" twice. I have a high threshold for boredom. But what bothered me most was the feeling that nothing felt new or original. It was a patchwork of every folk legend everyone has ever heard. And yes, I get it, that may have been the point. But if that's the case, write an essay about archetypes and their relationship to individual and collective psychology and just tell me that life is easier when we begin to forget past slights and grudges. Because that's the point of the story. Nothing will ever get better on a large or small scale if we do not forgive the past and allow it to become a dim memory, half-remembered and not as important as the present. It is the only way to heal, the only way to love, and the only way to live in peace.A beautiful concept. A heartbreaking concept. One I would have liked Ishiguro to explore in a novel.

She can craft a great suspense novel like nobody's business. Her character development is exceptional. Her turn of phrase is fresh, insightful, and often startling in its originality. She writes within a genre that is often tainted by formulaic hacks and pedestrian plots and she elevates it to bonified literature; her writing is really that good. We all know the phenomenon that is ""Gone Girl,"" a delicious piece of work whose devious contrivances were lost on you if you only saw the movie. And Flynn's novel, ""Dark Places"" was even better than ""Gone Girl,"" filled with complexity and nuances that truly captivated. ""Sharp Objects"" is another well-written, well-crafted novel about a struggling city journalist sent to cover the human interest side of the disappearance of a young woman in her hometown, a town she has no desire to revisit for reasons that largely have to do with the complicated relationship she has with her disapproving, passive-aggressive mother and her eccentric stepfamily. Telling you much more about the plot would give away far too many spoilers, and you need to unravel these on your own. Suffice to say, this is a really damaged woman with some pretty disturbing family secrets who is not going to have an easy time of things as she navigates this news story. Flynn, as usual, makes the characters come alive. She writes like a dream and her imagery really stays with the reader. So, why am I not giving this book a higher rating and a more enthusiastic recommendation? Because this is the only one of Flynn's three books that did not ring true for me. Some of the characters and their motivations, as well as the eventual outcome of the book, seemed unlikely, unrealistic, and in some ways, maddening. I have come to dislike books that take this unlikely turn, because they are legitimizing a concept that is not supported by facts. Criminology has detailed again and again that crimes of this nature have particular culprits, a type that is far and away the norm. I feel endings of this unnatural type feed into a certain mindset that is unnecessarily damaging to our view of society in general. And I have stumbled across this type of ending far too often lately. I am not liking the trend.My apologies for being so cryptic, but any additional information would be too much. I wholeheartedly recommend Gillian Flynn, and really hope she comes out with many more books in the near future. She is a very talented writer.

But that alone may be enough to make this book worth reading, at least as a palette-cleansing quick summer read between more substantial works of fiction.""Disclaimer"" has a great little hook. What if you had a deep, dark secret from your past and you thought no one knew about it? Absolutely NO ONE. And then one day, a mysterious book showed up at your door and it held the story of your buried secret for all the world to read? What would you do to protect the shell of your privacy? How would you deal with this subtle form of terrorism from an unknown intruder into your personal life? ""Disclaimer"" has a truly interesting premise that sets the stage for the way this secret will begin to tear apart the lives of our main character and her family, beginning as a woman's desperate attempt to quash the story and discover its source and building to a twisted crescendo that reveals an even more surprising secret that I doubt even the most savvy reader could have seen coming. With such a fantastic concept at its heart, one would think I would have given this book a higher rating. My problem with it was a stylistic one. I just felt that the characters were never truly fleshed out. They seemed to me rather two-dimensional, unremarkable people. I could never even picture them as entities in my head, (even though there were really only four main characters), and I just never got a sense of the inner lives of any of them. It was clear that the characters and their dialogue and any small event that occurred was really only calculated to continually drive the one plot point home. And, that's fine. I get it. To some extent, every book must revolve around its conceptual framework. But don't make the machinery so obvious to me. I don't want to see the Wizard behind the curtain in the Emerald City. Get me involved in the characters, make me care about them, and then...only then...will you drive your little hook into my heart. That said, this book has not one, but two reveals - the second far more incredible than the first. I usually see a surprise or a plot twist coming from a mile away. I never once suspected the actual secret that would be revealed near the end of this book. Well done, Renee Knight, on surprising me. Now, if only I had cared more about the characters, had felt a little more invested in their lives and fates, perhaps instead of finding this book to be a mildly surprising suspense novel with a serviceable hook, I might have dubbed it ""the ""Gone Girl"" of this summer."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 22, 2015","Jun 30, 2015","Jun 02, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/23734639-disclaimer

Most of us also know we will never make our living as writers, and so we work other jobs to pay the bills while writing in the bits and pieces of time not filled by other concerns. When we think of an author like Ann Patchett, who has made the leap, has written successful novels of depth and substance that also afford her to pay the bills and live her life as a writer, we may think she has had advantages that we do not. She has been carried along on a magic carpet ride of privilege and connections and lofty offers that could not possibly apply to any of us. And to some extent, that has been the case. Good schools, amazing mentors, the benefit of working with great writers who taught her so much. She did seem destined for greatness. Until her first teaching job went sour, and her marriage fell apart, and suddenly, she found herself back home living with her mom and waitressing at TGIF. Ann Patchett. Famous novelist. Waitressing at TGIF. Let that sink in for a moment. If you are a fan of Ms. Patchett, like I am, and someone who writes (perhaps with the hope of publication), like I do, this little gem of a memoir (and I do mean little - you can read it in a couple of hours) is well worth your time. You will not learn anything new. You will learn that writing is about work, about time spent writing, about planning, about revision. We know the drill. But you will discover that even someone with every advantage can find herself down on her luck, in a dead-end job and a dead-end town, wondering how the hell to get out of there and pursue her life's dream. And rather than explore other options or settle for less, she decides to create her ""getaway car"" - the novel she needs to write to prove to herself that she can. Along the way we learn that college does not prepare you for writing a novel. Nothing prepares you for writing a novel except writing one. All novelists have different approaches and styles for their process. None is better than another. There is no magic formula, no hard and fast rule. You just have to trust what works for you. If you want to write, you have to practice writing. Just like playing the cello. None of this is news, but somehow, all of it, put together in the luminous yet pragmatic voice of Ann Patchett, becomes something more important than news, or tips, or how-to guides, or just whiling away the time as a famous author discusses her life. It becomes that most essential thing for writers. Inspiration. Which is why I feel I will read this small gift over and over again. While I work on my own ""getaway car."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 11, 2015","Jul 03, 2015","Feb 17, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12471186-the-getaway-car

Prior to this book, I read a non-fiction book, the extremely well-written and well-researchLet me tell you how I know Gillian Flynn is the real deal. Prior to this book, I read a non-fiction book, the extremely well-written and well-researched ""In the Heart of the Sea,"" a solid story with riveting characters and a compelling setting that kept me engaged throughout. So, the time came to choose my next book, and since I like to alternate between fiction and non-fiction, I chose a recently published suspense novel that had come highly recommended and well-received by critics and readers alike. Only it wasn't Gillian Flynn's novel - it was a different suspense novel, acclaimed by a different group of readers, and one whose name and author I will not mention here, as I intend to use it as my ""before"" picture in this particular ""before and after"" comparison. Halfway into the first chapter of this unnamed novel, I shut the book and sat for a moment, asking myself if I thought the book was poorly written or if it just paled in comparison to the book I had just read. Should I keep going? Give its lifeless pages another chance to improve? Ah, life is too short to read bad books when there are so many good ones out there beckoning, and there is so little time. So...I placed it on the backburner and turned to the next title in my queue, ""Dark Places"" by Gillian Flynn. I had read her novel ""Gone Girl"" last year and found it a pleasant surprise, the kind of book that becomes popular with a mass audience despite being non-formulaic, a real gem of well-crafted dialogue and superb character development all wrapped around a twisted little premise. I had liked it very much. So I started in and got to about the third sentence, when I realized, ""Wow, what a difference! This lady can write. This book is already so much better than the bland, mediocre writing I encountered a few minutes ago."" And things just kept getting better from there. ""Dark Places"" is not the kind of book you want to read if you like warm and fuzzy stories about happy people living normal lives in relative comfort and safety. Flynn seems to have an affinity for tragic people in desperate situations trying to grasp a little piece of everyone else's seemingly normal existence. This tale deals with the sole survivor of a murdered family, trying to uncover the details of what happened that night twenty five years later. Libby Day was seven years old when her family was butchered in their farmhouse and she has been just floating through life ever since, never thinking about that night, staying away from the ""Dark Place."" Her testimony, however, was the main reason for the conviction of her teenage brother, Ben, and now, in her thirties, she is confronted with the concept that she may have been wrong. A truly intriguing premise that would have probably made a good story in the hands of any competent suspense writer, but Gillian Flynn has a way of bringing characters to life and writing scenes so vivid that they make you feel you are right inside the action, inside the heads of these people every step of the way. The story jumps back and forth between 1985 (the days leading up to the murders) and the present (2009 as of its writing) - and the chapters alternate between three main characters and are told in the voice of each: Libby (now and in 1985), her mother Patty (murdered in 1985) and her brother Ben (in prison all these years). Some writers attempt this type of format and fail miserably, the time frame jumpy and hard to follow, the different characters muddying the waters, making the story feel choppy and unfocused. Flynn masters this format with a fluidity and seamlessness that make the transitions seem barely noticeable. Each character is a fully developed, well-defined entity with all of the flaws and strengths and quirks and unique personality traits that entails. In fact, with as dark a premise as this (a murdered family, a tragic survivor, a potentially innocent man imprisoned as a boy, and several other desperate people in unsavory sidebars) you would think this a depressing little read, heavy on the battle between good and evil, barely readable in its horrific details. But no, this is where Flynn manages a magical balancing act, somehow transcending horror, transcending genre, and flying in the face of preachy convention. She gives us a collection of people, real flesh and blood people, and says, ""This is life. This is what can happen, even when everything seems to be normal. This could be you or any of us."" And she makes us care what happens, because these characters are not unlike you and me, our neighbors, our coworkers. These are not hideous anomalies, pathetic victims, caricatures of terror. These are average folks in a normal existence until the unthinkable happens. And that's why Gillian Flynn is a writer that will most likely be writing compelling fiction for a long time to come. She doesn't write suspense thrillers. She writes about average people in unthinkable situations, just trying to cope, just trying to get past it. Because we all have at least one dark place, whether we want to admit it or not. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Mar 05, 2015","Mar 11, 2015","Feb 17, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6569735-dark-places

You hand me a book about shipping disasters or Amazonian perils or Shackleton or the search for the Northwest Passage, and if it is at all well-researched and readable, I am in. But find me one that references something I know, an area with which I am already familiar - and there is something even more tempting and immediate about its draw. That's why ""In The Heart of the Sea"" seems like a book that was custom written just for me. A thrilling true story about a shipping disaster in the 1800's that gives brilliant detail about the Nantucket seafaring community of the time, its uniquely constructed society, its dependence upon sperm whale oil for its financial success, all of the anthropological nuances of that culture brought to life, but also tells - in harrowing detail - the story of one tragic voyage, a voyage that would ultimately become the basis for one of literature's greatest novels, ""Moby Dick.""Exhaustively researched, this book succeeds on many levels, largely due to its investment in the lives and fates of our main characters. Much the way Sebastian Junger made us experience (as if first-hand) the unique swordfishing community of Gloucester in his book ""A Perfect Storm"" and made it a place we could literally see in our mind's eye, populated with people we came to know and care about, so too does Nathaniel Philbrick bring the early Quaker enclave of Nantucket to life and attempt to describe the inner lives of the men who would go to sea on this ill-fated voyage, as well as those of the women left behind, often for two years at a time. The description of early Nantucket, in fact, was nearly as interesting as the description of the tragedy itself, one of those rare occasions when the backstory really is as essential to our understanding as the main event. I won't get into specifics here, but the quest for sperm whale oil in the 1800s may have been one of the most dangerous and incomparably brutal occupations ever known to humans, and Philbrick describes the process in awe-inspiring detail. That every crew who sailed for that purpose did not suffer a similar fate is the true miracle of the tale. I will tell you this. This is not a book about a tragedy, it is a tale about a series of tragedies, each one more disheartening and insurmountable than the last. Be prepared for a dark voyage into corners of the human psyche few care to contemplate. Yes, there are glimmers of hope along the way, and yes, there is a great deal of history and adventure here. But at its heart, this is a tale of bad luck, poor decisions, and the truly dire consequences that can occur when those elements converge with the power of the sea and its creatures, unmoved by the desire of men to master and tame them. Every bad thing you can imagine happens in these pages. Even a few things you never dared to imagine. In less talented hands this would be a lurid tale of brutality, gore, death and despair. In Philbrick's hands, it is a thoughtful narrative on what living beings are able to endure, how our behaviors define us, and in the end, what constitutes humanity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Feb 17, 2015","Mar 04, 2015","Feb 17, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6570440-in-the-heart-of-the-sea

These are the store clerks or baristas or subway travelers we see on a fairly regular basis, the somewhat familiar faces that show up in our existence time and again - people we think we may ""kind of know,"" but who we do not really ""know"" at all. And in our heads, maybe we play this little game where we imagine what their lives might be like beyond the context of our acquaintance. ""Maybe Kent the toll taker has a young wife and three children at home and they live in a cramped tenement apartment with Kent's ailing mum?"" It's tempting to create a backstory and then convince ourselves that it is real. Or maybe we think that we can gauge a person's character by virtue of their looks or their demeanor. ""That waitress is always so pleasant to me - she must be a nice person, right?"" ""That guy at Starbuck's is so handsome, I'll bet his wife is a lucky woman."" Which is probably why the neighbors of serial killers, when interviewed on television, always say ""He seemed such a nice, quiet fellow. Always polite, always helpful. I can't believe he would ever do such a thing."" We all think we know the familiars in our lives...but we don't really know them at all. ""The Girl on the Train"" is arranged around that same premise. Part ""Rear Window,"" part ""Yellow Wallpaper"" and part every mystery you have ever encountered that involves suspicious suburbanites, a missing woman, and unreliable witnesses, this book follows our main protagonist, Rachel, who has created a backstory for two of her ""familiars"" - a couple who live in a home she sees from her train stop every day. Rachel witnesses something unusual in the lives of her familiars the day before the wife in that couple goes missing, and from there we are catapulted into a story where we are presented with a host of characters we begin to think we know...only to learn we do not really know them at all. I won't lay out the plot lines or divulge any spoilers here. This book is a great little character study that benefits most from its razor-sharp economy of language, addressing all the dark layers of human existence with a very effective minimalism, and also succeeds due to its disturbingly simple premise that we never truly know what anyone around us is capable of doing at any given moment, we cannot imagine the inner lives, the internal struggles that those around us face beneath the facade of everyday platitudes. That lady down the street may be cheating on her husband or plotting revenge on a colleague or a clinically depressed addict just as easily as she may be a good samaritan or a devoted mother or a volunteer at the food bank. And she may even be all of these things at once. The capacity for others to be able to deceive us also depends on our capacity to deceive ourselves. There were a couple of minor issues I had with the book, but they did not detract much from my enjoyment of its quick prose and nasty little twists and turns. What bothered me most was Rachel herself, but that's actually a testament to the author, because Rachel is supposed to bother me. She is a troubled desperate woman, an alcoholic, obsessed with her ex-husband and her old life, and truly her own worst enemy. In fact, I kind of wonder if the train imagery that persists in the book is also meant to represent the ""train wreck"" of a woman that Rachel has become. There were several moments in the book when Rachel would fall into another bad habit or desperately serial call someone, and I wanted to crawl into the pages and take the cell phone away from her or stop her from making some new boneheaded mistake. But Rachel has to be this way, for purposes of the storyline and for purposes of lulling us into yet another preconception. The only real stumbling point for me with this book was that I figured out the big reveal long before it happened. Very close to the beginning of the book, in fact. And that took a bit of the fun out of it, because I do like a book that can surprise me, and I would have liked to have been wrong. Many readers claimed not to have seen it coming, though, and I envy them that morsel of satisfaction. Somehow, even knowing did not diminish my enjoyment of the book or my compulsion to try to read as much of it in one sitting as possible. The untangling of the story's many deceptions and misconceptions, the realization of the true natures of their ""familiars,"" is really a journey that the characters themselves have to take, a reveal that they ultimately have to uncover, whether we know where this train is going or not. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 07, 2015","Feb 11, 2015","Jan 16, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22105022-the-girl-on-the-train

Somehow, through keen perception and shrewd dealings with key players in the Court, Cromwell broke the shackles of his ill associations and low birth to become right hand to King Henry VIII (largely by helping the king find a way to shed his wife of two decades by virtue of overturning the entire country’s wealthy and powerful religious system). No small feat. In “Bring Up the Bodies” we now watch Cromwell perform a dangerous tightrope walk between the regard of his new Queen - Anne Boleyn (who has shown him favor despite her volatility), his mercurial King, whose temper and wandering eye may be the undoing of countless innocents, and the nobility, most of whom despise him, but all of whom want to use them for their own ends.

That Mantel somehow manages to make this ruthless, vengeful scrabbler the hero of these volumes is nothing less than miraculous. We do not just root for Cromwell in these books, we admire him. He is nothing less than a marvel of insight and perspicacity. One wonders if he is more wizard than human. In this Court full of entitled men of noble birth, he reigns free, holds a place of honor and fear among all. All because he is a man who is willing to do what others will not.At the end of this book many men have died at the hand of Cromwell, ostensibly because they were consorting with the Queen, but in actuality because they were enemies of Cromwell’s mentor, Cardinal Wolsey – if men had to die to appease the wishes of the King, they may as well be men for whom Cromwell had little regard in the first place. Men who, in his mind, deserved it more. This is the justice of the Court of King Henry, a justice the king applauds as long as it suits his needs. For we become increasingly aware that the only man more ruthless than Cromwell is the King himself. Thus is the stage set for the final volume in Mantel’s trilogy about Cromwell. How long can a man of low birth and high aspirations stay safe in a place where he has more enemies than friends and his only protector is a king who grows more unstable and demanding with each passing day? If the following description is any indication, Cromwell has his work cut out for him:“You can be merry with the king, you can share a joke with him. But as Thomas More used to say, it's like sporting with a tamed lion. You tousle its mane and pull its ears, but all the time you're thinking, those claws, those claws, those claws.”...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 03, 2015","May 02, 2012",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13512040-bring-up-the-bodies

Irene is a a woman, but she is also a symbol – foWhen an author names a character “Irene America,” chances are the name has not been randomly chosen. Irene is a a woman, but she is also a symbol – for a country, a culture, a part of history. And when that character is also Native American, her symbolic impact becomes even more nuanced. And when that character’s husband is a famous artist whose paintings are all inspired by Irene’s image, then suddenly the conceptual framework intensifies and individual interpretation of Irene - of her image, of the real woman behind the image, of her artist husband, and of America itself - becomes not only the key to our understanding of the character, but of the story as a whole. Irene America regularly writes her thoughts and life story in a hidden red diary. Upon discovering that her husband has found her diary and begun reading it in secret, rather than confront him, she decides to continue writing in her diary, but writing lies and half-truths and quizzical thoughts that will make her husband question their marital history and their life together. Additionally, she obtains a secret safety deposit box, and begins writing a blue diary to be kept and updated there, filled with her actual story, the truth of the matter as she believes it to be. Her husband, a possessive and occasionally abusive man, a brilliant artist, but desperate and insecure, becomes haunted and enraged by the deceptive passages he reads in the red diary, and Irene uses the betrayal as a sort of belated revenge against the man who has exploited her for all these years. It is a twisted scenario, particularly when viewed in the context of a dysfunctional marriage in which three children also get to witness their parents’ issues, and equally disturbing when utilized as a reflection of America and the revisionist history that has become an inherent part of both its mystique and its corruption.The theme of revisionist history is woven into the story in several different ways. Irene is completing a doctoral thesis on George Catlin, an artist whose early paintings of Native Americans became controversial symbols of exploitation to some, valuable depictions of early life to others, and were a source of both fear and wonder for the subjects of those paintings. Irene tells stories about Catlin to her husband, and often those stories are filled with half-truths, imagining occurrences that never actually happened. We are given glimpses of Catlin's character that we need to reassess when we later discover Irene’s falsifications. We are left to decide if our feelings about the actual man have changed given the information we now have at our disposal, some of it true, some of it created. Catlin comes to stand for the history of America as a country and the way much of what we learn in history classes is myth, a history written by the victors, legends passed down through centuries that may have little or no basis in fact but become true by numerous retellings. Similarly, like visitors to a gallery, we are given small glimpses into the lives of our main characters, scenes that show both their weaknesses and strengths, their moments of light and dark, and then we must ask ourselves if the information at hand gives us a complete enough portrait to make an assessment about their true selves. The fine line (or at times, vast chasm) between truth and mythology, art and reality, depiction and exploitation, image and distortion, are all images Erdrich plays with throughout the novel, often with startling and disturbing results. The material is ambitious, but Erdrich handles it deftly with sharp prose and surprising imagery. When Irene discusses the way Catlin’s portrait subjects were worried that their images on canvas contained trapped pieces of their souls, she begins to see her own image, captured so often on canvas by her artist husband (Gil), as another soul trapped in captivity, a distortion of the real woman, now altered to suit the motives of the painter and the interpretations of those who view her. Irene’s ancestors, like Catlin’s subjects, believed a soul could be captured through a shadow, a mirror, a reflection. Irene begins to see herself in Gil’s paintings as a double that has been released into the world, one that her husband now owns. Erdrich writes, “Gil had placed his foot on Irene’s shadow when he painted her. And though she tried to pull away, it was impossible to tug that skein of darkness from under his heel.” There are other thought-provoking points made in the novel, particularly when we are made privy to Gil’s favorite artists (Rembrandt, Bonnard – both renowned for their portraiture) and asked to consider Rembrandt’s portrait of Lucretia (the doomed faithful wife who took her life rather than bear the shame of having been raped). Gil obsesses over this portrait of a woman who has been represented in art and literature throughout the ages. We know this obsession foreshadows something unfortunate for Irene and Gil, as well, but in essence, we are being asked ahead of time to judge the depiction and decide if the story has been told accurately or if it is a fabrication that has achieved nearly mythological status. Likewise, in descriptions of Bonnard's paintings, we are given small scenes from a life and asked if we can judge the truth from those few small moments in time. This theme resonates in the larger story as we are given a series of incidents, a spate of domestic moments, a handful of facts, and then are asked to discern, by virtue of just these details, if we can ever truly know the motives of the people involved in these scenes. Erdrich seems to want us to arrive at the conclusion that we all have shades of light and dark within us, we all carry the full spectrum of colors, and most of us have reflected all of them at one time or another. No single glimpse, no moment in time, ever tells the whole story. Every soul is open to interpretation. I would have loved to have given this book four, or even five, stars. I have been pondering its stunning themes for days, and I am enamored of Erdrich’s writing style and her bravery in taking on such a breadth of philosophical matter. Unfortunately, the book itself isn’t fleshed out enough to take on such expansive themes. For starters, it is simply too short. Usually, I am apt to complain if a book is unnecessarily too long, but this book needed at least another two hundred pages to fulfill its early promise. By the end of Part Two, at just over two hundred pages, it was clear that Erdrich was rushing her narrative. Either the book had become too harrowing for her, its subject matter too difficult to explore any longer, or she was merely under a deadline and needed to wrap it up. Several veins of rich material needed to be further mined, and the impact of certain story lines was vastly diminished by the quick wrap-up. I almost want to call “Shadow Tag” Erdrich’s ""unfinished"" novel, because if only it were twice as long, it might be the best book ever written. (Three and a half stars – and well worth reading for the conceptual framework alone.)...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Feb 12, 2012","Feb 16, 2012","Feb 12, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6673172-shadow-tag

He was an American HistNote: Goodreads doesn't have a half star option, but my rating is actually three and a half stars.My dad would be proud of me. He was an American History buff, always pressing me to read less fiction and more books about our nation's past presidents and significant historical events. I was never very interested in that. But since his passing, I have made it a point to alternate fiction titles with non-fiction titles, and one of those happened to be Candice Millard's previous book ""The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey,"" (which I have also ed on GR), a five-star marvel of a book that engrossed me from its first word to its last. That said, when I discovered that Millard had a new book out, I was eager to read it, despite the fact that I knew embarrassingly little - oh, who am I kidding? - I knew absolutely NOTHING about former President James Garfield except that he had suffered an untimely death at the hands of an assassin (an assassin about whom I also knew nothing, including his name). Determined to rectify that gap in my knowledge, I began reading, less with enthusiasm than with trepidation. But I'm very glad that I did. I'll admit, this is not Millard's best book. It is not as riveting as ""River of Doubt,"" that's true. But that book had Teddy Roosevelt and the Amazon River. Any decent writer could take either of those subjects and produce a pretty good book out of them. In fact, even a poor writer could probably have written a pretty good book about the larger than life Roosevelt and his trek through uncharted territory. Garfield was no Roosevelt. But Garfield was remarkable, in ways I never expected, and through Millard's eyes and her careful research, he has now become one of the more beloved figures in my mind, a man who could possibly have been the greatest President who ever lived, had not one, but TWO truly destructive megalomaniacs ended his life too soon. I will not give you a complete synopsis. You really should read this book and learn about the greatest President you never knew. There is also a wealth of fascinating information about the state of the country at that time, the technological advances that were just being made, the corrupt political spoils system in place as Garfield was ascending to power, and a great side story about the workaholic Alexander Graham Bell, striving to save a President with a new invention. But here is what I will tell you: This is not a tragedy. A tragedy, as we know, is when a protagonist brings about his own downfall through his own questionable decisions and actions. Garfield, by all accounts, was a thoroughly good man, a veritable walking testament to the value of knowledge and decency as a way to rise through the ranks and achieve ""The American Dream."" No, this was not a tragedy, but a travesty.Garfield didn't have to die. He was shot by one madman and killed by another. The first was a lowly lunatic with delusions of grandeur. The second was a self-promoting arrogant physician with delusions of grandeur. One shot him. One killed him. The first had intent. The second, merely self-importance and incompetence. The first was hanged for his actions. The second merely disgraced by history. And so, a beacon of all that the Presidency should be was cut down in the beginning of his reign. A man who championed civil rights, education, and an end to political corruption shot in a public train station. A man who never wanted to be President - never ran for the office (who was nominated against his will!), died because of his duty to the nation. A tragedy? No. A travesty. And a cruel twist of fate for a young nation who could have truly benefited from the long Presidency of a great man. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 28, 2015","Jun 20, 2015","Jan 17, 2012",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12738936-destiny-of-the-republic

When he misses, I generally cite a ludicrous premise made more unappealing by hasty plot contrivances added for shock value. I also cite (even in his best books) his penchant for truly unnatural dialogue. I often stop myself while reading a conversation between his characters to literally say out loud ""No one would say that. Nobody talks that way."" His misses have left me wondering if I should take the risk with each new book (and he seems to put one out every few months, so that's an investment of time I have not always been willing to make). Ah, but when he hits, he hits in spectacular fashion. And ""11/22/63"" is a big, big hit. Is the premise ludicrous? Absolutely. Are there plot contrivances added for shock value? There most certainly are. Is the dialogue written in King's characteristically unnatural style? You bet your ass it is. But then, there's the concept. And what a concept! An ordinary man given the chance to rewrite history as we know it. And what an ordinary man! Someone the reader can truly champion, not because he is pristine and heroic, but because he is just a slightly ""smarter than average"" schmoe with our flaws and desires and mistake-laden past trying deperately to do what he feels is ""the right thing"" despite the toll it may take on his own small but precious life. And what makes it work? The fact that our hero's inner dialogue feels genuine. The conversations he has with others may seem a bit unnatural at times, but inside his head this guy is real. He thinks our thoughts, he has flashes of irony and comedy at inopportune times. He struggles with ethical dilemmas and doesn't always choose the best path. A few chapters in, it occurred to me, ""Jesus. I just really like this guy."" And that made all the difference. Now, add to that character foundation the fact that the story revolves around one of the more interesting times in American political history and around some of the most troubled and dangerous characters of that decade. I am not sure if I am pleased or embarrassed to admit that I may have learned more about the Kennedy years and about the political machinations swirling around his presidency - and about the character of people like Oswald and Johnson and others - than I ever did in a classroom. King did some truly impressive and extensive research into the era, and it really added immensely to the spellbinding quality of the text. The moves our characters made felt believable because they were reactions to actual events in their proper historical perspectives. That might make this book sound dry or overly manipulated, but that's the beauty of this book. It feels as if history is spilling out of the characters, as if suddenly the things we learned in school have human faces and beating hearts and deperately troubled minds behind those pesky, debatable ""facts."" King has made the era, the zeitgeist, the historical figures, the settings, and his fictional characters all come to life in the midst of a very long, very complicated story filled with twists and turns and stylized backstories and all manner of added plot fillers - and somehow it only rarely becomes too overwhelming or bogged down. I would consider it a monumental achievement of creativity and research to have written just this one book in a normal human lifespan. How King seems to do this over and over again I have no idea. And to write a few misses in between. Well worth the wait. I won't tell you the rest. You know what happened in 1963, even if - like myself - you were not even born yet. But...you have never heard the ""what ifs"" stated quite like the ones in this book. Suspend disbelief for the first few chapters and you will be highly rewarded with a story that takes you through a time you have not experienced in a way that might change your perspective forever. Thank you, Mr. King. I've been too hard on you....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 16, 2012","Jan 17, 2013","Nov 09, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10644930-11-22-63

Subtlety is not my strong suit - I absolutely love those books. But, as someone who has traversed the jaw-dropping scenery of the Bavarian Alps just to get to a trash-strewn field full of heavy metal concert-goers, I also learned long ago that very often the journey is far more satisfying than the destination. For every spectacular sight, exotic landmark, and sunset boat ride along the way, there's often a corresponding turbulence-filled airplane flight, grungy taxicab ride, or tense wait in an awkward queue at the customs counter or rental car place. For me, ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Catching Fire"" were amazing journeys, full of the excitement, novelty and romance of all great travels. ""Mockingjay,"" on the other hand, was the final destination, and like all final destinations, it harbored a little bit of the letdown of the journey's end, as well as an acknowledgement of the strings being pulled by the travel planner. **There may be some spoilers in the rest of this, so if you don’t want to know about the trilogy’s end, you may want to stop reading now. My main problem with the book was that I felt as though Collins was scrambling to take all the plot elements she had so brilliantly set up in the first two books and somehow make them all come together in a BIG finale that would not only be plausible to her now-loyal fans, but explain everything, AND look really cool onscreen when the films came out. Because of that, it seemed like a very self-conscious book, one that dragged out all the bells and whistles, sometimes in place of deeper character development, more believable occurrences, and a greater emotional impact. I won’t go into long passages about it, but here are a few bullet points of the things that bothered me a bit in the novel:•	The regression of Katniss – she is headstrong and capable in the first two books while still being sympathetic, but in the third book she becomes a bit grating and arrogant. Her lack of understanding in the face of Peeta’s ordeal particularly disturbed me.•	The vilification of Gale (made inexcusable by the unnecessary cause of a beloved character’s death at the end of the book). I know Collins did this in order to make the choice of suitors acceptable, but as someone who adored the Gale character in the first two books, this left a bad taste in my mouth.•	The contrived manner of death of the aforementioned beloved character. It’s not the death itself that bothered me as much as the haphazard way it was handled. There is no reason for the character to be there at the time of her death. Some sort of logical progression would have helped. I’m not a fan of contrivance when it is painted with such a heavy brushstroke. •	The ludicrous series of events that lead to the small gang of fighters leading an ill-planned and ill-fated siege on the Capitol. Defied believability. •	The all-too-grotesque manners of death within the grid. Even in a video-game world, it was a bit of overkill (pun intended). And finally, I was really unhappy with the resolution of the “love triangle.” When Katniss finally makes her choice it is not even a choice at all. It disappointingly becomes little more than a matter of proximity. “Oh, you’re here. I guess I’ll try to love you then.” Considering everything he went through for her, I would have liked it if maybe she had shown him a little declaration of something more passionate than just “Real.” So, even though I still highly recommend this series to absolutely everyone on planet Earth, I would now caution that every trilogy ends, and endings are not always the most satisfying part of a great journey. That said, Collins has given us a YA gem of a series with much to say about our civilization, our politics, our culture’s missteps, flaws, joys, and strengths, and all of those elusive traits that make us human. She can plan my travel itinerary anytime (as long as it’s not a trip to the Capitol in Panem by way of the grid).  ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Oct 31, 2011","Nov 03, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7260188-mockingjay

This book was well-paced, well-plotted, and completely engrossing for all of 352 pages. Unfortunately, the edition I read had 434 pages, and therein lies the problem. If you haven't read ""The Poet,"" but you intend to do so, I do not want to dissuade you from that endeavor, because Connelly really is a very good writer with an inventive mind and an evocative style. On the other hand, you may want to skip the rest of this , as it is about to contain some possible spoilers. Without revealing the spoilers, I would be unable to justify my three star rating.********************************************************************""The Poet"" started out with a lot of promise (news reporter Jack McEvoy's twin brother - a police homicide detective - is found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after having obsessed for months over a particular homicide victim). But all is not as it seems, and McEvoy uncovers a series of serial killings of homicide detectives all across the country that have cleverly been made to look like suicides. Great hook. Really captivating. The creepy suspected killer is a pedophile and truly horrifying character, and Connelly does a fine job of making him disgusting and realistic at the same time. Once the FBI becomes involved and McEvoy has to blackmail them into letting him join the task force in order to keep the story under wraps, it all takes off brilliantly. For genre fiction, this had me reading past my bedtime on work nights and looking forward to the next time I could open its covers. Which is why I was so truly disappointed when right at the peak of the story, our supposedly intelligent and savvy reporter does something so absurd and unbelievable, I felt not only let down by the story, but questioning of Connelly's abilities to bring this thing home properly. And I was right to feel that way, because after that first lapse, the rest of the plot devolved into even greater absurdities that made the book feel false and insulting. Sure, throughout the book there were a few things that happened that felt somewhat inauthentic or seemed a bit too convenient, but at the time, I thought it was intentional staging for an ending that would incorporate all of these things and make them seem more necessary to the plot. I really felt that Connelly had put all of these elements into the storyline on purpose in order to lead us along until the big reveal, when their vital nature would be explained and his inclusion of them, vindicated. (Yes, I tend to expect too much at times. I'm aware of that.)The most glaring of these contrivances was the all-too-formulaic romance that ensued between Connelly's McEvoy and the ""beautiful but troubled"" FBI agent he is paired with on the case. I assumed her seduction of him would have searing implications later on and be part of a really clever game that had been played on McEvoy, the FBI, and/or the reader. I was assuming Connelly had a far more clever mousetrap set than he actually did. But some of the formulaic elements turned out to be just that, and some of the contrivances were merely to move the plot along from A to B to C. It wasn't so much a creative journey as a serviceable outline. There were a hundred different ways this book could have ended and still surprised the reader while maintaining its realism and integrity. Instead, Connelly decided to travel a route that made zero sense and left anyone who knows anything about actual crimes shaking his or her head at the ridiculousness of the contrivance. It seemed like such a smart book for such a long time, I guess I never thought Connelly would go for blatant sensationalism instead of a really clever outcome. With his background in news reporting, I thought he'd prefer a well told story to tabloid dreck. So, even though I enjoyed the writing and the pace, the ending was a real disappointment. That said, I may actually try him again someday. Just not someday soon.Oh, and just as an aside, I think of this as a modern story, but because it was written in the late nineties, there were some technological references that came off as archaic to a modern reader. I was pulled out of the story several times when it referenced scenarios that would not have happened in a modern setting merely because the characters lacked cell phones or easy computer access (detectives having to rely on ""pay phones"" and ""pagers,"" people faxing things instead of sending them electronically, the plotline that hinged on ""newfangled digital cameras,"" so common now. I kept thinking to myself that the story played like something from the 1970's instead of something recent. That's not Connelly's fault, of course, but for some reason, it was really a strange distraction. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 03, 2012","Jan 06, 2012","Sep 12, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1489071.The_Poet

Like, for instance, what exactly is it that makes us human, what are our responsibilities as a species, and does the soul exist? You know, little things like that. He takes the most urgent and overwhelming philosophical questions ever to face human culture and somehow tackles them effortlessly in a casually worded book of under three hundred pages told entirely from the point of view of a young woman at a 1990's English boarding school. I will not go on and tell you more about the setting, but be assured this is no ordinary woman and this is no ordinary boarding school. But it could be...and that's kind of the point. Despite what you may have heard about the nature of this book, the characters could be any of us, all of us, in fact, and their existential questions are our existential questions, as well. We all have to face the issues these young people face. What constitutes a desirable quality of life and how can we cope with the nature of mortality? What are our obligations to the other beings in our sphere of existence? What does it all mean and why should it matter?Ishiguro never shirks from the difficult questions. He forces us to ponder what being human means: Is it compassion, empathy, the desire to care for someone?Is it being able to create, think in the abstract, find beauty in words or pictures?Is it lust, jealousy, the ability to omit the truth at will?Is it the desire to pursue happiness or the awareness of grief?In stunning parallels with modern culture, (because even though this is set in the very recent past, it is an alternate reality, a slightly different version of those times), Ishiguro spells out for us the way human society has marginalized certain groups in the past and may do so again, how our scientific and technological advances often occur without equal consideration of the ethical concerns, and how humans, as advanced as we may be, still do not have definitive answers to the biggest questions, like who we are, why we are here, and what happens when we no longer exist. These topics, as seen through the eyes of our young heroine, become even more poignant when we encounter Ishiguro's lovely, simplistic prose, within which each line of dialogue is fraught with underlying concerns and each thought becomes layered with multiple meanings. Ishiguro is, after all, the master of the unspoken thought. If you are someone who has ever regretted something in your life, yearned to go back and say the things you left unsaid, dreamed of righting a wrong or taking an old mistake and finding a better outcome for it, Ishiguro knows your inner life; he has thought your thoughts, seen into your soul, and he will wrap his text around your heart and squeeze the very life out of you. The young people in this book are on a linear road much like the one we travel ourselves, and maybe no amount of pondering or speaking up or active pursuit could ever really change the inevitable outcome, but Ishiguro, as he so often does, always leaves us to agonize over that one small ""what if"" that could have made all the difference. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jul 22, 2011","Jul 24, 2011","Jul 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6334.Never_Let_Me_Go

Yes, I think the book had more flaws than strengths. No, I don’t think it deserved to win the Pulitzer Prize (or even a blue ribbon in a local library contest, for that matter). But I’m not angry or outraged or insulted by anything having to do with the book and its material. I’m merely disappointed. I had heard this book chronicled characters involved in the American punk music scene, and that the music and the soul of that era pulsed on every page. I started out at Emerson College in Boston (a school largely devoted to the performing arts) and, although my era was about a generation or two removed from the punk scene, its devotees still lingered on that campus and its influence was still highly revered. People didn’t just know the names of bands like the Cramps or the Nuns or the Stranglers or Black Flag (I still have a crush on Henry Rollins) – they knew the music, the band members, the song lyrics, the history, and the special quirks and influences of all of those bands in rock history. These things mattered to people. They lived and breathed music and often represented the style of a genre through their own music or fashion sense or philosophy. I was lucky enough to see the Cramps perform once and I was blown away by their crazy energy (they were specifically punk rockabilly -or psychobilly - which is quite different from pure punk, but you won’t find that out - or any other details about the real punk scene in this book). I spent days telling people every last detail – the way lead singer Lux Interior’s jacket was so shiny it looked like it was made out of liquid, the way Poison Ivy Rorshach leapt into the crowd while still playing her guitar - (truly, someone could have been killed!). It was all noteworthy. I appreciate that Jennifer Egan attempted to utilize the punk scene as a vehicle for her characters, but I never once got the feeling that she had ever even listened to any of the music or that she was ever there, even in spirit.. She tosses out a lot of band names without any further description of the unique style of the band or what any of it might have meant to the characters (and, believe me, when you are a teen immersed in music, you have favorite bands and favorite songs and specific significance is attached to certain music - these things are very serious to you, very serious indeed). Egan mentions a few items of clothing that were far more indicative of Goth music than punk music, she mentions a famous club here or there or a famous promoter, and really, that’s about it. Hell, anyone could Google that sh**, you know what I mean? There is the fact of the matter without the sense of the matter. It just didn’t ring true. Early in the book she tells us that one of her characters has written a  for Spin magazine. I remember thinking, “I don’t believe this character would even have a subscription to Spin magazine.”And I guess, in essence, that’s my problem with the book as a whole, not just the punk aspect, but all of it, every single aspect. It just doesn’t ring true for me. Not the punk music scene, not Lou the record producer, not the ridiculous subplot involving a genocidal dictator, not the safari in Africa, which could have been written by anybody, with little or no research into Africa required at all (and here, in the Africa chapter, again I feel she missed the mark with her character of Mindy: she tells us this graduate student isn’t reading her Boas or Malinowski when any real Anthropology student knows those are names you learn in first or second year and are not still reading for your graduate work. Again, I felt Egan was just Googling sh** and throwing the names around). It was all kind of slapdash for me. There were so many unnecessary gimmicks and inconsistencies and disturbingly inaccurate chronologies. Many of the characters – in fact, virtually all of the characters - seemed like ideas of people rather than real people to me. And usually one major gimmick or quirk dominated the character and, I feel, cheapened the reality (Bennie’s gold flakes, Sasha’s kleptomania, La Doll’s trays of oil – (which really bothered me, by the way, because it never would have happened; she may have designed the trays but she wouldn’t have installed them and whoever did would have known about weight distribution and the way to hang them properly – it would have been a lighting technician or other professional, so here I feel Egan took a concept she thought was cool and trippy and forced it into the book as a gimmick), Scotty’s big fish (and please tell me why a character who is clearly poor and virtually homeless and fishing in a dingy river every morning with seedy characters is buying multiple orders of takeout every night and can somehow afford to regularly dry clean clothes that are already clean?) – oh, and the scene of Sasha’s boyfriend’s inexplicable naked swim in the Hudson with Rob, which seemed more forced to me than almost any other scene, except perhaps the one where Jules is released from prison after attacking a celebrity, and despite his criminal record and dark habits, his highly status-conscious sister who is trying desperately to fit into a snobby community immediately offers to let him stay with her and her family, even though they don’t get along that well and he watches pornography in front of their daughter. Really? Just ridiculous. At the end of the book, Egan even lapsed into some futuristic scenario, despite the fact that the timeframe seemed to be only a few years from right now. Yes, things are moving quickly, but that quickly? Reading this book made me roll my eyes so many times, I felt like a slot machine.People who know my reading habits know that I don’t mind absurdity. A novel can have all kinds of crazy, atrocious, outlandish, highly improbable things going on. That’s fine with me. Just make me believe it. Just make those characters real for me, and I am all in, headfirst. But don’t lead me by the nose through a second year writing workshop full of smoke and mirrors and expect me to marvel at your shell game. No one likes being taken. Some of the Pulitzer board members said they had chosen this novel for the inventive writing techniques it used – its structure as a series of short stories rather than a linear narrative, its use of different characters narrating each chapter, oh – and, particularly, the now famous “PowerPoint chapter.” All of this would have been fine with me, too, if it had possessed some authenticity. Did anyone else notice that every character sounded the same, each one spoke in the same voice, utilized the same clipped delivery, adopted the same minimalist approach to linguistics? If you want a different character to narrate each chapter, that’s great, just give me some different characters. If you want to make each chapter a short story, that’s super, just let each story be something that stands on its own, that makes for a compelling or believable vignette on its own merits. And if you want a chapter written entirely in PowerPoint slides, well, that’s just …well… that’s…honestly, that’s crap. Don’t do it, just don’t. Besides, in that chapter, a twelve year-old is supposedly creating the slides, and yet they were alternately both too babyish at times and far too mature at others. I had many other concerns with that chapter – and all of the others, for that matter – but you get my point, you get where I’m going. I could so easily get lost in semiotics and keep griping about the details forever. When what I really mean to say is, “Jennifer Egan, I had such hopes. I was really looking forward to reading your book, and I’m sorry to say I was extremely disappointed. But hey, you won the Pulitzer, so congratulations on that.”...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Jul 19, 2011","Apr 19, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7331435-a-visit-from-the-goon-squad

Life has settled into a dull numbing of that trauma, and our characters are doing little more than sleepwalking through life in the Victor’s Village, not sure what the future will hold for them. Ah, if only we could tell them about the sh**storm that will soon await them, but that’s a ride we all have to share - and what a ride it is! I thought nothing could compare to the captivating breathlessness of the first book’s brutal and surprising Hunger Games, but “Catching Fire” rivals the dynamic quality of that book and adds several new and fascinating characters, none of whom detract from - nor needlessly divert attention away from -the book’s core group of now-beloved ensemble members and the central themes that elevate this story from “young adult fantasy” to “universal imperative.” (Sure, I’m given to overstatement; I like to think of it as ""part of my charm."")I could go on and on about the cleverly devised plot, the seamlessly interwoven elements (action, romance, pathos, grief, responsibility, survival, compassion, greed), the minimalist perfection of the language – all things present in the original book, as well – but what set “Catching Fire” apart from the first book for me was that its story spoke more intently to the political crises that inevitably arise from a culture of cruelty. The implications for our own global society are obvious and cannot be ignored. Rebellion is brewing in Panem, thanks to the outcome of the first book, and its tendrils are going to reach every aspect of our story and every single one of our characters. We know this long before it ever happens. Due to this foreshadowing, the tension involved in the premise is both squirm-inducing and necessary - as well as being wrought with the whims of the powerful, (much as they often are in modern society). Let’s just say, I grew to care about these characters quite a bit in the first book. When I sat down to start reading this sequel, I got a few pages in and realized I had missed them; I was, in fact, thrilled to be reunited with them. I had also missed the author’s clear voice and steady guidance and was glad to have her talking to me again. Katniss, Gale, Peeta, Prim, Cinna, even Haymitch – I felt like these were old buddies of mine - and the reunion was sweet – until it occurred to me that it was time to get very, very worried about them all. Yet again. What Collins puts these folks through is pure torture, and somehow we love her for it. That alone speaks to her skill as an exceptional storyteller.I now know from the s of the many adults on this site who love this series, as well as from the many young adults I know who have read the books that this story transcends age and gender. Boys and girls, men and women, all adore the books equally and find something of worth in them. I find that remarkable in and of itself. Brutal and dark as the themes are, I still find myself anticipating the day I will be able to give the books to my now 8-year old nephew, knowing he will find them as fascinating as I once did. And then, on to his little brother when he is old enough to read them. On a side-note: Perhaps having been raised as a girl in an American culture given to gender-typing triggered some sort of latent indoctrination cues that forced me to care more about the romantic element in this story than I probably should have...but seriously, has any young woman in literary history ever had a better choice of two young suitors than Katniss Everdeen does? Damn – even I couldn’t decide between Gale and Peeta! But, I have to say, I really like Suzanne Collins for making sure that our heroine isn’t wasting her time trying to make that decision. Katniss really doesn’t want much to do with it all. Her goals are far more lofty, more noble, and more survival- and family-oriented than those of a silly lovestruck stereotype. Katniss doesn’t want to get married. She wants to save her family, her district, and maybe – if she’s lucky – save the world. A decidedly better role model for the generations of young people who will now (hopefully) grow up reading about her than perhaps the female role models I grew up emulating. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Oct 30, 2011","Apr 14, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6148028-catching-fire

It's a five star book. No, I fully admit ""The Hunger Games"" is not ""The Sound and the Fury"" or ""Ulysses,"" or Ellison's ""Invisible Man."" Held against those books, maybe I give it four stars, but, as it is technically classified as a YA novel, and since it deserves to stand alone, on its own unique merits, it could just as easily get ten stars. It really is that good. Besides, by today's standards, a book like ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" often found near the top of critics' lists of the best books ever written, would probably be classified as a YA novel and shelved in that section of the bookstore. Telling a story through the eyes of a young protagonist should not mark a book as less relevant to an adult audience. And deceptively simple (if beautifully cadenced) language, should not make a book seem less inherently complex in its message. Many critically-acclaimed books are wrapped in layers of unnecessary allusions and forced complexities that add little to the story itself other than to demonstrate to the reader how seemingly erudite the author is. This book is not about posturing. Its power lies in the shared mythology of human culture, the imagery of the collective unconscious, whether it is stated outright or not. This tale of sixteen year-old Katniss Everdeen, growing up in the poverty-stricken coal-mining district of the former North American continent (now called Panem), has every single element one could hope for in a great book: compelling characters, imaginative settings, social commentary, political subtext, conflict, danger, poignancy, parallels to modern culture and society, archetypes (even a few classic heroes and villains, but more often, subtle variations of each), memorable vignettes, even some humor and romance. The writing is deceptively simple yet expounds brilliantly on a number of complex ideas, particularly in its exploration of systematic cruelty and the value of human life. After all, the crux of the book is that teenagers are being forced to fight to the death for the glory of the state and the entertainment of the masses. That could never happen here...right? In our current global culture, where wars are being fought on many fronts, public uprisings are occurring around the world, dissidents are tortured in tyrannical regimes, and human cruelty has become so common it barely registers a response anymore, the world of Katniss Everdeen does not seem all that improbable. In America, our top-rated television shows tend to be reality-based competitions, pitting people against each other in sometimes humiliating, even cruelly-conceived tasks that generally result in eliminations of the weaker players. Heroes and villains emerge from these competitions, largely due to the way the shows are edited and the ratings that certain contestants bring in. In Panem, in the arena for the Hunger Games, where 24 teens face off in a Survivor-like competition to the death, the same heroes and villains emerge, the government controls the edit, and a player's elimination is permanent. I particularly found it interesting that in the Hunger Games, as in modern culture, a player's popularity with the masses dictated the amount of sponsorship he or she would get. Money and endorsements follow the victors. At one point during the book, I started to wonder, ""Would a government really be so cruel? And would people really let this happen to their children without finding a way to resist?"" And then a series of images flew through my head. Images of people living under Saddam Hussein or Qaddafi or any of the cruel dictators throughout history who have killed and tortured dissidents, abused the masses on a whim, threatened the families of those who spoke out, and ruled through fear. I thought of the countless teens who have marched off to war at the behest of their governments, their families often resigned to the course of events or cheering with pride. I thought of the many children in poor countries, fighting for a crust of bread, while the small percentage of the rich feast in their hillside homes. It was then that I realized ""The Hunger Games"" is barely even a futuristic fantasy. It's real. It's now. Images of the hunt are prevalent in this book, from the beginning. Katniss and her friend Gale are poachers in their district, skilled at finding food in a place that has none. Katniss is a whiz with a bow and arrow, and she and her family are also herbal healers, able to make remedies from local herbs and nurse the sick back to health. The mythology of these skills looms large in the book, evoking comparisons of Katniss to Artemis or the Amazonian women of lore. Her fellow district competitor, Peeta, is the baker's son, and provides Katniss throughout the story with the sustenance of life and the hominess of comfort, much like the image of the bread that he bakes. Katniss is the wild, untamed food-providing huntress; Peeta the domestic, familial constant, a foundation of loyalty and love. We come to appreciate the complementary nature of their survival in a way that emphasizes that even the most self-sufficient people benefit from human connection. And, at its core, that's what ""The Hunger Games"" is really all about. Human connection. Katniss has entered the games having volunteered to take the place of a beloved sister, knowing she will most likely die in the process. Why make that altruistic sacrifice? Peeta risks his life to save Katniss on several occasions, because he is in love with her. What makes another's life more valuable than our own? Katniss and another contestant, Rue, form a bond and risk all, knowing one of them will not make it to the end of the competition. Why offer up your vulnerability, risk human emotion, all the while knowing it will end in tragedy? These are the concepts our contestants grapple with in the course of the games, and the ones we often grapple with, here in our own games. After all, we make human connections, we love, we bond, we desire freedom and dignity in our lives, just like Katniss and Peeta - and just like the two of them, facing off in the arena, we also know that no one is getting out of this alive. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 10, 2011","Apr 14, 2011","Apr 10, 2011",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/7723926-the-hunger-games

Her cerebral, edgy, and original humor has done for women in the field of comedy what, say, Hillary Clinton (no, not Sarah Palin, ironic as that may have been) has done for women in politics. She has made everyone re-examine their preconceptions and helped people to accept women in roles once reserved for men. As head writer of Saturday Night Live, she helped bring more women to the forefront of sketch comedy and fought against the idea that ""women aren't funny."" Luckily, she had some powerful men supporting in her in this effort (Lorne Michaels, most prominently) and some really funny women for whom to write (Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Molly Shannon, for instance) or who knows how all of that groundbreaking idealism might have gone. The journey from teen summer theater to the Groundlings to SNL to ""30 Rock"" and a film career is wonderfully engaging and filled with her trademark clever humor and absurd self-deprecation, but I enjoyed this book the most when it offered some real insights into how the television business really works and the types of obstacles facing creative artists every day, particularly female comedians who still face an old-boy network that refuses to validate or finance their efforts. One of the more striking observations in the book comes near the end when Fey has reached the height of her success to date and is agonizing over whether or not to have a seocnd child. The time this would take from her career, she muses, would leave her ""unemployable and labeled crazy in five years anyway."" She goes on to state a harsh reality: ""Let me clarify. I have observed that women, at least in comedy, are labeled ""crazy"" after a certain age...I've known older men in comedy who can barely feed and clean themselves, and they still work. The women, though, they're all ""crazy."" I have a suspicion - and hear me out, 'cause this is a rough one - I have a suspicion that the definition of ""crazy"" in show business is a woman who keeps talking even after no one wants to fu** her anymore."" Yup. She said it. One of the many times I silently cheered ""Good for you, Tina!"" while reading this book. There are a lot of funny stories, laugh out loud moments, and touching little vignettes in Tina Fey's book ""Bossypants."" It's a really likable, well-intentioned, and smart little read. But every now and then she gives you an insight like the one above and reminds everyone why it's so important that she's here. That's why I love Tina Fey. (Three and a half stars, btw - which I think is a really good rating for a book I definitely recommend to Fey's fans, people who want to get into the business, and young women everywhere.

Through a little trickery, I managed to take World History twice just to avoid it.American History was not my favorite subject in school, I admit it. Through a little trickery, I managed to take World History twice just to avoid it. I really know embarrassingly little about Teddy Roosevelt – at least I did before reading Candice Millard’s engaging book “The River of Doubt”- but nevertheless, I always thought he was someone I would have loved to have met. Fearless, charismatic, outdoorsy, eccentric, and adventurous, it seemed there was nothing Teddy couldn’t do or didn’t at least want to try. He seemed to me a slightly crazy, daringly rugged “man for all seasons” with a personality as big as his frame. I made this observation based on very little actual information, mind you, and yet Millard has validated all of the preconceptions I originally had about the man, and perhaps even augmented them. There really wasn’t much that Teddy didn’t – or couldn’t - do. In addition to being a cowboy in the Dakotas, the NYC police commissioner, the Secretary of the Navy, the leader of the Rough Riders, the Medal of Honor winner, the driving force behind the Panama Canal, the founder of the Progressive Party, and an avid naturalist and conservationist given to rugged adventures in Africa and other locales, he also just happened to be the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the first American winner of any of the Nobel prizes awarded in any category. Oh and, not to leave it out...President of the United States. But even that is just a small series of highlights from a life that incorporated many other interesting asides. Any author who writes a boring book about Teddy Roosevelt has no one to blame but him or her self. Luckily, Millard doesn’t have to worry about that. “The River of Doubt” really only focuses on one major event in Roosevelt’s life, an Amazon adventure that occurred when he was fifty-five years old and had recently been defeated when his Progressive Party took on Woodrow Wilson and William Howard Taft in the presidential election. (Teddy actually beat Taft and is still the only third party candidate to come in second in an election.) Nonetheless, Roosevelt did not have a disposition suited to a leisurely retirement, and he was lured by an invitation to travel to South America to collect Amazonian species with naturalists hand-picked by the American Natural History Museum. With his son Kermit already working in Argentina, and his friend Father Zahm eager to put together the specifics of the expedition, Roosevelt took to the idea with gusto. He was supposed to travel a route that had already been charted and was well-known to South American explorers (though not without its perils – this is the Amazon, after all), but somehow, inexplicably, despite being ill-prepared and possibly ill-suited to the rigorous demands of the challenge, he was talked into charting a murky, untraveled enigma of a river in the middle of Brazil that was thought to be a thousand-mile tributary of the Amazon. El Rio Duvida.The River of Doubt.An apt name for a river that may or may not exist in its expected form, even according to the man who discovered it, Brazil’s most famous explorer, Candido Rondon - the same man who would be making the journey with the former President - as his co-commander. At this point in the book, as the journey begins, we have all the elements of a proper adventure story. We have our heroic commanders, Roosevelt and Rondon, we have their hard-working right hand men, Kermit (Roosevelt’s son) and Lyra (Rondon’s able assistant), we have a variety of unique characters: the naturalists Cherrie and Miller, the Arctic explorer Anthony Fiala, the bumbling, self-aggrandizing busybody Father Zahm, an assortment of noble camareras, and the bad apple of the bunch, a hired camarera named Julio Lima, who brought a threatening element of deceit and sociopathy to this already dangerous trek. From here on out, the book read more like a gripping adventure novel than an actual event in history. Anyone who has read “The Lost City of Z” (highly recommended, by the way) or any other accounts of Amazonian exploration, will recognize the unique struggles and perils of that part of the world. A small cut, a minor injury, anywhere else on the globe is often merely an annoyance. In the Amazon, it can mean imminent death.I often watch a cable show called “I Shouldn’t Be Alive,” featuring real people who have found themselves in dire circumstances – out in nature – from which they should not have emerged intact. There is usually an element of extreme bad luck, even an “Apollo 13”–like series of harrowing occurrences that contribute to the ordeals these poor sods endure - and yet somehow they survive. Several of these episodes, as expected, have taken place in the Amazon. I sometimes watch the show and think, “I could have survived out in that desert…or on that mountain…” but I know in my heart, I would never survive the South American jungle. Infection, swarms of insects, parasites, bacteria, and enemies from all parts of the jungle and its waters attracted by blood, by sweat, by commotion, can kill you at any moment. Hostile tribes, venomous snakes, cayman, jaguar, piranha, were all far less worrisome to Roosevelt’s band of explorers than the constant bouts of dysentery, malaria and various other ailments from which the party suffered throughout their journey. Add to that, meager and dwindling food rations that threatened constant starvation and excruciating portages through challenging terrain – or churning rapids - for which they had the wrong transport, tools and supplies, and you have a party that should have ended in complete disaster. Yes, some tragic occurrences took place on the voyage, (Roosevelt very nearly died, for example, and a couple of others did actually perish on the trip), but for the most part, it was an absolute miracle of luck coupled with endurance and teamwork that triumphed in the end. The River of Doubt is called the Rio Roosevelt to this day. The adventure that nearly killed him also cemented Roosevelt’s staggering legacy by making him a man who put a previously uncharted river on the map. In these pages, Roosevelt lives up to his impetuous, ""no holds barred"" persona. And for that reason, some of his decisions seem foolhardy, some of his parenting skills seem rather questionable at times, and his lack of regard for safety is truly troubling. But, he also lived a life unlike any other in history, and that doesn't happen by playing it safe. Millard captures Teddy's spirit for all time in this riveting book set along the banks of The River of Doubt. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jan 07, 2012","Jan 16, 2012","Apr 04, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/78508.The_River_of_Doubt

I had read a couple of real dogs lately and thought this book might be the literary equivalent of a 2011 has not been a stellar book year for me yet. I had read a couple of real dogs lately and thought this book might be the literary equivalent of a ""palette cleanser,"" the way one nibbles a little pickled ginger root in between portions of sushi and wasabi to bring the senses back to a place of moderation. ""The Postmistress"" appeared to have an engaging plot, a setting to which I could relate, and several female characters to whom I might potentially feel a kinship by the end of the book. Yes, I admit it - a chick book, but one with a story decent enough not to make me feel guilty for reading it. That's what I thought, anyway. My first problem with the book was a minor one, but one important enough for me to question the author's lack of attention to detail early on. The setting is meant to be Cape Cod - the furthest town on Cape Cod, in fact, where the town of Provincetown currently sits on the map. Ms. Blake has named her fictional Cape Cod town ""Franklin."" That would be totally cool with me if in fact there were not already a Massachusetts town named ""Franklin,"" and one that is not only not on the Cape, but not even a town any tourist would want to visit for any reason that I can think of. This bothered me, and then bothered me again, even more than usual, as I got deeper into the book and into one of its main characters, a postmistress named Iris James, who is very prim and orderly and makes sure that every piece of mail is properly stamped and addressed and gets to its proper destination. Iris would have known that the town name of ""Franklin"" was already taken and might have let Ms. Blake know that another fictional place name might be in order. Still, I plodded on, determined to ignore this mosquito in my ear and judge the story on its own merits. It started off with great potential. A new town doctor and his young bride have just settled into town, while postmistress Iris James, well past her prime, finds herself being courted by town mechanic, Harry Vale. In the background, World War II is looming. The radio is constantly tuned to reports from London during the bombings, and often the reporter is a woman named Frankie Bard, who works for Edward R. Murrow and is one of the few females working in the industry at the time. These were our main characters, and we knew that somehow their lives were going to intersect, and that part of the story would have to do with a piece of mail that would never be delivered. An intriguing start. Leading to a frustrating middle. And an infuriatingly dull ending. Maybe I'm cranky and being too harsh, but I never cared about these characters at all. Ms. Blake is very good at letting us know where they were standing and what the sky looked like and how many cigarettes they smoked in a day, but I never got a feel for the inner lives of the characters, never felt a connection to them, and thought they all had a nasty habit of misconstruing the most innocent comments in polite conversations, and then bolting out of rooms in a huff. The female reporter, who obviously has been trained in journalism and knows that to make it in the field during this era she has to be tougher than the guys and possibly smarter, is a teary, emotional wreck who gets angry at the drop of a hat, can't seem to make a rational argument, dissolves into tears when she's not busy being indignant and at least twice causes harm to others in the book due to her inane actions. The author wants us to see her as a savvy dame and then writes her as a nincompoop. Similarly, we are set up to care about the young doctor and his waif-like wife and their deep love and destined life together, when almost immediately he has a traumatic mishap that causes him to feel the need to leave his young wife and go to London to help care for people during the height of the bombings. You know, just because. She is, of course, pregnant and he doesn't know it. Why? Oh, you know, just because. And there's an Austrian man in town, who everyone thinks is a German spy but really he's a Jew who has fled Europe and come straight to Franklin for no reason. You know, just because. And the postmistress's lover, Harry Vale, he seems like a normal guy except he spends every waking moment up in a bell-tower staring at the ocean looking for U-boats. You guessed it - just because. Even all this wouldn't be so bad if the book weren't filled with horrendous and ridiculous contrivances that just make you want to slap Sarah Blake's editor and give him or her a good talking to. People die unnecessarily at implausible moments for unthinkable reasons, and it's meant to make us think how transitory and random life really is. Because, make no mistake, as poorly-conceived as the plot is, it still manages to take itself very seriously. Very seriously indeed. It's about World War II, after all. And Murrow. And dead people. And the U.S. Postal System. So by all means, we need to feel something of the heft and patriotism of all this. Well, sure. Of course we do. And in a really well-written book with characters that stir the soul, it always does. Just not in this book. Why? You know. Just because. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 03, 2011","Mar 16, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6903357-the-postmistress

I don't know what they saw that I didn't, but I found this a completely ludicrous, utterly fabricated story told through unlikable, two-dimensional characters. The writing is abominable. Seriously abominable. I spent most of the time wondering how it had even managed to get published, let alone make it into repeated printings, sequels, and - apparently - a film (!). The book purports to teach deep, mysterious lessons of the ""warrior's path,"" and yet I have learned more penetrating lessons watching reruns of ""Kung Fu"" which, in fact, were far better written and more emotionally stirring than this complete dreck.

I’ve been in the Letterman camp since I was twelve years old, and if you’re a late night junkie – like me – you know which camp you’rI’m a Dave girl. I’ve been in the Letterman camp since I was twelve years old, and if you’re a late night junkie – like me – you know which camp you’re in. In truth, I would have liked for Leno to have been more appealing to my sensibilities. He’s from Massachusetts, after all. New Englanders like to root for the home team. We talk about people like Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg as if we know them. And Leno’s gotten a lot of mileage from that blue collar work ethic, the anti-elitist stance – all things that might appeal to me on a visceral level. And yet, when Leno is the vehicle…somehow they don’t. But Dave. Ah, Dave. That edgy, curmudgeonly anti-social iconoclast. I don’t know what it is about him exactly, but from the first time I saw his “little dog and pony” show (as he calls it), I just got him. Jay might deliver solid topical jokes night after night like the modern embodiment of the ghost of Henny Youngman (set-up, punch line; set-up, punch line), but Dave isn’t from that Catskills school of stand-up. At times, his jokes aren’t even jokes as much as strange images that catch his fancy or life’s absurdities that deserve a skewering. If a line doesn’t work, sometimes Dave will just keep repeating it, over and over again, maddeningly so, at times. Sometimes I think he does it for spite - to show a writer how truly bad the line was or to tweak the audience with the fact that they should have found it funny. And sometimes I think he does it just because he knows that if he repeats the line enough times, it will not only suddenly become funny, but it will also become part of the legend. His legend. There’s something just a little bit subversive about Dave. Something a little more obscure and philosophical about his comedy. Which is probably why Jay has beaten him in the ratings for sixteen years. And also why, even according to Bill Carter in “The War for Late Night,” every major player in late night television (from Conan to Jimmy Kimmel to Jimmy Fallon to John Stewart to Stephen Colbert to Jay himself) names Dave as an idol. None of them say the same about Jay. Comedians get Dave. Mainstream America gets Jay.But this story isn’t about Jay and Dave. That’s just the backstory. Dave was the heir apparent to “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.” He had been told it was his; even Johnny had handpicked him for the job. But when the time came for Carson to retire, it turned out that Jay Leno also had designs on the job, the NBC executives had never put anything in writing with Dave, and Johnny was no longer being asked who should succeed him. Through a series of backhanded deals, whipsmart agents, and ruthless machinations by certain players in the fray, the Tonight Show went to Jay, Dave went to CBS, and the first real late night battle of the network stars began. In the backstory, Letterman and Michael Ovitz (I won’t get into details – read Carter’s first book, “The Late Shift” for that) came out as victors and quasi heroes in the story, while Jay and his former manager (the, by all accounts, heinous Helen Kushnick) came out as Machiavellian manipulators. It’s not that simple, of course, but that’s how it played, until things settled down and went back to normal and stayed that way for over a decade. Until one dark day in 2004 when a man named Jeff Zucker woke up one morning with a plan that he thought was brilliant – never a good thing when the plan is hatched by an NBC executive.Conan O’Brien had done well with David Letterman’s old late night show, having been plucked from near obscurity by Lorne Michaels to rise in the ratings to a place where he was carrying the youthful demographic NBC so eagerly sought. But his rising fame and popularity among America’s college campuses made him attractive to other networks as well, and NBC knew that ABC and the cable channels were about to come calling. How could they keep Conan, (and they desperately wanted to keep him), when they were paying him a pittance and FOX alone could offer him many millions more without blinking? Oh wait, oh, oh, I know. Offer him “The Tonight Show.” “What?” you might ask, “The Tonight Show? Doesn’t that show already have a really successful host in place?” Yes. Yes it does. But even good things can’t last forever. At least that’s the way Jeff Zucker saw it the day he decided to go to Jay Leno’s dressing room and tell his biggest star, his biggest money-maker and possibly his biggest bargain (Jay was making less than half of David Letterman’s salary at the time) that he would renew Jay’s contract, pick up his option as usual, and never do so again. Five years from now, Jay would hand the show over to Conan O’Brien. The end. As one might expect, there was some shock on Jay’s part and some hemming and hawing. Someone else might have taken the opportunity to negotiate, make a few demands, remind the brass that he was their biggest star and he’d be damned if he’d be told what to do that way. He might have had his agent come in and read them the riot act. But Jay didn’t have an agent. He didn’t like conflict, he didn’t like to think about money. All he wanted in life was to “tell jokes at 11:35” and tinker with his cars. So, in the end, Jay meekly said, “Okay, if that’s what you want,” and he swallowed his anger and signed his contract. While, meanwhile, in NYC, the young Conan O’Brien had similarly agreed to keep working for five years of peanuts and give up a possible 20 million dollar offer to get the one thing he had always dreamed of – “The Tonight Show.” In five years, that is. Well five years passed like the blink of an eye. Jay was still winning the ratings, Conan was still big with the young people, and NBC started to wonder if this had been such a good idea after all. To get out of the deal they would have had to pay Conan 45 million dollars (Conan did have an agent). But Jay was starting to hint that he might go over to ABC (Jimmy Kimmel was already in place there, and in fact, when Jimmy had first gotten the gig and was asked what he planned to do with his show, he remarked that he “wanted to do the comedy version of The Tonight Show”). Well, as we know, Jay has never been averse to pushing someone out of a gig, so NBC got scared again, and needed a brilliant solution. Well, who better to come up with a brilliant plan than old Jeff Zucker, the rocket scientist who had forced Jay’s early retirement in the first place? He offered Jay Sundays. Saturdays. Specials. A weekly show. An 8:00 PM slot every night. Jay wanted to work but he was a late night creature and none of that sounded good to him. So Zucker reached into his back pocket and came up with a plan to cancel every ten o’clock drama on NBC and put Jay there every night. He would still have his beloved monologue, have his comedy bits, have his guests, work in the same lot. It would be just like what he did now, only earlier, and Conan would still have to follow him. Jay was a creature of habit and this appealed to him. No one thought about the fact that it might just destroy two shows at once, and make NBC look like a network run by pinheads. (No one except David Letterman, that is. No one had a better time with the ensuing mayhem than he did.) We all now know that Jay’s show was abysmal, it destroyed that time slot, it hurt the lead-in for Conan and angered some powerful affiliates. So, the call came down to cancel Jay. It was the obvious move. Until NBC realized they had signed what’s known as a “pay and play” deal with Jay. Unheard of in television, it gave Jay the power to say “Hell no, you can’t cancel me, because you are contractually bound to both pay me and keep me on the air (he had learned from his forced retirement to make the next contract count). So Zucker and his minions now hatched the plan to bring Jay back to 11:35, push Conan back a half hour, and solve their problem. Conan had only been host of “The Tonight Show” for less than seven months and he was about to be told he was now going to host a diluted version of the show, at a time slot that wasn’t even “Tonight” anymore, so that he could try to follow a popular well-known host who was going to steal his prime monologue spot. Super. People have their own opinions, but for my money, I totally respect the fact that Conan chose not to accept this preposterous insult of a deal, and instead wrote the manifesto that would brilliantly state his case while taking the high road and transforming himself from that “kooky redheaded guy” to famous icon of the pop culture. (I highly recommend that everyone who hasn’t read it, read Conan’s “People of Earth” manifesto that he released to NBC in response to their demands.) The youth of America sprung into action at this news. Team Coco became an internet sensation, and Conan was met with cheering throngs for weeks. His ratings shot through the roof those last few weeks, and Jay was once again vilified as a man who didn’t know when to keep his mitts off a job that wasn’t really his (a label he had tried so hard to remove over the past decade and a half). In the book, Carter quotes people like Seinfeld (a longtime friend of Leno’s) and Lorne Michaels (an NBC mainstay) to say that no one should have taken it personally. It was just business after all. “The Tonight Show” isn’t an institution. It’s just a show! Being host isn’t an entitlement. It’s just a job! Face it – like everything else in life, it’s just about the money. I understand that two guys who have a combined history with NBC of about sixty years pretty much have to say that. Particularly to a journalist who plans on quoting them. And maybe they really have seen too much corporate jockeying, and life has become too insular to see it through the eyes of the audience anymore. But I think you would have to be either naïve, coldhearted – or both – to tell the same American public you’ve been feeding the history of “The Tonight Show” to for all those years that their memories didn’t count for anything, the loyalty you tried to instill in them was a lie. Letterman certainly saw the show as an institution, a safe haven inhabited by a man he idolized. Conan yearned to host the show he had watched as a child with his father, even if it meant waiting for years and taking a pay cut. Countless Americans had memories of the show. Entertainment is about money and ratings for the executives, but for the people sitting at home it’s about what adds to our lives and who we choose to enter our homes on a regular basis. I, for one, will be crying my eyes out the day David Letterman turns in his final show. Don’t tell me it wasn’t an institution. Americans are easily led and we can be spoonfed quite a bit of crap – but once we get attached to it, don’t try to tell us we were stupid to care. Maybe that’s why Jeff Zucker is no longer with NBC. And why David Letterman is currently beating Jay Leno in the ratings. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Dec 28, 2011","Jan 24, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8201411-the-war-for-late-night

William Maxwell's spare, near-perfect prose is the retelling of just such a memory, a memory from childhood that still haunts the now-elderly narrator, the way regrets from one's childhood, seen through the lens of adulthood, can follow one forever and never lead to a satisfactory resolution. Maxwell transports the reader to 1920's Illinois, and a scandal that rocked the sleepy farming community there, changing forever the lives of the families involved and severing the bond between two young friends impacted by the events. The narrator is one of those young boys, now old, looking back on the era and the murder that took his young friend away from him. The power of this book is in its ability to paint a picture of the class structure of the Midwest, the domestic structure of that system, the inner lives of two farming families, and the sad spiral of events that lead to infidelity, broken homes and murder - all while at its heart being the story of two young boys and the simple joys of childhood they shared before the world collapsed beneath them. The book itself is short, nearly a novella, and its colloquial feel and simply stated observations work to great effect here. Like the heartland it purports to chronicle, the language mirrors the characters and the times, but also stuns with its honesty and wisdom, while never shying away from the difficult themes it addresses.The narrator makes clear his regret for a small indiscretion now writ large across his past, a slight against his friend Cletus that was meant as a kindness, but in hindsight is seen as a devastating mistake (“I had inadvertently walked through a door that I shouldn’t have gone through and couldn’t get back to the place I hadn’t meant to leave.”), but we find that each character in the story harbors regrets, some far greater than those of the narrator, who generously observes the foibles of his characters and concludes ""so often people have no choice."" We witness how one series of events can be experienced and rationalized and justified in so many different ways by the various participants and observers, yet we must come to our own conclusions about guilt and choice while Maxwell never lets us lose sight of the crux of it all - the loss - the loss of innocence, the loss of hope, the loss of friends and family, the loss of the small familiar routines that make life ""happy.There is not an unnecessary word or description in the book, but there are two sequences that stick with me the most. One takes place early in the book, when the narrator and his friend Cletus are playing on the beams of an unfinished home renovation. They are enjoying the excitement and camaraderie of the setting without a thought that one false move could change the world forever, their homes beset by unfinished business and unseen dangers. The second scene is near the end of the book when young Cletus is going through an ordinary day, and we see all the small joys that are about to be taken away from him - the windy walk home through farm country, the rusty bike, the fur of the dog he loves, the stone pot on the stove, the warm bread - and, perhaps even more than the shocking events that will succeed this vignette, this poignant description is the truly heartbreaking one. A young unsuspecting life about to be upended.  Maxwell's writing is a joy to read, but also makes one wistful in that it dredges up both the sweet specificity of past joys and the small regrets that never go away. In the end, the narrator sums up the longing and regret of the past by simply observing, ""Between the way things used to be and the way they were now was a void that couldn't be crossed.""...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 24, 2020","Apr 30, 2020","Oct 21, 2010",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/12273647-so-long-see-you-tomorrow

But howSo, Howard Jacobson was sitting down one night thinking that he would like to write a book about what it means to be Jewish in modern society. But how could he do it in the form of a novel? Well, he could create characters that represent different aspects of the Jewish experience. One could be an affluent Jewish scholar, a philosopher and writer whose viewpoints are highly regarded and whose books are even popular with the masses. Another could be an elderly man, the seat of Jewish heritage and culture, representing religious ideals and the crush of history. And yet another could be a Gentile who is friends with the other two men and who desperately wants to belong to their “clique,” who wants to know from an outsider’s perspective what it would feel like to be a Jew. The three of them could have vastly different relationships to the issues affecting the global Jewish community, and they could debate these issues over a series of dinners and meetings together. There, all the ancient and modern history could be examined, all the stereotypes exposed, all the atrocities digested, and all the labels acknowledged. It wasn’t a bad idea. It also helps that Jacobson writes fluid prose that is often very clever, and occasionally, laugh out loud funny. He also has a pretty decent grasp of sadness. He can write passages that examine the faithless progression of the dying, the utter loneliness of widowerhood, the lifeless void at the center of adultery, and the emotionless interactions of family members who don’t really like each other. Mr. Jacobson definitely knows how to put together an effective sentence. And I think that may be the only reason I was able to finish the book. The writing is superb. The story, less so. Julian Treslove, the main character of the book, is about as wishy-washy, uncommitted to anything and listless a character as you may ever encounter in a novel. His ability to be chameleon to any endeavor that piques his interest is Zelig-like. He has left his job at the BBC to become a celebrity lookalike hired out to parties. No one is sure which celebrity he is supposed to look like, but he looks like all things to all people, so it hardly matters. His life changes when he is mugged on the street by a woman, who he believes calls him a Jew while she is mugging him. This leads him through a life-altering phase within which he decides he really is a Jew and undertakes to fully become one. He gives up the waifish, bird-boned WASPs he so often dates, and takes up with a substantial Jewish woman named Hephzibah. Hephzibah is possibly the only likable, grounded, decent person in the whole book, so naturally we know Julian will most likely find a way to f*** up this relationship. No matter. If only this relationship, or any of the relationships in the book, had mattered as much to Julian – or to Howard Jacobson – as they did to the reader, this would have been a compelling story. What is it then, if not a compelling story? To be honest, I found it to be an ongoing diatribe about the plight of the Jew in modern society, whichis fine but not what I signed on for. Had it been couched in the elements of a decent plot, rather than using characters to represent ideological paradigms, I would have accepted the premise and come to my own conclusions, but there are issues even with the diatribe, once you accept that that’s what it is and stop waiting for the story to happen. Because the story never does actually happen. The paradigms just sort of run their course. As a non-Jew reading the book, I often felt my reactions or understanding of the issues may have been lacking. I am sensitive to the plight of any persecuted group, Jewish or otherwise. I watch the news – I have a basic understanding of the issues in Gaza, of Zionism, of neo-Nazism, of the Holocaust-deniers, of modern prejudice in all its forms. Jacobson thinks not. He means to educate me about my lack of knowledge in these areas, and I appreciate it, but he both makes and contradicts his point in the process. He asserts, and possibly rightly so, that everyone should understand, and be passionate about, these issues affecting the Jewish community - and then basically follows up with the notion...but you have to be Jewish to really understand it. Always a catch. Which is something Julian also struggles with while trying to fit into his adopted Jewish culture. He never quite gets it right. He isn’t clever enough, doesn’t have the Jews’ natural comedic timing and delivery when making jokes, doesn’t have the Jewish inherent knowledge of music, finance, theater production. Ah yes, another issue I had with the novel. Jacobson gets to use all the stereotypes. I’m sure he’s doing it consciously, but should he? Doesn’t he both make and contradict another point by doing so? And what’s more, if a non-Jewish person had written this book, can you imagine the fall-out? The only times Jacobson takes a break from his all-Jewish extravaganza is when he is busy being misogynistic. Like so many highly acclaimed male writers, Jacobson has issues with women. Big ones. They are whores, they are shrews, they are mothers or needy birds. The ones men are married to force them to seek out others to sleep with, because it’s just what men do, right? How dare they speak their minds? We’ll show them who’s boss with a little sexual submission. Ah, Norman Mailer, you are not forgotten. Next to Hephzibah, the two main female characters in the book are dead. It is so much easier for the men they left to care for them now that they are dead. The men have the heft of their loss to endear them to other women, and the revisionist memories that make them better husbands than they actually were. A dead wife is so useful. Despite all of this, and miraculously, I actually really like the way Jacobson writes. If he had taken his themes and even his agenda and utilized them in a well-constructed story where something actually happens and the characters are real people as opposed to conceptual vessels, I would have found the reading a delight as opposed to a pretentious romp through purely intellectual terrain. These characters could have mattered to me as much as the concepts did. And they could have mattered to a wider audience, as well, which is what Jacobson might have ironically missed in his need to educate rather than illuminate. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 12, 2011","Mar 15, 2011","Oct 13, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8664368-the-finkler-question

I was wandering about, being jostled by weekend shoppers who pushed past I met ""Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter"" on a busy Saturday at Barnes & Noble. I was wandering about, being jostled by weekend shoppers who pushed past me to pluck bright new bestsellers from shiny displays, when a blast of air from the door and a new wave of customers pressed against me, sweeping me back into the belly of the store, where I hastily sought shelter in a nook of the fiction section devoted to mysteries. Tired, disheveled, uninspired by any of the formulaic-looking new arrivals or cynical-sounding memoirs, I looked around aimlessly for a reason to stay. And there it was, silently dominating an end kiosk. It beckoned to me with its dark yet attractive cover art, its mysterious title, its inexorable pull. Shyly, I sidled up to it, exchanged a few meaningful glances, boldly fingered the edges. It seemed so unlike the other offerings, a little reserved, maybe, but also a little dangerous. There was just something different about this one. I suppose the rest is an old story: a few scattered phrases, an impulsive decision, and my new infatuation and I left the store together, headed for my place. For awhile the cover was enough, just looking at that darkly beautiful facade filled me with anticipation. And when I finally started in, tentatively pulling apart those first pages, getting a taste of this unexpected new style, I was drawn in, too curious and easily led. I was pretty sure I liked it. Pretty sure. No, maybe it wasn’t love, but that could come in time, couldn’t it? So I threw caution to the wind and dove in, headfirst. Too fast. I know that now. And “Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter,” sensing I was committing too soon, decided to slow things down. Way down. Instead of moving things along, CL spent long days telling me things I didn’t need to know in tediously minute detail. He conjured up random memories that would show him in an unattractive light, as if to dissuade me from falling for him. Sometimes he would play on my sympathies, bringing me back to him, wrapped in my protectiveness for the injustices of which he spoke, brimming with compassion for the misfits treated cruelly by the world, the people he knew, the people whose stories he shared with me. But often I was just frustrated with his idleness, his acceptance of memories so fraught with miscarriage and ignorance. Why don’t the people he writes about just tell the truth, stick up for themselves, push back a little, grow a conscience? And then he would let me know that things are different in that part of the world, where he comes from, the part of Mississippi where things don’t change and people don’t, either. And I would come back, briefly captivated by vivid pictures of the South and the slower pace of its inhabitants. We went on that way for awhile, dancing around the issue. I would spend a little time with him every other night or so and it wasn’t unpleasant, but it also wasn’t exciting. I often initiated contact begrudgingly, out of obligation, only to find that parting later was still difficult. I guess I wanted to love CL more than I did, wanted to find the promise of that first meeting, and never quite got there. Eventually, even his dialogue started to sound unnatural, a little exaggerated, a little derivative, as if he were saying what he thought he should, instead of what he really meant. I wasn’t born yesterday; I knew he was just feeding me a line. Hadn’t Stephen King used the same conversation in one of his books? Hadn’t Harlan Ellison said something similar in a story? I knew he was just imitating at times, I knew he didn’t mean it. So it ended, the two of us drifting apart, a pat ending that I saw coming a mile away. There were no surprises. No true revelations. I don’t regret the time I spent with CL. His story was interesting enough and some of it I will always remember. He didn’t live up to the hype, but we parted amicably with no harm done. Now it’s on to the next dark stranger. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Oct 10, 2010","Oct 22, 2010","Oct 10, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7948230-crooked-letter-crooked-letter

Crime and mystery novels, in particular, rarely deviate from the formula, and even the best of these contain an expected format, something the reader climbs into willingly, like a familiar old sweater. Well, Larsson obviously didn't get the memo. Or he got it and totally disregarded it, which I find both odd and strangely gratifying. Book One (Dragon Tattoo) was a unique and intricate murder mystery wound around a missing persons case and a separate financial scandal. It was haunting and desolate and full of unexpected twists and turns. Book Two (Played with Fire) was a fast-moving action thriller, a real cops-and-bad-guys story with beat-downs and shoot 'em ups and a good deal of suspension of disbelief. Book Three (Hornet's Nest) is unlike either of these. It is a sophisticated spy thriller ending in a classic courtroom drama, populated along the way with media intrigue and political overtones. There are fans of the series who wanted a more action-packed end to the saga and have bemoaned the fact that this third story seemed to be ""all talk."" While I understand the criticism and completely sympathize with the desire for things to go ""out with a bang,"" be assured the story doesn't go ""out with a whimper"" either. And the ""all talk"" is pretty riveting talk at that - the tale of a super-secret division within Sweden's spy organization that operated outside the boundaries of its mother organization and was embroiled in all sorts of Cold War espionage. Not your average parlor talk. Add to that two subplots involving computer crime and hacking and a nice lead-up of evidence compilation to simulataneously utilize in the public arena and in the private courtroom drama, and you have a satisfying end to the series, one that gives you a sense of what lies ahead for the main characters, particularly our beloved Lisbeth Salander. Admuittedly, I am a self-confessed nerd who loves the paper trail and the research, the psychology and the analysis of a situation as much as the action, so a plot based in thought and verbal cues doesn't bother me at all. But at its heart, this is really a story about injustice and persecution. The fate of one small heroine rests upon the seemingly impossible task of defeating wealthy, powerful men in high places and entire organizations bent on self-serving interests. [And please tell me Teleborian is not the most sinister twist in a suit since Thomas Harris's Dr. Frederick Chilton in ""The Silence of the Lambs.""] So, anyone who loves a story in which the reluctant heroes cleverly outwit the powers who persecute the powerless, a story that exacts just revenge on those who would try to intimidate the innocent, or a story that exposes misogyny and injustice in our society and tackles it with thoughtful plot devices, will find this final installment a fitting end to Larsson's literary tour de force. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 30, 2010","Sep 25, 2010","Aug 30, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6892870-the-girl-who-kicked-the-hornet-s-nest

If you haven't read even one of his books, you really ought to do so right away. Secondly, ""A Walk iFirst of all, Bill Bryson is a phenomenal writer. If you haven't read even one of his books, you really ought to do so right away. Secondly, ""A Walk in the Woods"" is probably his best known book, and rightly so, because it is a small gem of a book, detailing Bryson's attempt to walk the length of the Appalachian Trail with his comically overwhelmed friend, Katz. These two men, who have very little knowledge of serious hiking between them, and are really prime candidates for death by heart attack, sunstroke, wild animals, starvation or hypothermia, unimaginably decide to take on ""the granddaddy of all hiking trails"" for the sake of a Bryson book deal. As you can imagine, the two men find themselves in all kinds of taxing predicaments from the moment they set foot on the trail in Georgia until they reconnect with it later in the wilds of Maine, somehow managing to survive each new ordeal while subsisting almost entirely on boiled noodles and candy bars. The antics of Katz alone are well worth the price of admission; the man is a real character and Bryson's musings on him are filled with the wry, avuncular charm and humor we have come to know from his many books. In fact, three quarters of the way through the book, when Katz is no longer a part of the story for a short while, the narrative really suffers from his omission. His energy, equal parts surliness and likable nihilism, have really engaged the reader by then, and I, for one, was very happy to see him return near the book's final chapters. But beyond just the day to day travelogue of two men - who start off as bumbling incompetents and learn to become skilled hikers - this book is captivating for several other reasons, as it explores the (often troubling) history of the Appalachian Trail itself, its staggering array of botanical and animal species, and the hikers themselves who feel compelled to master this arduous journey of over 2000 miles. Bryson's true nature is that of an insatiably curious traveler, someone who not only takes a walk, but researches that walk and tells you all the details that led to it and all the things that might be spotted along the way, without ever making it feel as though you are on the other end of a dry, didactic lecture. Bryson is teaching a course on the Appalachian Trail in these pages and making you think he is just having a conversation with you, that you are just another friend hiking the trail along with him and Katz. ""Let me tell you a little bit about that salamander over there."" And ""Did you know about the vast chestnut trees that used to dominate this trail and are now all gone?"" It's like taking a camping trip with your favorite uncle. Moreover, Bryson also takes a little time to consider the mindset of those who thru-hike (hike the complete trail from one end to the other), and to delve just a bit into the nature of compulsion. I admit that is what often fascinates me the most about nature books and accounts of adventurers and explorers and outdoor enthusiasts. It is why I am fascinated with books like ""Into the Wild"" or ""Into Thin Air"" or the film ""Grizzly Man."" What makes people feel compelled to hike for hundreds of miles over terrain that changes little from day to day? Or climb the highest mountain, planning the next climb on the way down from the last? Or camp and live among wild, often dangerous creatures, knowing full well you may end up a meal for them someday? In my own past, I had a brush with the outdoor life. I spent a number of years with a wildlife biologist who was one of those real mountain men, the kind of person who could go up into the woods with a few necessities in his pack and come down a month later, none the worse for wear. As someone who had previously thought of camping as something you did at the beach, in an RV, on a concrete slab, I was more surprised than anyone to discover that off-trail hiking in the mountains and forests of the Southwest was something for which I seemed to have a natural ability. I was good at it. And it was intoxicating to know. It bred a kind of addiction for the outdoor life, a desire to see the hidden parts of the earth that few others ever come upon. But it also made me keenly aware of the dangers of that type of existence, the knowledge that you are only ever one bad fall or deep cut or mountain lion away from possible death. My memories of all those rugged camping trips and stunning hikes alternate between a great sense of wonder and accomplishment and a heightened appreciation of soft sheets, homecooked meals, and warm bubble baths. Bryson, too, during his journey, alternated between a kind of addiction for the hiking life and a desire for the safety and comfort of the mundane world. It was clear that given the time and inclination, he might have become one of those obsessive thru-hikers who cannot seem to stop hiking these trails, much the way Forrest Gump felt compelled to run or triathletes feel compelled to train. It is not really a love of the process. Many thru-hikers admit to hating it. But they can't seem to stop. Something inside them pushes them on. And I think that is what makes this book so appealing, even to those readers who may have little interest in the Appalachian Trail or the endangered species along its path or the historical figures who came to build the trail in the first place. Readers who have no experience with long hikes or rugged camping or curiosity for the wonders of nature. We all have a little compulsion in us, a little voice that urges us to try what may be unlike us or attempt things with which we are clearly uncomfortable. And some of us heed those voices and succumb to the pull of uncertainty and some of us do not. But among those who do are the clique of like-minded hikers who wake at the crack of dawn every day to a voice that says, ""Go on, just a few more miles, just a few more miles until tomorrow...""...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,Jan 2015,"Feb 10, 2015","Aug 02, 2010",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods

Based on their high recommendations and constant urging, I chose to begin my foray into Mitchelldom with the most recent in his already impressive body of work, “The Thousand Autumns of Jacob De Zoet,” the tale of a Dutch clerk serving a trading post on a Japanese island at the turn of the century (the nineteenth century, as most of the book takes place in 1800). I was immediately struck by Mitchell’s amazing attention to detail. It was obvious that he had done exhaustive and meticulous research into the era – its history, its geography, its linguistics, its customs and mores and prejudices and precedents. From the possessions of his characters to the clothes they wore, Mitchell did not miss a beat, evoking a time and a setting as clearly in the reader’s mind as if it were something Mitchell himself had observed only yesterday. The characters he introduced us to were also a colorful bunch – a Dutch crew laden with pompous windbags, lowlife swindlers, backbiters, ruffians, and outright criminals – and then, conversely, a Japanese society of strict hierarchies, intense formalities, and a congress of leaders and interpreters who must often negate their feelings in order to accommodate social expectation. Add in an eccentric Dutch doctor with radically liberal philosophies and a penchant for cultural relativity, a fascinating Japanese midwife from an exalted family who dreams of being a doctor, and a Dutch clerk unmoved by the greed of his compatriots and determined to follow his Christian principles, and Mitchell seems to have laid the foundation for a compelling story. So, imagine how worried and befuddled I was when nearly 200 pages into the book I still did not find the story all that compelling. How was this possible? What on earth was I going to tell all of those Goodreads friends who love this guy? How could they ever believe or respect another of my s if I ended up disliking a book by this exalted demigod of the bookstore circuit? My street cred was on the line, and Mitchell was not helping me at all. After 200 pages out of 479, one doesn’t generally expect things to change radically. Usually you get that far into a novel and you can expect 279 more pages of what you started with. Boy, was I wrong about that. Suddenly, after all that investment of time and set-up, the story absolutely exploded. And I mean that in a good way. A brilliant way, really. It turns out Mitchell had meticulously laid all this groundwork expecting us to patiently follow him into this world he was constructing, counting on us to trust him, and then he let loose with a storyline I never saw coming (a plotline involving intrigue and pure evil related to nuns held captive in a mountain monastery)and then another that quickly followed it (related to a British naval frigate that shows up unexpectedly and causes sheer havoc) – and finally, finally, I understood the staggering genius at the core of his writing style. And make no mistake, this guy can write. He can do ornate and poetic descriptions as well as he can do the vulgar slang of sailors in conversation. His observations of beauty always hold a modicum of ugliness and his observations of evil always hold a modicum of hopefulness. He’s that kind of writer. The kind that never leaves you with a false sense of security because he tells you right away that any sense of security is ludicrous in a world so fraught with both expected and unexpected peril. Mitchell is also well aware that the themes that concerned people in the 1800’s are often the same themes that consume us today. Through his characters and their international trade pursuits, Mitchell gives us insights into the little-changed reality that greed is both a powerful motivator and a demonic cancer, that the meeting of two cultures often results in the arrogant ethnocentrism of inhabitants of both, and that often those people in possession of the greatest amount of talent and strength of character are the ones subjugated to the fringes of their environments while the well-connected or merciless thrive. And yet, even admitting such, Mitchell makes a case for the importance of integrity, the steadfast adherence to good will, and a belief that there is wrong and right – good and evil – in the world, and a person should follow rightness, regardless of the consequences. When you read this book and see the types of consequences facing our characters and the difficulties in remaining stalwart in such scenarios, you realize that Mitchell’s stance is not merely a platitude, but an admission of the brave and often brutal force of will required to remain good in the world. And does goodness lead to rewards and happy endings? Very rarely. As is so often the case in real life. In the end, Mitchell believes that a life is defined as much by one’s character as by the many regrets that haunt one’s memories, the tragic or wistful reveries of “what might have been.” No one gets exactly what he or she wants in life; no one is ever as truly happy as is possible. The things we could have said, the stands we might have taken, the unrequited love or the gold left unpursued – these lost possibilities are the things that define us even more than the things that we ultimately achieve.(Note: My four rating is actually a four and a half – and the only reason I subtracted from the rating is because of the many, many pages of set-up before the story took off and the quality Mitchell sometimes has of including unnecessarily gross or vulgar images in his writing merely for the shock value or repulsive quality of the image. I also feel he occasionally beats us over the head with symbolism. But he takes risks that other writers do not – often with unique and fiercely poignant results, and his research is impeccably integrated into the story as a whole. Mitchell is a force to be reckoned with.)...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jun 26, 2011","Jul 04, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7141642-the-thousand-autumns-of-jacob-de-zoet

I realize this is a flaw, but I admit to it anyway. NonetheleI generally have little interest in reading about the machinations of American politics. I realize this is a flaw, but I admit to it anyway. Nonetheless, after the crushing lethargy brought on by two terms of the Bush presidency, I watched the last presidential race with a newfound interest. Who is Barack Obama underneath the idyllic visage? Is he really as good as he seems? Can Hillary Clinton overcome the negativity of her White House image to win this race? Is that doddering old McCain going to pull off a miracle or make a fool out of himself? Who in the hell is Sarah Palin? All of these questions and more caught my interest and made me pay attention to what seemed a crossroads in American history. This election was going to define our culture in some way. It was in the air. It was palpable. ""Game Change"" captures the electricity surrounding the campaigns of these famous entities (and their lesser rivals) by creating fascinating character studies borne out by meticulous research and hundreds of corroborating interviews. It is brilliantly written to have a ""day in the life"" feel to it, while still touching upon enlightening insights into the candidates' mindsets and rich nuggets of political maneuvering. Granted, it had a headstart on cornering the ""interesting"" market by already focusing on some of the most complex and riveting people in modern politics (Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, John McCain, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani, Sarah Palin, Joe Lieberman) - all well-known and iconic (and often, polarizing) figures in many ways. The initial battle for the Democratic nomination took up the lion's share of the book and for good reason. It was loaded with defining moments and featured one of the closest and most historic rivalries ever witnessed. The journey Obama and Clinton took together changed both of them, taught them some things about themselves, and made their new partnership also seem destined to be, despite its many contentious moments. Following them both along this journey was like being a fly on the wall and being able to overhear some of the most brilliant strategizing in a modern campaign setting as well as some of the most unexpected gaffes. Gaffes, however, were the stock in trade of the GOP campaigns in the last election, as this book shows in shocking, and occasionally amusing, detail. McCain banked everything on the unelectability of his rivals and was therefore able to ride one of the most financially bankrupt and poorly planned campaigns in history to a successful nomination. Spontaneous and hotheaded, McCain had his moments, but was saddled with the endorsement of a hugely unpopular president and a campaign team that was shoddily put together and slapdash in its approach. I was stunned to learn that Palin had only been vetted for a week before being sprung upon the RNC. McCain had hoped to run with Leiberman until his own team member leaked it to the press and set off an outraged explosion in the Republican party a couple of weeks before the planned announcement. Having to start again at Square One so deep in the race, Palin was chosen hastily, vetted poorly, and later deeply regretted as a choice, due to her obvious lack of knowledge about the issues, strange psychological behavior on the campaign trail, and tendency toward compulsive lying. (Biden's loose lips and occasional flubs paled in comparison, or could have been much more of an issue in a more traditional race.)Obama clearly comes off the best in this tome, largely because he truly seems to be the real deal, a guy who believes his own rhetoric, truly wants to change the world for the better, constantly educates himself about the issues and surrounds himself with competent advisors, and who adores his family. Some occasional arrogance and perhaps a little too much loyalty to old friends seems to be his only real flaw. Hillary, though far more complex and flawed, came off as quite sympathetic to me throughout the book. Her knowledge, her ability to charm and make alliances, her tolerance of her husband's antics, her desire to be liked - it all made her seem both noble and tragic at times. John Edwards comes off as a truly deluded man with a messiah complex who does not understand until far too late that he has caused his own ruin. McCain comes off as a man who had the ideals but not the temperament for the job - as someone who felt pressured to enter a race for which he was not prepared because of some idea that he needed to ""save the party"" (and that it might be his last chance at his age to run). His old-fashioned notions in the wake of Obama's youth-infused message of change made for a sad juxtaposition. Palin, frankly, comes off as a loon. A dangerous loon. And in fact, a loon whose platform is so far right even the right is embarrassed by it (signing off on legislation, for instance, to require rape victims to have to pay for their own rape kits). Nice. But the behind-the-scenes look at her and how overwhelmed she was by being tossed into the arena completely unprepared by McCain's team and then abandoned when she proved to be too much of a liability was an eye-opening feature of the race.Finally, there are the little nuggets in this book that are priceless. Hillary's clueless tirade when she finds out Obama's campaign has raked in a fortune selling T-shirts and other gear emblazoned with the candidate's face and message (""Why aren't we doing that?""), McCain and his cronies breaking up the tension of the campaign by endlessly viewing (and going into hysterical laughter over) the YouTube video of John Edwards primping his hair for an event, Obama mockingly adopting Palin's ""You betcha!"" at team meetings, or Palin refusing to study the issues for her upcoming Katie Couric interview while interrupting her handler with questions like, ""What's Katie like?"" and ""How is my makeup?"" (As you'll recall the Couric interview was a train wreck of immense proportions for the Republican ticket.)The race was endlessly fascinating for those who cared, and this book brings it all back in glorious detail. Now that we see Obama entrenched in partisan wars he had hoped to abolish and health care reform that took every ounce of energy and political compromising possible, it would be interesting to know if Obama's ideals are still intact, assaulted as they have been by the political machine. Hillary's place in history has been affirmed by her excellent work ethic as Secretary of State, Biden's mouth still betrays him, and Michelle has risen from a place of being misunderstood to being beloved. The ""Game Change"" this book details might very well have saved this country, though its citizens seem to have made that a dim memory at this point, but, however you view this election's place in history, its players remain endlessly fascinating. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 17, 2010","Mar 24, 2010","Mar 17, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6694937-game-change

Mantel is a brilliant novelist, the kind who can convey a great deal with spare dialogue and a cleverly observed detail. It's just that I read her ""Wolf Hall"" first, and that book is such a masterpiece, that this intimate story seems a small book in comparison. It is almost as if a very good short story or novella had been expanded to fill the pagination requirements of a novel. The book concerns a group of female students in a wry ""coming of age"" tale set in 1960's London. Mantel is very good at setting the tone, and at letting you envision these people as true flesh and blood entities. You can see them as clearly as the people in your own hazy memories of youth. Their desires, their fears, the coping mechanisms they use to deal with their emerging womanhood - it all rings true. I definitely know these young women, have met them, have been to college with some of them, have shared some of their helplessness and some of their appetites. That it all happens decades before my own college experience does not date it, the same situations are still valid today. The inner life of the main character, Carmel, is beautifully rendered, we think her thoughts with her, we realize the strange empowerment of her self-sabotage, we understand the miscalculations of her sisters in the dormitory through her eyes, the woman she is hoping to be and the one she is hoping not to become. It's just that this is a story that feels familiar, as if other authors have tackled it before and possibly more effectively. It is a worthwhile read and a thoughtful study, but I cannot help but wonder, if Mantel had it to write over again, if she would lead us further into these lives, give us a richer world to enter and perhaps, follow into the future a bit more - or alternatively, if she would crop this a bit to find the very moving short story it would have made. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2010","Mar 16, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/101926.An_Experiment_in_Love

Here we have a story about Earth in the aftermath of an apocalyptic event, a horrific and unsafe world of gray rivers and burnt Where does one begin? Here we have a story about Earth in the aftermath of an apocalyptic event, a horrific and unsafe world of gray rivers and burnt forests where people are few, but the majority of those few left alive have formed marauding bands of cruel and inhumane scavengers who most likely consider other survivors a source of meat rather than a source of companionship. Enter our two characters, Papa and the boy, traveling ""the road"" to reach the coast in hope of a better world there. They have devised a way of hiding and rummaging that has so far ensured their safety. They need to survive because they are ""carrying the fire."" So what is the road and what is the fire and why must the boy survive? The road is life, the life thrust upon them, the trudge from birth to death, the central metaphor, the river, this mortal coil. And the fire seems to be the hope of goodness, the idea that kindness is sacred, that love transcends. The boy embodies that sense of right in his altruistic dedication to other human beings, his earnest desire to help the others they encounter. The Papa is a world-weary realist, unsure that a happy ending can be had, but urged on by love, his love of the boy, who might be his son or who might be your son or who might very well be God. Mccarthy never tells us for sure, but he certainly lets us know that whatever God may be for some, to him it is the ability to love another human being. The scenes of man's inhumanity to man turn up at regular intervals in the book. Even in a world that has not experienced a nuclear winter or whatever catastrophe the earth is enduring in the book, we know enough of human nature to know that evil can rear its ugly head even in the best of circumstances, at any time, in any place, with or without warning. McCarthy's road is a place of ever-present fear and vigilance, a place where one false move can mean that you never take another step. This book, as a microcosm of the world, shows us throughout its pages the many ways a person can die. One is the victim of nature, struck by lightning. Others are shown to have died quickly in the catastrophic event, still in motion, pain stretching across fearful faces. Still others wither away from starvation or illness. Bodies litter this world. Then, there are those killed by the survivors, their bones boiled, babies roasted, still more captives kept in the dank holes of deathcamps until they can be killed for food. At one point McCarthy invokes the famous anthropological quote about ""nature red in tooth and claw"" when he muses about men white in tooth and eye. Are we little more than a mass of survival instincts when left in a world that requires it? Do we revert to primitive lobes in meager brains and care little for the others in our tribe? The case is made, although Papa and the boy are the exceptions, two people in that world who define their roles as ""the good guys"" and preserve as a goal the hope that they may never need to harm others. All through the book we pray that there are other exceptions to the inhumanity, other people alive who cherish goodness, because if there are not, then there is surely no hope - not for Papa and the boy, and not for us as a species. And death the eradicator waits at their heels. Our heels.This incredible little book deals with some huge themes, maybe the only themes. Who inherently are we? What does it all mean? And possibly even more heart-wrenching than thoughts of what it all might mean is the all-encompassing idea of ""What does it matter?"" When we lie in bed at night on the nights when we allow ourselves to contemplate mortality, these are the fears we hold and the answers we never get. McCarthy gives us an unflinching look at every angle, every possible pain and sorrow humans can endure. But through it all he also shows us the redemption of love, the meaning it holds for characters, a papa and a boy who could be any of our acquaintance, who could have pasted onto their faces the faces of our own father or husband or lover, our own son or nephew or neighbor, the people we love. And in the end, in even a cruel world where those alive have little else, even if nothing else matters, maybe love still does. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Feb 16, 2010","Feb 16, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1221381.The_Road

The kinds of things that occasionally make you feel that you are connected to a greater web of being, a little sign to let you know that you are not in this alone. Two days before I picked up Colum McCann's extraordinary novel ""Let The Great World Spin,"" I watched the equally extraordinary documentary ""Man on Wire"" for the second time. Philippe Petit, more angel than human, strung a cable across the Twin Towers in 1974 and performed on it for over half an hour, walking, reclining, and literally dancing for the tiny human specks below and for the gods above (who could see him better, after all). It is a breathtaking sight, a man who has become art, who has made of himself something otherworldly and glorious. Like walking into a forest and seeing a unicorn or looking at the seashore and spotting a mermaid on a rock. It is therefore no wonder that the thread that ties together the vignettes in ""Let the Great World Spin"" is Petit's momentous tightrope walk as witnessed by the various residents of New York City. McCann introduces us to a number of these residents, some living gritty lives in the projects, others living lives of quiet luxury in a Park Avenue penthouse, still others trying to survive somewhere between the two extremes, in addresses less prone to preconception. And all of these residents are tied to the story and tied to the events of the day in ways that are sometimes obvious but more often as tenuous as a wire strung between buildings. But a wire that stretches. And holds. McCann's brilliance lies in the fact that each individual we meet is a revelation, a wholly expressed and vivid entity burnt onto our brain cells for all time. When we first meet the young Irish monk, Corrigan, living in a pit in the projects in order to try to protect the downtrodden, the hookers, and the elderly of the neighborhood, we jump into his world without a thought for our own safety, because we are smitten by his desire to bring goodness to bad places. As it turns out, he - and we - should have considered our safety a bit more carefully. So we learn straight off that some stories are not connected by so much as common addresses or economic status as they are by loss, by grief, by people left behind to trudge on when another's goals are left unfulfilled. Other characters will learn similar lessons, some by choice and others by circumstance, but McCann does not leave us behind like onlookers in a theater. He tells us these stories to make us look at our own and to consider the effect our lives have on the lives around us. Add to this ingenious structure the most perfect prose in modern literature and you have not a book, not a work of fiction, but an experience. McCann's stories are startlingly beautiful in many ways - their description, their construct, their gorgeous dissection of the dreams and memories of their characters. But the windows McCann opens, the doors he peers through, are just as often opening onto heartbreak as they are onto joy. Somehow, though, the grief and loss make the small tribulations and unexpected beauty that much more meaningful, the way a small remembrance can give us an inner photograph of our own unique definition of happiness. ""So much depends upon the red wheelbarrow..."", after all. McCann's characters allow us a glimpse of their sorrow and their happiness and let us decide if a balance has been achieved. That is, if the living of a life matters in the world, which is what McCann ultimately appears to be weighing in his fiction. Which is why he has allowed us glimpses into lives connected to other lives, and connected to other lives still, like the branches of an ever-expanding tree limb. How does this new person have an impact on the soul I have just become acquainted with, how can this person across town make a mark on the life of the one I just met in the Bronx? Late in the book one of our characters says, ""It had never occurred to me before but everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing as strange as the last, and connected."" Reading ""Let the Great World Spin"" makes me understand anew that we are all connected, that what we do matters, that our actions send ripples into the world that can affect other people in strange and unexpected ways. And every so often something stunning and remarkable happens that can bind us all together in sorrow or in joy. Like two planes hitting the Twin Towers. Or an angel walking between them. ...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Jul 03, 2010","Jul 09, 2010","Feb 09, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

Maybe there's a cowHave you ever wanted to be a fly on the wall and observe a day in the life of someone you know or perhaps someone you barely know? Maybe there's a coworker or a teacher or a barista at Starbuck's - anyone at all - that you wonder about. Do they live alone or have eight kids? Do they throw their socks on the floor or use a hamper? Are they gay or straight? What is a day like for this person? What does he or she think about? Christopher Isherwood understands that ""fly on the wall"" mentality and satisfies it brilliantly with his portrait of George, an aging professor and British transplant in California, whose partner has recently passed away. Isherwood gives us a day in the life of George, a day which might have been mundane or uneventful were it not for George's rich inner life and refreshingly frank observations. The brilliance of this little book is that George engages the reader right away. He is brutally frank, unflinchingly self-aware, and both flawed and endearing in equal parts. Whether he is having a pang of grief on the stairs (which he likens to a physical rather than emotional occurrence, comparing it to an ""attack of cramp"") as he thinks about the many mornings spent with his partner Jim, or disgusting himself by trying to win over the neighbor children who hate him by offering them a bag of candy, or frankly assessing his many physical flaws at the gym while trying to decide if his abs are too saggy to go shirtless, George himself might be surprised to find out that he is a reluctant everyman, thinking the same thoughts many of us have had, filled with the same misgivings and the same small comforts. Despite the fact that George is a gay man living in the 1960's, with all of the prejudices and consequences of that lifestyle during a time far less tolerant than today, his reactions to the pervasive public opinion are sometimes fair and sometimes equally prejudiced. And sometimes his anger spills over into almost laughably mental images of atrocities perpetrated on his verbal and political assailants. Isherwood knows that George is not perfect. He loves him for that reason and lets us do the same. In fact, the one time the book gives us an inner thought of another character, pure and not previously filtered through or perceived by George, is when we are told that George's neighbor, Mrs. Strunk, who George thinks secretly judges him and reviles his lifestyle, actually thinks to herself ""he has a kind face."" The book is at its best when George is just thinking his thoughts and giving us his interpretation of the world around him. Somehow, in his naturally engaging manner he drops real bombshells about the realities of grief, loneliness, aging, death, sexual desire, and the nature of friendship, while never becoming preachy, maudlin or sentimental. It is a book that becomes very poignant and moving, seemingly without trying to do so. I very nearly gave the book five stars, and almost wonder if I did not merely because of the book's apparent effortlessnesss, as if Isherwood could have jotted it all down in an afternoon. Any book that so brilliantly hides its craft within the folds of almost tangible characterization is a real accomplishment, and I am quite sure I will think about George for a very long time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 28, 2010","Nov 29, 2010","Jan 26, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16842.A_Single_Man

A radiation oncologist with a scientific background comes across some textbook cases of near death experiences in medical journals early in his career and makes it his life-long mission to collect as many near-death experiences as possible from around the world and study their similarities and statistical consistencies, as well as their apparent occurrence in the face of medical improbability, to conclude that his body of work proves the existence of an afterlife. There are only two problems with the book that I can find: 1) Dr. Long is passionate about his mission and arduous about his methods, but cannot write an interesting sentence to save his life, and 2) Dr. Long points out nine lines of evidence to prove the existence of an afterlife, none of which actually proves the existence of an afterlife. So, why read this book? Because mortality sucks and despite himself Dr. Long has compiled the most extensive data in the field, some of it so amazingly similar in style and content that it defies being coincidental in nature or even culturally ingrained. When people make things up, they tend to embellish in ways that are inconsistent, adding details that do not maintain certain repetitive elements and constant stylistic devices. Reading a selection of the hundreds of thousands of entries Dr. Long has gathered makes it challenging to remain completely skeptical about the process. Dr. Long also brings up some interesting medical facts that make even science geeks and nonbelievers like myself think long and hard about our views on the nature of death and dying. Could it all be neurological, physiological, remnants of electrical currents in the brain? I've always assumed so. Dr. Long, however, offers some clear medical reasoning as to why that type of dismissive thinking is medically unsound. I have some major issues with many of Dr. Long's research methods, statistical values, and conclusions (the man is not afraid of big leaps), but the near death experiences themselves are the draw of this book, and wedged between Long's dry, clinical sentences and clipped conclusions, the voices of those who have briefly died, and yet lived to tell about it, make the pages briefly come alive. The amazing similarities in these hundreds of stories truly affected my perceptions of the event itself. Even if you don't come away from this book with a belief in any type of afterlife (guilty as charged), it is still difficult to walk away from this book without the strangely comforting feeling that the moment of death may not be a cause for terror but rather the experience of a pleasant journey to a place where love and peacefulness reign supreme. Beyond that, one must come to his or her own conclusions about eternity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jul 04, 2011","Jan 20, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7473655-evidence-of-the-afterlife

I know other readers who admit to doing the same thing, and they, like me, cannot say why. Maybe we just want to go on a journey, find a character or two, accept a premise, and then invest our time for the long haul. Perhaps we think if we understand a character, live a life with someone in the span of a few hundred pages, we may also understand ourselves - and others - a bit better by the end of the book. On the other hand, short stories have always seemed to me the literary equivalent of blind dates - short periods of time that require minimal emotional investment, no immediate sense of commitment, and within which you get a brief impression of someone that may or may not be correct. Like driving by lighted house windows in the dark of night. You glimpse a scene (maybe a family eating dinner together or a young married couple fighting, or a middle-aged woman caring for an elderly man), you have just enough time to feel a glimmer of attachment, maybe create a backstory, and then its on to the next lighted window. Maile Meloy's ""Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It"" has changed all of that for me. From the moment I opened it, I was a fan. Meloy's writing is deceptively simple, and that is because her characters speak the way people really do. Eavesdrop on a conversation at the coffee shop or diner someday. You will see that people talk the way Meloy's characters do and not the way so many other writers would have us believe. There are many very good, very famous authors who write dialogue so unnatural I often find myself stopping mid-sentence at various points within their books to complain, ""Nobody would actually say that."" Meloy succeeds because you fully believe you are intruding on a real scenario, somehow overhearing it from a nearby booth or bench. I could talk about craft, because Meloy's stories are so perfectly crafted, utilizing such an economy of language and such natural markers to define her characters that you never actually see the craft in the work. It all seems so effortless. But craft to me sometimes makes people think of pretension, writers who are trying too hard to be clever or unique or poignant. Meloy sidesteps all of this, brushes off any labels, and just goes along her way. The best compliment I can give this collection is that, by the time I finished it, I remembered the first story as clearly as the last. I could have given an accurate synopsis of every story in the book to an interested party on the spot. Scenes from the lives of these characters still made me feel the weight of their choices or the heft of their indecision. Many of Meloy's observances still run through my head, striking in their minimalist honesty. One character remembers a man he disliked with the line ""not even failure could make him interesting"" while a devoted wife with an unfaithful husband is described ""looking toward the kitchen door, like a faithful retriever with her messy hair and red nose, waiting for her master to appear."" Such sparse lines give us so much information in such a small amount of space. Only one story in the collection did not work for me, a story called ""Liliana,"" because in comparison to the others its premise seemed outlandish, a deviation from the consistent voice of the rest of the collection, like an experiment that the author chose to include. It was still very well written and had some lovely moments, but it just didn't ring true. Also, the final story, ""O Tannenbaum,"" had a couple of implausible moments for me, as well, but those are really my only criticisms of a truly stunning piece of work, and the only flaws that brought this from a five star to a four star rating. Needless to say, Maile Meloy has given me a new-found appreciation of the short story writer, a new respect for first impressions, and a fondness for those glimpses of lighted windows in the dark. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 30, 2010","Sep 06, 2010","Jan 19, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5948644-both-ways-is-the-only-way-i-want-it

In fact, I remember clearly that I didn't want to see it. The name sounded silly, and I had no clue what it was about. Visions of pirates and space creatures clouded my judgment. Luckily, my friends dragged me in by majority vote and I emerged from the theater two hours later, exhilarated, endlessly curious about early human cultures, and determined to live a more exciting life. And it stuck. Years later, I stood in the middle of Albuquerque receiving my degree in Anthropology, still consumed with a passion for learning about ancient human history and lost worlds. Percy Fawcett, the adventurer, explorer, and land surveyor at the heart of ""The Lost City of Z"" would have most likely seen a lot of himself in Indiana Jones. If ever there were a real-life version of the intrepid anthropologist, Fawcett would definitely be a frontrunner. And fate seemed to lead him there. In his early military years in Ceylon, Fawcett heard the legend of a lost city buried beneath an earthen mound near his base. He took it upon himself to try to locate this lost world, and appears to have had some success, although he did not have the wherewithal at the time to excavate it. Still, the thrill of the find and the desire to pursue other ""lost worlds"" grabbed hold of him then, and planted the seed of obsession that would follow him throughout the rest of his life. Working for the Royal Geographical Society, Fawcett was sent to the largely uncharted and dangerous forests of the Amazon. By many accounts, there seems to be no crueler environment in the world. When I was once contemplating graduate field work, I recalled the stories of an anthropologist who had visited our class to tell us about his work with the Yanamami, a tribe so fascinating and remote that many classmates later expressed their desire to do the same. But me? Not in the least. I knew the last place on earth I ever wanted to live - even for a short time - was within the bug-infested, snake-laden, vampire-bat heavy jaguar lair that is the Amazon. Mosquitoes love me here in New England. Imagine the feast I would provide them in the rain forest. I would be nearly bloodless in a week. But Fawcett, he was made for the place. Surveying the formerly unexplored (by white men) border between Brazil and Bolivia, he accomplished his mission nearly a year ahead of schedule. This despite losing half his team to disease, the arrows of hostile tribes, parasitic worms, viral infections, and starvation. By all accounts, Fawcett was impervious to disease, boasting a hardy constitution unphased by the rigors of a jungle so dense that a day's worth of hacking through it with machetes sometimes only gained the team a half a mile of advancement. His amazing physical stamina and seeming disdain for the suffering of others bred one of two things in the men who served him: intense loyalty or mutinous desire. The tales of both of these conditions in his many journeys back into the jungle after his acclaimed first mission, are the stuff of legend. But, somewhere along the way, Fawcett began to hear about a Lost City, much like the famed El Dorado, a city of vast palaces and towering pillars, filled with riches and covered in gold dust. Having encountered a smaller version of this phenomenon in Ceylon, Fawcett became intrigued. As time went on, intrigue turned to obsession, as more and more of the oral histories he encountered in the tribes he befriended, as well as the geographical and archaeological record that had newly been discovered began to substantiate the claims. When Hiram Bingham discovered Machu Picchu during the same time period as Fawcett's work, it only fueled his desire to find his own ""lost world."" ""The Lost City of Z"" is brilliantly told and exhaustively researched by David Grann. Needless to say, Fawcett's final mission involved a last ditch effort to find the city, taking only his grown son, his son's best friend and a couple of temporary native guides. They went into the forest in 1925 and were never heard from again. Since that time, literally hundreds of amateur explorers have trekked into the same hostile jungles to try to find the missing Colonel and his companions. As recently as 1995, a Bolivian businessman and his grown son (along with an expert team and the best technological aids) tried to finally find out what happened to the Fawcett team all those years ago, only to find themselves taken captive by an Amazonian tribe. (The tribe debated whether or not to kill them for three days until finally releasing them in exchange for their thirty thousand dollars worth of equipment.) And this was 1995 - not 1925. It is no wonder that Grann himself finally feels compelled to witness the land where Percy Fawcett was lost forever. His journey, which he documents late in the book, is far more eventful than I would have imagined, and his final meeting with the anthropologist Michael Hecklenberger, who has lived in the Amazon for over a dozen years now, was insightful and educational. For anyone who has ever felt the pull of exploration, imagined the thrill of a lost world, or even just really enjoyed the exploits of Indiana Jones, pick up this fascinating book. I doubt it will make you want to trek through the Amazon, (in fact, it may dissuade you from going to a jungle anywhere, ever, under any circumstances), but it might just make you want to explore a new culture, visit a museum, or even just take the long way home.

But I now know that if I could only give my nephews one book to read in order to shape their minds and inform their lives, it would have to be Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything,"" which is exactly what it purports to be, and a little bit more. Bryson's book is not just a tremendous achievement by virtue of its exhaustive research and myth-busting details. It is not just a marvel of scope and inclusion, detailing the basic principles of every major field of scientific research, including but not limited to geology, physics, biology, astronomy, genetics, anthropology, and climatology. It is not just a compilation of fascinating character studies and vignettes featuring some of the greatest minds in human history. It is that rarest of books. A book of complex ideas and scientific principles that is also a page turner. Learning the history of the universe from the wry, avuncular Bill Bryson, with his entertaining style and dry humor is a pure delight. You are enthralled because he is enthralled, endlessly so, and his enthusiasm and wonder rub off on even those with an already decent grasp of the material. Bryson makes scientific thought what it was meant to be, breathtaking and fun, even if you think you have heard it all before. And chances are you haven't. Even familiar material is scrutinized and the old histories revisited in a sincere attempt to reflect that elusive historical element: accuracy. You may think you know who discovered what - and you may be quite wrong about that. I spent a good deal of time with this book, because its concepts, the sweeping, mind-blowing concepts of earth's history, need to be processed and internalized. One night I would go to bed pondering the vastness of galaxies. Another night I would similarly ponder the impossibly infinitessimal structures within the nuclei of cells. The anthropologist in me revisited my beliefs about hominid lineages and the visionary in me attempted to explore the bottom of the ocean floor. All of this I have done before Bryson, but now I do it with a better informed mind and a respect for Bryson's voice, gently guiding me once more through the brilliance of life as we know it. So, if my nephews and I ever find ourselves on a desert island...with just one book... like Darwinian explorers, we will look at each leaf and species more closely, like the geologist Lyell, we will find a small world in each rock, and, like Sagan, the night sky will be a playground of wonder for us, filled with billions of stars and billions of galaxies, some of which must surely have...life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jun 19, 2010","Aug 21, 2010","Dec 29, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21.A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything

Even at her most buoyant and optimistic, Ms. Hoffman writes books that will haunt you forever. And ""Skylight Confessions"" (a truly awful title for a book that deserved better) is not a buoyant and optimistic book by any stretch of the imagination. It is a sad book full of damaged people living lives full of secrets and regrets. It is, at its core, a book about loss. A book, in fact, about death. Hoffman is clear about this; the novel starts with a funeral and ends with one. We lose several characters along the way. But, like so much of Hoffman's ""Yankee fantabulism,"" it is also a book filled with the magic of the inexplicable. Make no mistake, none of this magical fairy dust is going to save any of our characters, but without the quality of the unknown, the twists of fate that define a life, the strange turn of events that can rewrite a history, there is no Alice Hoffman novel to be had. You might as well read the newspaper. ""Magic"" is not the stuff of Harry Potter in a Hoffman novel, it can merely be the ""spell"" someone feels he is under when he behaves in an uncharacteristic way, or how a character may feel bewitched by a moment in time. Why did my car take a wrong turn and end up in this place that led to a marriage? Why was I looking out the window just in time to see an event that would change my life forever? The inexplicable ""what if's?"" haunt our characters and also Hoffman's readers, because how much of what qualifies as ""magic"" in the lives of these characters also qualifies as magic in our own lives? How much of it is fate, and how much of it is simple free will? Hoffman likes to play with the concept of destiny. She likes us to consider if our actions are guided by destiny or are simply our own, if events can have a synchronous manipulation or if they are merely coincidences or things we will into being through our own creation. Like most of her novels, this one has a ghost. You need not believe in ghosts to accept the presence of this one, because it could all have a perfectly terrestrial explanation, couldn't it? Several of our characters are the victims of lore, tied to the one story their deceased mother told of a race of people who could sprout wings and fly at the moment of imminent disaster. What's more, our characters also happen to live in a glass house. No, not a metaphorical glass house. A real one. And it all seems perfectly natural, since it was designed by the father of one character, a famous architect known for his fusion of glass and metal. Here, the world of dark fairy tales meets the real world. Some children make it out of the woods and some do not. Some princesses make it out of the glass house and others remain captive there.

Yes, it utilizes the theater and its players to effectively explore its themes, and in doing so says quite a bit about the world of people who pretend to be other people for a living, but at its core, this is a book about the psychology of the individual and the processes at work that shape us into the human beings we become. In the very first sentence of this novel, Valerie Martin has a character make a statement about Freudian psychology. Is it just a coincidence that the novel starts off with a statement about Freudian psychology? Even Freud would tell you ""there are no accidents"" in life, and Valerie Martin knows this only too well. Her main character, Edward Day, however, is about to find out with unique clarity that there are no accidents in life – after he has a life-altering and self-defining…er…accident. When Edward Day falls off a pier at midnight into the ocean, he is rescued by the enigmatic Guy Margate, a fellow actor and rival for the attentions of Edward Day’s love interest, Madeleine. Guy has some unusual distinguishing characteristics, not the least of which being that he looks almost identical to Edward Day. He may be a bit darker in his features, a bit more raw and wild-looking, but the two could be mistaken for each other, their resemblance being so uncanny. From that day on, the two become inextricably linked to each other – Edward, beholden to Guy for saving his life, resentful that he needs to feel gratitude toward a man he does not like – and Guy, now Edward’s savior, a man who feels he can impose upon the favors and goodwill of Edward, having saved him from his doom. Guy, in fact, becomes a shadowy conscience and judge who turns up at some of the most significant times in Edward’s life. Now, let’s get to the backstory, as all good actors do. Edward was the favorite son of a sometimes-distant mother. Late in her life, she left Edward’s father, became involved in a lesbian relationship, and…oh yeah…killed herself. The night she killed herself, she called Edward’s number several times, never reaching him, because he was busy having his first sexual experience with a woman (Yup…Calling Mr Freud, please pick up, Mr. Freud…). No one knows his mother tried to call him, and he never tells his father or brothers about it. He merely represses the experience, pushes it down and proceeds to look for approval in every woman he meets from that point on. When he falls for a beautiful acting student named Madeleine only to find that she harbors feelings for Guy Margate, we are suddenly smack dab in the middle of a psychoanalyst’s wet dream. Can you say Oedipal complex? Displacement? Transference? As the story progresses, the reader is called upon to witness hook-ups and betrayals, tragedies and lies, successes and failures. There are important moments when characters in the story are called upon to make sacrifices, face difficult truths, accept or negate their own actions. Edward likes to portray himself to the reader as the hero of his own story, a man beset by the infuriating intrusions of Guy Margate, a man we are meant to think of as a threat and a sinister force in Edward’s life. Guy’s attentions to Madeline are seen by Edward as deliberate falsehoods meant only to vex his rival (the term Edward uses to define his and Guy’s unique relationship throughout the book). When Madeline goes through some serious life issues, however, we discover that Guy is the one who decides to help her through it, even though Edward believes he is the only one Madeleine truly loves. Edward, often the catalyst for these issues, continually removes himself from the situations, rationalizes that things turn out the way they are meant to turn out, and goes about his business, pursuing his ambitions and his life in the theater. Guy, on the other hand, stays and does the dirty work of real life, sacrificing his incipient career, and attempting to appeal to Edward through the use of guilt and entitlement for having saved his life all those years ago. Tactics that do not, of course, work on the increasingly narcissistic Edward. All three of our main characters are actors, and all three bring different strengths, failings, and emotions to the stage and to their own lives. To take that notion just a step further, due to the book’s subject matter, all three could also be considered to represent the three main sections of Freud’s triumvirate of psychology: the id, the ego, and the superego. Is Guy an actual human being or Edward’s superego? Is Edward an actual complete human being or just the desires and conflicts of his own id? Is Madeline a love interest or Edward’s mother, Edward’s ego, Edward’s feminine? Why does every important woman in the book have a name that starts with “M?” Could it stand for “Mother?” Why does sexual conflict, infidelity, lack of deferment of gratification, and confusing gender issues revolve around the characters and their worlds? In the world of the theater, Guy’s two defining roles on the stage involve, first, an all-naked performance in a play that is never named, which he gives to rave s and which puts him on the fast track to stage success - and then later in the book, a disastrous turn in another unnamed Broadway play that is beset by accidents (and remember, in this story, a decidedly Freudian story, there are no accidents…), that effectively ends his career on the stage. Later, Madeleine is defined by two roles – Desdemona in “Othello” and Elena in Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya” (the former, a faithful, loving wife who is wronged by her jealous husband; the latter, a “lazy, selfish beautiful siren”). So, which is she, we may ask ourselves? When she is with Guy, they seem to have a loving marriage and a deep bond, and yet whenever Edward intermittently shows up from the road, full of his own needs and concerns, Madeleine always wraps her arms around him and opens herself to his sexual advances. We learn things about her marriage that could paint her as a long-suffering saint – or alternately, a lying little minx, and our question can only inevitably be determined by us. Edward, as an actor, is likewise defined by a series of important roles. The first is Chance Wayne, the blonde gigolo seducing an older woman in Tennessee Williams’ “Sweet Bird of Youth.” As it turns out, the woman he longs to seduce on the stage he also longs to seduce in real life. She is a dazzling and protective mother figure and, although she significantly helps him in his career and in his depth of emotional range, he is never able to get her into bed. We later witness a turn in Pinter’s “The Birthday Party” (a play which involves, threats, seductions and a nervous breakdown, with a sweet love song startlingly wedged in the middle), which Martin juxtaposes with an actual party in the book that mirrors these themes. Soon after, we find Edward successfully playing the role of the contemptuous Jean in “Miss Julie,” a Strindberg play in which a sadistic valet takes total control of his weak-willed mistress. (Are we seeing a pattern here?)Much is made of the Stanislavski process of method acting. Some of the greatest acting teachers in theater history are mentioned in the book as being the teachers for our main characters. Mining the sense memories we carry with us is a dangerous business. Our author seems to be asking whether it is harsh and deceptive to use a true tragedy in one’s life as a tool in a performance or merely cathartic and a way to offer significance not otherwise found. We are told that Guy never uses sense memory – all of his performances are the result of talented mimicry. He does not choose to lose himself, his true self, in a performance. Madeleine, we are told, is too emotionally involved in her characters, her fragile nature often conflicted and made sick by them. Edward, on the other hand, begins as an inauthentic actor and later learns to mine the world of his own history for truth in his performance, but to what end? Does he use his mother’s death as an acting strategy? Is his own guilt bound up in the way he takes advantage of his past? Martin’s casual language and matter-of fact writing style betray a depth that stays with the reader long after the story is over. She utilizes the quintessential age-old analogy, “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players” to great effect. Martin, however, seems to believe that the parts we choose to play define us, and the themes we choose to explore are not accidental. Obviously, the plays and roles chosen in this novel mirror the lives of the characters we meet. The depths of the emotions they need to fathom in order to bring authenticity to their roles are sometimes so fraught with their own histories and insecurities, that the parts they must play nearly overtake them, and in the end, threaten to ruin them altogether. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Jul 2011,"Dec 17, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6426472-the-confessions-of-edward-day

As much as I love the Jane Austen novels, the Brontes were a much darker clan, and Emily was probably the darkest still. This is not a book in which misunderstanding, betrayal, and hardship lead to eventual happiness ever after. It is not a book in which we suspect the characters will find the right course, that goodness and justice will win out in the end. It is a book in which tortured people do terrible things that lead to their eventual downfalls. It is a book about how painful it is to love someone, how agonizing passion can be, how first love can make you feel like you would rather be dead than alone (hence, its popularity among teen women and their grown-up counterparts). Who does not recall the physically altering feeling of wanting to be with someone more than you want to eat or breathe? Heathcliff is a fascination. He may be one of the most complex characters in literature. His capacity for love is as vast as his capacity for hatred. He is an amalgam of light and darkness, a paradox in his world. The gypsy boy raised by his adoptive father to be a gentleman, but treated as a servant by all around him, is an inherently noble person spurred on to vengeance by the cruelty of his surroundings and the spurning of his affections. It is an odd reversal of the usual story we have all heard in which the coarse, ignoble member of the riff raff becomes a man of virtue when raised to a state of prosperity. Heathcliff had goodness in him all along. He loses it among the narrow-minded sadists he encounters among the upper class. The man who becomes his father is the one exception to this continual onslaught of prejudice and cruelty, a vicious daily assault of injustices perpetrated by everyone from his adoptive brother to the servants in the manor. In fact, his father's death can be seen as a real turning point in Heathcliff's transition, as he is Heathcliff's one protector, and the one man who knows his true heart. Even Cathy vacillates in her understanding and love, so when Mr. Earnshaw dies, Heathcliff is truly lost. Despite his later madness and cruelty, it is difficult not to sympathize with Heathcliff's tortured soul. Perhaps that is one of the true virtues of this work, and ironically one of the myths that has ruined many fine women for all time. Heathcliff is the model for all of those men women think they can change. They see the pain in him, the struggle, and succumb to what I call ""wounded bird syndrome."" But Heathcliff, though fascinating, cannot be redeemed. He blazes a path of vengeance that eventually kills the only person he ever truly loved. Their consensual addiction to their twisted love is a scenario that has a very modern flavor, another reason for this novel's continual popularity. (It can be no accident that the novel figures heavily in the ""Twilight"" series. This is a theme repeated over and over again in history - the star-crossed lovers who cannot be together, who will only destroy each other. It was as relevant in Shakespeare's time as it is now.) You can say that there is the requisite happy ending in the coming together of Hareton and young Catherine as the book ends, that it is a symbolic extension of Cathy and Heathcliff's love, but I also feel Bronte was clever in cheating the reader of a true resolution - the bloodline is not Heathcliff's (if you recall Hareton is the son of Cathy's brother, not Heathcliff's actual son, though he has raised him as one.) Heathcliff is truly lost in this scenario, his death a complete erasure of the man, an experiment gone horribly wrong. This ambiguous aspect of the novel makes Bronte a far more interesting writer to me, as well. Her stance is more open to interpretation than one might suspect. Are we to believe those who feel she was espousing the postulate that only love survives in the end? That true love survives even beyond death? Perhaps. Or perhaps we are to believe the opposite, that the brief flicker of love was meant to be experienced on earth, and even that intensity is erased in the end. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Dec 15, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/348914.Wuthering_Heights

I feel I have livIt will be difficult for me to move back into my own home now that I have been residing at ""Wolf Hall"" for the past couple of weeks. I feel I have lived an entire lifetime there, an intimate observer in the court of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Thomas Cromwell has been my host in this place, and never has there been a host as ruggedly self-sufficient, capable and well-rounded as he. A dreamer and a realist at the same time, Hilary Mantel's Cromwell is as loyal a protector as he is ruthless competitor, as benevolent a father as he is determined materialist, and as refined a soul as he is a seasoned terrorist. In the film, I picture him played by Daniel Craig. The story of the Tudors is an old story. We have heard it in one form or another a hundred times. If that keeps you from picking up this book, it is a pity, because this story has never been told before. Utilizing the perfect device of perspective, Mantel has brought us a new hero in an old saga by telling us this story as Cromwell's story. Meticulously researched, Mantel gives us shocking new insights into people we thought we knew well. Thomas More, for instance, known mostly for ""Utopia"" now, seems deceptively kind and gentle when viewed solely by that work. But Mantel shows us a man who fiercely defended his opinions as God's opinions and was eager to mercilessly torture those who disagreed, a man who childishly sought the weakness in others to use to his advantage and amusement. King Henry, such a caricature of girth and homicide in most modern minds is shown as a paradox of a man, as capable of brilliant diplomacy as he is of careless disregard, as eager to erase his marriage of twenty six years through world-altering religious turmoil as he is to hunt fox and shoot arrows in the noonday sun. And that is the triumph of ""Wolf Hall."" Every member of the immediate court becomes a flesh and blood entity. These are no longer two-dimensional faces on paintings and relics, no longer archaic titles that have no breathing, feeling bodies attached. When you finish ""Wolf Hall"" you feel you have known these people, you understand the history of the time, you are a confidant within the court of England. Cromwell is a magnificent host. I will be the first in line to buy Mantel's next book, which continues the saga. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 29, 2010","Nov 05, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6101138-wolf-hall

I just knew I would feel the same rush of excitement I felt when I was introduced to Owen Meany or T.S. Garp, or Dr. Larch or even Susie the Bear, and first entered their strange and revelatory worlds. My palms were sweaty just thinking about it. I just knew this was the one. I knew it. And that was my first mistake. “Last Night in Twisted River” is an ambitious novel that tackles themes that might seem a natural progression for Irving who tackled themes relating to childhood, young love, lust, sexuality, infidelity, rebellion, and identity, in earlier books, then began to further explore themes related to parenting, child-rearing, loss, grief, success, human rights, and the nature of religion in later works, and now adds to those themes with an in-depth look at the nature of aging, dying, and coming to terms with one’s past decisions (not to mention a lengthy running theme about lethal grudges and warring factions that is meant to tie in to America’s political and military history, and our contemporary war on terrorism). In fact, there is a literal “running” theme of running away from danger, and of danger always following, always being right there at your heels. Compelling stuff, in theory. And let me be clear, I was not put off by either the themes or by the political platform (admittedly, Irving’s politics have usually mirrored my own, and his themes have always captivated me). In fact, I desperately wanted Irving to write a novel that illuminated those themes for me in a way that moved me, caused me to reflect, or even left me emotionally gutted, if necessary. At the very least, kept me engaged. None of those things, however, indeed, actually happened.Some s have criticized the fact that Irving seemed to be rehashing material he had used before, reaching into an old bag of tricks and trying to make something new out of it. Have these people not read Irving before? He started doing that in book two. In my opinion, this is part of Irving’s allure, part of his familiar voice, a little shout out to his cult following. We want to see the usual hallmarks. If you go to the carnival, you want to see a Ferris wheel. If you read a John Irving novel, you want to see some bears. And this novel does not disappoint on that front. He mentions most of the biggies: bears, wrestling, New Hampshire (even Exeter, by name), the draft, the usual “sexual suspects,” odd mixes of people living together in one big complex, the writing life, and even a shout out to his own books. It had all the elements. It really should have worked.So, why didn’t it? As a big fan of Mr. Irving (and I am – a huge fan), this novel seemed really self-indulgent. Stopping just short of building a soapbox, Irving preached his views rather than incorporating them into a well-crafted story. Irving certainly knows how to craft a brilliant story. In “Cider House Rules” he managed to take a volatile issue like abortion and explore it with depth and purpose through the lives of his very well-developed characters and the situations that were thrust upon them as they explored both the theme and their own feelings about it. Intelligent people on either side of that issue could have appreciated the story despite their feelings about the subject matter. But here, rather than having characters engrossed in situations that let the reader discern the struggles and inherent complexities of those situations, Irving just basically went on tirades that often seemed bombastic, and worse, unrelated to the material at hand. But even more troubling, in “Twisted River,” there also seemed to be an emotional disconnect, something I never detected in Irving’s other novels. Early in the book, for instance, we are introduced to a sympathetic maternal character who unexpectedly meets a tragic end at the hand of another main character, someone for whom the victim cares deeply and who supposedly cares deeply for her. The death is accidental, but never once do we feel that the victim is mourned, that her death is anything more than a convenient plot contrivance to further the theme. Not once are there any genuine feelings of grief expressed or of wistful remembrance or even of guilt or regret. More is made of the absurd logistics of disposing her body than of the affect she had on the child she cared for or the character who was her lover. She is forgotten almost as soon as her body is left behind. This type of emotional disconnect with various important characters occurred throughout the novel for me, and always made me cringe. I realize that part of Irving’s purpose was to convey to the reader that often people come into our lives unexpectedly and sometimes those people are just as unexpectedly removed from our lives; but, he also set these characters up as people we should care about. How can we care about them if they don’t seem to care about each other all that much? In fact, the very few attempts at emotional connection (usually merely sexual) bothered me almost as much as the many instances in which it was non-existent. For instance, at the end of the book, an emotional connection is actually forced upon us, and is so implausible in its ridiculousness as to border on insulting our intelligence. (I’ll just say it involves buying a suddenly urgent and deep love between two characters who met once, briefly, and haven’t had ANY contact in forty years.) I often found myself thinking that, perhaps in the writing of this novel, Irving had made a list of absurd images and plot developments in his head, all of which had to be strung together using the characters at hand, and, as such, the characters became mere props for those images, more important as plot contrivances than as genuine people actually witnessing or taking part in the events. Irving has written many books that involved plot contrivances and absurd situations, but in the best of those, I never once questioned the validity of the situations, and never once felt that the characters involved had less than authentic reactions to the events. In this book, nothing ever felt fully real or fully realized.  Another bothersome aspect for me involved the dialogue. Perhaps, in trying to capture the way he believed Coos County loggers would speak (or the way North End Sicilians would speak), Irving took a risk and went whole hog. Granted, for me, his river driver character, Ketchum, is the most interesting (and endearing) character in the book and makes for the most lively aspects of it, but Irving never quite makes the dialogue natural, not only with Ketchum but with most of the other characters, as well. Ketchum, in particular, comes off more as cartoon than man, (I always pictured him as a kind of fleshed out version of Yukon Cornelius from the “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” special). And Ketchum was my favorite character, so you can see how things deteriorated from there. As a last aside, (and just a pet peeve, really), I was also irritated with Irving’s obvious use of the Danny Angel character to mirror his own literary ascent. I don’t mind that he wrote a character based on himself or made reference to obvious milestones in his own career. That’s not it at all. It was the constant references to how great he was and how many famous people he knew and how rich he had become and how ignorant ALL those press people were who asked him such tedious questions and all those fans who mischaracterized his work and how he could never possibly answer all their letters. Ah yes, fame is so difficult and being great is such a chore. That grew tiresome rather quickly. So, my favorite author has written a book that I just don’t like. I’m sure he’ll get over my disapproval. As his friend and mentor, Kurt Vonnegut, (who is mentioned several times in the book) would say, “And so it goes.” The truth is, it doesn’t matter. My great love of many of his other novels is not diminished by my lack of love for this one. Would I have liked to have gotten some meaningful insights into these compelling themes from a man I have always admired and maybe idolized a little? Of course I would have. But if I am expecting to learn my life lessons from a John Irving novel, maybe I am already lost. If anyone is reading this , and has never read an Irving book before, please don’t let this stop you. In fact, go out and buy a copy of “A Prayer for Owen Meany” immediately. Trust me, you’ll never be the same. And you’ll love him, too – no matter what....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 05, 2010","Feb 08, 2011","Oct 22, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6323821-last-night-in-twisted-river

My love/hate relationship with “The Little Friend” makes it difficult for me to  in any coherent, linear fashion, so my apologies in advance. And there may be spoilers. 3.5 stars but I'm rounding up.First of all, the book is too long. I know, I know – the descriptive elements, the extravagant attention to detail, the elegant, hazy, evocative fragments of a Mississippi childhood full of crazy aunts and backyard theatrics, and real and imagined dangers, and meth-making poverty-stricken troublemakers, and…little friends…is why so many people love this book, but it is also why so many readers could not finish it. On the one hand, Tartt writes like a dream. You can see every single scene as if it is laid out before you, like a painting or a walking play. No detail is too small to be left out. No conversation too irrelevant to be ignored. And yet, in some ways, its greatest strength is also its greatest flaw. The descriptions are sheer perfection in their rendering, but there is just too much of a good thing. The reader can see that Tartt becomes lost in these reveries, lovingly recreating every moment, every cicada chirping, every wafting blade of grass, every item in the pantry, but so often these vignettes lead nowhere (not that they have to, I understand that) or lead to their destinations far too slowly, which creates a real problem for me with the pacing of the book. I know there are books that can be savored for their lush descriptive elements alone, and I love many such books, but this book gives us many reasons to expect more urgent pacing (the murder at the book’s beginning, the quest for answers, the Ratliff family, the SNAKES!) and too often leaves us to meander through page after page of minor characters who never matter and side trips that bear no fruit. So, I loved the writing and was frustrated with it in equal turns. I nearly stopped reading at least three or four times. So, why did I keep going?Harriet.Despite the issues with length and pacing, Harriet is one of the more interesting characters you will ever meet. This fierce, independent, inquisitive little pit bull of a girl is a force of nature. You keep reading just to find out what she will do or say or think next. Her relationship with her friend Hely makes for some of the strongest passages in the book for me, even when some of their antics become far-fetched, and their dialogue seems natural, born of a stage in life when everything is important, everything is “life and death” and you can only share it with your best friend. Harriet is navigating a difficult youth with a massive amount of bravado. Her brother has been murdered, her father has all but abandoned the family, her mother is useless, her sister vague and elusive, and the only person she seems to love is the maid she inadvertently gets fired, but, through it all, she has convictions and goals and a certain self-confidence born of her intelligence and interests. I would recommend that people read this if for no other reason than to meet Harriet Dufresnes. Okay, now for the meat of it all. Who is “The Little Friend,” who murdered Robin, and what is this book about anyway?Donna Tartt showed us in “The Secret History” that crimes often go unpunished. In that book, we knew who the culprits were, but society never would. Sometimes terrible things happen and no one is held accountable. We all know this is true, but as readers, we all want closure. For Harriet, the lesson hits hard. Her goal in life was to take revenge on the man she thought had murdered her brother, when in fact, he hadn’t murdered anyone, until the end, when his own brother is the victim. Had Harriet’s meddling caused that relationship to grow violent? Had it spurred the paranoia that caused events to escalate? We are left to wonder. And Harriet is left with a secret that will haunt her forever.We may not find out the identity of Robin’s killer, but there are many candidates for the title “Little Friend.” Harriet herself is the little friend to others in the book, Hely is her little friend. We learn near the end that rather than being an adversary to Robin, Danny was his little friend. These characters and others in the book start out in the usual world of childhood until something changes that world. For Danny, poverty and drugs changed his world and erased the promise of childhood. For Harriet, loss and tragedy mark the end of her childhood. For Hely, entitlement and popularity mark his transformation. Somewhere along the line, we all make the transition, we all stop being “the little friend” and have to decide who we are going to be in the world, how we are going to interact in a place so fraught with pitfalls and hardship. It is no mistake that the family homestead in the book was called “Tribulation.” This is a book about suffering, about difficulties, about things not turning out the way anyone hopes. The characters in “The Little Friend” have little control over the socioeconomic system in rural Mississippi that has guided their fates to a large degree. In the same way that Danny and the Ratliffs are born into their destinies, and Ida Rhew and Odean have little control over their lot in life, Harriet is born into the legacy of Tribulation. The only thing these characters have that is truly their own is how they react to their particular trials. A family from a home called Tribulation is surely going to have their share of sadness. But even when that home is torn down, erased from town history, nothing but a cornerstone, they all miss it terribly and remember it fondly. Isn’t that just life? All of our stories are tinged with loss and sadness at one time or another, some more difficult than others, but usually there is a nostalgia that recalls the sweeter memories of childhood and makes us willing to relive the past, no matter how difficult....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"May 28, 2019","Aug 26, 2019","Oct 13, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/775346.The_Little_Friend

Three stars seems kind of paltry in my estimation for a book that I started a day and half ago and that was so thoroughly riveting that I stayed up almost all night to finish it. There was absolutely no way on earth I could have allowed myself to sleep last night with but a few measly pages standing between me and either the confirmation or refutation of my fears. So, let me tell you why you should read this book - and I do recommend it, even highly for some - before I get into the less compelling reasons I gave this three stars instead of four. First of all, this is the fictional equivalent of a roller coaster ride, and I say that as a compliment. From the moment you get on board, everything flies by in a colorful blur of exhilarating images and distorted emotions, until you are not sure if the screams are from excitement or pure terror. Pages fly by before you even realize you have read them, and I am not a fast reader. In fact, I almost pride myself on that trait, since I like to savor the books I read and pay attention to the nuances. I completed this book in two nights (the first night constituting a mere hour or so of reading and the second composed of several hours of obsessive reading with the book glued to my hand). For any book to maintain that level of interest and exhilaration alone makes it a worthwhile read. Lehane is also a master of character. This is a not a story dependent upon character development as much as plotline, but somehow Lehane takes us inside the characters immediately - their body language, turns of phrase, the snippets of history we are allowed to glimpse, the way they interact with others. Lehane always gives us enough to care. And then there is the island. A desolate, mysterious little tract of land off the coast of Boston, housing a fortress filled with the criminally insane. Add an escaped prisoner who would have had to have walked through walls to get out, a couple of doctors out of an Ira Levin plotline, and a hurricane that cuts off all communication with the mainland and you have yourselves all the elements of a first-rate nightmare. Add in a heroic US Marshall grieving over his murdered wife and wrestling with fleeting thoughts of suicide, and suddenly it is impossible not to be fully invested in the fate of this protagonist.So, why three stars instead of four? This is a book dependent upon the big reveal. Unfortunately, I saw it coming a short way through the book. Had the book succeeded in surprising me - hell, I would have given it five stars. But being able to piece so much of the truth together on my own seemed like a bit of a flaw in the narrative. Just my opinion. Did it harm my enjoyment of the book? Not at all. A great, breathless, carnival ride of a book. If that sounds appealing - and why shouldn't it? - do yourself a favor and spend a night or two with this absorbing read. How often does a few hours spent sitting in a chair get to feel like that?...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jan 30, 2010","Feb 05, 2010","Oct 06, 2009",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21686.Shutter_Island

It is not just that his tale is set in an earlier time period with cities that may no longer exist in their ancient forms. Nor is it just that a city is a sociological beast, a place that only exists as defined by a group of people who populate it on a particular date in history, slightly different the day before or the day yet to come. Calvino knows that each city is a dynamic, ever-changing social habitat couched in struts and beams, offering its own unique resources for consumption, but existing wholly as an imagined construction, a hollow shell without the plans and needs of those who reside there. Calvino's cities are the cities of the mind, places that spring from the imagination, some of which can only exist because someone has thought of them. And some are not cities at all. If a  that begins with such a conceptual framework is intriguing to you, then you should put ""Invisible Cities"" on your ""to-read"" list immediately. If not, I recommend passing it by. And I seriously mean that, with no judgment one way or the other. This a book for lovers of abstract thought, for those who enjoy having their perspectives challenged and who do not mind being led by confusing clues into disorienting places only to find that any answers that ultimately come, do so, as usual, from within. Unconventional notions, a loose framework housing flights of fancy and raw emotion, horror rendered as poetry, desires built into cities, cities made into women, it all gets a bit heady at times. If you like a straightforward narrative that is either plot-driven or character-driven and has clear situations that are ultimately resolved, you will not enjoy this book. There is no plot. There are two characters, Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, and even though we know they existed and are quite real in the records of history, this is not Khan and Polo, but creations of who Khan and Polo might be as imagined by Calvino for the purposes of embodying other entities, perhaps his own, or perhaps those of society at large, or perhaps both. There is no story, per se, except the one important linear thread: Polo describes a series of cities to Khan that are meant to embody the cities of Khan's own crumbling empire. We learn along the way, however, that these cities are most likely not cities Polo has seen on his travels, (some are not even cities that could logistically exist), but are an inner city that Polo decribes differently every time, depending upon his particular mood, viewpoint, outlook on humanity, relationship with desire or mortality, philosophical bent or ideological perspective. Khan comes to believe that each description is a different take on Polo's own home city of Venice, and that every city reflects every other city in the end. As you can see, this is that rare conceptual piece that is about, well, everyone. It is about society and social constructs in its depictions of fantastical cities and the people who build them and reside in them, and it is about the individual in that no city exists without first residing as an image in the mind of a creator, and no inhabitant has an image of his own city that is not informed by his own psychology or philosophy. Calvino echoes what Anais Nin once brilliantly observed, ""We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are."" How Calvino's cities take shape also provide commentary on the human condition. Some are formed out of fear, out of desire, out of a yearning for lost youth or as a makeshift response to war or forced exodus. Oh, and each city is named for a woman. Make of that what you will. The book has surely been compared to many other famous works, although it resembles nothing conceived before. For my part, as I read it, I was reminded of two other works, one ancient and one modern. In its lush, textural and exotic descriptions and its framework of stories being told to appease and entertain a powerful ruler, it reminded me of ""1001 Arabian Nights."" The dynamic, the stories, all quite different, but still the reference to that work is not lost on the reader if only due to the parallels of nightly stories and ancient origins. Oddly, the modern work that paralleled this one for me was ""Einstein's Dreams."" Like ""Invisible Cities"" that book offered mind-altering perspectives of one concept (time) told in a series of short vignettes, each of which contains a new look at an old theme and a conceptual framework that challenges the reader, both in terms of the abstract world of physics and the abstract world of philosophy. Calvino similarly offers stunning vistas of the mind in his series of vignettes about one subject, cities. Cities and Signs, Cities and Desire, Thin Cities. Calvino describes these and many others for us to ponder and explore in the realms of our own imaginations, but in the end, all of them have one distinguishing feature. They are all, collectively, invisible. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 05, 2010","Aug 28, 2010","Sep 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9809.Invisible_Cities

The pursuit is meant to lend specificity to the character, hopefully translating to a greater universality in the way an audience relates to the character. When Lipton sticks to the words of the actors as they discuss the way they craft a role, this book is bright and engaging and can even spark a greater understanding of interpersonal relationships on a larger scale. Sadly, though, much of the book has nothing to do with ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" and more to do with ""Inside the Ego of James Lipton"" and that is a massive place populated with every famous brush with greatness he has ever had, every celebrity he has ever shared a room with and every accomplishment worthy of his own self-congratulatory pat on the back. Yes, Mr. Lipton has had a very interesting life and met some very famous people, and all of that could have been truly fascinating had it been an exercise in letting us have an insight into their lives rather than a vanity piece dedicated to each time Lipton was mentioned in a conversation or every clever thing HE ever said to THEM. The need for approval was so desperate at times it became embarrassing. Some autobiographies transcend the details and become about something more, something with which the reader can identify, a story the reader begins to share on a more meaningful level. For all his immersion in the world of people who create connections and tell greater truths for a living, Lipton himself seems to have no understanding of that human element in his own writing. Lipton's life and background contain fascinating characters and some really interesting occurrences. They could have made for a powerful accompaniment to the details of the show and the talk of craft. Instead they became an unwelcome source of tedium as I skimmed in search of the next excerpt relating to craft and creation. Five good chapters in a book containing far more chapters than five. Maybe Lipton should have put the details of his life into the hands of a writer trained under his tutelage. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 05, 2010","Feb 12, 2010","Sep 15, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1797440.Inside_Inside

Why else would I be so fascinated by the lives of the men who set sail on voyages of discovery, risking all to find lost continents, the fabled Northwest passage, or the elusive “terra australis?” And why else would I be so enamored of the sea and so terrified by it, in equal parts? Reading accounts of early voyages, one truly understands the 18th century aphorism quoted above. Wooden ships of the day were often nothing more than floating deathtraps with rudimentary equipment, inadequate nutritional reserves, mutinous sailors, rats, filth, and untreatable diseases that could sweep through a ship and ravage its crew at any moment. Barring those perils, if injury or drowning could be avoided, generally scurvy would get you regardless. Those who survived at all rarely thrived under such conditions, particularly since these ships of discovery were often on voyages lasting several years at a time. What kind of man would have the wherewithal, the constitution, the intellect, the bearing, the wanderlust, the stoicism, the curiosity, the luck, and the basic common sense to not only thrive at sea, but set off on three separate voyages of discovery (in his forties, no less!) that changed the face of every map that existed during his lifetime? Captain Cook, of course, would be that man. His story is remarkable in every possible way. He came from absolutely nothing. He was a poor Yorkshire farm boy, who like most of the poor Yorkshire farm boys of his time, could probably have hoped for little more than a hard, bucolic life with few conveniences and little opportunity of ever traveling more than a few miles beyond his home. Most people of his time lived and died in the shadow of the same small churchyard. Yet Cook ended up traveling hundreds of thousands of miles in his lifetime, reaching parts of the globe no one had ever reached before him and circumnavigating the globe several times over. How did this modest man with little schooling, no means, and no lofty connections raise himself up to become a captain in the Royal Navy and possibly the greatest explorer of all time? Tony Horwitz became obsessed with this very same question and set off on his own journey of discovery to not only chart the progress of Cook’s three very famous voyages, but also to try to uncover the character of the real Captain Cook, a man who has been both honored and vilified by cultures across the globe for over two centuries, cultures for whom Cook seems to signify many things to many people. Horwitz is a fantastically engaging writer. His casual humor and wry observations put one in mind of Bill Bryson, a comparison which I consider a huge compliment. Horwitz knew he wanted to tell Cook’s story in a way that would be historically accurate but also would be appealing and readable. So, he decided to intersperse the details of Cook’s voyages (all of which are fascinating in every detail in and of themselves) with the story of his own voyage to “boldly go where Captain Cook has gone before.” This was a brilliant tack, and I’ll tell you why. From reading the journals of Cook and his men, it is obvious that Cook was in many ways the first true anthropologist. Yes, others made contact with native peoples before him, but Cook seemed to be the first real practitioner of what modern anthropologists call “cultural relativity,” the notion of accepting the practices, beliefs and traditions of other cultures, learning and observing without judgment, and attempting to make a positive impact without too greatly affecting the culture as a whole. Now, granted, this was the 1700s and not everything went off quite the way Cook would have liked, but that’s all detailed in the book. Suffice to say, Cook was sort of the Jean-Luc Picard of sea exploration (if you understand that reference you’re as big a dork as I am). He wanted to find new frontiers, chart new territory, experience rare flora and fauna, try new cuisine (he was a VERY adventurous eater) and truly make connections with native peoples – not to exploit them, as colonists would, not to strip their resources, as so many others would in his wake, but to see the world and discover all there was to discover just for the sake of doing it – and being the first to do so. If he were alive today, he’d be volunteering for missions to Mars. Horwitz, on the other hand, is a journalist who knows the world has been discovered several hundred times over and wants really just to discover Cook. The real Cook. Not the symbol, not the hero or anti-hero. His mission is to uncover the truth under mountains of supposition. In doing so, he visits many of the same places that Cook visited and details the modern conditions of those peoples in ways that were all largely affected by Cook’s discovery of them. Sure, if not Cook, someone else would have done so – maybe fifty years later, maybe a hundred. But Cook was first, and because of that, many cultures see him -and maybe rightly so - as the villain who opened them up to the hordes of Europeans who later came and decimated them. Symbols are powerful things, and Cook became a symbol for his nation and all Western nations who raped the land and its people. It’s anthropology in action: Cook’s journals detailing the pristine cultures on first contact; Horwitz writing about the long-term effects of colonial influence on modern peoples. It’s all as sobering as it is fascinating, and the modern story has as many “discoveries” as Cook’s did. Horwitz keeps it moving along, at just the right pace, and he adds color and comic relief by embarking on many of his journeys with his hard-partying friend Roger, another Yorkshire man who hightailed it to Australia, (though that’s where the Cook analogy ends). Roger’s jaded demeanor and pithy observations often put things back in perspective when Horwitz’s quest for the truth and Cook’s idealistic legacy meet incongruous modern roadblocks. It took me awhile to get used to Roger, but once I did, I was glad to have him along for the ride. There are so many facets to this book, so much history and lore; it is difficult to even write a synopsis. Patrick O’Brian fans will note the similarity between the relationship of Cook and Joseph Banks (the young botanist and upper crust adventurer who accompanied Cook on his storied first voyage) to that of Aubrey and Maturin. Others will note the appearance of William Bligh in the crew of Cook’s third voyage, a man who would make history on “The Bounty” soon afterwards. Cook went everywhere. Literally everywhere. From Polynesia to Antarctica. He looked for the Northwest Passage, and befriended Maori cannibals. Through it all he seems to have been largely a man of principle, fidelity and acceptance in a world so often unlike him, someone who managed to meet the world on his terms and not necessarily those of his Eurocentric brethren. Hopefully, through Tony Horwitz, people will come away with a clearer picture of this captain, mathematician, adventurer, astronomer, and yes, anthropologist, who truly went where no white man had gone before - and sometimes beyond that - to where no one in the human race had ever gone before. And when he was done, he packed up and did it all over again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jul 13, 2011","Sep 15, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/94529.Blue_Latitudes

Well, stranger things have happened. Has this book helped me in my own romantic relationships? No, not even a little. But has it helped me to understand the people in my life better? Absolutely. This is a book that provides some really sound insights into the way people express love, and it is eye-opening in its revelations. I realized that in my own life I have often come to erroneous conclusions about whether or not someone had the proper depth of feeling for me based solely on observations of them seen through the lens of my own style of expressing love - and not necessarily theirs. I began to see the various styles more clearly, and understand how two people can love each other deeply and yet feel they are trapped in a loveless relationship. Sounds a bit corny, but read this book, and I guarantee there will be a number of moments when your mouth drops open because you just remembered a time in your life when someone expressed love and you did not see it for what it was. Or when you tried to show someone you cared and it went over like a lead balloon. You will see your family members in here, your coworkers, your friends, and you will understand them all a bit better, and feel a tolerance and understanding you may not have felt before. This book is neither preachy nor gushing; it is a practical, interesting, insightful look at relationship styles - and even if it doesn't make an impact on the relationship you have - it may just make an impact on your next choice, by showing you your ""love language"" and pointing you in the direction of the person who shares that language. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 24, 2007","Sep 09, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/567795.The_Five_Love_Languages

She would make an Umberto Eco noveIn Lisbeth Salander, Stieg Larsson has created one of the most intriguing and complex characters in modern fiction. She would make an Umberto Eco novel readable just by walking through it. Hell, she would be interesting if she turned up in ""The Bridges of Madison County."" And trust me, Madison County would never recover. But even though this second novel in Larsson's trilogy is far weaker for me than his first (which I tore through and to which I gave five stars without a moment's consideration to another rating), it is worth the journey for many reasons, not the least of which is Salander. This diminutive genius with serious issues from her past and a resolutely anti-social nature to the extreme makes you wonder not only what she will do next or how she will get out of this mess, but sometimes merely makes you wonder ""What is she thinking about now?"" How often does a character in a popular fiction novel make you wonder about the workings of her mind and the content of her inner self? Luckily, Larsson became smitten with his character enough to write three books devoted to her, and that is his gift to humanity. Even in a book whose sometimes ludicrous contrivances and unbelievably bizarre characters test the bounds of suspension of disbelief even in those who devoured the first book and came into this one as fans, there is still plenty to like. Most notably, Larsson's dedication to feminism. In a global climate that has seen a feminist backlash for decades now, Larsson shows us in a more effective way than any sociological study or political stance, that we live in a world where a lot of men hate women. We just do. Simple as that. His characters inhabit this misogynistic climate with a desire to champion those who are damaged by it. Larsson depicts the lives of women in ways that other men have not attempted in popular fiction, and I admire his courage. In this novel, he takes on the sex trade, pitting our heroine Salander and our idealistic reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, against a host of perverts, thugs, skilled criminals, corrupt officers and politicians, and the rabid hyenas that make up the world of the tabloid news (or just ""the news"" since it's all pretty much tabloid at this point). Utilizing this scenario, Larsson is able to depict a number of the atrocities that occur in society on a regular basis and make a statement about how society often allows and perpetuates these atrocities by virtue of its long-held prejudices and disregard for human dignity. So, a preachy tirade with political undertones? No, not so much. More, a riveting nailbiter that has a good many twists and turns and delves deep into the backstory of a fascinating character. Granted, this novel had quite a few too many coincidences for my liking, and the action scenes held way too many head-scratchers, but for those who loved the first book, keep in mind that you get to spend some more time with Lisbeth Salander, who is always worth the price of admission. And, from what I've heard, the middle book is supposedly a bridge to the far superior third book in the set.

I will tell youGoodreads ought to have a half star option, as I would give this nicely-written mystery three and a half stars rather than just three. I will tell you why I liked the book and then I will tell you what caused me to stumble occasionally, but all in all a better-than-average offering in a genre that often suffers from formulaic scenarios and pat endings, neither of which you will find in this book. This is a tale of two stories intertwined: one the tale of three children who go into the woods one summer day only to see one return, a boy whose shoes are full of blood and who is unable to remember what has befallen his mates; and the second, the story of another child murdered in the same woods over twenty years later, a crime now investigated by the boy who was spared in the first scenario, who has now become a police investigator. But more than that, it is the story of the close bond between that investigator and his female partner, Cassie Maddox, who truly becomes the heroine of the novel. The suspenseful plot, which winds the two perhaps-unrelated crimes together, definitely packs a wallop and keeps the reader interested. Cassie, too, is a force of nature, and a unique character that I grew to admire greatly. Rob, her partner, wrestling with demons from his past, was a far more difficult character for me to understand, his adulation for Cassie often reaching ridiculous heights of hyperbole and poetic extremes despite the fact that his subsequent withdrawal from her later in the book borders on outright mental cruelty. But that may be the strength of this book in an odd way. At its core it is a book about about psychology - the pathology, the neuroses, the driving forces within our heads that make us display behaviors that are complex and sometimes inexplicable. From Rob's passive aggressive way with the ladies to Cassie's frequent nightmares to Rob's roommate Heather's anal need for order to their colleague Sam's continual optimism and desire for ethical behavior in all situations, this is a tale of what motivates us all, and within that concept is the not-so-subtle implication of why those motives do or do not become criminal motives. In that way, this book transcends many others of its genre. What bothered me about the book was this: Rob's voice did not feel like a man's voice to me on a number of occasions. There are many women authors who write in a man's voice and do so very well. I am not saying that Tana French is not one of those writers, I'm just saying that, for me, Rob was one odd dude. That Cassie, on the other hand, was so well-drawn and her actions and dialogue so much more believable speaks volumes for me. Another minor issue I had with the book was that I saw the driving force behind the crime for what she was probably the second she was introduced in the book. I don't think there's a woman who would have been snowed by her. Rob seems to think the revelation is a stunner once we finally learn the identity, but I think any woman reader saw it coming all along. We have all met this woman on one occasion or another, though possibly not one of such nefarious extremes. Or maybe so. Anyone who expected a nice tidy wrap-up for this book where all questions are answered and all criminals from all crimes are revealed and brought to justice has been watching a little too much ""Law and Order."" Thank God Tana French wasn't. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 10, 2009","Aug 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/237209.In_the_Woods

Larsson's plot revolves around the lives of two main characters, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, both of them incredibly flawed people with immense issues, complex lives, and multifacted personalities. They don't even meet until deep into the storyline. In fact, throughout the book I was never quite sure if either of them was a person I could ever have warmed up to in real life. And it didn't matter one bit. Each of them was a fascination to me, and I truly felt like a voyeur peering into their unusual lives. There are so many things going on in the book all at once - a missing persons case, a dark secret, a series of ancient murders, and an ongoing parallel story of financial espionage and fraud. There are also running threads throughout the book which deal with the prevalence of misogyny and ethnic prejudice in society, linking them in the archaic murders as well as modern culture. Clearly, the author is telling us that we have not even begun to address these issues no matter how progressive and modern we claim ourselves to be. Larsson also gives us some rather disturbing images along the way that will never be erased from memory. This plot has some truly dark moments and the author spares us nothing in his exposure of the harsh and brutal side of human nature. One might think the book could become bogged down in the multiple plotlines, the dark themes, too laden with with its own complexity and rife with confusing details. Quite the opposite. Each piece of the story is brilliantly described and seamlessly integrated into the whole. The setting of the Swedish countryside adds an eerie chill to the drama, and lends a somber tone of isolation and severity to the investigation at hand. But more than that, Larsson has given us some unique characters that no one else could have created, and a story so cleverly devised one wonders how he came up with it at all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Sep 04, 2009","Aug 06, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2429135.The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo

In person, FergusI was given this book as a gift by someone who knows I am a fan of the comedian's late night talk show and stand-up comedy routines. In person, Ferguson is a master of walking that tightrope between lunacy and sly intelligence. I admire that. So admittedly, I went into this novel with (perhaps unrealistic) high hopes that his fiction-writing style would emulate his comedic style. That said, I probably should not have expected the book to be funny, which I did, and which it was not. Not at all. Nor should it be. My preconceived notions about its expected humor are not Ferguson's concern, and that's fine. Yes, the book is laden with absurdity and filled with clever, sardonic comments about human nature and the state of the world, but funny it is not. I laughed out loud, exactly once, on page 300, when a particular moment struck me as amusing. On the other hand, all that the book lacks in humor it fills in with bitterness. It is an angry book, cynical and sometimes vindictive, the absurdist descriptions often used as a blunt instrument against whichever sector of the populace Ferguson deems unworthy at the time. Does this mean I did not like the book? Actually, and surprisingly, even to me, no. I ended up liking the book, despite its many flaws, the way I am able to like many people despite their flaws (and I'm quite sure the same way many people like me despite my own). Granted, I was languishing in a limbo of frustration and disappointment fully a third of the way through the book. I nearly put it down and moved on, until a Goodreads acquaintance who had read the book encouraged me to stick with it, as it would ""get better."" And amazingly enough, it did get better. Quite a bit better. The concept underlying the initial bitterness began to take hold and color the remaining narrative. And it's a good concept, one that has as its philosophical core a belief that all humans should concentrate on helping others and avoid the errors of perceived infallibility. A very good concept indeed. And characters I previously despised suddenly became less despicable, less unworthy of my time and commitment. The storytelling began to take hold and become far more captivating. Magic infused the plotline and new characters bolstered the sudden momentum. By the time I had finished the book I was a little sad as I felt it had finally reached its stride. Ferguson needs to practice the craft of fiction writing a bit more, as he tells us far too much that he could be showing us. There is also the hint of pretention in much of his ranting, and a sense of ""look what I know that you probably don't."" It is a quality I despise in writers like Umberto Eco, but one I feel quite willing to overlook in Ferguson since the premise and underlying decency of the story excused many of its problems - and because I just plain like Ferguson so much. On the plus side, several of the characters' visions and unique stories were quite inventive and compelling. Scenes involving visions of Carl Jung and Fatty Arbuckle should not have worked, but did. And the diverse storylines really converged in a meaningful way as the story unfolded. So, a book I wanted to love and ended up hating for fully a third of the way redeemed itself and became a book I reservedly liked. That said, I am glad I finished it and even felt suprisingly uplifted by the material. And I look forward to Ferguson's next offering. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 09, 2009","Aug 02, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/134203.Between_the_Bridge_and_the_River

Even more so if you happened to be an Irish beat cop in the North End with terrorist neighbors, a politically connected family, an undercover job infiltrating anarchist groups, and an African American buddy who happens to be running from the law for the murder of a drug dealer in Tulsa. In ""The Given Day,"" Dennis Lehane has done more than write a big, riveting story, he has captured a time in history and made it come alive for generations of readers who might otherwise never have imagined the intense, often tragic and violent social history of their fair city. Cleverly interweaving vignettes about Babe Ruth (then a Red Sock, soon to be traded and become the cause of an 86 year curse) and some truly astonishing current events of the time, Lehane paints a very precise portrait of a country in flux, torn by inner conflict, beset by threats of Communist infiltration, racial tensions, ethnic enclaves, poverty, political corruption, and the Spanish influenza. This is my first Dennis Lehane book, though I have no idea what has kept me from him for so long. After all, as well-established and critically-acclaimed as he is nationwide, he is even more highly revered here in New England, and his familiar settings are an attractive feature of his writing for local readers. On that note, I will admit that I may be a bit biased in my regard for this book, as I found it fascinating to have Mr. Lehane tell me what the same streets I have seen many times must have been like in 1919. Hanover Street, a bustling tourist spot where gourmet Italian restaurants and sumptious bakeries now line the cobbled sidewalks, was once a sequestered enclave of dirt roads where goats and pigs roamed at will and chickens outnumbered humans as inhabitants in almost every apartment. The description of the Great Molasses Flood alone was truly astonishing. This very real occurrence in which a huge molasses tank exploded and hit Boston like a tsunami of molten sugar was something I knew about vaguely but only truly understood after the sad and shocking images Lehane detailed in this story. Moreover, the rioting caused by the Boston Police strike was described in horrific detail and gave as sobering a look at human nature as any great work of fiction ever has. I am embarrassed by all of the historical events I did not know and am indebted to this book for enlightening me in a way that will stick with me permanently and not fade like so much grade school memorization. The pervasive influence of various anarchist and workers groups during that time and the real threat they posed to the government was an eye-opener for me, as was the way law-abiding citizens were kept at the poverty level and unable to organize for betterment due to the possibility of being characterized as Bolsheviks or traitors to America. Attempts to thwart minority groups from gaining small strides in the power circles was also enlightening, though sadly not a surprise. Vignettes involving political figures of the time (from J. Edgar Hoover to then-governor Coolidge) have altered my view of them in history and the small character piece relating the intelligence and good work of James Jackson Storrow will now come to mind every time I see the turn-off for Storrow Drive.Many writers might have taken scenes from American history and used the characters as puppets to illustrate the historical events. Lehane transcends this common manipulation by giving us a tale that at its core is really about family, about friendship, and about the bonds that people form in life, whether due to - or regardless of - the external circumstances. If we did not care for the main characters in this work (namely Danny Coughlin and Luther Laurence) we would not have a story, we would have a history lesson. Danny and Luther bind us to the events because we want them to succeed, we are worried about them, we celebrate their small triumphs and care about their failures. The Irish beat cop and the African-American fugitive seem worlds apart, but they are both casualties of circumstance, men who wish to control their own destinies but have little opportunity to do so in a world controlled by others, men who wish to live contented lives with the loved ones of their choice, but who have to battle outside forces in order to do so. Yes, their story takes place in 1919, within the swirl of that social and political climate, but their core struggle, the struggle for autonomy and social justice in an unjust world is as modern as it is ancient. That's what makes ""The Given Day"" an emotionally powerful read as opposed to just a history lesson. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Dec 27, 2009","Jul 28, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2830067-the-given-day

If one were to hear the tale of the Monster of Florence without being first told that it was a true story, it would seem to have all of the elements of a work of fiction. Only no one would believe it. The characters would seem impossibly drawn, many of them grotesque and heinous, the plot line would seem filled with the types of corruption and miscarriages of justice that just do not occur in civilized Western society, and the resolution would seem outlandish to the point of disbelief. Welcome to Florence. I have rarely been so fascinated by a true crime case, and also rarely felt such genuine outrage toward the social climate that would allow repeated travesties of justice to occur. Because of the jaw-dropping ineptitude of the law enforcement systems of Florence and Perugia, dozens of innocent people's lives have been ruined due to this one case, (god knows how many other cases in the region have caused similar atrocities to the innocent), still more have been incarcerated for years at a time for crimes they did not commit, and power-hungry control freaks with mental delusions that border on clinical narcissism have been allowed to linger in high posts within the police force, (namely Giuttari and Mignini), making arrests based on the ravings of a crazy old psychic obsessed with satanic cults and sexual deviance. Not to mention the fact that this same ineptitude has ensured that the real killer still remains free and uncharged with any crime. Good system, that one. In the reading of this book, the first portion of it, dealing with the chilling descriptions of the serial killer at large - and journalist Mario Spezi's sensible and well documented investigation of the crimes -was fascinating to read. The killer, and his hold on the city, makes for an interesting book in and of itself. The descriptions of Florence and its storied history also create a strange juxtaposition to the crimes, giving a sense of surreal disbelief to the notion that such a beautiful region of the world, known for its scenic beauty and cultural magnificence spawned such evil. But the second portion of the book, when justice became the plaything of idiots and publicity-seekers, absolutely incensed me. That so much damage could have been done by the very people entrusted with the security of this portion of the world, that lurid, unsubstantiated claims made by delusional fools could supercede solid police procedure and adept crime scene methods, that ridiculous rants and personal vendettas overcame such modern techniques as trace evidence and DNA testing is mind-boggling. Florence (and Perugia) seem to be basing their law enforcement techniques on witch-hunting methods and convoluted logic that would have been archaic even in the 1400's. The truly sad part of it is that the same lunatic of law enforcement that railroaded so many innocents in the Monster case (and who is currently under indictment for a host of crimes related to falsification of evidence and other atrocities in that investigation) is the same lunatic beng allowed to railroad Amanda Knox in the highly publicized case in the same region. I am stunned that no one has intervened to save that poor girl and her boyfriend. The deranged inspector (Mignini) is using the same wildly inaccurate postulate about satanic ritual and sexual orgies being the motivation in that murder that he used in the unrelated Monster case (and by which he scandalized dozens of innocent residents, all of whom should sue him for defamation of character). Not to mention the fact that all of his ideas come from a psychic website run by a crazy woman that he habitually visits and whose website he quotes verbatim. Preston spends a final chapter detailing the corresponding atrocities in both cases (The Monster case and the Knox case) which makes us realize quite vividly that Amanda Knox chose the wrong Italian city within which to reside. Corrupt Perugia may never let her go even though she is surely innocent. Those who have read Preston's fiction know that he can spin a good yarn and build the momentum of the story to a chilling climax. He does the same here, only this time there is no happy ending in sight. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Aug 24, 2009","Jul 27, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2198274.The_Monster_of_Florence

The first one I read was her miraculous gem of a book, ""Bel Canto."" The second was the solid, beautifully cadenced tale of a Boston family called ""Run."" When I discovered that ""The Patron Saint of Liars"" was Patchett's first novel, I assumed that the two books I named above, which came later and which I both adore, would be better crafted, more intricate, more resonant. Turns out her first novel is the one I love the best. And that's saying something. Patchett is an extraordinary writer, able to capture characters like no one else writing today. Every word her characters utter sounds authentic, every thought the reader is allowed to witness rings true. These people are so fully realized and so wholly three dimensional that by the end of the book you are certain you know them and, oddly enough, you feel they might even know you. This is not even a book you read; it is a book you feel. First, let me just say, please do not be frightened away by the subject matter. Especially the men out there. Yes, this is a book about a home for unwed mothers, the same way ""The Cider House Rules"" is a book about an orphanage or ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is a book about a mental institution. It is and it isn't. No, Patchett's book is not a sweeping saga or a morality tale or a complex and didactic puzzle. It is also not ""chick lit."" I become very disturbed by the fact that virtually every book written by a woman runs the risk of being marginalized as some sort of fluff. If a man had written this book - or any of Patchett's books, for that matter, it would be heralded as a marvel of modern literature. And it is not that, either. It is merely a book about three people. Three brilliantly fleshed out people. And all of the other souls who come and go in the lives of those three people during the time we are allowed to spend with them. I rarely dogear books, but every now and then an image or sentence will capture a moment so perfectly, I have to remember where it was. The first time I did this was when Rose, the first character we meet, has just discovered she is pregnant and has run away from her home in California, abandoning her young husband, to go to a Catholic-run home for unwed mothers in Habit, Kentucky. As she enters a room full of pregnant girls, she describes the experience as ""a gathering of distended abdomens, overinflated balloons from which small wisps of girls were attached. I felt that surely I had come to the wrong place, that whatever these girls had was not what was wrong with me."" Rose, we come to discover is someone always itching to leave. She drives for no reason, collecting maps, studying routes. When conflict arises, her inner voice says, ""Flee."" She becomes fascinating to the reader because of the temporary nature of her presence. One never knows when she might disappear again, and always for good. The second character we meet is Son (short for Wilson), and I have to say he is now easily one of the finest characters I have ever met. The way I feel about Son is only slightly less intense than the way I feel about Atticus Finch. They were definitely cut from the same cloth, but Son would be the poor man's Atticus Finch, with a few more demons in his past. In Rose, we fear the fleeting nature of her promises, while in Son we fear for his permanence. He is the one who will always be there to hold everything together, even if it may not be what's best for him. Like Rose, he too initially fled a bad past, but when he landed in Habit, Kentucky, his legs took root, and his presence becomes as strong and comforting as an oak tree. In the dynamic between Rose and Son we learn about the way secrets shape people, what makes some people stay and what makes others run. Our third character, Cecilia, is a child growing up at a home for unwed mothers, doted on by pregnant girls and nuns, the Scout to Son's Atticus. Her life is a motif of continual loss (all the girls who have their babies and eventually leave), and her musings on the loss of a beloved person in her life strikes a chord with anyone who has ever lost someone - or feared losing someone. At one point she says, ""She was lost, like a ring you swore you'd never take off but did, put it in your pocket, and the next thing you knew it was gone. The places to begin looking are as many as the breaths you took in a day. More than that. She could be anywhere, and by the time I got there, she could be someplace else again."" Cecilia becomes the bridge between two disparate themes, the need to leave and the desire to stay. Her relationship with her father is so perfectly written, their daily interactions so natural, I couldn't help but feel nostalgia. At one point, when Son is injured, there are passages that describe that terrifying feeling you have when, for the first time, you realize your father is getting old, that you may have to be the one to care for him, that he may need your help and you may not know how to help him. I'm not one to cry easily at books or films, but several times the scenes were so achingly real and so mindful of those people I have known in my own life, feelings I have had exactly the way the characters experience them, that I felt a tear or two roll down my cheek. I'm not proud. I admit it. On a side note, there are several characters in the book who are nuns. As a girl who was raised as a Catholic, went to parochial school for a time, and had a great aunt who was a nun (a beautiful energetic little sprite of a woman), I can guarantee that these characterizations were absolutely perfect. I have known several nuns who resemble those in the book, and the most lovely of those, Sister Evangeline, the nun who runs the kitchen and has a gift for clairvoyance, able to predict the sex of all the babies and a few of the machinations of those in her circle, reminded me so much of my own grandmother with her sweetness and understated ways, I caught my breath at times. This is the brilliance of Ann Patchett's characters. They come from all walks of life, they inhabit places we may never have been, they live lives unlike our own, but we know them. They remind us of our own families, our own neighbors and friends, they remind us of our pasts, and our demons and our dreams and our secrets and our lies and our sacrifices. And they say to us, ""What would make you run and what would make you stay? What are the secrets that haunt you and what would you do to protect the ones you love?"" For me, Son captured the essence of the book's themes when he said, ""People die. Terrible things happen. I know this now.

Bolling comes on the scene a likable chap with a head for stocks, a good income, a well-connected existence in upper-crust New Orleans, and a way with the ladies. Early on, we believe his habitual moviegoing is merely an escapism, a way to ward off the mundane (which it is, to an extent), until we learn more about the machinations of Mr. Bolling's inner thoughts and see that his moviegoing is a kind of religion, a Church of the Desperate Soul, within which he sees the lives of the characters as reflecting ""rotatory"" truths and hidden meanings important to his survival. Bolling, despite his easygoing, unserious exterior is on a search. A search for the key to overcoming the ""everydayness,"" as he calls it. He staves off the malaise of the everydayness by making money, going to movies, and seducing his secretaries in a form of brief but serial monogamy. None of these activities seem to ward off the malaise for very long, though, and even when he is sure he should be happy, he feels the malaise of the everydayness creeping back in. He begins to believe that the only cure for the malaise is tragedy. The time he felt the most unique and alive was after having been wounded in the war. The life he has lived since then - a life full of small talk, luncheons, married friends, society functions - all of these run the risk of smothering him with their everydayness. Enter Kate, his cousin and lifelong companion with a frail psychology and a bent toward suicide. She becomes the external manifestation of his own inner fears, the person who does what he only thinks. Throughout the novel we begin to realize that her darkness lures Bolling closer to his own brink of existential despair. We begin to fear that there are only two options - someone will perish or someone will be saved. And isn't that the way of all life? Percy has hit upon some truths so obvious and defeating to the psyche that it often makes us uncomfortable to read them. Like the Myth of Sisyphus we all continually roll the boulder up the hill, heaving and panting, only to have it roll back down again and begin the task anew. No matter how many times we try, we will never complete the task, because we are all mortal. No one ""wins."" Bolling knows this and wonders if the living is enough to justify the life. In the end, he decides that it is, but it all could have gone the other way....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Sep 13, 2009","Jul 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10739.The_Moviegoer

Olmstead, utilizing the deceptively simple storyline of a boy sent by his mother to find his fatherThis is one of the darkest books I have ever read. Olmstead, utilizing the deceptively simple storyline of a boy sent by his mother to find his father and bring him home during the Civil War, has created a tale of nearly mythological proportions that explores every possible atrocity known to humankind. Along his journey, our fourteen year-old protagonist witnesses life-altering violations of human virtue, a barrage of repulsive acts and abhorrent characters that make him question everything he has ever believed about life and death. Death, in fact, permeates every sentence of this work. One cannot read this book without hard thoughts about the nature of mortality, as the work surely intends. Often, the reading of this novel was akin to watching the reels of the Nazi atrocities, eliciting the same disbelief that any human could do that to another. And yet, Olmstead's luminous prose, a strangely poetic and often unexpected use of language that mimics no other author of my acquaintance, gently pulls you along through this house of horrors and keeps you engrossed in the plight of this young innocent. So, too, does the image of the coal black horse himself, another element of the story that takes on a nearly mythical quality. The horse becomes an omniscient and powerful conscience within the tale, always observing, always aware, keenly protective, impressively strong and capable. His presence alone is a calming force for the boy - and for the reader - as we, too, are traversing this story along with our young guide and are enduring the same hollowing sense of despair. Many elements of the story reminded me of the classic Greek tragedies, so many of which are framed around a journey through war presaged by an oracle (our young protagonist's mother has the ""sight"" and sends her son to the battlefield after a vision she has had). At other times, I was reminded of the Divine Comedy, since the boy seems surely to be traveling through the circles of hell. In size, this is a slight book, but a weighty one in the reading of it, and although the ending gives us a small sense of some redemption for all that has happened, it never erases or glosses over the hard lessons and dark knowledge it imparts. This is a book that searches for the definition of evil, chronicles death in all its many faces, and then silently grieves for all humanity....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Aug 2009,"Jul 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/352676.Coal_Black_Horse

""A woman of means and social privilege goes on a jaunt to find herself and indulge her whims and teach me a lesson along the way about how pathetic my life is because I haven't done the same..."" That's what I thought. Plus, a couple of the snobbiest women I know recommended the book to me...highly. Nope, I thought, not for me. But I was wrong. Well, no, I was right...and wrong. It IS about a woman of means in a privileged social circle who goes on a jaunt to find herself and indulge her whims after a messy divorce. And she DOES think her story will teach me a lesson about how my life, among others, is pathetic for not having done the same. But the truth is - Elizabeth Gilbert writes so well, you don't care about that. In fact, she writes so well she even redeems herself from more than occasional bouts of arrogance and showboating by being equally desperate, vulnerable, kinda kooky, and truly funny. I'm not going to kid any of the men out there by saying this isn't a ""chick book."" It clearly is. I think the average book-loving woman, in particular, will genuinely find Ms. Gilbert's honesty of a transcendent quality if that woman has ever been in love and heartbroken, found herself crying on a bathroom floor, found herself wanting to pack it all in and travel the world, or wanted to find a sense of peace or reverence in this unpredictable world. It wasn't lost on me that this is a book about a woman's travels after a bad split. I began this book six days ago on a plane out of Boston to take a spontaneous trip to San Antonio, my first vacation after a bad split a few months ago. I finished the book as we (my friend and I) touched down in Boston again, having come full circle with the author and her journey. The book is written in thirds. The first takes place in Italy where Gilbert throws away her structured life, learns to be free, and eats her way through the country while using pasta as a balm for grief. In India, she lives at an Ashram and learns the Yogic life, in a nearly 180 degree turn from her carefree indulgence in Italy. Finally, in Indonesia, she balances the two extremes and learns how to love again. Nice if you can do it, I know. Gilbert seemed to have an unending supply of money and a far-reaching support network. But what I got from the book, other than a very insightful, funny, and lively read, was a real sense that any of us can find transcendence, can navigate the many levels of existence in our own unique ways if we choose to live an authentic life and cultivate friendships and experiences. Life may hold sorrow and hardship, but it also houses magic and joy. Yes, it's an age-old lesson. But Gilbert tells it well enough to bring it home.

The author's engaging style, for one, like the voice of a seasoned storyteller, weaving a vivid scene in front of you that you never question, despite the unnatural circumstances or hard-to-believe scenarios. The graphic history of WWII Russia, for another, rendered in heartbreaking detail through vignettes that offer glimpses into the suffering and tenacity of the populace during the siege. Additionally, there is the excellent pacing of the novel, always moving effortlessly through the horrors and unexpected turns of war, while offering just enough comic relief to keep it bearable and endearing. But the main reason to love ""City of Thieves"" is the relationship between its two main characters, Lev and Kolya, the thief and the deserter, (though neither deserves the label with which he has been saddled, since Lev is a one-time thief having taken a knife from a dead German invader and Kolya is an accidental deserter who never meant to leave his unit for good). The pair become bound in an unexpected mission - to somehow find and deliver, in just a few days, a dozen eggs to a Russian general to be used to bake a cake for his daughter's upcoming wedding. If they can find this rare commodity in a war-torn Russia in which the people are starving and have been known to eat glue from the binding of library books - their lives will be spared. This unusual premise is the foundation for what, at its heart, is really a buddy movie masquerading as a novel, an almost visual manifestation of two mismatched characters who form a bond of real admiration and affection despite their differences and disparate backgrounds. Lev is the young teenager, a virgin and master chess player hiding his literary and Jewish heritage, while Kolya is the charming and worldly wise twenty-something, a handsome army enlistee who has dreams of being a famous novelist and has a female admirer in every town. The story of their developing friendship is the heart and soul of the story and the reason this novel is more than just an interesting read, but a truly memorable one. Not everything in the novel is believable, and the ending bothered me quite a bit, because even though I knew it was going to happen and fully expected it, the timing came so late in the book that it almost felt like an unnecessary cheap shot, like something that should have happened earlier or not at all. By then, I didn't need the package to be wrapped up nearly as tightly or with such stylistic precision. It all felt a little false. That said, I was still completely enthralled throughout the entire book, I was fully able to suspend disbelief and accept all of the outlandish scenarios (until twenty or so pages before the book's end), and I admit I even fell a little bit in love with the brash, dashing Kolya and his charm and bravado. I have no idea who could capture that big personality on-screen, but some smart filmmaker better start looking for someone who can - because, after all, this is really a buddy movie at heart....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Dec 06, 2010","Dec 26, 2010","May 03, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1971304.City_of_Thieves

With that said, I am happy to report that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Granted, it doesn't hurt if you are fascinated with the lore of those explorers who searched for the Northwest Passage (as I am). It also doesn't hurt if you are willing to suspend disbelief the teeniest bit in order to make the leaps of imaginative storytelling our author makes. Nonetheless, this obviously well-researched novel is a fantastic character study that posits the probable outcomes for each man aboard the two vessels (Terror and Erebus) as they became trapped in the ice off of King William Sound and lost forever. Without giving too much away, the book's ""monster"" adds complexity to a novel that would stand as great fiction even without its appearance, in that it can be viewed quite literally as a monster or in a solely metaphorical way, (much like Danielewski's ""House of Leaves"") according to each reader. That, and the brilliant storytelling style of the author, help to transcend this book from ""horror"" novel to unforgettable piece of fiction. When I neared the end of the book, I started to read more slowly, as I knew it would be like saying goodbye to a friend once I reached the end.

The building of the fair was the far more interesting plot, in sheer size and scale often overwhelming the reaches of my imagination. So many amazing achievements came to light at the fair, and it truly is an event that changed the world forever. Breakthroughs in electricity, construction, design, science and technology, commercial products, even cultural diversity blossomed in Chicago during this small window of time. I found myself mesmerized by the true story of a group of architects (!) on a seemingly impossible mission. Yes, this story easily could have been as dry as a textbook in another author's hands, but Larson brings the details to life and truly fleshes out these fantastic characters.

Every young adult should have to read this book at some point, if only to get a perspective on life's priorities and where true success really resides. Pip's desire for wealth and status radiates from his wish not to be thought common in the eyes of his beloved and her society, undeserving as they may be of his esteem. When he finally sees the error of his ways and the way he has turned his back on the people who were his true source of happiness, it is a hard-earned lesson, but an enlightening one, and one he learns in time to keep himself from being doomed by his own ""great expectations."" There is no pat happy endng here, no neat little wrap-up. It is a story like any life story, full of small triumphs and defeats and larger tragedies, mistakes, regrets, and unexpected joy. The characters are unforgettable - who could ever forget the withering crone, Miss Havisham, who has molded the haughty Estella to be the source of her own revenge upon mankind; the misguided Pip, in love with the wrong girl and thrown into unexpected wealth by a shadowy benefactor; the salt of the earth soul Joe Gargery, unable to hold a grudge or see the bad side of others - and the list goes on and on. Dickens' vivid portrait of London in this era, his completely enthralling characters and his wry humor make his work a glorious addiction....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Jan 04, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2623.Great_Expectations

At twelve, I found it strange and dangerous. By the time I was seventeen, I had researched the time of this poetry: Warhol, Edie Sedgwick, the Velvet Underground and all of the NYC crowd who longed to be living works of art. Suddenly, the life of a small Catholic junkie became the voice of the city itself, and I saw the urban brilliance of it in every stark line.

I read this book several years ago (and even remember reading a huge chunk of it in the laundromat and another huge chunk of it outside the same laundromat, which had closed up but I could not stop reading), because it was pretty much surgically attached to my hand the entire time. Berendt brought these eccentrics to life in a way that made the entire culture mesmerizing and almost endearing. A really unfortunate film was subsequently made of the book and was a complete and utter failure in its attempt to grasp what Berendt knew early on. This is not a story about people, not a film about secrets or oddities, voodoo or murder. This is a love story between the author and the town of Savannah, herself, a town that ultimately becomes the most important character in the book, and Berendt fleshes it out in a way that still leaves me feeling like I have been there when, in fact, I have not.

Patchett's prose is so effortless, the cadence so gorgeous, the dialogue so natural, it is like entering a story rather than reading it. I have read a few s that bemoaned the supposed contrivances of the plot or felt the characters were obvious ""types."" With all due respect, I thought the characters were anything but, and I understand that disturbingly unrealistic contrivances deter from a book, but necessary contrivances occur in virtually every book known to humankind, not to mention most actual lives. This book was rooted firmly in the latter category for me. I adored this book. Days later, I still miss the characters (something I don't think I would be doing, if they were, in fact, ""types"" rather than fully developed people). I do ask myself if I would have loved this book as much if it had not been so familiar to me. It takes place in Boston (I am from the area); the core family is rooted in the Irish American Catholic Democratic traditions (I am an Irish American Democrat who was raised in the Catholic tradition). So many people and places resonate with me and populate my world. I can say these people are not types because I know them, they inhabit my world, and Patchett captured them perfectly. I thought this book took on matters of race and social class in a way that brought them to a personal level, rendering them the everyday matters of a family, as they so often are. I appreciated the nuances of the characters living those lives as much as the social climate within which they exist. Those who have read Patchett's earlier masterpiece ""Bel Canto"" may be inclined to shrug this book off because at first glance it seems a smaller, more personal book, with less expansive themes and a less global feel. I would suggest that no one make the mistake of thinking that because this book is crafted in a more minimal style and revolves around one family in one time period that it is a ""smaller"" book. The themes are just as relevant, the scope just as all-encompassing. Patchett does what the best poets do. She takes the specific and makes it universal. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2009","Aug 30, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/80566.Run

I worried initially how a book with this conceptual framework and storyline could maintain its brilliance over the span of a few hundred pages, without devolving into novelty or pretention. Not only does Danielewski maintain its brilliance, but with each new page he expands upon it, making the underlying themes darker (or occasionally lighter) and always more richly expressed. If anyone deigns to call this a horror novel, then it is the quintessential horror novel, exploring every angle of the primal horror of mortality and how each being has his or her own unique survival instinct in the face of that inevitable void. One er called this book ""Stephen King meets Nabokov,"" which is true in its way. If I were to find an analogy in that framework, I would call it ""Shirley Jackson meets James Joyce."" Jackson could make even a happy day seem ominous in the description of the architecture housing her characters: lines that do not quite meet up, angles that seem impossible in pure geometry, floors that do not seem even, ceilings that hang too low. Take that subtle and continual foreboding and match it up with the expansive themes and experimental brilliance of Joyce and you may be looking at their twisted little lovechild.

The book was so intense and yet flowed so beautifully, with its dark family secrets and memorably flawed characters and innate sense of place. It became an addiction. When the movie came out, I was greatly disappointed with the way it was made an overblown homage to one character at the expense of several others. The most captivating character in the book, in fact, (the siblings' brother Luke), is removed completely. It is unusual for me to read a book about a family this dysfunctional and this fraught with damaging memories - and yet to remember it so fondly and its characters with so much tender regard. I attribute much of that to the skill of Pat Conroy. He understands human flaws so well and describes them with such insight that even his villains are hard to hate.

But anyone who dismisses it (men...) ought to look at it from the viewpoint of its very interesting depiction of English society at the time, when marriage had less to do with love and more to do with economic concerns, for both men and women (some would say that has not changed so much even in modern times). The risks many of these characters take will have serious consequences that affect their status and reputations in society at large, and within those severe social strictures, this book becomes a fascinating study of a time in history when choosing to fall in love could seal your fate, and that of your family, for generations. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Aug 11, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice

How a book about a hostage situation in a South American country can be so tender and filled with such marvels of human observation is still a surprise to me. The hostages, who consist of a famous American opera singer, a powerful Japanese businessman, and a host of attendees from various countries who speak diverse languages, all come together (through a four and a half month stalemate with the government) to form a small, self-sustaining, and eventually beneficial unit. There is one translator who acts as a conduit of verbal communication between the various hostages, but otherwise they are left to their own devices to coexist with any understanding of each other, and the book shows us the many forms of communication that can exist between people, as well as the many words that can hold different meanings for each speaker. Love is one of these words; happiness is another. There are so many different ways in which we love and so many diverse scenarios that can represent true happiness. The hostages become aware of this in ways they never imagined. They begin to form a bond with their captors, and through it all the group shares the unifying power of music as a central theme of the story. The opera singer becomes almost a metaphor in and of herself for the best part of the human spirit. Juxtaposed against the violence of society and the social inequalities of the world at large, we view a microcosm of that world and see the utopia possible when a group comes together in acceptance. Of course, utopia is a conceptual entity and we know as we read this story that eventually the world will be showing up at the door to try to knock that utopia down, but I, for one, kept stubbornly ignoring that fact, the way the hostages do, happy in my self-delusion as they were in theirs. And ultimately, this book requires that we decide for ourselves whether or not we know what love is, whether or not we know the meaning of happiness, do we believe in the goodness of people and embrace all that is good in the human spirit, do we accept the differences of others, and is there truly hope for us all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 30, 2008","Jul 30, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

Truly, it is only an assessment of this ONE work, a book I consider an aberration from the other gems he has written.]Truly one of the worst books I have ever read. This book started with a great deal of promise. A series of vivid occurrences of espionage linked to scientific pursuits in exotic locales. Eco-terrorism, shady business dealings and a cast of potentially interesting characters. And then...it all self-destructed into a ludicrous mess that was not only idiotic in its pacing and plot contrivances but preachy and annoying, with characters of such brutish ignorance being lectured to by such emotionally-void snobs that you end up not liking anyone and just wishing this interminable muddle would end. As a reader who has been a fan of Crichton for several years, I have to say that it is the type of book that made me wonder how far he has sunk in his now-endless endeavor to get another book to the screen. I imagine him writing these ridiculous action scenes as if he is some pseudo-Spielberg lining up the shot and working the formula with just the right John Williams-type music in the background. In his quest to achieve what he mistakes as a riveting nailbiter, Crichton even has one character endure an escape from an Antarctic crevasse, an escape from eco-terrorist gunmen, an escape from a vehicle in a flash flood seconds before it crashes down a waterfall, an escape from a potentially fatal rare mini-octopus bite, an escape from cannibals, and an escape from a series of tidal waves...all in the course of a few days! And this is a character that in any realistic scenario would not have been asked to come along on any of the specialized military jaunts that produce these outcomes in the first place. For some reason, instead of utilizing a force of well-trained military agents to carry out the attack operations necessary to combat the highly-organized evil villains in the book, Crichton believes the uber-genius special agent in his book would use a reluctant young trial attorney, a secretary, an actor, and the agent's untrained niece to do the lion's share of the work needed to disable sophisticated machinery, track down veteran assassins, utilize a range of munitions and infiltrate areas that the Delta Force would find too challenging. I have rarely been so disappointed in a book. If Crichton were to walk into the room after I had finished it, I may have slapped him. And don't even get me started on the haughty pompous tone of the book and its one-sided caricatures meant to represent ecological viewpoints. I think from now on, I will just reread an early Crichton book if I get the urge to try a new one from him. He used to take brilliant scientific notions and utilize them in well-conceived stories that had some depth and an understanding of the inner life of a character. Now, he writes screenplays full of fools in such overblown action scenes, they would make Michael Bay blush. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Aug 28, 2008","Jul 30, 2008",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15860.State_of_Fear
