While the sentences were strong and the characters of the two middle sections were mostly interesting, the structure of this novel bothered me. The whole first section, which purports to be a novel itself, while compelling by itself, isn't needed for the whole. The book, IMO, would have been stronger if this ""libelous"" fictional biography of Andrew Bevel and his wife had simply been referred to in the middle two sections, rather than present in its entirety. Likewise, the last section feels a bit like an epilogue, where a few questions were answered, but because the style was so different from the earlier parts, it fell flat for me. Even the second section, which tells much of the story from Bevel's point of view is problematic because of the choice to present it as if it were a draft of the final piece, which markings for where additional material is needed. As a whole, though, the book does paint a portrait of the crazy financial happenings of the 1920s, so I'm glad I read it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jan 2024,"Jan 12, 2024","Jan 13, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58210933-trust

Part history, part romance, part corporate intrigue, The Last Bird of Paradise is well written and propulsive—I didn’t want to put it down! ~Daphne Kalotay, author of The Archivists  In evocative and authoritative prose, The Last Bird of Paradise, tells a compelling story of two women who travel to Singapore not of their own volition and a century apart. Garstang’s sympathetic imagination transports us in the manner of my favorite kind of fiction – that which convinces the reader of setting and character not because of the author’s resemblance to the protagonist but because the author is a virtuoso shapeshifter and spell weaver. ~Robin Hemley, author of Oblivion: An After Autobiography and Borderline Citizen: Dispatches from the Outskirts of Nationhood Aislinn Givens leaves a settled life in Manhattan for an unsettled life in Singapore. But that’s only part of a story that tracks back and forth over the span of a century and keeps returning to a vibrant painting. That painting radiates mystery and longing. So does Clifford Garstang’s vivid and simmering novel, The Last Bird of Paradise. ~John Dalton, author of Heaven Lake and The Inverted Forest  A feast of a novel, Clifford Garstang’s The Last Bird of Paradise mesmerizes with its story of two expat women who find themselves relocated to Singapore because of the men in their lives. One woman is an artist, the other a lawyer. A century separates them. In stories historical and personal, Garstang weaves mystery, love, and explosive politics, rendering in high relief the uncanny ways in which women call to one another across time. ~Elaine Neil Orr, author of Swimming Between Worlds...more",Notes are private!,0,5,2,"Jan 05, 2017not set","Jan 05, 2024not set","Jan 05, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/200842763-the-last-bird-of-paradise

Here’s the blurb I gave this novel: Devastating and beautifully written, Gerry Wilson’s Spirit Light is at once a heart-rending tragedy and a testament to the indomitable human spirit. In her heroine Leona, Wilson has drawn an unforgettable character buoyed by her determination to survive and to care for her child, even when confronted with violence, racial tensions, the horrors of a distant war, mounting losses from the influenza epidemic, and the lingering repercussions of murder. This historical tale about a hard-scrabble Southern farming family grabbed my attention and wouldn’t let go. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Jan 2024,Feb 2024,"Jan 01, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/125636388-that-pinson-girl

Except that I have also traveled extensively and lived outside the US for long periods, I have very little in common with this writer, either professionally or personally, so it's a little hard for me to relate to some of the episodes about which she writes. We do both come from less-than-wealthy backgrounds and have worked hard to achieve our goals, but that's about it. If I can't relate, that's certainly not a flaw of the book.Having said that, the author reminds me of a good friend I had when I lived in Asia. A smart, hard-working woman who also made it a priority to have fun. Not such a bad way to live, for her. And if I had to characterize this book, I might call it Sex in the City Goes on the Road.

Completed by his son and published after his death, the novel focuses on a figure outside the Secret Service. He is a disillusioned former trader from London who has cashed in his former lifestyle and moved to a village where he has opened a bookshop. There he becomes acquainted with a mysterious figure, Edward, who claims to have known his father at school. The two begin a venture that is tangential to the bookshop to build a library of classics. For this purpose, Edward needs a dedicated laptop in the basement room where the library will be housed. (Uh-oh, red flag!). Meanwhile, it seems that Edward, who occasionally did work for the Secret Service, is married to a woman who was formerly high-up in the service who is now dying, but he also made contacts with the Muslim world while working in Bosnia during the war there. It’s an engaging book, as all of LeCarre’s have been.

Brown is a charming novel about a grieving widower and his grown son who has suffered losses of his own. They have come together to live, but are adrift and aimless in their home on the shores of Lake Superior. They each claim to be “holding fast,” meaning that they’re doing okay, but in reality they’re both sinking. Whether they’ll be able to pull themselves together and recover from their losses is the book’s central question. Brown’s writing is excellent, and the reader feels real sympathy for both father and son as they work through their grief and also work on their relationship with each other. A fine plot element that is revealing of character is the arrival in the father’s life of a young pregnant woman who needs shelter from an abusive domestic situation. Perhaps more important thematically is the project the father undertakes—he begins to build a boat that he intends to row across the lake. I savored the reading of this book because of the fine writing, until I neared the end and needed to know how the various conflicts would be resolved. Highly recommended.

It’s a short novel in which the narrator Simone travels with her friend Agnes to Cyprus for a memorial service for her ex-husband who has died there. Her plan is to disrupt the service by exposing the guy for having cheated on her and for generally being a manipulative narcissist. In this she will be aided by other former lovers of the man as well as former friends. In the meantime, Simone is haunted by people from her past—a brother who died in Vietnam, a former Korean student who drowned in a ferry sinking, and of course Guy, her ex. All are warning her about something, but she isn’t quite sure what it all means. Here’s the blurb I gave it: “In spare and emotionally heightened prose that calls to mind the work of Annie Ernaux, Sybil Baker’s new novel, Apparitions, is an intense psychological portrait of Simone, a woman haunted by her past. On a trip to Cyprus for her ex-husband’s funeral and bent on revenge, she is visited by a parade of ghosts who warn her not to be misled, paralyzing her with indecision. The book is a story of betrayal, but also one of disappointment and strangling regret. It’s a deeply satisfying mystery, too, as Simone seeks to understand what really happened to the man she once loved.”...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 22, 2023","Mar 22, 2023","Apr 22, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/137174086-apparitions

I was also interested in the book because of the subject matter, which deals with the revival of a Shakespeare theater in Memphis (where Bausch once taught). There’s a large cast of characters (and a cast list at the beginning, as befits a story about a theatrical production), and the story is told from many different points of view. Except that it isn’t particularly funny, it reminded me of Slings and Arrows, the Canadian TV series about a Shakespeare festival in Canada. My interest, of course, stems from my own involvement on the Board of Trustees of the American Shakespeare Center, where I’ve witnessed variations on the drama and intrigue Bausch portrays in the novel.

The story revolves around a young mother who moves to Budapest with her husband who is exploring business opportunities in the years following the fall of Communism in Hungary.

(Was it because I recently attended a rooftop party? Maybe?) Anyway, I was right that I'm not the intended audience for a book like this, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate the craft that went into writing it. First, I love a story where the protagonist has a credible job. In this case, Dana is a host of a show on ""The Shopping Channel,"" and although I don't watch such things, it all seemed authentic to me. Second, there were enough twists and turns and red herrings to make the mystery interesting. And third, Dana was relatably bad at managing her relationship with her lover. Finally, Dana's curmudgeonly father, although a little over the top, was hilarious.

It’s an impressive achievement of voice and, at the same time, of social commentary. I’ve seen complaints about its lack of a plot, and it’s true that the central conflict could probably have been presented and resolved in a short story, but there is so much more to admire here than just the plot. The narrator is a young woman who has a boyfriend (or a “maybe-boyfriend”) but she is also being stalked by a “Renouncer”—a member of the IRA, presumably, opposed to the British occupation of Northern Ireland. Instantly, rumors abound that she is having an affair with the Renouncer, and no one will believe her denials. There are many wonderful side-plots as well, including her relationships with her boyfriend and her mother, also with her siblings, and with others in the community. I listened to the beautiful audiobook of this novel, which helped me get through it, but I also borrowed a copy from the library so I could also read some of it on the page. I’m not sure I would have liked it as much if I had only read it, because the pages are dense with type—long paragraphs, no dialogue breaks, syntax that on the page seems to go nowhere.

The Southern way of life has long been based on a big lie, and it's changing very slowly. Maybe a book like this will help move things along a little faster.

Reading that chapter, I recalled reading another story by Lee in the New Yorker which was also a chapter in the book. I thought both stories were excellent, so I dived into the book, which, while called a novel, is more of a novel in stories. Which is fine with me, because it's a form I like. The over-arching narrative isn't a single plot, but is the story of a marriage, from its early days until the couple's later years, between an African American woman and an Italian man. Early on, the man builds a vacation home for them in Madagascar and their lives on the island (a fictional smaller island off the coast of the main island) lead to lots of story-worthy events.Besides the engaging characters, this is a smart book about big issues that could be summed up as post-colonial.

Nonetheless, a guy, Hig, has found his place, sharing a territory with another guy, Bangley, and they have an odd co-existence. Aside from the premise that was just science fiction when it was written, which is just too horrible to contemplate right now, I found the book pretty melodramatic and overdone. A little too much crying, for example, given how much hardship Hig has endured over the 9 years since civilization went to hell. The voice is interesting, but annoying, with a steady stream of fragments and single words. I guess in the fictional world the disease spread too fast to develop a vaccine--I don't think the word was mentioned once in the book--but I'm grateful our world has one for COVID-19. Hope it works.

He's a good narrator also a stimulating writer, in part because he seems to have a lot of bones to pick with other linguists. He makes good arguments, but of course I can't say for sure that he's always right. In this book, one of the most controversial points is his conclusion that some aspects of English grammar weren't accidental but must have been influenced by neighboring/intermingling speakers of Celtic languages. The book concludes with another hypothesis, less certain to him but also less controversial, that proto-Germanic diverged from proto-Indo-European because of influences from the Punic-speaking Phoenicians who established a presence in what is now Denmark and Northern Germany over 2000 years ago.

There's actually a handy chart in the front matter that names most of the big (pun intended) players, so I could have checked if I'd really needed to know. Being somewhat aware of the dino story, there weren't a lot of surprises here, but I loved the detail about the transitions between periods and what the world was like across the hundreds of millions of years we're talking about.

It is in 1001 sections, a reference to One Thousand and One Nights, the classic work of Arabic literature that is mentioned several times. but the structure is meant, I'd guess, to approximate an apeirogon, a figure of countably infinite sides, a circle made up of straight lines, thus counting upward to 5oo and then back down to 1.

Mexico City, Bangkok, Hanoi, Copenhagen, Central Asia and the hinterlands of Virginia are only a few of the locales he transports us to in these memorable stories. And at each stop along the way, we’re greeted by another cast of characters, eager to enchant, charm and delight.~Tim Wendel, award-winning author of Castro’s Curveball and Cancer CrossingsIn his story collection House of the Ancients, Clifford Garstang sets before the reader a tiered Crayola box full of modern American males. A variety of different shades await inside—troubled, thoughtful, arrogant, and broken men, each trying to find his place in a changing society. Be prepared to hate some of them. Be prepared to weep for some of them. Be prepared to weep for the ones you hate. Fascinating, insightful, equal parts poignant and disturbing, House of the Ancients will keep you reading deep into the lonely night.~Kim Wright, author of Last Ride to Graceland, winner of the Willie Morris Award for Southern FictionThe characters in Clifford Garstang's House of the Ancients and Other Stories travel the world. But no matter how far they go—Denmark, Mexico, Vietnam—they can't escape themselves. It is the collection's flawed and fascinating characters as much as Garstang's exquisite evocations of international settings that make House of the Ancients a wonderful reading experience.~Mark Brazaitis, author of The Incurables and The River of Lost Voices: Stories from GuatemalaWhere won’t Clifford Garstang travel in his urgent quest to explore the darker corners of the male mind?

It is set in Singapore, and I think it helps to have some familiarity with that country to really grasp what’s happening in the book (although maybe the movie would work better). The book deals with an American woman who is in a relationship with a Singaporean in New York, where they are both academics. He invites her to join him in Singapore for summer vacation, but he doesn’t tell her that he’s from a very wealthy and powerful family. Even when she arrives and starts experiencing the absurd extravagance of the lifestyle of his family and friends, she doesn’t fully understand that she’s basically now on another planet and there’s no way the natives will ever accept her. Having lived in Singapore for almost ten years, I’m very familiar with the landscape Kwan is describing here, although I had no dealings with the people he’s describing. I lived and worked on planet earth, I’m happy to say. In the end, I found the book to be kind of silly—a farcical soap opera of the rich and powerful—but I actually did enjoy it in the end.

The impression of the book is enhanced by a familiarity with the city, I think, as the narrators refer to real places (and the author even includes a map of the primary locales). It was interesting, for example, to read of a body being found in the plaza next to the Santa Maria del Mar church, a site that I visited this morning before I read that passage. As entertaining as the book is, it has two flaws, both significant. First, it's overly melodramatic (although that might be owed to the young narrator, Daniel, who sees everything in exaggerated terms). Second, much of the detail is rendered in passages where one ""witness"" or another tells Daniel information he needs to know. These passages are tedious and would have benefited from dramatization (although that probably would have added a couple hundred pages to a book that was already too long). Anyway, read it if you're in Barcelona have been to Barcelona....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Nov 20, 2019","Dec 02, 2019","Nov 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1232.The_Shadow_of_the_Wind

Gwynne portrays them as brutal people, rapidly emerging from the stone age. I wonder if the focus of the book loses some balance, though, as I know the white settlers were also capable of brutality and were, in fact, stealing the land from the Indians. While those facts are there, the book's emphasis is elsewhere.

At first, I was annoyed by the ""white trash"" angle--a term I really hate, but seems to apply here--which is just drilled into the reader. The extended family is a bunch of drunkards and ruffians who have a hard time holding down a job and they all behave badly. But eventually the emotional intensity of the story and the first person narration are overwhelming and too strong to categorize. What happens isn't because this is a poor southern family but instead happens because of the circumstances this particular family finds itself in, and that could happen anywhere. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 18, 2019","Sep 13, 2019","Aug 18, 2019",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/18108689-bastard-out-of-carolina

And on the whole, I liked the book very much. (I also had the hard copy and read parts of it even though I was mostly focused on the audiobook.) I do think the book comes down too hard on the ""White Savior Syndrome,"" although it does--begrudgingly, I thought--acknowledge the good intentions of some who want to do good in Africa and elsewhere. But my real concern here, and the reason I've given the book just 4 stars instead of 5, is structural. There's nothing wrong with telling two stories at once, but they seem to be only loosely connected--the story of the narrator's obsession with her childhood friend Tracey and the story of the narrator's work for an international pop star who is creating a school for girls in Africa. One sheds only a small amount of light on the other.

It's all a surprise to the daughter, who knew nothing about her mother's past. The story-telling of the alternating narratives is very effective.

Hessler's writing is both lively and clear, and in this book, he successfully combines his personal experience (as a former teacher and as a journalist in Beijing) with a somewhat more detached observation of historical events. I found a great deal to relate to here, as well. First, he taught English in a Chinese university, and a couple of decades earlier I taught English, also in the Peace Corps, at a Korean university. Second, while my later work took me to Singapore, I became a student of China and the Chinese language, and I found the information about the oracle bones to be fascinating. (I had, of course, heard about the oracle bones, but the book provides more background on the bones themselves and the researchers who worked with them). Third, while working for the World Bank I also was in China at the time of the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, so Hessler's discussion of the reaction of his contacts in China at that time was interesting. (We were advised to keep a low profile at that time, which we did.) Fourth, Hessler's friendship with the Uighur man he calls ""Polat"" also struck me because of the time I spent in the '90s in Kazakhstan, a country that neighbors on China's Xinjiang region. Polat, after he moves to the US, ends up living in my old neighborhood just north of Chinatown in DC, yet another detail to which I could relate.I bought this book shortly after it came out in 2006, but I've only now taken it off the shelf to read.

It's about international sex-trafficking and the horrible book I just finished reading was about domestic child sex-trafficking. I would not have started this novel if I'd known what it was about. Nonetheless, it's a compelling read for several reasons. First the book begins with big trouble--two deaths are revealed on page 2--and the stakes for the male protagonist just keep getting higher. Second, one has instant sympathy for the sex slave who is at the heart of the trouble. The alternating points of view (with the protagonist's wife thrown in for good measure) keep the story humming forward. Third, it seems hyper-real.

Lack of familiarity with the cultures seems to have been part of the reason US readers have responded so well to it. In 1977 I spent some time in Osaka with some friends. We went to a Pachinko parlor--perhaps run by Koreans, although I wasn't aware of that--and we each played for a while. I was a pin ball addict in college, so I could definitely relate. We each won a lot of balls from our games and the parlor exchanged them for bundles of ballpoint pens. Puzzled, we managed to ask what we were supposed to do with the pens.

I've read several of Kingsolver's more recent novels and consider myself a fan. While I admire this novel greatly, I have two complaints. The first is the character--or caricature--of Rachel Price, the oldest of the Price sisters and the one who seems to have been denied a brain and even a sliver of social conscience. She's both too stupid and too vile to be believed, although I get that she's meant to represent an element of society that refused to see what was going on under their noses. The second is the novel's preachiness. Kingsolver is known for her agenda-driven fiction, and I share her political point of view, but the angle here got in the way of the story sometimes (and probably made the book a lot longer than it needed to be).

The details of life on the river are sharp--the fishing, the raft, the boat (and, yes, there's definitely a Huck Finn vibe there). The main character, Pearl, is fresh--she's in a predicament I don't see often and she responds with strength, although her vulnerability is at all times present.

On the one hand, once it settled into a rhythm, I enjoyed the reading experience immensely. On the other hand, it is on the whole unsatisfying because of its disjointed structure. In some ways, the book is a saga of the combined Keating and Cousins families, a kind of dysfunctional Brady Bunch where two cheating spouses contribute a total of six children the marriage that is the result of their affair, but where the ex-spouses remain in the picture for the next fifty years. But the lens is focused slightly more on Franny Keating, who in the opening chapter is a newborn and star of her own christening party. But we also settle from time to time on the other kids--her sister Caroline and also her step-siblings Cal, Holly, Jeannette, and Albie--as well as all the parents of this tribe. The book seems to have a randomness to it, which perhaps become clear near the conclusion, when Franny thinks about how things might have been different if this even had not occurred, or if that thing had never happened. One change early on and everything would have been different. Is that the point? If so, it's not particularly profound. My favorite character of the book is Leo Posen, a novelist with whom Franny has a long affair, but long before the book ends he has died and life has moved on.In many ways, the book reminds me of Patchett's The Magician's Assistant, which had a similar feel.

I was there for two years and it was a tense time politically, both internally and because of the ongoing conflict with North Korea. While Jeonju City was fairly calm--it's an agricultural province known for its great food--the neighboring province, South Jeolla, was a hotbed of anti-government activity. Tensions weren't unknown in Jeonju, though. I remember that one of my students stopped showing up to classes. When I asked where he was, the students wouldn't tell me, but I eventually learned that he'd been arrested for demonstrating against the government. Just a year and a half after I left Korea, the ruthless President, Park Chung-hee, was assassinated. In 1979-80, demonstrations against the government and the newly installed President Chun grew, especially in Gwangju, the capital of South Jeolla. In May, the demonstrations were brutally quelled and an unknown number of people were killed by the military. (Officially, the number is under 200 dead; unofficially the number is between one and two thousand.)The Gwangju Uprising is the subject of this book, which is told in stark and gruesome detail. It is shocking because while the dramatization is imagined by the author, the story is true. It's told from a variety of points of view, mostly focused on a middle-school boy, Dong-ho, who participates in the demonstrations and later is remembered by various survivors and witnesses.It's not an easy book to read, but it's an important one.

But the first thing to remember about this book is that it is a work of fiction that takes advantage of the peculiarities of its setting. It's not strictly ABOUT North Korea. Instead, it's about one man who is trying to tell his own story and discover who he is. The pain that he endures, both physical and mental, are, in the book, real. The mental anguish would be just as real if the story were set elsewhere. So I think we have to look at the book as being one about the themes of the book: family, impostors, facades, deprivation, the lies we tell ourselves and others.

The book is about that horrible incident, but it's also about their joyous travels together before he died and, critically, her need to travel alone after his death.

This one is better than most, if only because it goes beyond the sort of daily journal that so many of them are. Here, the author presents a real story--a narrative arc that shows his descent from newly arrived volunteer to a depressed and alcoholic expat, culminating in a dramatic climax and resolution.Along the way, Davis does share a lot of his experiences, most of which are interesting and revealing of Mongolian society, peppered with short essays about Mongolian history. I found the history interesting, for the most part, because I don't know all that much about Mongolia. (But I do know some: in my former job for the World Bank, I visited Ulaanbaatar (the capital of ""Outer"" Mongolia, the country where Davis worked) for a few days, and also visited Hohot (the capital of ""Inner"" Mongolia, an autonomous region of China); and in my job before that I lived in Kazakhstan and visited Uzbekistan, territory conquered and influenced by Ghengis Khan.)When I read a Peace Corps memoir, inevitably I compare the author's experience to my own as a volunteer in South Korea. In this case, my service was 25 years prior to Davis's, and yet his living and work situation were in some ways just as primitive as my own, or perhaps more so. Like Davis, I was often lonely. In my first year, I considered terminating early. I'm glad I didn't, but it wasn't always easy. I didn't drink as much as Davis did, probably because my personality is such that I remained somewhat aloof from my fellow teachers. Certainly drinking in South Korea was a major activity, but it never got the best of me. When I worked in Kazakhstan, I claimed allergies and didn't drink at all, because I knew the quantities of vodka would be too much for me. In all the work I did for the World Bank in China, I managed to drink just enough to be polite to my hosts.

(The book is about the Armenian Genocide.) Part of the reaIt took me a long time to read this novel, and not just because of the brutality portrayed. (The book is about the Armenian Genocide.) Part of the reason I went slowly, I think, is that I was interested in structure: The book is a faux-memoir by a woman novelist who is intrigued by the history of her grandmother and her Armenian grandfather who met in Aleppo in 1915. The contemporary frame story is about this writer discovering things about her grandparents as she delves into the story and eventually finds their correspondence in a small museum. In the course of her research, she uncovers a secret that is revealed near the end of the book. But the bulk of the narrative is about the writer's grandmother, then a young woman on an aid mission. The narrative consists of a story the writer has pieced together--the woman's experience, the thoughts and experiences of the grandfather, and also the thoughts of other characters who play smaller roles. I've read a number of blended historical and contemporary stories, but this structure seems unique.The second reason it was a slow read for me is that I found the distance from the brutality puzzling. Maybe this writer could do it no other way, but despite some brutal passages, the reader isn't really asked to inhabit the world of the brutality. The faux-memoirist herself is distant and the narrative is always filtered through her. And her story is primarily about a witness rather than the victims.So my experience with the book is mixed, although I'm very glad I read it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Aug 08, 2016","Sep 09, 2016","Aug 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13330603-the-sandcastle-girls

The author uses textual authority to establish various traditions for ""how Jesus became God"" -- whether incarnation Christology, exaltation Christology, or various heterodox approaches. The bottom line, though, is that Jesus wasn't claimed to be God during his lifetime, and only after the ""resurrection"" did such claims begin to be made on his behalf. The so-called resurrection is also examined, noting in particular that it would have been highly unusual for the Romans to allow burial of a crucifixion victim, since degradation of the body on the cross was part of the point--a warning to others.

On the surface it's about the environment and the damage that climate change is doing to it.

Again, education is in order on both sides of that divide.At one point, Ovid Byron, the scientist who is studying the monarch butterflies who have suddenly settled onto a mountain in East Tennessee, says: ""Ecology, [my field,] is the study of biological communities. How populations interact."" He's talking about butterflies.

However, that knowledge is a long way from connecting the dots of migration and natural selection to get where we are today, some 200,000 years later, and that's what's so wonderful about this book. At its heart, the book is making the point that there is biological basis for race--that people of all skin colors are basically cousins--and that race is largely a story of historical immigration. Along the way, it debunks the case (again) made by some that there is a difference in intelligence among the races (which was argued in The Bell Curve, a book that I tried and failed to read when it came out years ago).One thing I wish the book did better is to present the reason for the occurrence of genetic variants (mutations) that are then either winners or losers in the natural selection lottery. I get why some variants succeed and others don't, but why do they arise in the first place?Overall, though, it's a fascinating read....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 24, 2016","Apr 24, 2016","Mar 24, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22822941-everyone-is-african

On the one hand, the topic of rape is extremely important and should be discussed. On the other hand, I think the emphasis here is wrong. Krakauer bashes lawyers in general for their tactics in both prosecutorial choices and defense tactics, but I think that comes from a common misunderstanding of the our legal system. In fact, Krakauer's logic suggests that he is opposed to our ""innocent until proven guilty"" standard, at least when it comes to rape. Because he insists that the allegations of rape must be believed until disproven, the result is the opposite: the alleged rapist is guilty until proven innocent. And I'm very uncomfortable with that.Instead, it seems to me, we should focus our attention on rape prevention. How do we ensure that rape doesn't happen?

Furthermore, although there is some mention that what the southern furniture makers did to the northern US manufacturers is exactly the same as what the Asian manufacturers have no done, this point seems to get lost. And that's partly, I think a question of race. Somehow globalization is worse because it is ASIANs who are engaged in the lower-cost manufacturing.The author also seems to use ""Chinese Communist"" as an epithet, as if the paternalism of the Bassett factory town was anything different.What saved Vaughan-Bassett was its ability to innovate in the face of competition.

I'd love to see this fine drama/poetry staged one day.The individual poems are moving and dark, as the lives and attitudes, but fondness for language, of the characters is revealed....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jul 2014,"Jul 03, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20908148-until-you-make-the-shore

I haven’t been going to the gym much lately, so it took a really long time to get through the book, which is 500 pages but feels longer. I liked it very much. I knew before I started it that it was about comic book creators, but I didn’t realize what its underlying themes were. The largest of those themes is escape—Joseph Kavalier’s escape from the Nazis, his escape from the gloom of the war and his family’s death, his escape from Antarctica, and Sammy’s escape from the lie he lives. And of course there is the comic book character they create: The Escapist, a figure inspired by Joe’s training as a magician and escape artist in his native Prague.See my full : Review of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 30, 2014","Aug 11, 2014","May 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3985.The_Amazing_Adventures_of_Kavalier_Clay

The author, Wes Moore, a Rhodes Scholar and White House Fellow was headed down the wrong path when his mother took drastic action. He then read a book by Colin Powell that showed him that stories can change peoples lives--and Powell's story changed his. The other Wes Moore, though, didn't change, and the author has the opportunity to interview him in prison, where he is serving a life sentence.There is a lot to absorb here about poverty, education, drugs, and opportunity in America.

The naThis book is a fine example of the novel in stories or story cycle that more resembles Winesburg, Ohio (the granddaddy of the genre) than most. The narrative, told through the eyes of several residents of the fictional town of Lincoln, TN, relates the aftermath of a violent tornado in the 1950s. Lincoln resembles Winesburg in many respects, but the events in this town are even more dramatic. The book truly is a cycle--it begins with a prologue and ends with an epilogue, and the first and last chapters are about Herb Gatlin, a one-legged man with ties to most of the other characters. Herb, the book's central figure, rescues Mary Jean McKinney during the tornado, risking his own life in the process. In the storm's aftermath, an unidentified naked dead man is found in the town square, impaled on Herb's wooden leg, creating a dual mystery. Who is the dead man? And what happened to Herb?It's a thoroughly enjoyable, incredible book, with some laugh-out-loud moments. (Some of the characters, such as Reverend Tyree and his wife, are over the top, intentionally so.) But it also handles some serious themes of memory and loss, forgiveness and revenge.I'd been meaning to read this book for some time, but was finally prompted to do so because I'm moderating a panel at the Virginia Festival of the Book this year that features McCown.

However, in the past couple of years I’ve read several and have been pleased with them all. There was Wench by Dolen Perkins-Valdez; Wash by Margaret Wrinkle; Come August, Come Freedom by Gigi Amateau. All were very well done. Now I’ve read The Life and times of Persimmon Wilson by Nancy Peacock, which is different from the others but is also excellent.Persy, as he is known, is sold by his owner’s estate in Virginia to a cane plantation in Louisiana. There, he is mistreated by “Master” Joseph Wilson, but also manages to fall in love with Chloe, a light-skinned house slave who Master takes as his “fancy.” But the book begins as Persy is waiting to be hanged for killing Master Wilson and Persy, who learned to read and write as a child, asks for pencil and paper so that he can write down his story. The rest of the book is that story—from abuse on the plantation, trysts with Chloe, Master Wilson’s move to Texas as a means to evade the Yankees, emancipation, capture by a band of Comanche, and so on. It’s all very exciting stuff as Persy attempts to reunite with Chloe.Black, white, and Indian, this book is filled with memorable characters. Persy himself, whom we meet as a boy of 17, is the centerpiece of the book, and it’s not hard to sympathize with his plight. Master Wilson, who is almost comical in his pretense of benevolence, is an excellent antagonist, even if he is something of a villainous stereotype. And Chloe, the beautiful, uneducated house slave who is repeatedly raped by Wilson, completes the triangle.While some of the story is familiar—slavery is a vile institution and that is amply demonstrated by the working conditions, the whippings, the inhuman treatment—there are some new elements here. For one, Chloe is so light-skinned that she can be mistaken for being white, which adds a complexity as the book reaches its climax. For another, Persy’s capture and assimilation into the Comanche highlights the genocide perpetrated against the American Indians during this period. Don’t expect to come away from this book feeling good about 19th Century white America, Confederate or Yankee either one.This is a very well written, compelling (and exciting!) story of one man’s life before and after the Civil War, but it’s more than that as well. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Nov 02, 2013","Dec 18, 2013","Nov 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18232337-the-life-and-times-of-persimmon-wilson

That's true IF you want your book to be published by one of the large trade publishers. There are thousands of smaller presses that accept submissions directly from authors without an agent.

He writes her a letter, but decides that isn't enough. He's going to go visit her. On foot. It's the least he can do because of something that happened 20 years earlier. We don't find out what that something is until the last few pages of the book, however, which contributes to the melodrama. This and other bits of information are withheld from the reader solely to keep us turning the pages. It's one thing when the narrative consciousness discovers information along with the reader.

I read A Mercy when it came out a couple of years ago and thought it was fantastic, on par with Morrison’s masterpiece, Beloved. While Home has some powerful moments and extremely important subject matter, the language is indifferent and overall the story isn’t fresh.Frank “Smart” Money has returned from the Korean War, but he’s a mess. We gradually learn that his two childhood friends Mike and Stuff died in the war, but his problems go beyond his mourning. He connects with a sweet woman, Lily, who is making her own way as a seamstress, but his problems are too much for him to take. He gets words that his sister Cee is dying and needs help, and so he heads home to Lotus, Georgia, running into his share of trouble along the way.The one thing that makes the book stand out, and the only thing that could have saved it, is the reason for Cee’s illness. Desperate for a job, she works for a Doctor who uses her to conduct experiments. This is explosive stuff, but Morrison makes it seem like a minor aspect of the novel, which mostly centers on Frank and his problems.It’s a very short book and fast read, though, so I’m still glad I read it....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 10, 2013","Jan 11, 2013","Jan 10, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13152998-home

It reads a bit like a collection of poetry (at about 100 pages in a small format, it’s about the right length). But it’s all prose, and the individual pieces are of two types. There are the instructions, in italics. And then there is the narrative of the unnamed man and woman and the trials and tribulations of their relationship. Since these latter pieces have, more or less, an overall narrative arc, leavened by the italicized instructions, the effect is of one cohesive short work—a novella in flash, maybe. Cool cover, too.

The writing is stunning, and the characters of Ned and Isabel are fascinating. And there IS a plot. It’s just not one that involves much mystery or action. Consider this book the antidote to Gone Girl, by Gillian Flynn. The enjoyment of that book was in its breathless pace and surprise (fueled, it has to be said, by deception), but the characters were flat and implausible. Here, the reader practically feels Ned and Isabel in the room with him.Maybe because they’re writers? They meet at Columbia. They marry, too soon, probably, they go to London, travel on the Continent. They come back and they’re not very happy. He’s struggling to find his voice—he writes short stories and can’t get a collection published, imagine that—and she’s just floundering. And then there’s Phoebe, Ned’s ex-girlfriend. Isabel is jealous, sort of.More fascinating characters: Clive and Dinah. Clive is a somewhat famous painter (and uncle of Phoebe’s husband Ben). Dinah is his current wife. Sally is Clive’s depressed daughter. And sex? Schutt’s writing style is elliptical, and so much of what happens is missing, but is there just the same.

It tells a story that is often overlooked, about the brutal Japanese rule before and during WWII. We're all familiar with the concept of ""comfort women""--the sex slaves that the Japanese forced into service from Korea and their other ""colonies""--but this book puts a face on that atrocity, as well as the conscription of young Korean men and the abuse of Korean patriots.The story is told by three narrators--two Korean boys and their mother--beginning from just before the start of the war.

In the sections covering his early days in the country, Tharp is condescending toward Koreans (in the tradition of Paul Theroux—a former Peace Corps Volunteer—who never met a local he couldn’t make fun of). But over time, it’s clear that Tharp’s affection for Korea and his understanding of the country have grown, so that in the later sections of the book the self-portrait is of a man who is much more in tune with his surroundings. I also was touched by Tharp’s account of the loss of both his mother and father while living abroad (which closely paralleled the deaths of both of my parents while I lived in Singapore in the ´80s and early ´90s), and the challenges of being so distant from family. I also could relate to Tharp’s experience in other ways, including his love of Korean food and his struggles with the Korean language.See full  at Perpetual Folly: Dispatches...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 29, 2011","Nov 17, 2011","Oct 29, 2011",,Nook,view (with text),/book/show/12441154-dispatches-from-the-peninsula

Our economy is in danger on multiple fronts: on the one hand, wealth and power are increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few, groups who exercise too much sway over Washington; and on the other hand, the decline in real earning power of the middle and lower class has meant that the engine of economic growth that powered the prosperity of the post-WWII era has run out of gas. The solution, as Reich articulates clearly, is to shift the tax burden in our society in a way that both generates greater income for the lower classes and also creates more opportunities.

And maybe my biggest complaint is that agenda-driven fiction (here: racists are evil) is so hard to pull off. Kingsolver can do it, which is maybe why Jordan won Kingsolver's Bellwether Prize, but few others can. The character of Pappy is as flat as a character can be because he represents the evil racists. Henry, on the other hand, isn't a bad man, but he's interesting because he's still racist. Even Jamie isn't flawless.I also didn't care for the multiple first person points of view.

I confess that I had misunderstood the religion of the founders, but, as it turns out, so have conservatives. The history of religious conflict in the colonies and the advocacy of separation by, especially, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, is fascinating.If I have one quibble it's that the author doesn't seem to have a firm grasp of the doctrine of incorporation, the principle under which, after ratification of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, some but not all provisions of the Bill of Rights have been applied to state and local government. In fact, incorporation has been selective and it was only in 2010 that the current conservative court incorporated the 2nd Amendment.But that's a relatively minor complaint.

Still, Batchelor's journey from his UK upbringing to studies in India to a shift in schools of Buddhism to secular Buddhism is quite fascinating. He articulates the problem I've had all my life with Buddhism since I first read Hesse's Siddartha in high school--I don't buy the supernatural aspects of it any more than I buy Christianity's supernatural. Despite the appeal of Zen, and my connections to Korean Buddhism from my time there, I've leaned toward Theravada on the theory that it is at least closer to the original and is less dependent on the mystical. But still it is, and that's been unsettling for me. Batchelor explains why, and I'm grateful for that.

They endured incredible suffering that the book can only really hint at. But through the suffering and the sacrifices of others, Bienkowski learned. And so the reader learns about the concept of “Radical Gratitude”—taking nothing for granted and remembering all the things in our lives with which we are blessed. We also learn about Listening, Hope, Perseverence, Kindness, and Love. But these are not abstract lessons at all. They are concrete suggestions for living a more fulfilled life skillfully crafted by Bienkowski, a therapist, and Akers, a talented writer.

C Minor stories are fictions that strike a dissonant chord and leave the reader unsettled, and quite possibly looking over his shoulder. Or her shoulder, often, as it seems to be the women who are most at risk in Russell Bittner’s world. These stories explore an unpleasant side of New York and New Yorkers, one that appears to represent the pain and anger that many people have felt since 9/11. The stories (five short stories and a novella) often deal with sudden, unexplained events and traumatic loss. In “Collisions,” for example, Maggie literally bumps into Jorg on the subway one morning and their attraction is instantaneous. What happens next can’t be anticipated, or explained. In a most horrific story, “Waltzing Matilda,” (which struck me as a story Flannery O’Connor might have written if she’d been a Manhattanite), busy real estate agent Susan gives a lift to a leather-clad pedestrian. He’s been affected by what happened on 9/11, and now so is she. Except he has other business to attend to, that is even more disturbing. “In the Animal Kingdom” deals most directly with 9/11 and sudden loss and is the most poignant of the stories here, and probably my favorite for that reason. In all the stories, Bittner uses language beautifully. They are crisply told tales, each gripping in its way, and the collection as a whole is highly rewarding....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 07, 2009","Oct 05, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6945389-stories-in-the-key-of-c-minor

What if God manifested himself in Darfur in the body of a Dinka girl and died there? One answer is that the world, learning of God's death, spins out of control. But another is that God wasn't really doing anything to stop calamity in the first place, so what has changed? Our fate is in our own hands, just as it was before. You could make either case from these stories, if that's what you want to do, but in the meantime you could just enjoy these very well made fictions, from the title story, ""God is Dead,"" in which Colin Powell visits the Sudan, to the last story, ""Retreat,"" in which the outcome of a war between the armies of the Evolutionary Psychologists and the Postmodern Anthropologists is decided. The characters are quirky, but believable, trying to cope with situations that, only in the context of a world that has just learned of God's death, are wholly credible. This is a terrific debut and should find readers of all stripes. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Jul 2007,"Jun 29, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1155314.God_Is_Dead

There's lots of great language, especially when he's describing the attacks the World Trade Center, but much of the narrative annoyed me, also. I saw no real reason, for example, to have sections from the point of view of one of the hijackers. Perhaps the point was that he was also a falling man, and in some sense, in the plane, that was literally true, but I don't believe it was spiritually true in the same way that the main protagonist Keith was.
