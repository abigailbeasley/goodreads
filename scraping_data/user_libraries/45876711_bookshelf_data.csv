After returning from a ""hen"" (an English bachelorette party), Lauren returns home to her husband.Except, he's not her husband. She's not even married. After he climbs up to the attic to change a lightbulb, a new husband climbs down the stairs. Thereafter, husbands disappear and new ones emerge from the attic in the dozens.A commentary on modern dating and perpetually ""swiping"" for new possibilities, Lauren must confront living in the present versus an infinite array of futures.It's definitely unlike any other book I've read, but the array of husbands made it difficult for me to connect to Lauren and the male characters. While unique at first, the premise also became tiresome for me. Still, it's a good read overall.Thank you to the publisher for an ARC!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 26, 2024",Apr 2024,"Mar 26, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/193781998-the-husbands

So as not to spoil any plotlines for you, I’m going to be vague here: Ruthless Vows picks up where the massive cliffhanger in Divine Rivals left off. So as not to spoil any plotlines for you, I’m going to be vague here: as the war rages on, the bonds of family and love are tested.This book focuses more on facing the challenges of love at a time of war, and its themes focus more heavily on the brutal realities of war.The war, and the many plot twists it causes, leave this fantasy world and its characters forever changed.This book is more dense than the first, but the shocking plot twists make it well worth it. While the gods, the war, and magic could have been better fleshed out, the limited fantasy world-building does make this series easy to read.If you plan on reading the Letters of Enchantment series, you absolutely must read Ruthless Vows or you will be left knowing only half of the story of Iris and Roman.
