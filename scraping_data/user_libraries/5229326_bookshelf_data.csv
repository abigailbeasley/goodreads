I picked it up because I am fascinated by memoirs of lives in extreme religious communities, and deconstructing from them (my favorite such book is Unfollow). Catherine Coldstream joined a cloistered Carmelite monastery—yes, monastery is apparently the appropriate word for a female institution if the inmates don’t interact with the outside world—in 1989, in her late 20s. She had grown up in a secular, artistic, troubled family in London, and had a religious experience upon her father’s death that led to her finding Catholicism, and ultimately seeking an extreme version of the religious life.The key thing about this book, I think, is that Coldstream is a mystic at heart. She joined the pseudonymous Akenside (probably Thicket Priory in Yorkshire) eager to engage in extremes of renunciation in service of union with God. And she apparently found some of that: in this article, she describes her years of monasticism as the great love affair of her life. She writes a lot about the natural world and about her emotional experience of spirituality; although interested in theology, she doesn’t care about dogma at all. In a lot of ways she reminded me of the author of A History of God, also a former nun inclined toward both mysticism and scholarship. To her bafflement and sorrow, Coldstream’s fellow monastics seem to share neither of these interests, instead focused on “just getting on with” the daily work of the monastery, and her spiritual journey winds up derailed by some brutal office politics. I have to say, I was baffled too: who would join a cloistered monastery in the late 20th century if they aren’t intense about it? Why are these women there? Sadly, we never learn that about anyone other than the author, in part probably because of the taboos the community puts on human connection and meaningful conversation—the author may never have learned herself. On the other hand, maybe she did and didn’t tell us, especially as she mentions getting to know several of the nuns post-monastery too.Because overall, the book is selective in ways that made me wonder. Its basic portrayal of the monastery’s politics is believable; I’ve seen bosses like that, who play favorites for all they’re worth, move the goalposts depending on whether they’re dealing with a favorite or unfavorite, and can’t brook criticism of themselves. It seems natural that the hothouse environment of a monastery, where everyone has made vows of obedience, suffering is part of the point, and giving up your own will part of the ideology (the nuns occasionally refer to themselves as living human sacrifices!) would breed a toxic environment when you have a bad boss at the helm. And I believe that someone who’s idealistic, earnest, sensitive and intellectually curious, as Coldstream presents herself, might rub an insecure leader the wrong way. But Coldstream has a tendency to stick to generalities, to relaying her emotions or experiences without trying to provide the whole picture (at one point she shows herself and several other nuns being punished but is vague as to what for), and to throwing shade without fully owning her feelings. I don’t doubt that the women presented as the villains of the piece were problematic, but she presents this as if it has nothing to do with her, as if she wants to put readers into her shoes and lead them to draw the same conclusions, rather than analyzing her own relationships with these people, how her feelings changed over time and what caused that to happen and what conclusions she ultimately drew. And she doesn’t explain most of her decisions: the problems with toxic leadership and lack of communal support were fully evident within the first year or two, so why did she stay another decade? Why did she ultimately leave? Why didn’t she provide more support to challengers when the opportunity arose for a new leader? Why didn’t she consider moving to the other monastery people kept defecting to, if it was just a personality conflict problem? What’s up with never mentioning in the book the visits from her sister, discussed in the article I linked above, and how did these visits play into her emotional journey? I think this is ultimately back to the mystic thing, and that Coldstream isn’t trying to tell a straightforward, factually complete, easily accessible tale. But that combination of mysticism and devoting a lot of chapters to why her fellow nuns were the worst isn’t quite satisfying to me.That said, I don’t want to criticize this too harshly. Coldstream is a strong writer, and brings her emotional experiences home to the reader well, alongside vivid descriptions of her surroundings. I appreciate that this as a well-written book about an unusual experience, and it made for different and interesting reading....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 03, 2024","Apr 07, 2024","Mar 04, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127305797-cloistered

I’d never heard of the author, but maybe now I’ll check out his stand-up comedy. This book traces his life An engaging, funny and informative memoir. I’d never heard of the author, but maybe now I’ll check out his stand-up comedy. This book traces his life through six subcultures: after a troubled adolescence he gets deeply involved in Alcoholics Anonymous, then finds an almost spiritual fulfillment in rave culture (despite being completely sober—which doesn’t stop him from selling drugs for awhile) and later Burning Man. Because his parents are deaf, he’s also involved in deaf culture and works as as ASL interpreter for many years, and his dad is a Hasidic Jew, which he rejects as a kid mostly due to having lousy relatives, before finding a place in more progressive Judaism as an adult. Then at the end he writes about his career in comedy.For each of the scenes, Kasher gives us a brief history of the subculture as well as writing about his own life and experience of it. The history is quite interesting, especially for the non-party scenes (I don’t care at all about the history of rave music, though I enjoyed reading about how this subculture transformed the author’s life). Subcultures are fascinating things and it was fun peeking into these worlds I’ll never be involved with myself, with some critique from the author too, as he often winds up having complicated relationships with the subcultures, whether it’s AA for being too Christian-oriented and one-size-fits-all, or the party scenes for exploiting their semi-paid employees. It’s also quite funny throughout—for some reason, humor books work best for me when they are memoirs, and this may not just be my quirk, as Kasher also discusses the history of stand-up comedy in moving from canned jokes that anyone can tell, to comedians drawing on their own experiences. That said, his jokes about history are funny too!Ironically, the comedy chapter was my least favorite—it felt a little less funny and engaging than the rest, a lot of Kasher emphasizing how much he persevered despite setbacks (this sounds like an exhausting career to try to break into). I also wished his male default hadn’t been quite so obvious: there’s a bunch of lines like (paraphrasing) “I always felt bad for the deaf kids isolated in rural school districts, unable to flirt with girls,” as if actual girls (and in this example queer boys) are totally outside his conception of “kids.” If you particularly empathize with (straight) boys because you were one, that’s fine, but have the grace to realize that’s what you’re doing!Overall though, I did enjoy this as well as learning a bit from it. Each subculture gets its own chapter, so you could pick it up just for one, but they also flow together well; it’s a cohesive memoir rather than an essay collection. Worth checking out for those interested in subcultures and humorous memoirs....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Feb 23, 2024","Feb 26, 2024","Feb 09, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/145625057-subculture-vulture

To the extent guest editor Kuang chose the stories (series editor Adams picks 80 by reading widely in magazines, collections and anthologies; the guest editor narrows it to 20), her introduction makes her philosophy clear: her primary criterion was “commitment to the bit,” with a strong preference for gonzo, bonkers, and sometimes political stories. They are concept-heavy, giving me new appreciation for the character-driven stories in BASS 2023. It is an interesting and diverse batch of stories—in topic and structure as well as author and character identity—but I only liked about 8 out of 20, and loved none, even the couple from authors whose work I’ve loved before.Notes on the individual stories:“Readings in the Slantwise Sciences” by Sofia Samatar: I love Samatar’s work—seriously, go check out her collection—but this is a wild choice to begin the anthology because it isn’t even a story, it’s a writing exercise. Samatar was going stir crazy during lockdown and rewrote three National Geographic articles to be surreal and fantastical. The articles have no connection to each other and while I rather liked the use of fairies as a metaphor for insect die-off, the piece overall is a strange choice.“Air to Shape Lungs” by Shingai Njeri Kagunda: Another strange choice for a first impression. The author comes up with a fantasy concept to symbolize opposition to borders and racism, writes a 3-page description of said concept and stops there, without actual plot or characters.“Beginnings” by Kristina Ten: The first one I sort of liked, a poignant little suburban fairy tale that kept me guessing about where we were and what was really going on. Not sure why the author thinks all fairy tales end happily, though.“Sparrows” by Susan Palwick: A favorite. While the world is falling apart, a lonely college student holes up in her dorm to finish her Shakespeare paper, and it’s a resonant exploration of meaning in life, what we do when death is imminent, and where the world might be headed. I’m excited to see this author has written novels (better yet, not about the apocalypse)—my biggest find of the anthology.“The Six Deaths of the Saint” by Alix Harrow: The most popular of the anthology, and I see why and mostly agree. An exciting tale of love and war with twists that pack a punch, and emotional and thematic resonance. I didn’t entirely love the ending: (view spoiler)[it felt like a “everything you needed, you had all along” message, which given that they were starving orphans, was not true. (hide spoiler)] But overall I probably liked this better than the novel I’ve read from Harrow and see why people love her short fiction.“Termination Stories for the Cyberpunk Dystopia Protagonist” by Isabel J. Kim: I’ve heard great things about this author, but this is a very meta takedown of a subgenre I don’t read, which did very little for me.“Men, Women and Chainsaws” by Stephen Graham Jones: A twist on horror tropes, which will likely work better for people who like horror. I admired the rare realistic depiction of average small-town young adults—not bookish, or solitary and eccentric, the way authors tend to prefer their leads; the protagonist works at a car dealership but wishes she was a hair stylist, lives in a trailer with roommates and parties hard at bonfires on the weekend—but didn’t otherwise enjoy it. The ending felt particularly off: (view spoiler)[the protagonist is basically a psychopath, murdering her ex for breaking up with her, but the story doesn’t embrace that and even vindicates her at the end. (hide spoiler)]“Rabbit Test” by Samantha Mills: Part dystopian tale, part historical , all op-ed about reproductive rights in America. It’s effective—I can see it being read at conferences in years to come, and if you’re feeling outraged about recent Supreme Court decisions and want validation, this story is a great choice. I would have liked a little more from the characters.“There are No Monsters at Rancho Buenavista” by Isabel Cañas: A flash fiction monster story. It’s fine but not helped by putting the author’s note up front—I’m not convinced this is the subversion she thinks it is.“Murder by Pixel” by S.L. Huang: This reads like a feature in a news magazine—impressively so; fiction authors rarely mimic the style of anything so well. What happens when chatbot AIs are set loose to contact people? The story gives us a scenario, inventing only the people involved, and giving us even (presumably fictional) interviews with professionals and the (real) history of AI. A strong work, to be engaged with as a thinkpiece more so than a story.“White Water, Blue Ocean” by Linda Raquel Nieves Perez: The worst-written story in the collection, featuring a Puerto Rican(?) family under a curse (or perhaps a poorly-thought-out blessing from a clueless spirit). Full of abrupt emotional shifts and awkward exposition, and with a narrator who believes the entire world revolves around their gender identity.“The CRISPR Cookbook” by MKRNYILGLD: Formatted as an instruction manual for the science-inclined who need to cook up their own abortions in an oppressive world. Suffers from being Abortion Story #2 and less effective than Abortion Story #1; I’d have rather read the actual story of a scientist doing this than the manual she refers to.“Three Mothers Mountain” by Nathan Ballingrud: A well-written story if you’re interested in Appalachian fairy tales blended with horror. I don’t like horror and found it gross and sad. The kids should’ve talked to their teachers.“The Odyssey Problem” by Chris Willrich: A spacefaring riff on “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,” in which several completely opposed—but all sensible by their own terms—systems of morality run into each other in what feels like escalating moral oneupmanship. I see why some people love this, and it’s certainly confident, blazing ahead and demanding readers keep up. But my biggest takeaway was “never assume you’ve reached the apex of moral progress,” which is pretty obvious, and its characters are no more than props. Why make a rescued Omelas child your narrator if you refuse to do pathos? Plus, Willrich ignores Le Guin’s points about the long-term effects—intellectual, linguistic, physical—that such a childhood would have.“Pellargonia” by Theodora Goss: Three teens with a worldbuilding hobby accidentally create a country, and the story is in the form of a letter to the relevant journal asking for help. Maybe I’m a curmudgeon for disliking it, as most readers found it charming, but the constant interjections interrupt the flow and it is not believable as a letter to an academic journal (nor did it make me believe these kids could’ve successfully passed off their prior work). Also, it felt like it was hiding the fact that this is a story about clueless Americans screwing things up for everyone by messing with countries they don’t understand behind the tired “every kid in the friend group has a different diversity point” trope. Maybe it’s subtly making the point that identity politics don’t absolve you of responsibility for your actions, or maybe that’s giving it too much credit.“Pre-Simulation Consultation” by Kim Fu: Happily, I liked this one: a story in the form of a transcript between a customer and employee, negotiating a virtual reality experience. We learn a fair bit indirectly about both of the characters, it’s a fun but thoughtful look at corporate and legal handling of new technologies, and the end is strong.“In the Beginning of Me, I Was a Bird” by Maria Dong: Ugh. A vibes story I definitely didn’t vibe with. A depressing premise (all life is dying off, and humans are making it worse by their spirits parasitically invading other species and killing them off even faster), that’s apparently supposed to be counterbalanced by the mystical connection between two souls, but those souls are parasites and we’re given no reason to care about them, and no hope. Also, the protagonist didn’t begin as a bird.“The Difference Between Love and Time” by Catherynne Valente: A bonkers story about a woman’s turbulent lifelong romantic relationship with the space-time continuum, which is always appearing in different forms. I can see why people like it but this one was just too out there for me, not surprising since Valente’s recent novels have been too. My buddy read partner, who liked it, describes it as “a story of metaphysics and madness.”“Folk Hero Motifs in Tales Told by the Dead” by KT Bryski: A good one. In a sort of purgatory, this story alternates between the poignant story of the dead narrator, and trickster stories recognizable in inspiration but twisted to feature the dead. Clever and meaningful and strange.“Cumulative Ethical Guidelines for Mid-Range Interstellar Storytellers” by Malka Older: I can see why others would find this unremarkable, but for me it was the perfect end to the anthology. It reads like a crowdsourced Google Doc put together by and for storytellers working on spaceships. It sneaks in a lot of worldbuilding while sounding like the kinds of comments people actually write, and I found it fun and sweet. Overall, then, lots of ups and downs, a few new authors discovered. Worth the read for me but hard to recommend. I might try another volume in a different year to see whether it’s the guest editor’s taste that doesn’t quite agree with me, or the series editor’s....more",Notes are private!,2,7,1,"Mar 02, 2024","Mar 28, 2024","Feb 05, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/127654222-the-best-american-science-fiction-and-fantasy-2023

The style also wasn’t quite working for me: it jumps around a lot, and Ghosh will throw out some bold statement like “we fail to understand the agency of plants in the course of human history” and then just…. move on. If you’re going to claim plants have their own plans for us, in a nonfiction work, you’d better explain yourself! But the biggest problem was carelessness, and what’s the point of reading nonfiction you can’t trust? In this case, my breaking point was his claim that in fact, surgery before anesthesia was no biggie: “The answer, of course, is that then, as now, you would have been given a strong dose of some opioid.”Ghosh provides no source for this beyond his own assumptions, presumably because he hasn’t actually read up on the history of surgery. As it happens, I have, and while it’s true opium was used on occasion—as was alcohol—this was by no means any sort of universal norm, nor available everywhere (Ghosh posits that any medieval peasant who needed a tooth pulled would have had it to hand), nor a substitute for anesthesia. If you dare, check out this detailed firsthand account of a mastectomy in 1811 (the letter is dated 1812 because, as the author explains at the end, the whole episode was so traumatic she couldn’t speak or write about it for several months).For those who chose not to subject themselves to that, the patient—English writer Fanny Burney—is definitely fully conscious for the whole thing, and no opioids are mentioned, unless perhaps included in the “wine cordial” she drinks, which in any case seems as effective as you would expect drinking a glass of wine before having a body part cut off to be. This is typical of descriptions of surgery at the time. And note that by Burney’s time, the opium trade was booming, overseas products were widely available in Europe, and Burney herself was a privileged woman, even a one-time lady-in-waiting to the Queen of England. No, Ghosh, we have not “repressed” memories of opium solving everything; surgery before the mid-19th century was such a nightmare that it would be the event itself you’d need to repress!As I am not wasting any more time on imaginative “nonfiction” I can’t trust, it’s back to the library with this one....more",Notes are private!,0,9,0,not set,not set,"Jan 30, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127282658-smoke-and-ashes

The primary goal of this book seems to be pretending that social justice is just a rich people affectation that even they don’t really believe, in the usual vein of Republicans who are struggling mightily to convince the electorate that they are the ones here for the little guy, but who have no solutions to offer, only rants about liberal values destroying America.And look, as far as Henderson’s life story goes, it’s compelling: after being removed from his mother’s care at age 3 due to her drug addiction (she was subsequently deported to South Korea), he bounced around in the foster care system for several years, before being adopted by a family that wound up disintegrating soon afterwards. This chaos and instability left him a troubled and troublemaking teenager, until he joined the Air Force, dealt with the alcohol abuse he was using to deal with his pain, and finally got into Yale. He’s a good storyteller, it’s engaging and fast reading, and if the purpose of this book was just to tell his story, or to comment on foster care, adoption, and the effects of a traumatic childhood, this would be a pretty good book. I feel for the guy’s rough life, and he does a strong job of communicating his emotions to the reader.Unfortunately, the personal story turns out to be the Trojan horse for his half-baked political message, disguised as a message about social class. Henderson wants the reader to believe (presumably because, as he indicates, his intended audience is disaffected young men unengaged with politics) that Yale undergraduates represent the rich as a whole, and that progressives are all wealthy while conservatives represent everyday, hardworking folk. Here, take a look at actual partisan leanings by wealth: Democratic preference is relatively consistent across income tiers, but slightly more common amongst the poorest Americans (50%, vs. 44% among the richest), while Republican preference is least common amongst the poor (27%) and most among the rich (47%). The one thing I guess he gets right is the significant numbers of the poor (23%) with no preference, as opposed to 10% of the wealthy. But his vision of the world, in which Republican elites don’t exist and only Ivy Leaguers care about social justice, is hogwash.Henderson’s thesis is that woke politics are “luxury beliefs,” or something only rich people believe but which hurt the poor. He pretends this isn’t a partisan analysis, but mysteriously only progressive beliefs are ever targeted: don’t hold your breath waiting to hear about rich people who totally oppose government handouts while raking in the subsidies and tax breaks, or advocating for abortion bans that they and their families can just travel to avoid. Nope, his primary bugbear is…. acceptance of single parenting.No, seriously. Single parenting is definitely the biggest problem in America today, if you ask Rob Henderson. And it’s true that better-off Americans are more likely to be raised by both parents, which in turn better positions them for success. According to Henderson, the culprit for this state of affairs is privileged undergraduates who think different family structures are acceptable, while meanwhile, planning for traditional families themselves. Hypocrites! says Henderson. Don’t they know true belief means demanding everyone else do exactly what you do? (I just got some unexpected insight into the crowd that claimed gay marriage would destroy straight marriage. Of course, unlike gay marriage, single parenting is probably the intended life plan of few of the people who wind up doing it.) Obviously, if rich kids condemned single parenting with sufficient verve, poor adults would stay in lousy relationships and thus we’d be back to the idyllic(?) 1950s. It can’t be about falling real wages among the working classes while the rich get richer (you’d think this might come up in a book purporting to criticize the rich, but it doesn’t because Henderson only criticizes the rich to the extent they are progressive). It can’t be about mass incarceration separating families and making low-income men worse marriage prospects. It definitely wouldn’t be helped by expanding access to birth control so women in marginal relationships could avoid unintended pregnancy. Nope—clearly the problem is the rich being insufficiently judgmental of the poor.The rest of his arguments are along the same line. Poor Americans are obese because fit college students endorse body positivity. No suggestions that we should limit what can be put in food, or do anything about food deserts, or walkability of cities and neighborhoods, or look into overeating as an addiction—shaming is definitely the solution to this problem (of course he doesn’t realize that opposition to fat shaming grew out of the fact that people engage in it all the time, which has not stopped Americans from getting fatter). He also thinks it’s total hypocrisy that wealthy Americans are slightly more likely to endorse defunding the police than the poor, who are more often victimized—apparently missing that the rich are less often victimized because the police are working for them, and also that very few proponents want to actually abolish the police, as opposed to reform.And I should say, I don’t even disagree with everything Henderson says. He critiques the excesses of the campus safe-space movement, which I think most grown adults would agree are excessive (no word on the book banning movement though, or any other suppression of ideas from the right). He questions wealthy people leaning hard on whatever marginalized identity they possess, and I agree there’s a tendency among many to focus on every other identity rather than grappling with economic inequality (but then, Henderson makes no proposals for reducing economic inequality either, nor even acknowledges the existence of racism, despite being Asian-American himself. But of course, he’s writing for a conservative, white audience). He points out that some people endorse the party line publicly while admitting a different opinion in private (which is definitely true on both sides the more tribal our politics become, but then Henderson has no comment on Republicans or the existence of the culture wars, because he wants you to think progressives just randomly became hardcore to show off). Ultimately, this book is a con. I’ll be interested to see whether Henderson ultimately uses it to parley a place on the conservative talk show circuit like his mentor Jordan Peterson (whose endorsement his website trumpets), or to run for office like the vile J.D. Vance (credited in the acknowledgments, and who also used a memoir this way). But I certainly can’t recommend it. If you’re here for a story of childhood abandonment, trauma and recovery, check out What My Bones Know instead.

However, I knew her life was interesting, and was curious.And on the one hand, it’s an interesting book. Tan has indeed had an interesting life, and has an interesting family, and the book is at its best when she writes about her family history, about investigating her parents’ lives, and about her troubled childhood. Her mother had a lot of trauma and wound up passing some of it on to her kids, and Tan writes about all this compellingly and with insight. It was also interesting to see her investigate other aspects of her young life: for instance, the longitudinal study she was part of in elementary school, which her parents claimed proved she was brilliant and meant to be a doctor, but which turned out to be a study of how early reading impacts kids. (When she was a child, experts were advising parents not to let children read before they were taught it in school, because they would then do it wrong forever! Luckily for Tan, either her parents hadn’t heard about or disagreed with this, or she sneakily learned from her older brother anyway—complications related to immigration and their resulting caution around anyone who seemed official caused her parents to claim the latter. I’m reminded of how when I was in school, kids were rebuked for even signing their names because you weren’t supposed to write cursive until officially taught in second or third grade. Shocker—nearly everyone preferred to print forever after, while cursive was generally considered a burden and seems to be a dying skill.)On the other hand, reading this book clarified why I tend to avoid memoirs subtitled things like “A Writing Life.” There are two types of memoirs: celebrity memoirs, usually ghostwritten, whose appeal is based on preexisting interest in the person and which I don’t care about, and literary memoirs, whose appeal is based on the strength of their writing, storytelling and insight. Memoirs of famous writers might initially seem to fall within the literary category, because they write said books themselves and are good at it. But a true literary memoir has focus: it’s not just a straight autobiography but focused on a particular theme; it’s telling a story because that story needs to be told. And this is where famous writer memoirs tend to fall flat; they’re writing not out of a sense of urgency about some aspect of their personal story, but because they have a market.And as strong as some of these chapters are, sadly, that describes this book. From Tan’s introduction, this grew from a series of essays she sent her editor, who suggested it seemingly as a way of keeping her hand in (or the money coming) between novels. (Tan writes that fiction actually became harder for her as she went, and in fact hasn’t published any since 2013.) The organization is scattershot and a couple of chapters—the one about her relationship with classical music, and the one consisting entirely of emails between her and her editor—bored me to the point of skimming.In the end, a relatively interesting book, but not the strongest memoir; I wish Tan had committed to a central focus, delved more deeply, and cut unrelated material. But if you are a Tan fan, it’s worth checking out. And she really does have some wild stories....more",Notes are private!,4,8,1,"Mar 24, 2024","Mar 30, 2024","Jan 25, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34043618-where-the-past-begins

(Said rainforest trek occupies 50 pages at the end.) That was fine with me: I love Enlightenment science history. And this is decent Enlightenment science history, but not the best I’ve read.Basically, a team of three high-profile French scientists and several assistants traveled to the Spanish colonies to measure a degree of latitude at the equator, in order to resolve a raging argument about the exact shape of the Earth (namely, whether it’s more flattened at the equator or the poles). The whole expedition wound up taking a decade, between the difficulties of going and returning, and the many difficulties of taking the measurements. The scientists wound up dividing into two separate parties because they couldn’t stand each other, got embroiled in local politics—one of their assistants was killed by a mob in a small town; to be fair he was an arrogant Frenchman, and the mob was provoked—but did ultimately do quite a lot of useful research, much of it not even on the subject they’d come to study. In true Enlightenment fashion, they studied everything from the local plants to Quechua grammar. In the end the academicians went home and the assistants mostly got stranded in the colony for lack of money to pay their passage. One, Jean Godin, married Isabel Gramesón, the 13-year-old daughter of a prominent colonial family, traveled from Ecuador through Brazil to French Guiana “to prepare the way” and then spent 20 years trying to get her out too. This was not because anyone wanted to stop her, but due to the incredible slowness of communication and inhospitable terrain, combined with diplomatic complications, plus the inexplicable unwillingness of everyone involved to consider literally any other route besides trekking through the entire Amazon. (I remained confused the entire book about why they couldn’t go out the way they came in, by taking ship from Guayaquil to Panama, crossing the isthmus by land and then sailing home from the Caribbean.) You think the couple of months’ delay in communication between Britain and its North American colonies was bad? When Jean Godin’s father died, his siblings wrote him a letter in Ecuador asking him to come home immediately and he got it eight years later! When a ship finally went up the Amazon to fetch Isabel, its entire crew waited four years at the meeting point for her to show up. Talk about patience and dedication to the job.All that said, the focus of the book is maybe a little too diffuse, or the author’s writing just not the most incisive. It touches on a lot of interesting topics, from the lives of those involved to the science to the culture of colonial Peru (as the whole area was known at the time), but doesn’t go in-depth on any of them. I’d have liked a little more explanation of the mathematics, and a little less Eurocentrism. Also, while Isabel’s journey was certainly harrowing, I wouldn’t call her a heroine—her survival is admirable, but she undertook the journey at the behest and with the assistance of her male relatives, and the worst of it resulted from her and her brothers’ unwillingness to brave the canoe.In the end, a fine choice if you’re particularly interested in Enlightenment science history, but if you’re new to the subject, try The Age of Wonder or The Knife Man first. Or, if you want the story of an Enlightenment-era European woman’s adventures in South America, I highly recommend Chrysalis, about a 17th century Dutch scientist and artist who traveled to Suriname on her own initiative....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Mar 07, 2024","Mar 20, 2024","Jan 15, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1129807.The_Mapmaker_s_Wife

I perhaps liked the first half a bit more than the second, but overall it has excellent writing, blending the unique and surreal with the down-to-earth and emotional. I’m kicking myself for having put it off as long as I did—possibly for the horror billing, but it’s more feminist horror than anything spooky or gruesome. Comments on the individual stories:“The Husband Stitch”: The collection starts with a striking story, mixing the unnamed narrator’s story of her marriage with her memories of other tales, often involving manipulation or gaslighting, and increasingly unhinged recommendations “if you’re reading this story aloud.” Well-written, thematically resonant, leaves a lot of unanswered questions to ponder.“Inventory”: The next is shorter and more experimental: the tale of a woman’s life through her list of sexual partners, as a virus wipes out the human population. I was impressed with how much Machado is able to show this way.“Mothers”: Perhaps the most difficult of the bunch to understand, about a woman given a baby by her ex, who claims the narrator fathered it. My read is that the whole story is the narrator’s psychotic break following the end of her abusive relationship, but possibly I just want that to be true because this woman is terrifyingly clueless about how to care for a baby.“Especially Heinous”: The first of two novellas, this one formatted as episode descriptions for 12 seasons of Law & Order: SVU, but telling its own bizarre and supernatural story. I’ve never watched SVU, but though this goes on long, I enjoyed it: the poetic flash-fiction style is fun, as is the way Machado weaves all these bonkers plotlines together. And it was nice to have a break from all the unnamed first-person narrators and get something truly different. Also the funniest of the collection.“Real Women Have Bodies”: An epidemic of women fading away, as seen through the eyes of an underemployed retail worker in a fashion store. Definitely a downer, but effective—this one gave me AIDS crisis vibes, perhaps due to the narrator’s relationship with another woman who is fading away and realistically terrified and furious about it.“Eight Bites”: A woman gets weight-loss surgery, supported by her sisters who have done the same, but exacerbating tensions with her daughter. I liked this one: we can start to see the narrator’s unreliability when we actually hear from the daughter, and the creature in her home is up for interpretation. (view spoiler)[I saw it as her love that she was rejecting, for her daughter and possibly also for herself. Interestingly, of the four sisters, she seems to be the only one to have an unhealthy relationship with her creature, though are they reliable narrators of their own experiences? (hide spoiler)] It also asks some questions about weight and eating disorders, and doesn’t give easy answers. (view spoiler)[The narrator’s mother only eating eight bites of anything indicates she probably had an eating disorder, but I didn’t think the narrator had an unrealistic view of her own weight; from her envious descriptions of her doctor as “sweetly plump” and “round and unthreatening as a panda,” this doesn’t sound like a supermodel-or-bust kind of woman. (hide spoiler)]“The Resident”: The second novella, and sadly, I actively disliked this one. It’s really long, and nothing happens: the narrator goes to an artists’ retreat and experiences some scattered, mildly unsettling incidents and encounters with the other artists, and remembers Girl Scout camp, and that’s pretty much it. I want to take it as a satire of residency programs and neurotic people who write boring novels about themselves, but the whole time it teases the reader with being potentially autobiographical. Also, I too was in Brownies and while the origin of the name was a bit of an “aha” moment, I found it oversold (at no point we were told we were supposed to be house elves, and anyway telling a kid to do their own chores is not the worst thing in the world).“Difficult at Parties”: The collection ends with the story of a woman struggling to recover from an unspecified trauma. From the context clues, I guessed (view spoiler)[she had been beaten and raped by a stranger in or near her home (hide spoiler)]. I think this one is probably technically good, and the narrator’s focus on reviving her sexuality is a daring and worthy choice. It didn’t do a lot for me, though; I maybe wanted to know more about her, or maybe was just in the wrong mood.Overall, a very strong collection and I am interested in reading more from this author....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Mar 08, 2024","Mar 23, 2024","Jan 12, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33375622-her-body-and-other-parties

It’s basically a parable of colonialism, patriarchy and ecoloOn the one hand, this is an impressive book, especially for something published in 1972. It’s basically a parable of colonialism, patriarchy and ecological destruction, and how these three are inextricably intertwined, and it draws this in a way that feels incisive and timely in 2024.Some spoilers below because it’s hard to discuss a theme-driven work without them!At the same time, while others have complained about lack of subtlety, to me this is the best way to do unsubtle: drawing out one’s points through the story itself, never simply dumping what we’re supposed to think into dialogue or internal monologue. And everyone in it feels entirely believable rather than straw men. The novella is told from the point-of-view of three characters, two of whom are colonizers and one of whom, Le Guin wrote later, embodies a level of evil she didn’t even consciously believe in. If, like me, you’ve read a lot of genre fiction, this would naturally lead you to expect a villainous cartoon, so imagine my surprise when this character and his perspective felt entirely believable: yes, he embodies fascism and toxic masculinity and anthropocentrism, yes he goes off the deep end, but there was never a moment in which he felt like just a plot device, like Le Guin didn’t understand the real people like this. He has some complexity, and functions successfully within his own society when things are going well. Maybe this speaks to our era, but I absolutely believed in Davidson. And I think the original readers were meant to as well—I suspect, from the way the story begins, that they were intended to start out identifying with him, then slowly realize how terrible he is.However, I’m not sure all the intended messages come through: this has to be the more pro-war “anti-war novel” I’ve ever read. War isn’t glorified, but it’s hard to come away from this book without considering this example an entirely necessary evil—that the Athsheans did what was needed to save their culture, species and planet, and succeeded spectacularly, though now they too will have to grapple with the legacy of violence.Also, while the novella did successfully get me invested in the larger situation, I never cared at all about any of the individuals in it. Even the protagonists have either no backstory (the Earthlings) or it’s the most sketchy and stereotypical possible (Selver with his destroyed village and his raped and murdered wife). The end felt a little simplistic, a bit deus ex machina—somewhere out there is a group of humans in power for whom respect for morality and natural rights trump greed and resource hunger, apparently, yet we never meet them, they just swoop in and announce this planet will be respected now rather than the Athsheans enforcing their sovereignty themselves. I was confused about why Lyubov’s work would have made this happen, when he himself didn’t expect it to make a difference—I didn’t need to see Lyubov vindicated, either, his blind spots were so well-drawn.Finally, from this book you would never guess that Le Guin would one day be considered a feminist. In terms of characters with an actual impact on the story, or who appear in more than one scene, there are no women in it—except for the aforementioned fridged wife, dead before the story begins and important only as motivation for Selver. That the colonial society is misogynistic makes sense, though it’s unfortunate that the book shows us nothing of the actual women under this regime: on the spectrum from human trafficking victims to eager volunteers, these “shipments” of brides and sex workers could be absolutely anywhere; we have no idea. Then they are all murdered.With Athshean society, on the other hand, Le Guin was able to envision something more equal—spiritual and intellectual roles go to men, and practical governance, diplomacy and hunting to women—but not to let women shine in those roles. From this division, our indigenous hero Selver should be a woman, but is not; women appear as decently-written extras in Selver’s war but all the narrative focus is on the exceptional man. I do wonder if the novella would have been published had she attempted otherwise, or dismissed as a “feminist screed”—but Le Guin’s later reflections, even in acknowledging the book’s weaknesses, don’t suggest she ever noted the lack.At any rate, this is a well-written book, as you would expect from Le Guin; the way the language changes with each point-of-view is impressive and brings them to life. The examination of colonial conquest and resource exploitation feels timely and thought through today, without ever resorting to caricature. The societies themselves are interesting, and the writing shows a strong understanding of the professions involved and how they operate. It is in many ways good and worth reading. It’s also my least favorite Le Guin thus far....more",Notes are private!,3,13,1,"Feb 24, 2024","Feb 27, 2024","Dec 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7672380-the-word-for-world-is-forest

As always, this year brought some great books, some terrible books, a bunch of decent-to-good books. After a couple years of reading a lot of fantasy and a few too many strikeouts early in the year, I decided to limit that genre to one book per month and read more realistic fiction. (Midway through the year I also decided to try more sci-fi, though that’s not quite evident from the numbers yet.) This was reasonably successful for my literary fiction reading, but the remaining fantasy books, rather than being the cream of the crop, were uniformly average. The real winner in my year was nonfiction; as I get older and more jaded it’s harder for fiction to impress or move me, but there is always more to learn.

I also read 1 book in the original Spanish.And now, the best books I read in 2023 and why you should read them!The Best Fiction I Read in 2023  [image]The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le GuinThis book may have singlehandedly convinced me that idea-driven science fiction is worth reading. It’s about how human societies are organized, from the perspective of a slightly out-of-place scientist from an anarchist, communitarian world, and from an author who truly gets people and how they behave and how human societies work. It’ll make you think but it also feels real, and features strong characters. While this will never happen because I get sick of authors, I kind of want to read everything Le Guin ever wrote.  [image]The Strangers by Katherena VermetteBy far the most emotionally compelling—sometimes excruciating—novel I read in 2023, this features three generations of a Métis family in Canada: a teenage girl in foster care; her older sister in prison; their mom, struggling with addiction; and their embittered grandmother. I cared deeply about these characters, I fully believed in them, I was gobsmacked by how well the author wrote each of their voices even though most of the book is in the third person. This is a loose sequel to The Break and you can read that first (more hopeful, larger cast of characters, also good), or not.  [image]Anna Karenina by Leo TolstoyA classic for a reason. This book is like getting to visit 1870s Russia and stay for a bit, except better, because you have Tolstoy’s psychological acuity to interpret it all for you (plus, you won’t have to worry about the train schedules!). Possibly better than War and Peace?—hard to say; it’s certainly more cohesive. I love how 19th century men wrote women better than 20th century men and I will stand by that statement.The Best Memoirs I Read in 2023  [image]There Was and There Was Not: A Journey through Hate and Possibility in Turkey, Armenia, and Beyond by Meline ToumaniThis is an incredibly bold and thoughtful memoir by an Armenian-American woman who had such tough questions about her community’s response to the Armenian genocide, she up and moved to Turkey for a couple of years. A meditation on historical trauma, power, history, hatred, and truth, with wide relevance beyond this specific situation—though you’ll learn a lot about that too. If everyone thought as deeply as this author, the world would be a better place. And she’s a great writer too.  [image]Daughter of Persia: A Woman's Journey from Her Father's Harem Through the Islamic Revolution by Sattareh Farman FarmaianAn amazing story of a woman who grew up in a wealthy harem in Iran pre-World War II, journeyed right through the middle of the war to get to college in the U.S., returned to her country to found a school of social work, then got caught up in the revolution of 1979. I loved this for so many reasons: because it’s a window into a life wildly different from my own; because this woman meant business and knew how to get things done; because she did a lot of reflecting on her eventful life; because the storytelling is excellent. Come to step beyond your own cultural lens, stay for the ethical musings that wind up relevant for everyone.The Best Nonfiction I Read in 2023 … About China  [image]Daughters of the Flower Fragrant Garden: Two Sisters Separated by China's Civil War by Zhuqing LiA scholar’s lively joint biography of her two impressive aunts, who grew up in Nationalist China before being separated by chance as young adults by the Communist victory. One was stranded outside the mainland and went on to make a life as a businesswoman, wife and mother in Taiwan. The other stayed home and became a doctor, devoting her career to gynecological public health despite some interruptions (like, say, the Cultural Revolution). You’ll learn a lot from reading this book; I think I get how Chinese people survived the 20th century better from this book than anything else I've read. And they’re great stories, too.  [image]Oracle Bones: A Journey Through Time in China by Peter HesslerA fabulous journalistic account of life in China in the early 2000s, alongside some intriguing investigation into the country’s past both recent and distant. The author follows the lives of a few of his former students as they begin their careers, as well as an Uighur man forced to live and work away from home. All the stories are fascinating and I learned a lot. Also this year, I read Country Driving (also about China) and The Buried (about Egypt, and worthy of being on this list had the author not been included already), which makes it practically the Year of Hessler by my standards.   [image]1587: A Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline by Ray HuangA historian’s  of 16th century China, focused on key people in government and how the system worked, or didn’t. Wide-ranging and erudite but readable. I am impressed by just how much we know about these people (entire transcripts of conversations between the emperor and his secretaries were written down!). Definitely a book to blow holes in your assumptions about history, from bamboo trees being used alongside cannon on the battlefield to the official who turned back his emperor’s army.The Rest of the Best Nonfiction I Read in 2023  [image]Bolívar: American Liberator by Marie AranaA fascinating, engaging and thoughtful biography of a towering figure in the history of Central and South America. The author gets the reader up to speed on Simon Bolivar’s life, its wider context, and the areas where historians disagree. You’ll learn a lot and also enjoy the ride. I am not sure why I thought this was the one book this year worthy of a full 5 stars rather than the (probably stingy, in most cases) 4.5 I gave the others—probably because I just could not think of anything bad to say about it.  [image]Indonesia, Etc: Exploring the Improbable Nation by Elizabeth PisaniA journey around a huge yet relatively little-known country, with a guide who’s lived there for years working in journalism and public health. The author takes us to far-flung islands, introduces us to some fascinating people and cultures, and provides a primer on modern Indonesia: history, religion, politics, society, with some great diversions into unexpected issues as well. It’s a fantastically diverse place and the book reflects that. The writing is accessible and engaging while assuming the intelligence of its audience.  [image]Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall KimmererLovely nature writing, accessible science writing, with an undercurrent of deeply meaningful spirituality and a little bit of memoir. People are blown away by this book and I see why: the author’s ecological worldview intelligently combines various sources of knowledge in a way rarely seen today, and perhaps necessary for our future.  [image]Invisible Child: Poverty, Survival & Hope in an American City by Andrea ElliottThere are a lot of great books out there about poverty in America (I made a list in my !) but this is probably the best starting point I’ve yet encountered, especially for those who love a good story and are a little leery of nonfiction. The book focuses on the life of one girl growing up homeless in New York City, and on her large and messy but tight-knit family and the challenges they face. It ties it all together—public policy, racism, trauma, addiction, the child welfare system—in a way that will keep you glued to the pages.Other notes from my reading year:-	This year’s divisive mega-bestseller, Fourth Wing, wasn’t half bad when read with a buddy and low expectations. I even read the sequel.-	I listened to an audiobook, and it was weird.-	I read a book about sex, and so should you! -	I read a book about swearing, and that was fun too.-	Want to know the worst books I read in 2023? Naming and shaming is for the ones you might have heard of: Circe and White Trash.-	Of new releases, Poverty, by America was my only Goodreads Choice vote this year. But here’s a great memoir and short story collection I’d have voted for had they been nominated.-	I created a shelf for all the books I decided not to read after the first few pages—you know, the ones I’m most likely to forget. Why didn’t this happen years ago?-	Maybe one day I’ll stop starting and DNFing massive historical surveys, but don’t hold your breath.-	Nonetheless, I enjoyed three  definitively “academic” books . Social history is my jam.-	And here are two fascinating books about cultural differences in  emotion and mental health (all s now complete!)....more",Notes are private!,12,34,0,not set,not set,"Dec 29, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/62316199-2023-on-goodreads

Here’s what stands out about this one:-	Short means short: the average story has 14 pages, with a few at just 6-8.-	First person: a full 15 out of 20 stories, which was a lot for me. Only one story does anything interesting with perspective or structure; the others (first and third person alike) are straightforward single points-of-view with at most some unreliability from the narrator.-	Female-dominated, racial diversity: This is generally true of these anthologies, and perhaps the current market overall, but especially so here: 15 of the stories are by women and over half by authors of color, with a lot of diversity of background all around.-	Contemporary realism only: On the other hand, while the 2019 collection included three historical stories and three dystopian or fantastical stories, the 2023 features only modern, realistic settings (a few include hallucinations, but that happens in real life too). Disappointingly narrow for an anthology claiming to represent the best regardless of genre.-	But not domestic realism: Only a handful of stories deal much with marriage or parenting. Far more focus on cultural issues, on friendships, on community, on searches for identity and meaning.While I’d personally have preferred a reduction of the first-person onslaught, and a bit more risk-taking and genre variation, the anthology did ultimately win me over—it helped that I liked the second half, overall, much better than those in the first.Below are notes on the individual stories (what I always want from s of collections):Tender by Cherline Bazile: An immigrant high school student struggles in her relationship with her best friend, mostly because she has declared herself the only one with a right to a bad home life. Unfortunately the anthology started out with a bit of a dud for me; this one is structurally plain, has too many characters in too few pages, and we never actually see this awful home life, either. Do You Belong to Anybody? by Maya Binyam: Happily, I loved the second story, my favorite of the anthology. A man returns to his native Ethiopia after many years away, for initially unclear reasons, and it’s this absurdist tragicomedy, relayed in a voice I can best describe as “Murderbot with amnesia”—except the narrator doesn’t have amnesia, he just doesn’t feel like sharing. And is maybe neurodivergent, but certainly traumatized. I spent the whole story trying to figure out what was going on and then read it all over again once I did, which is exactly what I want from a short story. Turns out the author expanded it into a novel, which I plan to read.His Finest Moment by Tom Bissell: A famous novelist and serial sexual harasser attempts to warn his teenage daughter before the story of his bad behavior breaks. I appreciate for this story for its convincing development of a perspective from which I wouldn’t want to read a whole novel, but showing that perspective is basically all it does. Almost more snapshot than story.Camp Emeline by Taryn Bowe: A family who lost their youngest child sets up a camp for disabled kids, as seen through the eyes of the teenage sister, who is struggling. Said sister gets involved with a 24-year-old camp employee, who’s also had a rough life, and this helps, I guess? As with the first story, I was underwhelmed—it’s structurally ordinary and didn’t make me feel.Treasure Island Alley by Da-Lin: After the last two stories, the sheer ambition of this one was a breath of fresh air. It’s about the meaning of death, through both science and religion, and covers the entire long life of a Taiwanese-American woman through the prism of a single day when she was five. I’m not sure it entirely succeeds—perhaps because it’s only 13 pages long; when Ted Chiang did it he took four times that—but it’s certainly interesting.The Master Mourner by Benjamin Ehrlich: Is this even a story? I’m afraid I don’t get it at all. Seven pages consisting mostly of descriptions of a couple of eccentric adults in an Orthodox Jewish boy’s community, followed by an out-of-nowhere epiphany and a deliberately vague ending. (view spoiler)[The father died, I guess? (hide spoiler)]The Company of Others by Sara Freeman: Each year, it seems, there’s one particular story that stands out for its combination of great writing and no imagination. While her husband and young daughter are away, a woman contemplates her ambivalence about parenting and her relationship with her own dead mother, and wonders if maybe she never should have married her husband at all. I wondered if maybe something would ever happen, but it didn’t.Annunciation by Lauren Groff: Another young woman seeking her path, and things definitely happen in this one, as our narrator gets to know a couple of overlooked, eccentric women in her community—her elderly German immigrant landlady, and a coworker who is an evangelical van-dweller fleeing domestic violence. There is tragedy, and the narrator comes to understand her own mother better. Some strong character sketches, and it depicts the Bay Area with a vivid sense of place. It never quite popped for me though: the narrator and her story aren’t quite strong enough as the linchpin that must hold it all together, and the ending felt a bit weak and conventional.The Mine by Nathan Harris: A South African man has risen to manage a mine, but there’s a tragedy and he feels haunted by visions locally understood to represent a guilty conscience. Unfortunately, this story just felt inauthentic to me. There’s no sense of place (and indeed, the author is American, with no mention of even visiting South Africa), everyone including the miners speaks formal American English, and the first-person voice likewise sounds like a college-educated American, whereas the narrator is supposed to have apprenticed in a mine from boyhood.Bebo by Jared Jackson: All right, now this one brings the voice, as well as the sense of place. It’s a boys-in-the-hood story featuring young teens in the inner city, in which the narrator must confront his failings as a friend to a boy worse off than himself. I found this one very strong, though tragic and sometimes gross. At first it felt like the story was being a little hard on the narrator—the whole world has failed Bebo; what is another kid supposed to do about it?—but on reflection, isn’t that the purpose of friendship, to be there for someone even if you can’t make it better?The Muddle by Sana Krasikov: This time the friends are two Ukrainian women in their 60s: one Jewish, a nonconformist, an immigrant to the U.S.; the other more of a follower, remaining in Ukraine with her Russian husband. When Russia invades, the U.S.-based woman tries to convince her friend to get out, and must ultimately confront the limits on what we can do about how those around us live their lives and what they choose to believe. A solid and timely story, and the conversations feel very realistic, though it’s missing that extra something for me, the characters a bit lacking in depth and the sense of lives lived.My Brother William by Danica Li: This story has all the depth and feeling I was missing from the last one, following the relationship of an adult brother and sister over several decades of their lives. A beautiful, poignant story, that I think will touch anyone who has a sibling they don’t see often, and that really brings the leads to life despite being only 14 pages long. The real vs. virtual world musings didn’t add much for me, but I still thought it was great.Peking Duck by Ling Ma: The one story in the collection to play with perspective, to use structure to illustrate its themes—this is a very artsy story, in other words, yet seems to be the most popular of the bunch. Featuring a Chinese-American writer who mines her immigrant mother’s experiences in her fiction, it asks questions about who really knows a story, who has the right to tell it. And it’s fascinatingly recursive: (view spoiler)[of course I wanted the final section to be from the perspective of the actual mother; it feels so authentic! But it can’t be, because it’s autofiction; Ling Ma herself is the daughter. (hide spoiler)] I think I liked it, in a complicated way; in any case, while some of the others feel chosen at random, this one clearly belongs in a best-of collection.Compromisos by Manuel Muñoz: A gay Mexican-American father tries to reconcile with his family when his relationship with a man proves to have no future. This is… fine? Like several of the stories in this collection, it’s so restrained that its emotional impact was blunted for me. We never even meet the young daughter who seems to be the father’s primary reason to return. A visually vivid story, and an interesting perspective, but not memorable for me.Grand Mal by Joanna Pearson: A literary crime story with an unreliable narrator: this one is good, and had me going back through it for clues once I’d finished. It’s also been turned into a novel, which I don’t plan to read because I don’t like murder mysteries, but I did like the story.Trash by Souvankham Thammavongsa: A 6-page anecdote narrated by a naïve and sloppy 32-year-old grocery store cashier, about meeting her ambitious lawyer mother-in-law, who of course disapproves. From the contributor’s note, the author is impressed with her own story, but I can’t say the same; it all felt obvious, with some weird moments (who would wait 2 hours in a parking lot for someone’s shift to end rather than going elsewhere or coming in? Why does the narrator think she’s “worked her way up” at the grocery store when she’s still a cashier?).Supernova by Kosiso Ugwueze: A depressed and recently suicidal young woman is kidnapped from a bus in Nigeria and held for ransom. I liked this one, particularly the Nigerian English and Isioma’s inability to muster the level of respect and fear her captors expect, all while still behaving believably. The growing rapport with the captors is interesting too. (view spoiler)[The ending elevates it I think, forcing the reader to ask the same questions I think Isioma has been asking herself all along: does anyone care about her? (hide spoiler)] Of the stories that haven’t yet been turned into novels, this is the one I’d most like to see.This Isn’t the Actual Sea by Corinna Vallianatos: A surprisingly good story about a friendship between two middle-aged artists, a writer and a filmmaker. I’m not sure I entirely understood it, but prefer a bit of artsiness over obviousness in a short story, and the portrayal of the friendship between the two women and the filmmaker’s relationship to her art felt very real.It Is What It Is by Azareen Van Der Vliet Oloomi: A slightly bonkers story about two Iranian expat women—roommates, grad students—in Chicago, who both seem to be losing their minds. It’s the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there’s a series of tragedies or near-misses affecting their homeland (see this  for a timeline). I liked it more than I didn’t. It really isn’t about the cat.Moon by Esther Yi: An uptight young woman attends a K-pop concert and becomes completely obsessed with a member of the boy band. I didn’t really connect with this one, and thought it ended too soon: we’re still within days of the concert, too early to know whether this will actually change the narrator’s life forever or if it’s just a weird blip. The novel it turned into would no doubt answer the question but I’m not that interested.At any rate, I’m glad I read the anthology in the end; the stories are well-written (though I had a chuckle at the “‘Coincidence,’ she emitted tersely” in the penultimate story!) with some variation in subject matter if not in genre, and it introduced me to a bunch of new authors....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Feb 02, 2024","Feb 17, 2024","Dec 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/84097257-the-best-american-short-stories-2023

I picked it up mostly because the Guardian called it the most fun of the books longlisted for the 2023 Booker Prize, a statement that clearly needed more qualification—this book turns pretty dark, and while apparently some found it funny, it was not for me. But the beginning pulled me in with the promise of a literary, closely-observed family saga, and the early sections, from the points-of-view of the two children—the family’s 17-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son—were excellent. Pitch-perfect, compelling, very realistic about what it’s like to be that age and living in this particular moment. I loved it.Unfortunately it was downhill from there, and this book being an absurdly unnecessary 643 pages long meant it was a lot of downhill. After the kids’ sections comes the mother’s, which is as long as both of them combined, including a whopping 100-page flashback which is a long way from 100 pages’ worth of interesting and even then hides a couple of key (though again, not that jaw-dropping) events to be revealed even later. Also, Imelda is one of those stock female characters whose entire life consists of the fact that she is beautiful and her relationships with the (mostly male) people around her. (While there are few functional relationships in this book of any sort, the most connection and least toxicity are reserved for male-male or to a lesser extent male-female pairings.) And Murray chooses to represent her lack of education by forgoing punctuation in her sections, which while I got used to it, nonetheless feels contrived (as if consciously punctuating one’s internal monologue were the norm) and lazy (Imelda comes to life far less well than the others, perhaps in part from the author’s assumption that lack of periods and commas somehow reveals her mind).Then we get the father’s section, which was a bit more interesting than the mother’s, and with a couple of genuine surprises. (view spoiler)[I was not expecting that rape scene; in fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a male author write something like that. (hide spoiler)] The book never fully recovered for me though, and then the final 150 pages are all in the second person, cycling ever more rapidly among the main characters toward an absurdly contrived denouement. I think I understand why the ambiguity of the ending—impending climate change comes up frequently throughout the book, and (view spoiler)[so presumably Murray leaves the family’s fate hanging in the balance to symbolize where the world stands right now (hide spoiler)]. And I see how it was foreshadowed (view spoiler)[from the very first sentence (hide spoiler)]. That said, that foreshadowing largely serves to point up the absurdity of the final scene, to me: if this is meant to be a book about (view spoiler)[what might drive a man to kill his family, as the murderer in the neighboring town did (hide spoiler)], perhaps it ought to explore what might actually motivate that, rather than how you might contrive a situation where it happens accidentally through a chain of bizarre and unlikely coincidences.But there’s a lot of melodrama and contrivance and emotional manipulation there at the end, and looking back on the book as a whole, this was going on well before the end; I just find myself less impressed with the whole thing. The characters now seem awfully broad, with everyone outside the family being one-note, mostly unpleasant and manipulative, and even the leads generally defined by a couple of traits. In retrospect the father is pretty much a caricature of (view spoiler)[a gay man (hide spoiler)], and the mother was a caricature of a shallow woman all along. The kids are better and feel more real, particularly the son; I was annoyed that Murray couldn’t give the daughter a single female friend or potential friend without sexual attraction being involved. The two non-Irish characters are particularly flat and stereotypical: the sexy Brazilian babe and the villainous Polish hunk. (I have no idea if making villainous hunks Polish in particular is a stereotype in common circulation, but “villainous foreign hunk” seems like a pretty universal one.)So, while this initially seemed promising, in the end I can’t recommend it. It never justifies the unusual length and didn’t deliver the strong character work I expected either....more",Notes are private!,10,29,1,"Feb 13, 2024","Feb 20, 2024","Dec 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62039166-the-bee-sting

I actually read the more recent Five Ways to Forgiveness, with an additional novella added; you can find the whole collection on ebook, or do as I did and get it in hard copy in Hainish Novels & Stories, Vol. 2. The collection, or “story suite” as Le Guin called it, consists of a novelette and four novellas, following the disintegration of a slave-based society on two planets.By far my favorite story was the first one, “Betrayals,” which is absolutely perfect. It follows an older woman in retirement in a remote village, and it is beautiful and poignant and strangely devastating for a story that, in the end, has a lot of hope. It is vivid in its sense of place and culture, the characters come powerfully to life as unique and believable people who would rarely get a leading role in fiction, it is wise and generous and, as I said, perfectly crafted. This set an extremely high bar.The next story, “Forgiveness Day,” doesn’t quite measure up, but it’s still excellent. It follows a young diplomat—a woman of looser habits than the patriarchal slaveholding society in which she’s posted is comfortable with—and her rigid ex-military bodyguard, and what happens when a complex political situation explodes into violence. Le Guin does a masterful job of crafting these characters and their viewpoints and the way they bounce off each other, the story is exciting and we see more of the wider world.Then comes “A Man of the People,” which was the nadir of the collection for me. It also features a diplomat, and half the novella follows his life story on his home planet before he even arrives, and when he does show up and become an ally to the women’s movement on the post-liberation slave planet, his remains the least interesting perspective from which this story could be told. Perhaps because the story rushes through so much material in so little time, I didn’t get a strong sense of anyone in it as people, either.This is followed by “A Woman’s Liberation”—these two novellas being much more closely linked than anything else in the collection—in which a former slave turned activist writes a first-person account of her life story. There’s something dutifully virtuous about its trudge through all the abuse the protagonist receives, all the abused and dead women around her, and little sense of personality to any of them. The story is also very invested in her coming back around to sex and getting into a long-term relationship, when I would’ve been more interested in seeing her other relationships explored. Some strong moments, but left me much colder than it should have. The collection ends with “Old Music and the Slave Women” (Le Guin had an idea for a sixth story, but it never came to fruition), in which an aging intelligence officer is held hostage first by one side, then the other, in what seem to be the final weeks of a war for liberation. This one is good—the smaller scope serves it well, the messiness of war and politics and the clash between ideals and reality all well-drawn—though it never fully gripped me.Overall, there’s a lot to love about this collection. The settings are complex and richly-drawn. I didn’t really need the worldbuilding notes at the end, and only skimmed them, as what we need to know is woven into the text, but it’s clear a lot of thought and knowledge of the world went into this. It was simultaneously frustrating and amazing to have moments (and this happened multiple times) where I felt I didn’t fully understand character reactions due to my lack of familiarity with their cultures and religions—well, of course I shouldn’t, foreign cultures are far more complex than can be fully grasped in a novel, and the usual over-simplification of invented societies in fiction is what makes most of them feel so artificial. These feel real. I loved everything about the use of language, the different speech patterns, the existence of multiple languages in the setting, the way vocabulary and grammatical structure at times became relevant to the story. The politics, likewise, feel genuinely realistic and complex—Le Guin is clearly someone familiar with real-world politics and history, and also wears that knowledge lightly, unlike the typical author of speculative fiction who invents amateur nonsense and expects us to be impressed. She understands both humans and human systems and that is a rare and amazing thing in the genre.So, I wish I’d loved the collection as a whole a little more. I wish half of it hadn’t been told from the perspective of diplomats from elsewhere, when I wanted to dig deep into this world rather than reflecting on the role of the outsider and ally, no matter how meritorious those reflections may be. I wish there had indeed been five ways to forgiveness rather than sex and romance being repeated so much! (I say this only half-seriously, these are complex stories and so there is a lot more to them than that, but nevertheless every woman’s story ends with her pairing off.) I could have done without some very over-the-top instances of violence against women in “A Man of the People” and “A Woman’s Liberation”: even by the standards of this type of milieu, several of these are really extreme and beyond what I thought necessary to make the point (this being the one thing—other than outdated tech which is in no way the point of the book anyway—that I think might be different had the stories been written in the 2020s and not the 1990s). And I found the time-travel aspects of space travel disturbing (as was likely intended) and not fully explored in the lives of the off-worlders.Nevertheless, it is such a well-written collection overall that its virtues outweigh its faults, in the end. I am definitely planning to read more Le Guin....more",Notes are private!,2,13,1,"Jan 15, 2024","Jan 22, 2024","Nov 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/92605.Four_Ways_to_Forgiveness

This is especially true when our own house is not in order: compared to physical health, our understanding of mental health runs far behind. The science is still very much evolving (we’re still at the level of diagnosing symptoms as illnesses, where physical health was in the 18th century), and not as reliably as one would hope, given drug companies’ dominance over the research. And aspects of western society may make us more vulnerable to mental illness in the first place.There are only four chapters so I’ll discuss them in turn, for those who may not read the book yourselves:1. Anorexia in Hong KongUp until the 1990s, anorexia was not only extremely rare in Hong Kong, it presented nothing like the stereotypical western model. While still mostly affecting distressed women, they were not teenagers, not high achievers, did not have body dysmorphia or interest in losing weight, and reported untraceable physical causes (lump in the throat, painful digestion, etc.) for their inability to eat. Interestingly, the same was true in the U.S. in the early 19th century. Watters traces the history of anorexia through 19th century hysteria, which had all sorts of weird symptoms—convulsions, paralysis, day blindness—until hysterics as a group seemed to settle on anorexia as an expression of their distress. This phenomenon is quite common, in which something enters the “symptom pool” and then is unconsciously picked up by suffering people.The risk, then, is that we misunderstand how we are exporting anorexia: not through western beauty standards—not everywhere that prizes thinness has an anorexia problem—but through the very consciousness-raising meant to help sufferers. Indeed, this seems to have happened in Hong Kong: after one highly publicized case, western pop-cultural ideas about anorexia were everywhere, and anorexia itself then spiked. Likewise, in the UK, bulimia spiked both when people suspected Princess Di had it, and when she announced that she had it.What More I Wanted: It’s hard to tease out whether something is being diagnosed more because awareness is bringing already-suffering people in for treatment, or because awareness is causing people to manifest these symptoms, then come in for treatment. The author makes the valid point that severe anorexia would be a strange thing for doctors to miss if it was in fact widespread (and a western-trained doctor who returned to Hong Kong in the 80s actively sought out anorexics, and found very few). But I was left wondering how the equivalent distress was expressed before anorexia. And also, what is the right amount of awareness, getting help to the people who need it without increasing the problem?Also Consider: The Sleeping Beauties: And Other Stories of Mystery Illness, on culture-bound syndromes and how psychosomatic symptoms can be contagious.2. PTSD in Sri LankaPTSD is a buzzword in the U.S. these days, which can make us evangelical about it. When a tsunami hit Sri Lanka in 2004, western psychologists appeared in droves, in a massive and poorly-managed mental health intervention. “Treatments” for expected future trauma responses involved things like “debriefing” people in groups of 25, with a facilitator unfamiliar with the language and culture, and despite the fact that post-incident debriefs have been shown to be detrimental even in the west, increasing later symptoms. Other “treatments” boiled down to “showing up” and “witnessing” people’s pain, while the locals were more interested in practical support (unlike the groups providing food and shelter, however, the mental health crowd wasn’t asking people what they thought they needed). Still other providers were in fact conducting research, which was often unclear to their subjects, who thought giving the right answers would get them access to practical help.The larger problem is that trauma, too, manifests differently by culture—that’s also true in the West, where symptoms have shifted over time (WWI shell shock included tics and paralysis; American Civil War soldiers reported chest aches and the perception of a weak heartbeat). So checklists of common western symptoms may be inapplicable to another culture. And, too, resilience is different. Every culture has its own ways of managing suffering and trauma, which may not work like ours (but probably aren’t worse than “debriefing”!). And of course, there’s a difference between experiencing post-traumatic stress, and having a disorder, when what defines a disorder is mismatch with your environment. Hypervigilance for instance is adaptive. What More I Wanted: This is probably the most dated section of the book (published in 2010). Not because it’s bad—in fact I think anyone with anything to do with trauma should read it—but because PTSD is so huge in the U.S. that there’s been a lot of research since. The book doesn’t address how it shapes the brain, which doesn’t mean Watters is wrong—brains interact with culture—but studying that cross-culturally could tell us much more. I also would have liked to see discussion of the cross-cultural prevalence of “classic” PTSD symptoms around intrusive memories.Also Consider: Between Us: How Cultures Create Emotions, about how emotional experiences are shaped by culture.3. Schizophrenia in TanzaniaA well-known 25-year study, completed in the 1990s, showed that people with schizophrenia often do better long-term in less developed, less industrialized countries. Western psychology is eager to push a biomedical (“it’s a brain disease”) understanding of mental illness on everyone, in part out of the belief that this reduces stigma. Unfortunately, it actually does the opposite. People who believe that someone’s distress results from life experiences, or even from a spiritual malady or possession in societies where this is an accepted part of life, are more accepting and less afraid of the suffering person. Across cultures, the brain disease model increases stigma, perhaps by creating the impression that it is an immutable part of the person.Another interesting theory on the different outcomes (borne out by the research of those the author interviewed) is that with schizophrenia even more than other mental illnesses, outcomes are worsened by criticism, judgment and even well-meant obsession with the illness from relatives. Families that just accept improvements and relapses as they come get better results than those who obsess over making the person well or engage in dramatic self-sacrifice, putting pressure on the person and potentially reducing them to their illness. This resigned attitude is far easier to accomplish on Zanzibar, where it fits with a general acceptance of difficulties in life, than in the U.S., where our individualism makes us obsessed with “overcoming” things.What More I Wanted: In our highly individualistic society, of course I wanted an exploration of the other end of the spectrum! At what point does disengagement from relatives make things worse, rather than better?Also Consider: Strangers to Ourselves: Unsettled Minds and the Stories That Make Us, about the importance of meaning in shaping mental illness.4. Depression in JapanDrug companies really wanted to market antidepressants in Japan, but to their chagrin, the Japanese didn’t consider themselves depressed. So they engaged in an intensive marketing campaign to convince the Japanese that they were sick, and then sell them medicine. This required overturning Japanese ideas about melancholy, which was considered a perfectly acceptable and even admirable way to be. It also depended on the argument that suicide in Japan results from depression, which is far from clear in a society where suicide has long been considered a valid way to make a social or moral statement.What the Japanese got out of this was feeling sick, not necessarily followed by getting well. Drug companies’ pervasive influence over medical research and the people who do it has allowed them to wildly oversell antidepressants, which outperform placebos in only about 10% of people. Also, all this again involved imposing a western view of what depression looks like: in other cultures, the equivalent involves largely physical symptoms. (According to a depressed person I asked, physical symptoms happen in the U.S. too, but doctors consider them unimportant. Which in turn perhaps pushes depressed people into expressing—and experiencing—the symptoms that get recognition in our culture.) What More I Wanted: More on the connection or lack thereof between depression and suicide in Japan.Also Consider: Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions, also a critical look at depression outside the drug-company model.--In sum, obviously I found this book fascinating and important. That said, I did find it a bit weak in a couple of areas: I wanted it to delve more into our societal expectations that cause things to be labeled “disorders” at all, from ADHD to grief (yes, “prolonged grief disorder” is in the DSM). So much of this is inconvenient for our society, but a perfectly normal way for humans to be. Also, in the end the author shies away from value statements or comparisons, opining simply that diversity in mental health is valuable for its own sake, like different kinds of butterflies. Surely, when we are talking about human suffering, the question should be if other cultures’ models are better: if not for everyone, at least for them. But all that said, it’s an important topic regardless, and I’d recommend the book (as well as those listed above). If nothing else, it will inspire some of the perspective and humility that we’re clearly lacking in telling other cultures we know best....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 18, 2023","Dec 22, 2023","Nov 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8774261-crazy-like-us

This one combines a handful of important facts to know about your bA long, chatty, imaginative but sloppy work of popular science by a non-scientist. This one combines a handful of important facts to know about your body and a call to end the exclusion of women from medical testing; with speculation about the role of women and the female body in evolutionary history, which though hypothetical is at least fun to think about, and a useful counter to equally hypothetical male-centered assumptions; and with its own weird assumptions, bad facts and unnecessary personal asides. The pages do turn quickly, but in the end it’s more entertainment (if this is your thing) than education.But to break it down. First, a few important or cool facts:-	The introduction is probably the most important chapter, calling attention to how much medical research (on humans and even on animals) includes exclusively male subjects… or if females are included, there’s no analysis of sex differences. The problem is that women are not small men. So for instance, prescriptions of pain meds will be inadequate because women’s livers process drugs more quickly. Even heart attacks look different in women—in fact, while women have fewer heart attacks than men, we’re more likely to die of them because they go unrecognized. I hope the introduction will be influential because this is a serious problem.-	It turns out even women’s fat is different. Fat deposits around the body are differently constituted, and women’s hips, butts and thighs store specific fatty acids used to make baby brains and retinas. You can’t get enough just during pregnancy, so your body starts hoarding them in puberty. What if you get a liposuction and then get pregnant? No one knows!-	A mother’s body actually communicates with the baby’s body through nursing. The nipple takes in and analyzes baby saliva, then adjusts the formula of the milk accordingly—for instance, with immune system boosters for a sick child. This communication can also have negative results: for instance, a very stressed mother can transmit that cortisol to the baby. -	Also, women who haven’t given birth and even men can lactate, though usually not much and usually requiring medication (and it doesn’t always work). Yes, there is a culture where men engage in so much childcare they’ve even been known to breastfeed!Some evolutionary arguments I had doubts about:-	Breasts: why do we have them? You don’t need all that just to feed a baby. Bohannon argues that it’s probably not sexual selection because women have such a wide variety of breast sizes, all of which are functional for nursing. This seems to me like a good argument for why it is sexual selection, because if it’s only aesthetic rather than a survival or reproductive need, there’s more wiggle room.-	Menopause: why do we have it? Turns out, we’re one of only two species that do (the other being orcas); others reproduce till they die, sometimes much older than us. (Chimps and elephants can give birth in their 60s!) Bohannon posits that our bodies were once programmed to die around the time we now have menopause, but having some old people around was good for the community, so our bodies evolved to live longer but somehow women’s reproductive systems got left behind. I’m afraid I don’t follow this one either.-	Rape: how common was it among our ancestors? Bohannon argues not that common, because we don’t have twisty vaginas or spiked penises or cervixes that can be closed off to sperm, which some rape-prone species have evolved to facilitate or fight back against rape. This doesn’t seem very convincing: first because our bodies have indeed evolved mechanisms to protect us from injury during rape (this is why many women experience physiological arousal even though they’re definitely not into it), and second because, as Bohannon herself points out, we already have a much harder time conceiving than most species. A mallard duck’s “trapdoor” vagina means she has only a 2% chance of conceiving from rape, which is a big difference if you’re a species that normally only needs to mate once per cycle, but humans average only a 5% chance of pregnancy from any single encounter, and that’s when you’re young. Plus, Bohannon also argues that humans likely developed gynecology among our earliest tools—thus, evolved to get rid of unwanted pregnancies by intentionally aborting them, rather than our bodies doing it for us like other species. So we do in fact have adaptations to protect us, however imperfect, at least from dying. She also weirdly distinguishes “forcible rape” from “coercion” among chimps, with the former being not that common. I don’t follow that argument at all: “forcible rape” being uncommon among chimps tells us what, exactly, about all rape among humans?-	Brains: I was unimpressed with this chapter all around (except for the bit about how female sex hormones apparently help keep swelling down after a traumatic brain injury, resulting in better recovery, and potentially being developed into medication for everybody—that was cool). Bohannon falls into the trap of assuming that whatever we see around us must be biological rather than cultural, and while she does at least mention that differences among members of the same sex are far greater than differences between group averages, she still spills a lot of ink on those averages. She discusses differences in average test scores without even mentioning (until later) stereotype threat, and how these differences can be culturally programmed: even being reminded of a stereotype before a test alters scores to better fit the stereotype, so what does a lifetime in that cultural stew do to you? (You can read more about it in this excellent book.) She doesn’t consider whether girls’ average math scores might be depressed by a society that stereotypes math as a boy thing; whether young girls might have better verbal skills than boys because caretakers talk to and encourage them more; whether there might be societal reasons that men commit suicide more often than women. Despite the fact that the last has an enormous, 17%-of-the-planet-sized exception: in China women kill themselves more. She doesn’t even mention that.-	Sexism: Bohannon argues that sexism—including internalized sexism—is also hardwired, using as evidence the fact that many women (including apparently herself) are harsher on women than men: for instance, blaming the single woman rather than the married man for an affair. Perhaps because I don’t share her reaction on that point, this argument seems awfully weak, and again, Bohannon overlooks psychological and sociological explanations. Certainly having a common set of rules helps bind a community together, but just assuming your own cultural detritus is written into the genes of all humans is absurd.Other stuff that was just weird or wrong:-	The bit about how men are faster but women have more endurance, illustrated by the fact that men beat women by 18% in a 5k, 11% in a marathon, but at 195 miles, women outrun men. How many people have ever run 195 miles in a go? Are they representative? Also, at the more common distances are we talking average runners or average winners?-	“There actually aren’t that many female prostitutes at work these days. By the most generous estimates, sex workers constitute only 0.6 percent of the U.S. population.” That’s… actually an enormous number if you ask me. A google search seems to bear it out, with an estimated total of 1-2 million sex workers in the U.S., 20% male and 80% female. So this footnote is perhaps accurate but in fact did more than anything else I’ve seen to convince me that sex work is a serious issue today.-	Then there’s the suggestion that “the latest numbers estimate that as many as 20 percent of humans are homosexual,” also so wildly huge that I went looking. Her citation is to an article I’m unable to access, but which claims nothing so grand in its abstract, instead stating that asking questions about sexuality in a veiled way makes people 65% more likely to report “nonheterosexual identity” and 59% more likely to report “same sex experiences.” The numbers I am able to find show a range of 4-8% by state of Americans identifying as “LGBT,” and the B is doing a lot of work there. Young people are far more likely to report an LGBT identity, but when you look at the breakdown, the increase is entirely in the fact that the numbers identifying as bisexual have shot up (with gays and lesbians holding steady at 3-4%, but 12% now calling themselves bi, thus leading to a spike in LGBT-identified people overall). Sexuality is fluid and often situational, so I’m not surprised a study digging for any indicia of “nonheterosexuality”—thus including people who are even a little bit bi—would hit 20% or even higher. But Bohannon calls all those people “homosexual,” i.e., gay or lesbian, and that’s flat wrong. Also, this statement is in service of the argument that we evolved this way to have extra childless adults to lend a hand in babysitting, which seems unconvincing given that plenty of adults are infertile without being gay, and that attraction as a cultural prerequisite for conception is by no means universal.-	Sadly, sloppiness with facts seems to be a pattern, even just with stuff I’m able to verify: take also the claim that “some say” that the Black Death killing 1/3 of the European population “[is] why Europe went through the Dark Ages, while the Islamic empires managed to flourish.” There is no source for this, presumably because even the most amateur of historians would immediately recognize it for hogwash: the Black Death struck Europe in the 1340’s, already in the late Middle Ages (which historians also no longer call the Dark Ages, but anyway), at which point the Islamic golden age—begun several centuries before—was by most accounts already over.And I’ve barely scratched the surface. This is a long book, made longer with personal anecdotes and pop culture references and imaginary recreations of ancient life and virtue signaling the author’s trans inclusivity without offering much in the way of science, on how hormones begun at different times of life affect the body, etc. I did find the speculation about evolution relatively interesting, and I hope the author’s points about the absence of women from medical research will help jumpstart some necessary work. But a book that needs this much fact-checking, and full of this much questionable speculation, can’t be taken seriously....more",Notes are private!,6,37,1,"Feb 12, 2024","Feb 23, 2024","Nov 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/75494215-eve

It’s intereMy least favorite book in a strong trilogy, about the lives of two Métis families in contemporary Winnipeg, connected by a terrible crime. It’s interesting how different each of the books is, and how they connect to each other: The Break is narrow in time but broad in character, mostly following the victim’s family; The Strangers is narrower in character but covers several years, exclusively following the perpetrator’s family. The Circle again covers a short period of time but is extremely broad in its cast: each of its 22 chapters is from a different perspective, including both families and other people tangentially related.Structuring a novel as a metaphorical restorative justice circle is a cool idea, though I was relieved that there isn’t a literal restorative justice circle, which is probably not a good idea for these people and this crime. At the same time, it has its pitfalls. Vermette does a good job of keeping tabs on the major characters through other people’s point-of-view sections, but limiting each character to a chapter does distance the reader a bit from the central players. And where The Strangers showed a strong ability to differentiate character voices even in the third person, the deluge here makes them all sound fairly similar.Meanwhile, some of the new people don’t really have anything to do, and so their entire sections consist of talking to a main character (Waaban), or worse, talking about a main character to third parties (Izzy), or worse still, just thinking about a main character’s backstory (Larry). If this were a restorative justice circle, I can’t say I’d care to hear this much from people whose connection to the crime is being mildly inconvenienced by the struggles of someone more seriously affected, and with this being the only snippet we see, it can make the minor characters’ inner lives look overly focused on someone who isn’t actually that important to them. I found the format most successful in catching us up on recurring secondary characters, whose chapters are often quite poignant: Ben, adjusting to retirement after his wife’s death; Shawn, getting to know his biological father, who’s in a nursing home; Nevaeh, now a single mother with big plans.There’s a sense in which this structure makes the whole book feel like an extended epilogue—especially since it’s fairly short; even the 240-page count is a bit inflated, as a couple of chapters are formatted as prose poetry with a ton of white space. But don’t let that epilogue feel lull you into a false sense of security, because it’s ultimately leading up to a new and horrible tragedy. There’s certainly hope, resilience and love here, but nothing is really over.All that said, I did enjoy the broad range of characters, from different ages and generations, different walks of life, all written believably and with sympathy, even when they’re difficult. Vermette is clearly a writer who is fundamentally interested in people, and if the book feels sometimes pulled in different directions because she just wants to follow some new person home and meet their family and hear about their job and explore how they came to be who they are, I actually love that. These books have always been about a community and about how people negotiate the circumstances of their lives. So widening the circle makes sense. I didn’t love how outright preachy Vermette has gotten on social justice issues, which is a change from her earlier books, though these books are very much placed in the moment in which they’re written and her milieu has probably changed too.Some commentary on specific characters and their endings below the spoiler cut:(view spoiler)[-	Jake! This kid’s death hurt. I wondered if he even knew how little Emily mattered to Phoenix as a person—that the rape wasn’t even about Emily, it was about Phoenix laying claim to her baby daddy, which made me think there was very little chance of Phoenix harassing Emily again. Although who knows with Phoenix. Also, any so-called defense lawyer who is pushing for a guilty plea to murder within a week of the supposed crime, the only evidence of which is that someone with a habit of running away has disappeared again, and all while refusing to investigate exonerating evidence, is criminally incompetent. Don’t be taken in by fancy clothes.-	As for Phoenix, she’s in pretty much the same place she’s always been: you can see she has the capacity for redemption, but all the stars will have to align and stay aligned for it to work and is that ever going to happen? I felt bad for Joe and his family—they might be better off if Phoenix “just” steals their truck and gets out of there.-	Cedar-Sage let me down a bit in this one: I don’t know whether it’s because of her growing up, or her not having much to do here, or from several of her appearances being through the eyes of people who sort of like her but also find her a bit pitiful (all this sitting at the window pining is a bit much) or from so much of the social justice preaching being put on her. In any case, reading about her wasn’t the emotional experience it was in the last book. And I wasn’t sure what Ziggy saw in her.-	Lou continues to annoy the hell out of me. The combination of her chapters being in first person when no one else is (except Cedar, who has youth and pathos and more central story importance going for her) and her always having the most banal and obnoxious romantic drama in the midst of a family tragedy, makes it feel like she thinks she is the protagonist in a work of women’s fiction when in fact she’s a secondary character in a literary one. This time I think the annoyance must be intended because it’s such a sordid affair, and with such awful results. -	Speaking of which, Tommy (now Tom) was a lot more sympathetic last time around—I wonder if Vermette soured on police in the interim, or just wanted a realistic story of someone who starts out idealistic and well-intentioned, then gets sucked into the system (and marries the wrong person, which has turned out exactly the way you’d have guessed).-	Alex pissed me off too. Not only for, you know, ordering a hit on a kid just trying to protect his family, but for his warped view of his own family dynamics. Alex can’t imagine how his brother and sister turned out so selfish! Well, for the record, by “selfish” he means not involved in the family gang business, and as for how Elsie and Joe turned out, Alex apparently does not realize that he was their abusive mom’s golden child. This book doesn’t even go into that, which had me outraged on their behalf—new readers might believe him!-	I was glad for Elsie’s hopeful ending though. This poor woman has been through the wringer her whole life and finally seems to have arrived in a good place, with a supportive and healthy community around her. I just wish she’d be more involved with Cedar, though I can see how feelings of inadequacy are keeping her away. -	I had some doubts about Emily’s identification with asexuality. She is annoyed that her mom and therapist suspect this is trauma-related rather than inherent to her being, but I was with them, given that, you know, her first and only sexual experience was a horrific rape at age 13 and she now lives holed up in her mom’s basement seeing practically no one. But I felt like we weren’t supposed to question her identification given the overall context of the book, its embrace of neopronouns and so on, and if the point here was to include asexual representation, could it not have been literally anyone else? Why is this the only one introduced in such a way that you can’t help but question it, while at the same seeming to scold anyone who does? Maybe it’s actually a good choice, to make readers think, but it irked me a little.- It’s funny that out of all the prior POV characters still living, Stella—the one the first book’s blurb treated like the protagonist, though she wasn’t—is the only one not to reappear here. We don’t even really get an update. And she was in fact affected by the crime. (hide spoiler)]At any rate, I had sufficient emotional investment in the characters that overall I did enjoy this. I think Vermette gets people, and writes well and with complexity about a marginalized community. But for new readers, don’t start here: begin with The Strangers or preferably The Break, which anyway are stronger and more cohesive....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 27, 2024","Feb 29, 2024","Oct 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/144423669-the-circle

The British title is “A History of the Roman Empire in 21 Women” and that’s more representative of its contents, though less allusive, than the American one, “A Rome Of One’s Own” (although over a third of the book is set before Rome became an empire). The chapters each focus on a different woman (or two) and a different period in history, so for me, something to read a chapter at a time rather than blow through all at once.Happily, I learned a fair bit about Roman history from this. The women profiled are diverse, and other than Boudicca (because no one can resist writing about Boudicca) were ones I hadn’t heard of before. The book moves from examination of the roles of women in Rome’s foundation myths; to the formerly enslaved woman who would up giving information that brought down the cult of Dionysus, all in an effort to save her boyfriend from his malicious mom; to a businesswoman in Pompei, officers’ wives at the forts along Hadrian’s Wall, a highborn court poet, an early Christian martyr. There are women at the peak of political power, too: I especially enjoyed reading about Augustus’s daughter Julia Caesar, whose restricted upbringing ultimately turned into rebellion, and Julia Maesa, a Syrian woman whose sister married an officer who later became emperor, and who later fought successfully to get her two successive grandsons on the throne. There were some real Machiavellian moves there, but she seems to have been popular, and I’d love to read a novel about her if anybody could write a good one.In the end, I definitely enjoyed this and found it well worth reading, as well as sometimes humorous. Too much of this author’s voice would probably begin to grate, but in small doses it is excellent, and a great way to learn more about Roman history....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 31, 2024","Apr 08, 2024","Oct 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/98652084-a-rome-of-one-s-own

I don’t think it’s a great work of art, but it is a lot of fun. I am reading them as a buddy read and they are ideal for that, or for anyone who wants to engage with a fandom: they are plot-heavy books chock-full of secrets and hidden agendas and fertile ground for speculation of every sort. The series is also an interesting mashup of narrative elements and styles: I would call it epic fantasy for an audience whose first love was YA, as written by an author steeped in American military culture and romance novels. None of these are elements I love on their own, but it’s fun to see how Yarros mixes them together.Iron Flame picks up right where Fourth Wing left off, and the plot does not slow down: just as much happens here as in the first, with lots of new revelations, new characters, new information about the world, and some big events, most of which I definitely was not expecting. Overall it was a satisfying story, and while I’m not fully convinced it needed to be 140 pages longer than Fourth Wing (a few of these scenarios could have been cut down a bit), it left me very interested to see what would happen next.One thing I think Yarros struggles with a bit here is particularly interesting to me. This series has just as many characters as your typical epic fantasy, but unlike most, only one point-of-view. Which results in Violet having the fairly unique opportunity among fictional protagonists to have about as many people in her life as you’d expect from a real person! Especially a person who is basically attending fantasy West Point. Violet has:-	1 love interest-	2 dragons-	3 close relatives-	3 ride-or-die squadmates-	1 non-military nerd friend-	1 antagonistic quasi-friend-	2 messy situations where one person is deeply invested while the other thinks they are sworn enemiesPlus a variety of other relationships with somewhat less investment: her doctor; several professors who seem invested in her success; a former mentor who can no longer be trusted; various peripheral squadmates, at least two of whom will obviously have a significant future role. This is a lot of characters to develop and relationships to maintain (not counting the 3+ actual sworn enemies since those don’t need maintenance), which is probably why most books don’t try. And I don’t think Yarros is entirely successful, in that characters often seem to drop off the radar despite living in the same place, and Violet’s squadmates and friends tend to have one-note personalities, if that. But as someone who gets tired of the limited relationship options usually available to protagonists (normally you get about 3 significant people, including 1-2 love interests and a parent or mentor), it was fun to see someone write an actually connected character. And I enjoy the family drama in these books a lot, while being less invested in the dragons and the romance than many readers. Well, this installment definitely delivers on the family drama front.Of course, like many hastily-written-but-huge fantasy sequels, there are writing tics: eyes flare, shoulders dip, “lectures” is frequently used as a dialogue tag, and most confusingly, the act of someone putting their hand in another’s hair is repeatedly described with the verb “spear.” I suppose all that tracks with the use of the first person present (Violet doesn’t have time to stop and think about her word choice either, and in any case first person present is not a stylistic choice from which I have high literary expectations). There are other nits I could pick, too: these books dump more trauma than they have time to deal with, and the characters don’t always feel quite like products of their world. Thus far each volume has one truly absurd fight scene in which Violet wins in a head-scratchingly convoluted way. Overall though, this was a fun read, with its heart very much in the right place, and despite my middling rating, I find myself resonating far more with fans of the series than its detractors. I’ll definitely read the next when it’s released, and I’ll fully enjoy theorycrafting in the meanwhile....more",Notes are private!,3,18,1,"Nov 07, 2023","Nov 24, 2023","Oct 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/90202302-iron-flame

After reading the book, I This book is about an important topic, and as the author is a history professor, I imagine she knows a great deal about it. After reading the book, I am left imagining, however, because good luck gleaning information from it.The book suffers from a lack of organization on any level: paragraphs, chapters, the book as a whole. I was left with little sense of what the author was trying to say other than that Africa and Europe have a history together, nor was the focus of individual chapters particularly clear, as they leap around in time, place and subject with no transitions. While the book is sold as a rebuttal to the notion that people of African descent living in Europe are a relatively new phenomenon, kicking off with World Wars I and II, it actually does little to rebut that or even focus on it much. Out of seven chapters, the first two are sort of about that, though also with non-sequiturs like the Roman-governed Egyptians’ war with Nubia, cited as an example of European/African contact. Then it jumps straight from the Roman Empire to the Renaissance. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on European overseas empires and the slave trade, Chapter 5 on the period around the world wars, and Chapters 6 and 7 are all about 21st century activism. But the biggest problem is with the writing itself; I wouldn’t even call it academic—there’s a bit of jargon, but not much—so much as clunky, confusing and at times incoherent. Here are some examples:Dutch ambiguity was further evidenced by the debate about slavery and education to which Capitein contributed in some degree. Capetein arrived in Middelburg in 1728. He then travelled with Van Gogh to The Hague, where Van Gogh had a house. Two years after his arrival, Van Gogh sent him to German-born minister [sic] of the Reformed Church, Johann Philipp Manger. Manger’s impression on the boy was important. In the 1730s the Republic was at its height in terms of trade and culture. The Dutch, Capitein amongst them, were proud of its achievements. Through Capitein’s writings, one learns that The Hague and the whole of the country were a source of regional and national esteem. Manger’s position as a vocal protector of immigrants and a tolerant Christian provided access to a more balanced and outward-looking perspective that greatly influenced the young Capetein. Under Manger’s tutelage, Capitein learnt French and was encouraged to consider university. In 1735, at nearly eighteen years old, he was baptized. He joined the University of Leiden two years later. (72)It’s as if the author put all the sentences into a blender and slapped them down in the order they came out—and at no point is the debate about slavery and education addressed, despite being the apparent thesis sentence of the paragraph. Or see this one, about France:The number of legal cases involving black people led the authorities to suggest that a special unit should be set up. In 1777 the Police des Noirs, or ‘police for black people’, was created. Soon after, it became compulsory for black people to carry a cartouche (an identification card). Between 1777 and 1789, in Paris only, 765 people were registered. The aim of the Police des Noirs was to limit the number of black people in the country. It was not named a ‘police for enslaved people’, so the assumption by then was that all black bodies were enslaved. Masters who had enslaved domestic servants in their service had to register them or risk paying a heavy fine. Enslaved people were to stay in detention centres for the duration of their master’s stay. The costs would be the master’s responsibility. (84-85)This paragraph appears to discuss two totally different regimes—one under which black people in France had to be registered and carry identification cards at all times and were heavily policed, and another under which they were interned (in regular jails, a subsequent paragraph explains). At no point is this abrupt transition addressed: did one system replace the other? Did one apply to some people while the other applied to others? Who knows! Not the reader of this book!I was similarly confused by this one, about the French West African colony at Saint Louis:The mariage a la mode du pays was legally recognized. When the European husband died or left the country and it was confirmed that he would never come back, the woman could remarry. These women had the support of their communities if they then wanted to start anew and have children within a second or third union. The children born from the marriages had their father’s name and could enjoy the benefits of his wealth. However, these unions were not recognized by European laws, meaning that the father’s European assets could not go to his African children. In 1830, the law changed, stating that European African children in Senegal could no longer inherit their father’s property. However, a French Royal Ordinance of the same year stated that children born before 1830 were still allowed to inherit their father’s property in Saint Louis. (108)So, basically, the law didn’t allow mixed-race children to inherit their European father’s property (despite “enjoying his wealth” in some unspecified way), and then the law changed so they super-duper couldn’t inherit it?Or take this one, about a Cameroonian prince:Alexander led a life of leisure in many ways. He married Andrea when he was nineteen years old. She was seventeen. Their first child, a son, was born in 1920 and their daughter was born a year later. Alexander travelled to Cameroon in 1919 and returned the same year. He went back there again in 1922, but by then the couple had grown apart. Andrea had been allowed to move to Germany and Alexander never saw her. He allegedly refused to provide for her unless she relinquished custody of their children, so she had to work to provide for them. It was only after the Second World War that Alexander was reunited with his daughter. His relationship with his son, Jose Emmanuel Manga Bell, remained contentious. Alexander shot his son while he was on a visit to Cameroon in 1947. The circumstances of the death remain unclear. Alexander and Emmanuel were African Europeans who were caught between both identities at a time when colonial rule was shifting from German to British and French powers. (140)What a bizarre paragraph: the opening sentence has nothing to do with the rest of it (nothing here suggests a life of leisure), buried midway through there’s a surprise filicide, given no more narrative weight than the mundane biographical details, and then it wraps up on such an anodyne statement one assumes it to be true, but which is in no way supported by the information given.Likewise, some assertions really needed more explanation, such as:Despite Bailey’s strict definition of the term, we have seen over the last few years that certain forms of discrimination against black and dual-heritage women have common features. The vile media attacks against the Duchess of Sussex held similarities to those encountered by supermodel Iman. Both were deemed too far away from either blackness or whiteness. Iman famously confronted the editor-in-chief of the black US magazine Essence when she stated that Iman was ‘a white woman dipped in chocolate’ in 1976. Both women have been criticized for having either not enough or too much of certain attributes. Nonetheless, class is an element that needs to be part of the discussion. Iman and Markle have had access to a kind of wealth that many underprivileged dark-skinned black women can only dream of. They have both held professional posts based on their physical attributes as well as expertise and achievement in their fields. (178)Like much of this book, this paragraph seems aimed at people already familiar with the situations described. As someone who does not follow royal gossip and has never heard of Iman, this “certain attributes” talk was opaque to me, as was the claim that both women “held professional posts based on their physical attributes” (?).Or: As Félix Germain and Silyane Larcher have noted, black French citizens are often referred to as people issus de l’immigration (‘from an immigrant background’) ‘as if white French citizens were not also issus de l’immigration’, with the implication that ‘whites are natives, but people of African descent are not’. (190)We’re talking about France here, not the U.S.—I’m going to need some explanation for why this proposition is wrong.Or:For example, a report on stop and search police practices in Spain corroborates word of mouth stories about the relationship of the Spanish police with minority ethnic communities. The harrowing reports demonstrate that stop and search for no valid reason is widely accepted by the majority group. In fact, it is one of many ways the police force shows that it values white bodies above all else. The report found that, according to the police, racial profiling reassures the majority group even when there is no evidence of danger. Yet the practice also propagates the idea that there must be a need to profile specific communities. In 2015, the last year that police data about stop and search in Spain is available, 6,550,422 police identifications were conducted. To put things in perspective, the report argues, this needs to be compared with 1.2 million stop and searches conducted in England and Wales in 2011-12. Police impunity in public spaces has rendered these places unsafe for most minority ethnic groups in Spain. (196)Maybe this brain glitch is unique to me but formatting those numbers that way had my brain so convinced that the England/Wales count was double the Spain count that I could not for the life of me figure out why this made Spain look bad even upon several readings (thanks to the commenter who pointed it out!). If the goal is to provide perspective, maybe compare the per capita stop-and-searches in each country, and express them in the same style? (Also, while we’re on the topic of this paragraph: did the Spanish police actually admit they were searching minorities solely to reassure white people and if so, why is that buried in weaselly language in the middle of the paragraph?)Part of me felt like I should give this book a second star, because it’s an important topic and I was pleased that it ranged over Western Europe as a whole rather than centering England, as British writers usually do. And if much of the book reads like the literature  portion of someone’s thesis, at least there is good information buried in there somewhere? But then I reached the bit stating that Treyvon Martin was killed by a “neighborhood manager” (221), when in fact George Zimmerman was just a neighborhood watch volunteer, with no authority over the neighborhood or the residents. And when the facts you know are wrong, it’s hard to trust the rest of them....more",Notes are private!,5,22,1,"Jan 11, 2024","Jan 19, 2024","Oct 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55277905-african-europeans

Elizabeth Pisani lived in Indonesia for years, as a journalist and later as a public health worker, before spending a year traveling around the country in 2011-2012. And this book is full of fascinating places and people. You’ll also learn a lot: there’s some basics on the history, as well as explorations of various cultural practices, religion, work, political campaigning, education, and language, not to mention difficult issues like corruption, environmental degradation, and recent experiences of mass violence. It all fits very naturally into the author’s journey and the experiences of people she meets. I haven’t made a list of highlights, as Pisani’s storytelling is strong and I was equally engaged and interested throughout—and because so much of what’s in here sounds so bizarre or extreme out of context that a list of factoids would look like gawping, while the book itself places things in context and is respectful. Pisani doesn’t just zoom around, but often stays for weeks or months, participates in household work, and keeps up with people afterwards. Indonesia is a huge and diverse country, and the book ranges from the urban jungle of Jakarta to little-developed and remote islands, spending more than half its pages on the smaller islands of eastern Indonesia, while later chapters explore Sumatra, Borneo and Java.Pisani does a strong job of picking out the most compelling stories to share (we don’t see every place she visited) and letting the places and people she meets take center stage rather than overshadowing the story herself (though her Britishness and her age are clear from time to time). But she’s clearly up for just about anything, and gets to know a lot of people fairly well. I especially enjoyed her reconnection with people she’d met sometimes decades before, seeing how their lives had turned out. And the writing itself flows well, as you’d expect from an experienced journalist. I do agree with other ers that it’s not a book you blaze through, but one to appreciate a section at a time.For the most populous country in the world, Indonesia is not one I knew much about, and this book did a great job of putting it on my mental map.

This one’s on me, because I don’t actually like YA, but at first glance it seemed like this would be cute and fun. Once I began reading it, though, it turned out to be standard YA: little depth, a highly telegraphed romance-to-be. Does the first present present itself resist characterization, or it just used by authors unable to or uninterested in providing it? Because not only is it a distractingly artificial mode of storytelling, everyone who uses it sounds exactly the same.I also thought the protagonist accepted far too quickly that she was able to turn invisible, given that she lives in the real world, which feels like a concession to those people who complain about protagonists taking a long time to believe in magic when, well, wouldn’t you? Readers know it’s a fantasy novel but the characters don’t.Still, my biggest suspension-of-disbelief-breaking moment was when the 17-year-old heroine, who has been at her boarding school for 5 years and apparently never had any friends or social group (nor a boyfriend or anything else that might substitute for that), suddenly realizes this apparently for the first time. Honestly, I thought that was made clear in the preceding scene when she arrives in the auditorium, has no one to gravitate towards and so goes to sit with her roommate, who accepts it but clearly wasn’t saving that seat for her. She’s in high school, you’re telling me similar scenes don’t play out every day? At that age, in that environment, there’s no way someone with a precarious friend situation is not keenly aware of it, who they’re with during social time and how much they want each other there. In the end it feels like this girl just didn’t fully exist before the book began, again highlighting the artificiality of the whole exercise....more",Notes are private!,3,9,0,not set,not set,"Sep 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60099660-if-you-could-see-the-sun
