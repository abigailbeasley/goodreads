But havinMcNamara does not attempt to justify the Vietnam mistakes made by the Kennedy & Johnson administrations in which he was a major participant. But having identified those fatal flaws which cost so many American and Vietnamese lives, and gained nothing, he does not analyze why the thinking, including his, was so bad. I understand the goal of preventing the spread of communism in Asia, but once it was clear that US actions could not achieve that end, and that the South Vietnamese could not defend their country, why not tell the truth and get out. In the end, the truth was known and nothing but more death was accomplished. The fact that this same deception continued in the Nixon/Kissinger years is a major thread in my historical novel of the interactions of the US and China in the years preceding the 1972 Nixon visit to China. The failure to face facts and to act in accord with those facts, in order to gain short term political gains such as Nixon's re-election in 1972, was a disgrace. McNamara's focus on numbers, including data such as body counts, is well known, and he is well aware of his absence of historical and cultural understanding of the countries and people he and others were dealing with in SE Asia. What is inexplicable to me is his failure to assemble resources of people who did know those things and to assimilate such input into his decision-making process. McNamara associates his focus on data with his years at the Harvard Business School. I attended HBS about 20 years after McNamara was there, and I took the excellent course in management accounting which was attributed to his influence. There was a focus on numbers at HBS, but this was always in the context of non-numeric conditions and human factors, which McNamara appears to have missed or considered not worthy of his attention. How could a man as smart as McNamara be so stupid!Here are some pathetic excerpts from his book ...... We of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations who participated in the decisions on Vietnam acted according to what we thought were the principles and traditions of this nation. We made our decisions in light of those values. Yet we were wrong, terribly wrong.... One reason the Kennedy and Johnson administrations failed to take an orderly, rational approach to the basic questions underlying Vietnam was the staggering variety and complexity of other issues we faced. Simply put, we faced a blizzard of problems, there were only twenty-four hours in a day, and we often did not have time to think straight. ... LEW: what a pitiful excuse... I had never visited Indochina, nor did I understand or appreciate its history, language, culture, or values. The same must be said, to varying degrees, about President Kennedy, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, military adviser Maxwell Taylor, and many others. When it came to Vietnam, we found ourselves setting policy for a region that was terra incognita. ... There were no senior officials in the Pentagon or State Department with comparable knowledge of Southeast Asia.... We failed to analyze our assumptions critically, then or later. The foundations of our decision making were gravely flawed.... We thought that President Ngo Dinh Diem aimed to move his people toward freedom and democracy. That he had studied at a Catholic seminary in New Jersey in the early 1950s seemed evidence that he shared Western values. As we got closer and closer to the situation, however, we came to learn otherwise. Diem, those around him, and the political structures that he built lacked a connection to the South Vietnamese people; he never developed a bond with them. We totally misjudged that.... top government officials need specialists—experts—at their elbows when they make decisions on matters outside their own experience. If we had had more Asia experts around us, perhaps we would not have been so simpleminded about China and Vietnam ... Contrary to the belief that we could force and win large-scale ground operations, the Sigma II-65 report noted “considerable feeling among participants that Viet Cong adoption of the strategy of avoiding major engagements with U.S. forces would make it extremely difficult to find and fix enemy units….Viet Cong experience in the jungles [and] guerrilla warfare…would pose serious problems, even for well-equipped and highly mobile U.S. regulars.” As for bombing, the report noted, “There was considerable feeling…that [the] punishment being imposed could and would be absorbed by the Hanoi leadership… LEW ... this quote refers to events of 1965, 10 years before US left Vietnam...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 30, 2023","Sep 03, 2023","Aug 30, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/816862.In_Retrospect

The egregious error committed by US statesmen and commanders was not that of lying to the world but rather that of lying to themselves.... McNamara told young UPI reporter Neil Sheehan that “every quantitative measurement we have shows that we’re winning.” He did not perceive that the “quantitative measurements” were being pulled out of the air... McNamara developed an ill-founded belief that he understood the military. James Reston later wrote shrewdly in the New York Times, “He has the sincerity of an Old Testament prophet, but something is missing; some element of personal doubt, some respect for human weakness, some knowledge of history.”... Kissinger had never supposed Vietnam winnable. He shared with Nixon the conviction that, whatever the merits of the allied cause, the war was draining wholly excessive political attention, material resources, and moral authority from the pursuit of US vital interests elsewhere. This brilliant, charismatic figure overcame his employer’s dislike of both Jews and intellectuals by displaying first his loyalty, then an unscrupulousness to match the president’s own. Though essentially an ice-cold human being, he was skilled at simulating warmth and geniality. ... He believed the North Vietnamese could be induced to compromise only “by being confronted by insuperable obstacles on the ground.” A first step was to launch massive but secret B-52 bombings of communist sanctuaries....more",Notes are private!,0,19,2,"Nov 20, 2023Aug 29, 2023","Nov 30, 2023Sep 05, 2023","Aug 29, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36099654-vietnam

Summers has done his research and my conclusion is that he has presented a fair picture of the man's often disgusting personality ... for my current novel-in-progress I am left with the belief that Nixon did not do all he could have to end the Vietnam War as soon as he could, and is thus responsible for many deaths which should never have happened.a few selected excerpts ...... New research strengthens the suspicion that in 1968, on the eve of the election that brought him to the White House, Nixon manipulated the Vietnam War for selfish political ends. Did he, fearful that impending peace negotiations would swing vital votes to his Democratic opponent, covertly urge Thieu to boycott the talks? ... Anna Chennault, who met secretly with Nixon and acted as a go-between with the South Vietnamese, claims he did. She eventually came to despise Nixon ... During the presidency, much more seriously, there had been times when he had seemed uncoordinated, rendered unstable by fatigue, alcohol, and medication.... Haldeman had an odd nonrelationship with Nixon in human terms. In the thirteen years of their association, the two men dined informally together, with their wives, only once. “He didn’t see me as a person, or even, I believe, as a human being,” Haldeman said years later. “To this day he doesn’t know how many children I have or anything else about my personal life. He never asked. . . .... in 1969, when the North Koreans shot down a U.S. spy plane, “Nixon became incensed and ordered a tactical nuclear strike. . . . The Joint Chiefs were alerted and asked to recommend targets, but Kissinger got on the phone to them. They agreed not to do anything until Nixon sobered up in the morning.”8 As reported earlier, Kissinger has written of Nixon “suppressing his instinct for a jugular response” after North Korea downed the spy plane but without mentioning drink as a factor in the incident. Kissinger’s close associate Lawrence Eagleburger, however, told a friend the following week. “Here’s the president,” he said, visibly upset, “ranting and raving, drunk in the middle of a crisis.” This particular allegation of flirting with nuclear weaponry is not an isolated one. Nixon had been open to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Vietnam as early as 1954 and as president-elect considered striking “a blow that would both end the war and win it.” A Kissinger aide who moved over to the White House, David Young, told a colleague “of the time he was on the phone [listening] when Nixon and Kissinger were talking. Nixon was drunk, and he said, ‘Henry, we’ve got to nuke them.’ ”...more",Notes are private!,2,10,1,"Dec 17, 2023","Dec 18, 2023","Aug 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/97935.The_Arrogance_of_Power

LBJ was an accomplished political bully who had no management experience to prepare him for the Presidency; he was in way over his head and lacked the humility to assemble and listen to the help available to any President who asks.McMaster presents example after example of the chaos and misdirection caused by the confluence of these two outsized egotistical types.

Zhou was nominally in overall charge of the government during Mao Zedooutstanding biography ... well researched ... well writtena few excerpts ...... Zhou was nominally in overall charge of the government during Mao Zedong’s entire tenure as chairman of the CCP, including the disastrous political experiments of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. While many lost their posts, and in some cases their liberty and even their lives, Zhou remained. He appeared personally loyal to Mao, although his political approach was closer to that of Mao’s opponents.... Zhou had to make a choice: enroll as a loyal acolyte of Mao, whose leadership was attracting a ‘cult of the personality’ or be a rival and a potential threat. ... Zhou told Fujian delegates that the party’s style of work had become sullied with exaggeration and lies. Rectifying this had to begin with the leadership insisting on truth.... During the Great Leap and particularly the Cultural Revolution, Zhou was in an impossible position. To survive, he said and did things he would have preferred not to. By surviving, he ensured a degree of damage limitation and protected many friends and colleagues. Despite his undoubted prestige and influence, he was never able to lead an effective resistance to Mao and the Cultural Revolution. ... Zhou’s influence depended on his relationship with Mao, who remained the final authority. Notwithstanding fundamental disagreements, Zhou remained loyal to Mao, both as party leader and personally; this created emotional conflicts that were never resolved. ... Zhou tried to manage Mao and sought to confine the battles of the Cultural Revolution to cultural matters and keep them within the central leadership. He failed, and the country was plunged into chaos.

Richard Nixon was another problem altogether. Helms knew how deep his resentments ran. Nixon thought the agency was filled with eastern elitists, knee-jerk liberals, Georgetown gossips, Kennedy men. It was an open secret that Nixon held the CIA responsible for the greatest disaster in his life: his defeat in the 1960 election.... Nixon & Kissinger had reached an understanding: they alone would conceive, command, and control clandestine operations. Covert action and espionage could be tools fitted for their personal use. Nixon used them to build a political fortress at the White House, and Kissinger became, in the words of his aide Roger Morris, the acting chief of state for national security.... When Kissinger finally sat down with Chou, the prime minister asked about the latest Free Taiwan campaign: “The CIA had no hand in it?” Kissinger assured Chou that “he vastly overestimates the competence of the CIA.” ... Chou was fascinated to learn that Kissinger personally approved the CIA’s covert operations. He voiced his suspicions that the agency was still subverting the People’s Republic. Kissinger replied that most CIA officers “write long, incomprehensible reports and don’t make revolution.” “You use the word revolution,” Chou said. “We say subversion.” “Or subversion,” Kissinger conceded. “I understand. We are conscious of what is at stake in our relationship, and we will not let one organization carry out petty operations that could hinder this course.” That was the end of that.

Kissinger returned to China in November (now as secretary of state), bringing a terminal blow to Mao’s ambitions.

I think we’re on our way there. There may be some setbacks. But we are going to get there.... The story of the civil rights movement is often rendered as a struggle between nonviolence and violence, between the demand for “Freedom Now” and the cry for “Black Power.” John Lewis and Martin Luther King preached and practiced nonviolence ... No one in Lewis’s column expected to make it to Montgomery. In the face of Wallace’s order, however, they felt they had no choice but to proceed. ... about 625 people ... silently walked from Sylvan Street to Alabama Avenue to the Pettus Bridge, named for a Confederate general who had served as a grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan. ... “This is an unlawful assembly,” Major John Cloud announced as the marchers reached the bottom of the bridge, face-to-face with the lawmen. It was 2:52 P.M. “Your march is not conducive to the public safety. You are ordered to disperse and go back to your church or to your homes.” ... John Lewis’s life reached a kind of crescendo. He was still so young—he had turned twenty-five two weeks before—and yet there on that strip of road he was like a martyr or a prophet of old. ... “We couldn’t go forward,” he recalled. “We couldn’t go back. There was only one option left that I could see.” ... “We should kneel and pray,” Lewis said to a nodding Williams. They wouldn’t have time. A moment had passed since Cloud had issued his final warning. “You saw these men putting on their gas masks,” Lewis said. Now he heard Cloud’s voice pierce the air. “Troopers,” the major cried, “advance!” Within seconds—to Lewis it seemed instantaneous—the wave of blue struck. He remembered the enormity, the totality, of the reaction of his attackers. “The troopers and possemen swept forward as one, like a human wave, a blur of blue shirts and billy clubs and bullwhips,” Lewis recalled. “We had no chance to turn and retreat.” The pain was to be endured. ... Charles Mauldin, a seventeen-year-old who was in the third row of the column, heard the blow. “I’ll never forget the sound of the billy club hitting John’s head,” Mauldin recalled. “It made this sickening, harsh thwack.” ... Lewis struggled back to consciousness. “I was bleeding badly,” he recalled. “My head was now exploding with pain. That brief, sweet sense of just wanting to lie there was gone. I needed to get up. I’d faded out for I don’t know how long, but now I was tuned back in.” The journey back to Brown Chapel was a blur ... At an impromptu mass meeting in the sanctuary, Lewis, bloodied and dirty, with a fractured skull and what one SNCC worker described as a “small hole in his head,” told the frightened congregation, “I don’t understand how President Johnson can send troops to Vietnam and cannot send troops to Selma, Alabama, to protect the citizens who want to register to vote in America.” He was seeing double as he spoke; the pain was enveloping. ... Strapped in the chair, Lewis was allowed through the police cordon, was loaded into the bread truck, and was taken to Good Samaritan, a few blocks away. ... Dr. Isabel Dumont diagnosed Lewis with a severe concussion and a fractured skull. He was attended to, given painkillers, and put to bed in the hospital.

It is one of the few books I have read that I will want to read again. Its pages offer many lessons to any writer, or at least to me.Embedded in the story are important feelings about Jews, Blacks and Nazis, and those whose privileged lives allow them to ignore injustice, or at best mention it in passing to show what good people they are. Blake ignores nothing, never lets a character off the hook.Now, it's not perfect. The family tree could be expanded to include all the important characters, related or not. It would be helpful to set time frames more often to make it easier for the reader to follow the story. NOTE: these features are far more important if you read the book on kindle.Some readers say it's too long, but I don't agree. Perhaps my recent novel that turn into a Holocaust Trilogy renders me ineligible to comment on a book's length, but I believe the book should be as long as it takes for the author to say what needs to be said.

Pham Xuan An’s mission as a spy was to provide strategic intelligence reports about U.S. war plans and send them into “the jungle,” as he referred to the chain of command ... his cover was as a highly respected Time magazine reporter ... The Communist Party recruited An and turned him into espionage agent X6 ... The party instructed An to choose a career in journalism as the best cover, raised the money to send him to the United States, and developed a carefully scripted artificial life history to support his cover.... An established perhaps the best and most informed list of sources in Saigon and consequently provided Hanoi what it needed most: an understanding of American tactics and battle plans.... The Nixon administration had always feared that if Cambodia became a Vietnamese Communist base, Vietnamization would be impossible. On April 30, 1970, Richard Nixon announced that six thousand ARVN (the Army of the Republic of Vietnam) troops, supported by U.S. advisers, artillery, and fighter bombers, had invaded the Parrot’s Beak, a dense jungle area in southeast Cambodia, extending into South Vietnam and rumored to be the location of COSVN, the Communist Party’s Central Office for South Vietnam, in an effort to neutralize North Vietnamese use of Cambodian territory. The president, who a year earlier had promised to end American involvement in Vietnam, had expanded the war into neighboring Cambodia.... “My profession has two taboos,” An told his Vietnamese biographer. “If you’re captured, and you cannot escape you must consider yourself to be dead. The thing that must be protected is not your body. You have to consider that you are already dead, but you cannot disclose your sources. ... Henry Kissinger had negotiated an agreement representing nothing more than a protocol for American disengagement. It was apparent to many that Kissinger acted like he had a “death wish for South Vietnam.”... An is venerated and beloved in Vietnam for his contribution to the Vietnamese people’s victory. When he died on September 20, 2006, his coffin lay in state for two days of public tribute before a funeral with full military honors. He is buried beside Ba Quoc and other espionage agents in a special area of the Ho Chi Minh City national cemetery....more",Notes are private!,0,19,2,"Oct 05, 2022Mar 23, 2024","Oct 14, 2022not set","Aug 16, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/210091.Perfect_Spy

During one of Zhou’s many meetings with the Red Guards in September 1966, someone suddenly shouted out, “Down With Liu Shaoqi!” Others took up the cry. Zhou turned his back to the audience as a clear indication of his disapproval without making a single comment that would allow someone to record “heretical words.” He refused to rejoin the discussion until all the shouting had ceased. Then, invoking Party history that few in the room probably understood, Zhou noted that comrades who had committed mistakes in the Party line were still genuine revolutionaries and certainly could never be branded as counterrevolutionaries.... Zhou was going to have to make a choice between his conscience and his political survival. ... he finally decided to make the big break with Liu and endorse the so-called criminal materials compiled by Jiang Qing and her relentless gang. “Enlai signed off on the documents used to expel Liu Shaoqi from the Party,” Zhou’s widow confided to the author Han Suyin nine years after her husband’s death. “Can we just simply apologize for this? The whole affair caused Enlai so much pain. But he had no choice,” she told Han Suyin. “He did it for the benefit of the whole picture.” ... Zhou was more than aware that Mao had made his premier’s attitude toward the Liu case another test of his loyalty.

The borders were not based on any ethnicity, geographic points or religious boundaries – they were ﻿truly arbitrary. ... Britain once again drew some lines in the desert, which would become the border for a new country, which was to be called Iraq. The Iraq Britain created had never existed in history and was as artificial as its brother next door, Jordon. ... Britain paved the way for Jewish migration to the region and eventually created a state for the Jews called Israel. The indigenous people of Palestine had no say over the land they had resided on for hundreds of years ... ﻿Following its founding war of 1947-49, Israel came into existence but chose not to define its borders and today it remains with undeclared borders. But it took 78% of Palestine, a percentage it has steadily increased in subsequent years, which has seen the expulsion of the indigenous population.... Through agents such as Nasser, the US CIA was successfully challenging and undermining Britain’s position in the region. At the same time, the US was duping the Muslims and Arabs into thinking that its puppet and Arab nationalism was their savior.

As you might imagine, there are constant references to Hitler, with whom Albert Speer worked closely, first as Hitler's chief architect and then as Minister of Armaments.Here are some of the ways Speer described Hitler. Does anything look familiar? How many of these destructive traits are part to the persona of Donald Trump?•	Speer was taken by Hitler's aura of strangeness and unpredictability … he had no doubts about right and wrong, or good and evil•	Hitler was devoid of human contact despite the mass rallies•	when Hitler was prevented from making public appearances, he deteriorated•	Hitler's constant irritability was seen as a tactical device for whipping up the masses and possibly also as a means of self-persuasion•	Hitler did not work hard ... whiled away the time ... read Karl May ... not interested in the bureaucracy or the workings of the government ... spent less than 1-2 hours per day on ""routine duties"" of governing•	Hitler forbade publication of the costs of his grand building projects•	Hitler would spend weeks on end on the Obersalzberg ... surrounded by acolytes ... doing no work•	immediately after the invasion of Poland, Speer offered to assemble a technical squad for the construction and repair of bridges, roads, runways ... Hitler declined the offer ... saying no one was permitted to put aside work he was assigned to choose new tasks at his own discretion•	Hitler knew he should avoid war on two fronts ... but could not wait to invade Russia ... he convinced himself that by ""a stroke of magic, he could solve all strategic embarrassments"" ... Operation Barbarossa began on June 22 1941•	Speer's predecessor as Reich Minister for Armaments ... Fritz Todt ... saw by late 1941 that Germany was hopelessly overextended ... urged Hitler to find a political solution to a war that was lost in military terms ... Hitler refused to listen ... and two weeks later declared war on the U.S.•	to some Germans it seemed as if Germany was waging a world war without a government ... not an accident ... purposeful chaos surrounding the dissolution of the state apparatus ... the only law was Hitler's will ... Hitler never involved himself in government ... never held cabinet meetings ... gave conflicting orders on sudden impulse ... refused to speak with officials who had lost his favor•	Hitler remained deaf to those who told him the Allies had achieved total air superiority ... that the war was lost ... the more hopeless the situation, the more stubborn he became ... finally forbidding mention of the subject•	when faced with a memorandum about the large strategic reserves held by the Soviets ... Hitler was outraged for weeks ... and then forbade the Wehrmacht High Command to prepare such analyses...more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Jun 22, 2020","Jul 05, 2020","Jun 22, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/355450.Speer

Berthold, looking for something to engage his mind in the dank emptiness of prison, initiates a conversation with Speer ... and then I have written this ...""Alone in my cell, many disjointed questions ran through my head about the unique resource to understanding I had begun to develop: What was the best way to keep Speer engaging in serious conversation with me? How could I get him to tell me more about why he and so many others had gone along with Hitler? Could either of us have done more to resist Hitler? Would conversations with Speer lead me to rethink my own guilt?It occurred to me that it would be important, if these conversations were to continue, to make sure the assessing of blame did not get in the way of understanding. That would be a tight line to walk, but critical if I was to take advantage of my unique and extended access to one of the more intelligent of the Nazi leaders. Was he also observant? What had he seen? I had twenty years to find out?""Speer's Spandau diary not only reveals his thinking (or his lies about his thinking?) but does so in chronological sequence, which is perfect for my evolving historical novel, as yet untitled, which will follow Berthold and Anna's post-Nuremberg lives....more",Notes are private!,0,12,0,not set,not set,"May 17, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1793291.Spandau

The two related story lines (1600's and modern day) are each fascinating and well conceived. The characters in each are always in a state of tense challenge, as they think through the problems they face. The reader is continually challenged as well, with philosophical and religious ideas that don't often grace the pages of fiction, including Spinoza's view of God and Nature. But all of those good things take second place to the writing itself. When Kadish is in her rhythm, she produces a sequence of glorious sentences, each one superbly crafted and the cumulative impact breathtaking. This is not a fast read, but rather one to be savored.The problem is that not every scene or every character contributes to the positives listed above. IMO, there are substantial scenes and several characters which could be eliminated and never missed. These always involve the extra characters, perhaps included to create some background or context which I could very well do without.

Every phrUPDATE 8/1/20 ...The first time I heard Elie Wiesel it seemed to me that his words, although obviously spoken in prose, resonated as poetry. Every phrase was a thing of beauty as well as content. I subsequently had the privilege of meeting him on several short occasions, and the honor of having him read and comment on my first novel THE HERETIC.Now I have read the chapter in MESSENGERS OF GOD intriguingly titled ""Moses: Portrait of a Leader."" It is eye-opening, because as I read what Wiesel wrote after the Holocaust, of which he was a survivor but his father was not, I frequently had the feeling he was struggling with both God's performance and that of Moses and the Jewish people. ... Wiesel writes: when Moses offered to take them out of Egypt, the slaves wanted to remain slaves ... while Moses was negotiating with Pharoah, Aaron was trying to convince the Jews to accept freedom... Wiesel writes: as the Red Sea parted to let the Jews go through, Moses began to sing ... the most majestic, the most lyrical poem in Scripture ... Exodus ﻿15:1... Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spoke, saying: I will sing unto the LORD, for He is highly exalted; The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea. 15:2The LORD is my strength and song, And He is become my salvation; This is my God, and I will glorify Him; My father’s God, and I will exalt Him. 15:3The LORD is a man of war, The LORD is His name.Wiesel never openly expresses his anger at Jews for not resisting Hitler, and at God for not destroying the Nazis as he destroyed the Egyptians, but to me that unspoken anger rides just below the surface of his written words.***Elie Wiesel's comments on Job (the last chapter in this book) have particular relevance to all of us, including the characters in my soon-to-be-completed novel CAUGHT IN A FLOOD OF EVIL, 1934-1946 ... the sequel to A FLOOD OF EVIL ...... What is the meaning of punishment inflicted on a just man … what is God doing? … where is his justice? Job knew, as we know, that he had committed no sin … he had nothing to reproach himself for, neither did God... Job turned against God … to find and confront Him … he defied him to come closer to him … he wanted to hear his voice, even though he knew he would be condemned … he preferred a cruel and unjust God two an indifferent God... Job's resignation was an insult to Man … he should not have given in so easily … he should have continued to protest, to refuse the handouts … he should have said to God: ""very well, I forgive you, to the extent of my sorrow and my anguish ... But what about my dead children? Do they forgive you? What right have I to speak on their behalf? ... By accepting your inequities, do I not become your accomplice? ...

Wiesel took on this theme again in ""The Trial of God"" (published 1979), but this time he seemed far more tentative and uncertain, setting the book, which is actually a play, in 1649, and offering both a confusing prosecution and a confusing defense of God from a character who turns out to be Satan. And he has a great deal of difficulty getting to the actual trial, spending 125 pages of a 160 page play in preliminary off-the-main-point conversations between the characters before the trial begins. It almost seems as if Wiesel had frightened himself by his earlier condemnations of God and is now far less certain of his case. Given the audacity of his theme, that reluctance to brace the issue is surely understandable, and it leaves the reader where any reader knows he will be, furious with God and uncertain as to what to do about those feelings. The important questions are all unresolved, as they must be. Did God know what was happening at Auschwitz and let it happen? Did God not know, and if so, why not? Is there actually a God who even cares about human affairs? I personally respond better to the Wiesel who condemned the Biblical Job for forgiving the God who had capriciously destroyed him than I do to the Wiesel who allows the trial of God to end without a verdict, but it is the latter Wiesel who may more accurately portray where we humans must ultimately be in relation to the unknowable....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Dec 24, 2019","Jan 06, 2020","Oct 27, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11161.The_Trial_of_God

They are then crowded into the gas chamber in such numbers there is, of course, only standing room. To compress this crowd into the narrow space, shots are often fired to induce those already at the far end to huddle still closer together. When everybody is inside, the heavy doors are closed. Then there is a short pause, presumably to allow the room temperature to rise to a certain level, after which SS men with gas masks climb on the roof, open the traps, and shake down a preparation in powder form out of tin cans labeled “CYCLONE” “For use against vermin,” which is manufactured ﻿by a Hamburg concern. It is presumed that this is a “cyanide” mixture of some sort which turns into gas at a certain temperature. After three minutes everyone in the chamber is dead....

The worst of these cases was Poland, which made enormous contributions (solving Enigma, pilots staving off Hitler's attack on London, intelligence vital to D-Day, and delaying the V1/V2 rockets) and was then given to Stalin. I have always revered Churchill, but Olson puts that in jeopardy. Here are some excerpts ...... only days before Germany invaded Poland, the Poles sent replicas of Enigma to Britain and France, along with detailed information on how to use it.... Having lost nearly a hundred pilots in the previous week, the RAF finally gave in and ordered the squadron into battle the next day. ﻿303 Squadron finally got its orders to fly. Shortly after taking off, the Poles hurtled down on the surprised enemy like avenging furies. In less ﻿than fifteen minutes, six of them had each shot down a Messerschmitt in the skies over south London. While the squadron would go on to compile a brilliant overall record in the Battle of Britain, it is doubtful that its contribution was ever more urgently needed than on its first day of combat. For it was on August 31 that Fighter Command suffered its heaviest losses of the entire battle—thirty-nine fighters shot down and fourteen pilots killed. The Germans, however, lost an identical number, with 303’s pilots credited with 15 percent of those kills... it was the Poles who provided the lion’s share of British intelligence during the war ... As D-Day approached ... Everywhere on the country’s coasts, it seemed, intelligence agents from occupied Europe were penetrating top secret enemy bases and stealing fortification blueprints and other material that the Allied planners of D-Day had asked them to gather. ... ﻿“practically all the Allied war plans for the invasion of Europe are based on information about the conquered territory supplied by underground intelligence systems. ... ﻿most of it came from French and Polish operatives.... Poland … like ﻿the rest of eastern Europe, was treated by Roosevelt and Churchill “as something secondary, not as a vital interest of their own.”... as much as he valued the Poles’ help, Churchill was unable to see the Soviet-Polish conflict through Polish eyes. The Soviets were now Britain’s valued allies, and he was determined to make Poland acknowledge them as such.... To Churchill, it was clear that the Russian leader’s acquisition of Polish territory would involve “the forcible transfer of large populations against their will into the Communist sphere.” By agreeing to this, he acknowledged in 1942, Britain would turn its back on fundamental principles of freedom that were the supposed bedrock of the Allied cause. In private, he agonized over the decision. He was genuinely concerned about Poland’s fate but would take no action on its behalf. ... ﻿the British were not prepared to risk their alliance with the Soviet Union for the sake of the Poles.... The Soviets’ treatment of the Poles under their control was nearly as brutal as Germany’s: ﻿During the twenty-one months that the Soviets dominated eastern Poland, an estimated 1.5 million Polish citizens were taken from their homes and deported in freight trains to Siberia and other Soviet regions. Thousands froze to death along the way or died of starvation and disease. Those who survived ended up in slave labor camps or were dumped onto collective farms.

Her remarkable father instilled a sense of persistence and an uncanny ability to stay ahead of the forces threatening to engulf his family. Tanya follows his lead without hesitation, and later, when she’s on her own, shows she has learned the lessons he taught. This is true even when a decision proves to be wrong, such as returning to Poland after the war, when it was critical to assess quickly and make a new plan. This book is an excellent example of what John Gardner called profluence (a word I think he may have made up), by which he meant flowing smoothly and copiously. Every page of Tanya’s journey is linked and related and flows smoothly. There are no enormous climaxes, but none are needed since the very survival of Tanya and her family, at a time when so many others did not keep going and perished, provides the emotional underpinning that makes each page special....more",Notes are private!,0,14,2,"Aug 25, 2023Mar 08, 2019","Aug 25, 2023Mar 24, 2019","Mar 08, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43547562-of-bitter-herbs-and-sweet-confections

It focuses on the causes and results of serious problems which had not been solved in 1991, with little optimism that ghetto problems would ever be solved except by the upward movement of people who found a way out. The details of the individuals whose histories are presented are illuminating but difficult to follow and absorb - too much detail not put into clear narrative or context. The political machinations in Washington and Chicago (President Johnson & Mayor Daley) are fascinating and easier to follow, perhaps because I was aware of many of the events covered at the time they were happening.Part of my problem in reading this book now is that it was written 28 years ago and while it has interest as history, its value as social and political commentary is seriously dated.

Deep in the woods near Auschwitz, my character Anna Gorska is about to meet Witold Pilecki, who has just escaped. I don't know what I'm going to write, but if I can capture anything close to the excitement I'm feeling about this encounter, I think it'll be worth reading.***This is an incredible story ... all the more so since it is true ... Witold Pilecki purposely joined a roundup in Warsaw in order to get inside Auschwitz. His objectives were to send out information about the camp and to prepare to take over the camp when the time came in the form of an order to parachute in arms or troops. He accomplished the first objective, but of course the Allies never attacked Auschwitz. Pilecki remained in Auschwitz from 1940 until April 1943 when he escaped.a few excerpts ...... In November 1940, I sent my first report to High Command in Warsaw through Second Lieutenant 6 [Tadeusz Burski] who had worked in Intelligence and who had been bought out of Auschwitz.... I discovered a way to send letters to my family writing in Polish. A young friend of mine [name unknown], going to work in the town, had managed to make contact with the locals through whom I sent two letters to my family. My letters were sent on to [Home Army] High Command.... A number of escape attempts led the camp authorities to decide to apply collective responsibility and (starting in the spring of ’41) ten inmates were shot for each successful escapee. The selection of ten men to die for one escapee was a difficult moment for the camp. ... “I have been inside for two years and seven months. I have had a job to do here. Lately I have had no instructions. Now the Germans have shipped out our best people with whom I’ve been working. I would have to start from scratch. I can see no further point in staying here. Therefore, I’m going to leave.” ... can one pick and choose when one wants to come to Auschwitz and when one wants to leave?” I replied: “One can.”... (April 1943) ... Over the course of a night we were meant to finish five batches. We were to put the bread in the ovens five times and then take it out five times. … We were going to try to escape from the bakery after the second batch, for after the first one it would be too soon. Meanwhile the first, second, third and fourth batches came and went, and we still could not leave the bakery. ... the cards would have to fall so that at one given moment we would be near the door and out of the line of vision of both the SS men and the other bakers. ...

(NOTE: see also my  of Phillip Hallie's ""Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed: The Story of the Village of Le Chambon and How Goodness Happened There."")EXCERPTS ... On Saturday 26 August, 1942, some 50 to 60 police and gendarmes wound their way up the steep roads in police trucks and on motorcycles and stopped in front of the Mairie in le Chambon. Trocmé and the mayor were summoned and ordered to hand over the names of all Jews resident in the area.‘I am their pastor,’ Trocmé is reported as saying. ‘That is to say their shepherd.’ He said he had no idea whether there were any Jews among his parishioners, and had he known, he would not tell them. The policeman in charge informed him that he had just 24 hours in which to come up with the names, and that if he failed to obey, he personally would be arrested. As darkness fell, the children were collected by boy scouts and moved to more remote farmhouses, where they were hidden in attics or behind wood piles, only emerging after nightfall while the police remained on the plateau. When no list of Jews was forthcoming, the police, who had brought a list of their own with 72 names on it, began to search the village. They checked documents, opened cupboards, combed through cellars and attics, banged on walls to see if they contained false panels. They found no one. Next morning at dawn, they set out to explore the surrounding villages and the countryside ... Day after day, for three weeks, the villagers listened to the police firing up their cars and motorcycles in the early morning before leaving to scour the countryside for hidden Jews. They found no one. With the police finally gone, calm of a kind returned to the plateau. The Jewish children left the forests and the isolated farm buildings and came back to their homes and pensions; the pastors resumed their parish visits and Bible classes; the farmers once again took up the slow rhythm of their agricultural lives....more",Notes are private!,0,15,2,"May 15, 2019not set","May 25, 2019not set","Nov 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20663052-village-of-secrets

In March 1942, the Germans, with the close support of the French police, began putting Jews on to trains and shipping them from Bobigny and Drancy to an ""unknown destination"" in Germany or Poland … primarily to Auschwitz... the Grand Rafle (July 1942) … over two days and in dozens of Parisian neighborhoods, 13,000 Jews were taken from their homes, from the hiding places, from hospitals, from schools, retirement homes and even asylums … this included more then 4,000 children aged 2-14, abducted from classrooms and nurseries ... Some children who were not taken returned home to find their parents gone and their apartments sealed... There is no way Germans could have succeeded as well as they did in rounding up Jews if it had not been for the help of local police forces … the Nazis did not have enough personnel to track and keep files on Jews or plan and carry out raids and arrests ... nor did they know the labyrinth of the streets of Paris ... About 4500 French policemen organized and participated in the operation ... The Germans were nowhere to be seen ...

The failure of the Allies to do anything to save Jews who they knew were being murdered is well documented ... so is the similar failure of Jewish organizations in America, who also knew the facts, but offered no call to action.The successes and failures outlined in Bauer's book will inform the final sections of my sequel to A FLOOD OF EVIL, as Berthold Becker and Anna Gorska struggle at enormous risk to try to accomplish something of value in the face of the overwhelming German atrocity ... A Flood of Evil... The first deportation from France to Poland took place on March 27, 1942, and the last in July, 1944. The figures for deportations from the main Nazi deportation center at Drancy in 1942, 1943, and 1944 were 41,792, 21,856, and 14,263 respectively, or 77,911 altogether. When one adds the numbers deported from places other than Drancy, the total is probably somewhere between 86,000 and 90,000. Thousands more were murdered by the Germans in France. Nevertheless, the fact is that about two-thirds of the Jews in France either fled or survived in the country.... When the first tens of thousands of non-French Jews were rounded up in Paris in giant hunts, many thousands of small and very small children remained behind in apartments and on the streets. Before they could be tended by kind neighbors, 4,000 of them were collected and put into the sports stadium of the Velodrome d’Hiver. Children from the age of three up were torn away from their mothers, thrown on trucks. . . . Through the main thoroughfares of the city one could hear the screaming and the crying of the children and the long reverberating despairing cry: mummy, mummy . . . several days after the deportation of the adults, the four thousand children were loaded into cattle cars. Sixty children of all ages were thrown into each wagon. One pail with water was the whole furniture. No bench, no straw, no provisions were put at their disposal, and the children were sent away without any supervision. Then the doors and openings were hermetically sealed and after many more hours the trains slowly moved away. . . . A nurse, who alone among the many French officials present protested against this procedure and against the conditions in this transport, was given the following reply by the responsible doctor: “we normally expect about thirty percent loss during the journey.”... Even after the Allies had officially admitted that annihilation of the Jews had begun, there was no forceful, unequivocal response by American Jewry, including JDC. Instead, reactions varied among incredulity, hope that the reports might turn out to be a nightmare from which the Jewish people might one day mercifully awake, utter despair resulting from accurate appreciation of what was happening, desire for immediate action, feelings of helplessness, and even desire to escape responsibility and hide behind words or meaningless action.... Jewish organizations in America were, on the whole, fairly well informed about the failures of the Bermuda Conference. But they did not respond with plans of their own. … demonstration against the government would be perceived as a demonstration against the war. Jews in 1943 simply could not demonstrate against Roosevelt....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2018","May 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1385597.American_Jewry_and_the_Holocaust

Malcolm Hay's book was one of the best sources, not least in my mind because Mr. Hay was a Catholic. His writing is soundly based in history, but the author does not hesitate to provide conclusions and opinions based on that history, his own and that of those he quotes. Now, working on the sequel to my most recent novel A FLOOD OF EVIL, I have read the rest of the book.The fundamental conclusions of Hay's work are as follows ... more than 6 million deliberate Nazi murders of Jews are the consequence of the teachings about Jews for which the Christian Church is ultimately responsible ... Hitler could not have done to the Jewish people what he did if the way had not been prepared for him by the anti-Semitic teaching in our churches and schoolsThe story of the Catholic Church's hatred begins with the 4th century writings of St. John Chrysostom. Hay asserts the violence of the language used by St John Chrysostom in his homilies against the Jews has never been exceeded: the synagogue is worse than a brothel … a temple of demons … a place of meeting for the assassins of Christ … it is unfit for Christians to associate with a people who have fallen into a condition lower than the vilest animals ... They are lustful, rapacious, greedy, perfidious ... The Jews have assassinated the son of God ... The Jews were guilty, they have been punished by God, and the punishment would endure for all time In the 20th century, the message was less inflammatory but equally effective. Hay quotes the influential English writer Hilaire Belloc, taking two irreconcilable anti-Jewish positions and never acknowledging the conflict ... Belloc was convinced that ""the Jews"" controlled all the machinery of modern capitalism, the big banks, and most of the industrial and commercial enterprises in Europe and America ... Belloc also believe that ""the Jews"" had inspired and organize the Russian Revolution and thereby inspired to destroy the source of power - capitalism - which they were supposed to control … he described Das Kapital as a Jewish book written in German. These positions underlay Hitler's justification for murdering all the Jews he could get his hands on.Finally, Hay condemns the Allies refusal to do anything to stop Hitler's mass murder of Jews ... Western governments who knew the facts about German liquidation of the Jews felt that it would be ""inconvenient"" if the Germans should offer to drop a million Jews on us ... and so they did nothing. It took until 1965 for the Catholic Church (Vatican II) to reverse its centuries-old doctrine and finally state that it was incorrect to blame all Jews for all time for the murder of Christ. Even then, after 6,000,000 Jews had been murdered largely because of that doctrine, many in the Church objected to the change....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Apr 17, 2018","Apr 18, 2018","Apr 17, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/913480.Europe_and_the_Jews

Jan Karski was a member of the Polish underground during the Nazi occupation of Poland. He performed several life-threatening missions as a courier, but that was just a warm-up. Designated to go to London to deliver information to the Polish government in exile, Karski was approached by Jewish leaders from Warsaw's ghetto, from which Jews thousands of Jews per day were already being exported to their deaths. They told him what was happening, but insisted it was so horrible nobody would believe it. Karski went twice into the ghetto and once to a deportation collection center to see for himself. Then he set off to London, on a route that had been planned by the Polish underground. Somehow he made it and delivered his report in late 1942, when millions of Jews were still alive. The report was made public, after which not a single world leader did anything.

Brzezinski'I have read through the events of 1941, and will return later as I do more research for the sequel to my historical novel A FLOOD OF EVIL. Brzezinski's material is detailed and evocative; you can feel the walls of the Warsaw Ghetto enclosing around you. You can consider if you would have decided it is better to die while resisting than to go passively. A few excerpts ...... the plume of smoke rising menacingly to the west of the city, from the airport, where German bombs were said to have fallen at dawn.... Shortly after noon on September 8, four Panzer armored divisions stormed Warsaw’s westernmost outer suburbs. By 3 P.M. they had seized the airport … At 5 P.M. the surging columns of tanks reached the inner districts of Ochota and Wola, where a thin line of defenders cowered behind the trenches that Isaac Zuckerman had helped dig. “Wolska Street is covered with blood,” one combatant said, describing the scene. “There are dead horses, burnt hulks, and pulverized corpses crushed by tank treads. An uninterrupted wall of fire precedes the Germans; a hurricane of bullets. The sound is deafening. They are massacring civilians, mowing down running refugees, indiscriminately clearing a path straight toward our barricade.... On September 10, 1939, the German High Command changed tactics. They were going to bomb the city into submission. On Sunday, September 10, three divisions of heavy Junker bombers, totaling several hundred aircraft, flew seventeen sorties over the city, unleashing “a rain of bombs.” ... planes swooped so low over the Royal Gardens that soldiers next to me were shooting at the cockpits with their rifles.”... the family buried their dead temporarily in the small flower garden Simha had tended outside their now smoldering home. Nearly twenty thousand similar graves dotted Warsaw—black, rectangular earth mounds, marked by sticks, primitive wooden crosses, or little pyramids of rock and red brick. ... “I caught sight of a hand separated from a body, and was told it was my brother’s hand. It was buried next to his grave.”... As the deadline for all Jews to relocate into the Ghetto approached, the city of Warsaw plunged into chaos. A fifth of the capital’s population—113,000 Gentiles and 138,000 Jews—had been served with eviction notices and sent packing. The massive dislocation clogged streets and back alleys and created impassable traffic jams along all the main arteries ... Every rickshaw, taxi, truck, and horse-drawn cart in the city had been hired for the mandatory move, and peasants from distant farms drove their wagons to Warsaw, lured by the exorbitant prices they could charge to transport household goods. Their fees rose daily, then hourly, as the October 31 deadline loomed....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Dec 30, 2018","Feb 05, 2019","Feb 22, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35395339-isaac-s-army

Stefan Korbonski was there and played a major role in the PolisThis is an outstanding record of what took place in Warsaw during the Nazi occupation. Stefan Korbonski was there and played a major role in the Polish resistance. Korbonski has an ax to grind, as he states in the first sentence of the Preface ... ""The charges leveled by the Jews against the Poles for allegedly sharing responsibility for the Holocaust by not preventing the slaughter of Jews are groundless, unfair, and slanderous. An individual or a nation can be blamed for denying help which could be given, but not for failing to do the impossible.""In my opinion, Korbonski proves his contention, citing fact after fact throughout his book. For example ...... the Jewish population (within the ghetto) was doomed to a slow death by starvation, exhaustion, and illness … or murder by the Gestapo … for illegal purchase of food, using public transportation, not wearing the armband, or for no reason at all ... or transport to the ovens of the Nazi murder camps... it is estimated that 18,000 Jews were hiding in Warsaw - outside the ghetto … 100,000 Poles were sheltering them … 2,000 Yad Vashem medals have been awarded to Poles for helping Jews (including one to Korbonski)... Council of Assistance to the Jews - ZEGOTA … established on Dec 4 1942 … headed by Julian Grobelny … headquarters in Warsaw … assisted Jews in hiding outside the ghettos with living quarters, documents, food, medical care, financial help, facilitating communication ... in Warsaw, helped 4,000 Jews ... the (Polish) Directorate of Civil Resistance issued a proclamation … citing the ""monstrous planned slaughter of the Jews"" … ""being mercilessly murdered, poisoned by gas, buried alive, thrown out of windows"" …""for no other reason but that they are Jewish"" … ""we are unable to counteract these crimes"" ... ""We protest in the name of the entire Polish nation against the atrocities perpetrated on the Jews"" ... This proclamation was published by the entire underground press and transmitted to London, where it was repeated by the BBC, SWIT, and other allied radio stations... Polish underground leaders also requested regular bombing missions to destroy all railroad lines leading to the extermination camps to prevent further transports from the ghettos … Feiner and Berman made similar demands in their dispatches to London ... the bombing of railway lines to the extermination camps was not undertaken … supposedly because of the technical impossibility of long distance flights … however the British bomber command (Sir Arthur Harris) consider the bombing of Auschwitz to be technically feasible if carried out from bases in Italy... On the first day of uprising in the Warsaw ghetto … three Home Army units, commanded by Captain Josef Pszenny, attempted to blow up the ghetto wall on Bonifraterska Street … however they were detected and their attack failed... Towards the end of the ghetto uprising, there began an organized evacuation of Jewish fighters … they escaped through tunnels dug from cellar to cellar and through the City sewers … Poles were waiting for them on the other side with trucks … transported the Jews to the woods near Warsaw ... escapes took place on April 29 and May 10These descriptions, and many others, will provide suggestions for scenes involving my fictional character Anna Gorska, who will be in Warsaw during much of this period, as I write the final sections of the sequel to my novel A FLOOD OF EVIL ... https://www.amazon.com/Flood-Evil-Lew......more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 16, 2018","Feb 28, 2018","Feb 16, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2204341.The_Jews_and_the_Poles_in_World_War_II

For example ...... the (British) Air Ministry’s assumptions as to how the German Air Force would be used were so much modelled on the Air Staff’s own plans for the RAF that it not only neglected the available intelligence but also omitted to subject its acceptance of the prevailing opinion to technical study.... the German bombers were ‘ not equipped for weight carrying ’ and were ‘ too small ’ to deliver on the United Kingdom the vast tonnages postulated. 85 From what was known of German aircraft it should have been possible to deduce that the long-range bomber force would have had to sacrifice much of its bomb load if it was to carry enough fuel for the flight from north-west Germany and back with or without over-flying the Low Countries. Again, the task of manufacturing, moving and storing the required number of bombs would have been truly vast, yet its feasibility was neither examined nor questioned.... on 10 July. It became obvious by that day, after a month of scattered night raids, that the GAF had embarked on a programme of concentrated daylight attacks on ports, coastal convoys and aircraft factories with the object of wearing down the RAF’s fighter defences in the south-east. By mid-August it had failed in this object but could no longer defer the decision to increase the scale of its attack and seek the direct destruction of the RAF on and over its airfields. Unless this was achieved without delay, the landings in England could not take place, as planned, early in September.A Flood of Evil...more",Notes are private!,0,9,0,not set,not set,"Jan 08, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29754390-british-intelligence-in-the-second-world-war-volume-i

There is a murder, a rather bizarre murder, and it was clear to me early on who did it. But the why of it, which was dribbled out in tantalizing bits, kept me glued. Plus the introduction of several new characters, all of them interesting, added to the complexity and the suspense. This is definitely a family I was happy to read about but which I would never want to actually know.The detectives were well portrayed, both in their deductive reasoning and in their emotions. Since this is the first of a series featuring DCI Tom Douglas, this bodes well for the subsequent books.Where the book could have been better was in the use of old never-sent letters as a way of telling past events. It would have been far better to show these events, which were engaging, as flashbacks where the characters actually appeared. This was particularly true with the early letters of which there were too many and several were much too long. By the time the later letters appeared, I was hooked enough on the story that I no longer felt cheated out of the action....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"Oct 13, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16244754-only-the-innocent

It was as though inexorable forces were rising up in both of them, essentially of them, and yet outside their control, two dark antagonisms waiting sorrowfully to join issue.... The past stood at their elbow like an importunate and shabby ghost.... For the first time he became aware of something definitely abnormal in himself, as though a dead skin had been stripped off his senses and he had begun to see and hear with a primitive and stupefying clearness....

The central story concerning Washington's response to a potential mutiny (against Congress, not him) in 1783 (after Yorktown) was interesting but not well portrayed and in the end not at all dramatic. Many other scenes, going back in time to cover major points in Washington's history, were brilliant and moving, although some seemed overlong. Overall, it was well worth reading.The relevance of this book, and Washington, to the fiasco of Donald Trump unraveling our government cannot be ignored. Washington was everything we needed, then and now. Trump is a disaster, and a real test of whether the Constitutional government largely invented and initially managed by Washington can survive.

The cast of characters participating in planning the coup is fascinating, and includes some of the most prominent German leaders: Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht, Admiral Canaris, head of the Abwehr, and General Ludwig Beck, Army Chief of Staff. This was a really big deal although not much remembered in much of the history of the period.On the other side was Hitler, maneuvering to maintain control of the military while encouraging the British and French to disavow their commitments to Czechoslovakia.

The cast of characters who made up the""opposition"" was large and included very prominent Germans. They had a plan that might have worked but were undercut when Chamberlain (British PM) caved to Hitler. Ritter's book tells this story in way that's exciting even when you know the outcome. I'm hoping to do the same when I put my fictional character into the mix of conspirators in the sequel to A Flood of Evil.Here are some excerpts from Ritter ...... in the army command of 1938, there was not the slightest desire to fight but only a universal apprehension of the possibility of a world war.... a rebellion was actually prepared ... in conjunction with a group of conspirators which had been formed within the counterintelligence service of the High Command.... The most difficult thing was, of course, to seize the person of Hitler right away. Witzleben was ready personally to take on this task on condition that he got from Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief formal orders to occupy ‘the Government quarter’; if necessary the gates of the Chancellery would be blown up by artillery and Hitler taken prisoner. To prevent the intervention of the S.S., especially of the Leibstandarte Division stationed in Munich, an armoured division commanded by General Hoepner and then in Thuringia would be ready to move. It was left obscure what was to be done with Hitler when he had been removed from the Chancellery.... Chamberlain flew to Munich and Berchtesgaden ... Hitler now had his supreme diplomatic triumph; the Prime Minister of Great Britain visited him in person in his mountain fortress in order—as the world generally interpreted it—to beg of him peace. The conspirators in Berlin saw themselves foiled. The wild beast which they had meant to snare, had escaped the net....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jun 04, 2019","Jun 04, 2019","Aug 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15394740-the-german-resistance

The Shemoneh Esrei is the heart of every Jewish service … it is recited at each of the three daily prayer services … composed in the 5th c BCE by 120 men of the Great Assembly … Almost every phrase has its source in the Bible ... when saying the Shemoneh Esrei a Jew addresses God directly ... Shemoneh Esrei … 4th prayer - knowledge ... ""Thou grantest knowledge to man, and teachest understanding to humans; from thine own self, favor us with knowledge, understanding, and sense. Blessed art Thou, Lord, giver of knowledge."" … the sages say: if there is no understanding, how can there be prayer? true piety, the kind not based on superstition, presupposes an understanding of the nature of the world and a knowledge of what God requires of us ... the giving of knowledge and wisdom to man is an act of Divine grace, for by doing so God graciously shares with man one of His own Divine qualitiesShemoneh Esrei … 5th prayer - repentance ... ""Return us, our Father, to thy Torah, and draw us closer, our King, to Thy worship. And bring us back before Thee in complete repentance. Blessed art Thou, Lord, who desires repentance."" … this prayer expresses the Jewish belief that God is not anxious to punish ... Judaism seeks the rehabilitation of those who violate God's lawShemoneh Esrei … 6th prayer - forgiveness ... ""Forgive us, our Father, for we have sinned. Pardon us, our King, for we have transgressed, for Thou art a pardoner and forgiver. Blessed art Thous, Lord, Gracious One who forgives abundantly … God sets no limit to His pardoning grace.

Churchill's views offer opportunities to question and criticize, and I will have my character Anna Gorska do just that as the scenes unfold in the sequel to A FLOOD OF EVIL. For instance, I have seen not a word about Kristallknacht which occurred in Nov 1938.Here are just a few excerpts to give the flavor of his wide-ranging observations and exhortations ...Oct 1936 ... What has happened to our defences in the meanwhile? Three years ago there was time. Two years ago there was danger. One year ago great new programmes of rearmament, and especially of expansion in the Air, were announced. What has happened to them? Are they being fulfilled? Are we making up for lost time? Are we overtaking foreign countries?Dec 1936 ... the dictators are preparing ...The armies and air fleets are preparing; in the arsenals and dockyards of Europe the great hammers descend with ceaseless clang. The heels of millions of soldiers crunch the gravel of the drill grounds. In the aerodromes new machines and new pilots take the air; squadrons form in rapid succession. Enormous stacks of bombs and shells pile up in the magazines. The dictators add the weekly outputs to their mounting tally.Feb 1937 ... To pretend for one moment that the danger in which Europe stands is not increasing would be absurd.Jul 1937 ... the plan of cutting Palestine into three parts is a counsel of despair ... the Partition plan, as now set forth, marks the end of the Zionist dream. The tract of land assigned to the Jews, no bigger than an English county, already bears a population of 140 to the square kilometre. It is as densely populated as Germany or England, and twice as densely as France. How then can there be any future for the idea of a national home of refuge and of inspiration for the hunted and hounded Jews of so many lands? Even in this limited area there are almost as many Arabs as Jews.Feb 1938 ... The secondary and smaller States of Europe are terrified by the decision and ruthlessness of the Dictator Powers, and their apparent readiness to use military force to achieve their ends. They have no confidence that Britain or France has the will or the power to protect them.Mar 1938 ... The Nazi seizure and subjugation of Austria has produced an effect in Britain deeper and stronger than anything that has occurred since the Great War. The scales of illusion have fallen from many eyes, especially in high quarters....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Aug 09, 2017","Jun 12, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22460805-step-by-step

Heydrich wrote a 5-part series in DSK … 1935: 5/1, 5/8, 5/15, 5/22, 5/29 … life is a constant struggle between the strong, noble and racially valuable people and the lower sub-human forms (untermenschen) … the untermenschen attempted to seize control of Germany through a Bolshevik revolution ... they are still in place in new battle positions, entrenched in every sector of public life ... do not be complacent ... Germans must recognize all the guises of the Jewish enemy ... operating through World Jewry ... seeking world domination through the creation of a Jewish upper class ... racial mixing will lead to disintegration ... there are two groups of Jews in Germany: Zionists and assimilated Jews, sometimes calling themselves Christians ... Germany is reeling from attacks in the foreign press led by emigrant Jews ... Jews use all their international organizations to destroy the German people ... but there are many among the SS who realize the Jewish menace ... Jews still have an elaborate network at all levels in state and public life (no details provided; seems to deny effectiveness of Nazi takeover) ... many Aryans aid the Jews: liberals, religious leaders, humanitarians ... our mission is to win the battle with the Jews ... only the SS can lead the attack ... the Jewish enemy must be brought down without quarter ... no exceptions ... no ""good Jews"" ... ... a full page story about Jews who frequent the Havel near Berlin … on the beaches, despite posted notices that Jews were not wanted … laying about in clumps, cuddling each other in a provocative manner … on the walks and in the cafes ... looks more like Tel Aviv than Berlin … why keep dogs on a leash when we let Jews run about?...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jun 12, 2017","May 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4512074-the-voice-of-the-ss

Dodd's observations were published in 1939, but presumably were formed earlier. It seems reasonable that her views were shared with her father, the American Ambassador to Germany in the 1930s, and possible that her father shared these or similar views with FDR. What Martha Dodd reveals is that Hitler's attitudes and intentions regarding Jews were clearly known, before 1939, at high levels in the US government. Here are some of her observations ...... in 1935, Hitler said to Ambassador Dodd: ""I will not be satisfied until there is not a Jew left in Germany"" ... in 1938, Hitler, drunk with the power Chamberlain and Daladier handed to him in Munich, indulged in a maniacal and frenzied orgy of sadism and destruction against Jews (she is referring to Kristallknacht)... it was a shock to me to learn that many wealthy German Jews had actually supported Hitler financially and otherwise … what could make them, with open eyes, commit their people's suicide … their fortunes meant more to them than their own lives and freedom ... Hitler does not intend his actions versus Jews to be limited to Germany … he expects other nations, far and near, to become acutely conscious of the Jewish problem as he sees it... there is only one salvation for Jews … calling forth whatever courage and self-forgetfulness it takes … renounce defeatism … unite with other Jewish groups … join with gentile groups who see he racial and economic problems involved … do not isolate … fight together with every anti-Fascist organization...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"May 23, 2017",Jun 2017,"May 23, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11726930-through-embassy-eyes

In this work, Jon DippI have read a great many books as research for my recently published novel A Flood of Evil, and now for the sequel in progress. In this work, Jon Dippel offers a magnificent blending of a collective overview of the factors which influenced German Jews from the 19th century Emancipation until Kristallknacht, amplified with details from the lives of 6 of the most prominent of these Jews. The book's stated question is why did German Jews stay when many could have left, but Dippel addresses far more. Outstanding work.UPDATE 4/28/17 ... This book was, for me, a synthesis of much that I already knew, although it was presented in a way that suggested new insights and interpretations. There was a focus on 6 prominent German Jews, of whom four may well become characters in the sequel to A FLOOD OF EVIL: Bella Fromm, Max Warburg, Rabbi Leo Baeck, and Robert Weltsch. Each of them experienced what Dippel called the tightening noose of Nazi persecution. Their public pronouncements and private thoughts (in diaries and letters) are an exquisite testimony to the pressures Jews were under. I was often pushed to consider how I might have reacted in their circumstances. These reflections will no doubt show up in the conversations and interior monologues of my main characters Berthold Becker and Anna Gorska.SELECTED NOTES ...... The Nazi movement lead many Jews to become more conscious of what made them different from other Germans … and what bound them together … more mindful of their traditions and great past... Many more Jews now accepted the truth of the Zionist argument that emancipation was a sham, that non-Jews would never except Jews as equals... Well-assimilated Jews thought the Nazis would eventually become more reasonable and accept a legal solution to the Jewish problem which would place only minor restrictions when the rights of German Jews... German Jews were afraid that complaining about their plight would fan the flames of hatred and make things worse... the realization that they were all Jews together was (for some) an intoxicating elixir … once again they resolved to prevail through solidarity … once again, they would be provn wrong... Baeck that those German Jews who had once shamefully hidden their spiritual roots would now find a fountain of regenerating strength in those roots... Baeck altered his message … he no longer smoke as a liberal Jew proud of the long process of acculturation in German ... Now he described his people as a race, always seen as a different people living among suspicious neighbors...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Mar 30, 2017","Apr 28, 2017","Mar 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/715045.Bound_Upon_A_Wheel_Of_Fire

There was to be no political life in Germany … parties were banned (except the Nazi party) … discipline would be provided by police terror ... It was the task of the Gestapo and SD to penetrate into every aspect of public and private life … and to create a legend of terror design to make them appear even more omniscient and ubiquitous that in fact they work... a Prussian statute recognized the status of the Gestapo … Clause 7 stated that there was to be no appeal from the decision of the Gestapo … the judiciary was forbidden to re-examine Gestapo decisions … this meant, for example, a person could be acquitted by the court, or released from prison at the expiration of a court sentence, and immediately rearrested by the Gestapo and taken into protective custody, ie, sent to a concentration camp... in 1936 ... Jews were not Heydrich's main priority … the German people as a whole had to be regimented … the army had to be put in its place … the churches have to be undermined...more",Notes are private!,0,15,0,not set,not set,"Feb 01, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4609535-gestapo

The contrast between this human goodness and the utter depravity of the Nazis and those who helped them jumps off every page. What kind of people murder children? The answer is people who are unable to face up to their own failures (such as losing the first war) and who are willing to blame others (Jews) rather than accept their own responsibilities. Hitler and the Nazis used the substantial human shortcomings of the German people to accomplish their own goals for power and wealth. The Catholic and Lutheran churches at the highest levels remained silent, although there were many priests and others who opposed the Nazis in remarkable ways. The Allies never made any effort to close down the death camps, even as they knew that millions of Jews, including Jewish children, were being taken on freight cars to be gassed and burned in ovens .

With one important exception, Silva repeatedly expresses great disdain for a not at all disguised President Obama, which I find overdone and offensive. On the other hand, there is almost no criticism of Israeli actions which, in my mind, have made things worse rather than better, and continue to do so. Now you can say that Silva writes novels, not political commentary, but when he chooses to insert his political opinions in his novel, then it is fair to disagree with those views on a political rather than literary level.

I am re-reading my own book in preparation for a bookclub meeting to be held in Berlin on Monday (via SKYPE). I am very interested in getting feedback from German readers, and I have invited them to be critical if they are so inclined.***A FLOOD OF EVIL OPENS WITH BERTHOLD BECKER FACING A DEATH SENTENCE AT THE 1945 NUREMBERG WAR CRIMES TRIAL …… Berthold Becker showed little emotion as his jailer unlocked his cell and escorted him along the dark corridor lined with soldiers. For several weeks he had sat quietly and watched as the trials of the other high-ranking Nazis had proceeded, and for the past two days he had paid somewhat greater attention as the evidence against him was presented, and what he regarded as a pathetic defense followed. It wasn’t his attorney’s fault. He was guilty. He had done horrible things. He couldn’t change what he had done and now he would pay the price. He expected to be hung.THEN THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY ASKS IF HE CAN INTRODUCE ANOTHER, NOT PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED WITNESS ...... The Chief Justice looked to Prosecutor Weintraub who made no objection, and all eyes turned to the now open door at the back of the courtroom and the woman standing there. Berthold choked back the sounds that began to erupt in his throat but could not stop the tears that flooded from his eyes. The woman entering the courtroom had been his closest friend and lover for fifteen years. She was forever in his thoughts. He had not expected to ever see her again. ANNA GORSKA TESTIFIES AT BERTHOLD’S TRIAL …… “Berthold Becker was a member of the Nazi Party, and in that capacity, he participated in the commission of at least some of the crimes he has been charged with by this Tribunal. I am sure he expects to be punished.” She paused. “But for reasons I will explain, he should not be put to death.… “This defendant is not now and never was an evil man. He was dragged into a maelstrom not of his choosing and from which he was unable to escape. It is easy to say he should have done more to stop the Nazis and in hindsight perhaps he would agree.… “Berthold Becker had a unique vantage point during the entire Nazi terror. He knows and will tell a truth that others deny.” Looking back to the justices, speaking slowly, she delivered each of her final words as if it were a dagger. “You have the power to allow the terrible story of German evil and guilt to be known. Do not take the life of this defendant. Let Berthold Becker live to tell his story.”FORTY-FIVE YEARS LATER …... the daughter of Becker's Nuremberg prosecutor, a professor of Holocaust history at Brandeis University, asks her father to collaborate with her in a book about the characters in his Nuremberg trial. “You read Gorska’s testimony,” he says. “There must be more,” his daughter responds. “A German Catholic Nazi is saved from death by a Polish Jewish woman who had been a prisoner at Auschwitz. There must be more.”THUS IS THE STORY OF BERTHOLD AND ANNA TOLD.

The author, grand-daughter of Jews who escaped from a small German town, went back to that town, met with people who had known her grand-parents, and produced a thoughtful presentation of the feelings and pressures on both Jews and Christians as the Nazi regime increased its persecution of Jews. Lifelong friendships were instantly terminated within days of Hitler's appointment as Chancellor, even before the most oppressive laws and measures were implemented. Most Christians looked away as Jews endured an increasingly lonely and fearful existence. Some Christians exhibited kindness, for instance bringing food to Jews no longer allowed in Christian shops, but most, fearful of being denounced by their neighbors, simply ignored the Jews.Ms. Henry also recorded attitudes of Christian Germans after Germany's defeat. Mostly, they were angry at Allied bombing and other so-called ""atrocities."" They acted like victims, of the Allies and of Hitler. Nobody felt their own actions were to blame.What would I have done in their shoes? Could they have done anything meaningful?

He would lay before the representatives of all countries the following suggestions: reduction of armaments; equal access to raw materials; laws of warfare ... If the response were favorable, the United States government would begin working with selected governments on the details of tentative proposals which could then be submitted to other nations ... Roosevelt was communicating with this proposal to the British only, and would proceed only if he received assurance from Chamberlain that the proposal met with the wholehearted support of his Majesty's government ... Eden's recommendation was to immediately accept Roosevelt's proposal … and to make no destructive criticisms or reservations or attempts to define issues more clearly … even if nothing concrete comes from Roosevelt's proposals in the short-term, they will bring us time and will bring the United States a little nearer to a divided Europe ... but Chamberlain dithered and Roosevelt's initiative was never made ...

He did oppose Hitler's euthanasia program, but as Griech-Polelle points out, this only serves to emphasize his lack of concern for Nazi terror and murder of Jews, when he was fully aware of what was happening.Bishop Galen was not unlike most other German Bishops, and the Vatican, in his failure to speak out against the persecution, deportation and murder of Jews. What is infuriating was the post-war attempt of the Catholic Church to portray him as an ardent fighter against the Nazis, even to the point of proposing sainthood. Fortunately, Pope John Paul II decided in 1987 that Bishop Galen would not be canonized, and instead named Edith Stein for her courageous witness to the horror of Nazi brutality.SELECTED EXCERPTS ......

Germans have been convincing themselves, in hindsight, that there was an extensive army of Gestapo agents and spies which allowed no opportunity for any real resistance or opposition to have crystallized … Gellately says that story is no longer convincing... ordinary German citizens played a key role in their own policing and help make possible the murderous deeds of the Nazi regime... the Gestapo’s reputation for brutality … and the knowledge that anyone could be sent to a concentration camp for an indefinite period … was central to the Gestapo’s effectiveness... police now had the authority to arrest and detain any suspect deemed a threat to the state … with no judicial procedure or permission … this could amount to unlimited trial, indeed without even charges ... Gestapo cases were organize into many categories … continuation of political parties … continuation of forbidden religious associations … forbidden youth groups … nonconforming verbal utterances … nonconforming work or leisure activities … acquiring or spreading of forbidden printed matter … listening to foreign radio … political passivity … conventional criminality … improper statements from the pulpit... Jews were made to feel that they could expect little help from their neighbors … that anti-Jewish policies would increase in number … and enforced down to the smallest detail … any sympathy that might be shown by any other person for their plight or even regarding the efficacy of anti-Semitic policies could be treated by anyone who wished to as cause for a report to the local Gestapo authority... there was a high incidence of false charges … but the Gestapo could use intimidation,, extortion and blackmail to force victims to sign confessions … Gestapo interrogation was often exhausting for the victims … days and weeks filled with terror and anxiety … some, when released temporarily, attempted suicide to escape the relentless cross examination by the tireless officials... sexual intercourse between Jews and non-Jews was declared a crime by the Nuremberg laws of 1935 … even friendly or social relations with Jews constituted an area of potential criminality ... a life-threatening incident could begin anywhere and at any time … a group was listening to dance music on the radio at a bar … the music was interrupted by a speech by Hitler … somebody turned off the radio … a woman immediately try to ascertain the name of the person who did that … the radio was turned back on but the lady was not satisfied and made a report to the Gestapo ... an elderly couple, a Jewish merchant and a woman who lived across the street from him, we’re suspected of having a relationship which might be considered raise the file … although the advanced years of both parties suggest that they fear of race defilement through production of a child of next ancestry was out of the question … nevertheless remarkably dogged and sometimes ridiculous efforts were pursued until the man died suddenly of natural causes … or did he commit suicide?... sometimes there were not enough cases of race defilement … Gestapo officials had to invent more cases … Jews were lured into compromising situations and then denounced … or so called evidence was simply invented … to local Gestapo officers it was a foregone conclusion that every Jewish person brought to their attention could be linked with some infringement of race regulation ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,2,"Feb 13, 2017Apr 13, 2016","Mar 12, 2017Apr 25, 2016","Apr 13, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/414229.The_Gestapo_and_German_Society

The problem is they're succeeding. They can't win the Presidency yet, but at every other level - Congress, Senate, state legislatures, local government and even school boards - they have already made major inroads. Voter suppression, gerrymandered districts and reduced budgets are all part of their agenda. They have created so-called ""think tanks"" and have infiltrated universities (George Mason is one) in order to fool Americans, especially under-educated Americans, into believing that the billionaires' objectives are good for America. This is the most insidious, dangerous force alive in America today. They are not looking to take over the Republican Party, but rather to replace it.

Rabbi Baeck was an inspirational figure in his time and, IMO, to this day. He was not naive and knew what was coming, but he would not leave. He helped others to leave and did his best to make sure they did not feel guilty by doing so. But for him, the opportunity which had come to him was to stay, and it would be a denial of his soul to do otherwise.I hope to introduce Rabbi Baeck into my novel (the sequel to A FLOOD OF EVIL) and make him as inspirational to my fictional character Berthold Becker as he now is to me.***Rabbi Leo Baeck was perhaps the most important leader of the Jews of Germany during the Hitler years. A scholar and spiritual leader before Hitler's rise, Baeck turned down offers to leave Germany and took on the difficult and ultimately frustrating role of coordinating Jewish response to the closing Nazi net. Arrested several times, he survived Theresienstadt and lived his final years in England. Baker has written a marvelous account of Baeck's long and remarkable life.Baeck recognized that the scattered organizational structure of German Jewry was not adequate to stand against Nazi antisemitism. He helped create and was the chief spokesman for the Reichsverretung, an organization which supervised welfare problems of German Jews … education … emigration … raised funds … and sought help of Jews abroad. He was a major factor in the escape of many German Jews during the late 1930s when escape was still possible.In 1935, on Yom Kippur shortly after the passage of the infamous Nuremberg Racial Laws, Baeck wrote a stirring sermon to be read in all synagogues in Germany. In this sermon, Baeck stated ... that there was a moment of decision for each individual, the point beyond which he will not bend, the pressure to which he will not succumb, the sacrifice he will not make ... that Judaism was the history of the grandeur of the human soul and the dignity of human life ... that no matter how weak we are, how oppressed we might be, how abruptly our former friends turn away from us, we cannot be defeated.Baeck was arrested by the Gestapo, but soon released after pressure from an article in the London Times and protest from a group of Christian ministers in the US. Baker points out that ""no German Christian leaders protested the Baeck's arrest.""This event, and others in Baeck's life, will likely play a role in Book Two of my novel A FLOOD OF EVIL....more",Notes are private!,0,17,2,"Apr 28, 2017not set","Apr 16, 2018Mar 25, 2016","Mar 26, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/998087.Days_of_Sorrow_and_Pain

It is a complex story, with many threads, beautifully written (even in translation), great descriptions of people, places and action, never overdone, and with occasional splashes of humor. Nesbo presents the story in pieces, and much is unclear as it should be in this kind of story. I paused before the final pages, wondering how Nesbo would finish it. These last scenes were brilliant, even though several threads were left unresolved, perhaps to be picked up in subsequent Harry Hole novels.Central to the story was the position Norway was put into between Hitler and Stalin, and the long-lasting impact of the choices people made in WWII, especially those who fought with the Nazis. Much of this history was new to me, but there are surely parallels to the position of Poland, which is part of my story in the sequel to A FLOOD OF EVIL currently underway.

When do the waving lights and shadows of dawning consciousness cast their print upon the mind of a child?""What a delight. Published in 1930, it covers the first 30 years of Churchill's life (1874-1904), and packs in more adventure than most of us could ever expect in many times those years. Churchill tells war stories in which he was a participant ... in Egypt, in South Africa. Apparently he barely survived many times, before rushing off to India to play in an army polo tournament, where he scored the winning goal, despite an incapacitated shoulder. His imprisonment after surrender, and subsequent 300 mile escape from a Boer prison, climbing out of windows, walking alone through the night with Boer troops looking for him, hiding between bales of hay on a train passing over the border. It goes on and on.Churchill is a hopeless egotist, as what politician isn't, but he is also to be commended for including in his book the rather intense criticism his exploits gained in British papers: he wasn't really in the army ... why was he there? ... he was risking our cause.Is it all true?

The French, under the foot of the Germans, never did much with Enigma. The Brits took the Enigma work, rejected the Poles who had solved the problems, and rather ungraciously took all the credit at Bletchley Park. The movie ""The Imitation Game"" gave all the credit to Turing and the Brits, and never mentioned the Poles. This oversight was finally corrected decades after the war (before the movie was produced), and the Poles are now included in Bletchley's revised history.The book's description of the actual Enigma machines is fascinating and clear enough, if you persevere. The activities and escapes of the Polish codebreakers are presented in an exciting and realistic manner as they get out of Poland, go to France, get out of France and over the Pyrenees, and finally to London, where they are seriously underemployed nowhere near Bletchley.And, of course, the information produced by the Enigma work was crucial in winning the war, since the over-confident Germans never knew that their encrypted radio transmissions were being read by the Allies within hours of transmission....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Feb 17, 2016","Feb 27, 2016","Feb 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20158066-enigma

IMO, there are roughly 25 pages that get 5***** and most of the rest is 2** at best. Let me explain.The first 100 pages of “Go Set A Watchman” are beyond awful. There’s no story, no focus, no direction, and the writing is abysmal. I have an image of the author reaching into a bucket of words and sentences and throwing them haphazardly into the air, leaving a pastiche of paragraphs scattered across the pages. The author is not in control of the book.Had I not been obligated to read the entire book because it was a selection of my book club, I would have stopped and that would have been a shame.Because ... when Jean Louise goes into the courthouse (yes, that courthouse) and sneaks upstairs (sound familiar?) to see her father (Atticus) listening without objection to an extended vile racist monologue that literally makes her sick, the book becomes electric. The sentences are sharp, the paragraphs make sense, there is direction and excitement. Alas, it does not last. After 20 or so sparkling pages, the rest of the book replaces story with diatribe, one long argument after another. The arguments are powerful, some of them, but there is no longer a novel going on. And so it goes, until one brief flourish at the end, where Jean Louise and Atticus and Dr. Jack briefly become people again. The last 5 pages made me cry.We understand that “Watchman” was a first novel, and that it probably never benefited from a good editor’s hand. If that was all there was to Harper Lee’s writing, we might say what a shame, there was real potential there. But then of course came “Mockingbird” and all of that potential was fully and magnificently realized. The same themes but without diatribe, a story told through the characters, wonderful characters, the anger of “Watchman” fully realized in one of the best novels of our time. Harper Lee apparently never wrote again, but then she didn’t have to....more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Feb 11, 2016",Mar 2016,"Feb 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24817626-go-set-a-watchman

Boycotts, legislation, emigration and pogroms all caused incredible hardship but still failed to eliminate Jews from Germany or even from the German economy. Finally, after Kristallknacht in November 1938, Hitler turned the Jewish problem over to Goering, Heydrich and Eichmann, which led to Auschwitz.Schleunes argues that Nazi policy until late 1938 was implemented by various underlings acting without consistent direction from Hitler. From what I have so far read, I think this was true but not a complete analysis. Hitler's fanatical Jew-hatred never wavered, from the moment he came to public attention in the early 1920s until his last statement before he died in 1945. But Hitler was patient, and his career is marked by a willingness to wait for the right opportunity and to defer action on one priority - ridding Germany of Jews - while focusing on the then-higher priorities of economic recovery and rearmament. When those goals had been achieved, and Germany no longer needed to be concerned with international opinion, Hitler turned to the Jews.One aspect of the Nazi Jew-hatred that Schleunes does not address is why Hitler hated and feared Jews as he did, and why so many (most?) Germans had no problem accepting that hatred as valid and acquiescing in Hitler's policies, even to the point of mass murder. Why were Jews hated? Where did Hitler acquire that hatred? Why was persecution of Jews so acceptable to so many Germans? These are issues I am dealing with in the almost completed A FLOOD OF EVIL (1923-1933) and the sequel which is now taking focus....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jan 02, 2016","Jan 13, 2016","Jan 02, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/804984.The_Twisted_Road_to_Auschwitz

For one thing, it was way too long; I found myself skimming through scenes that didn't seem to me to be either essential or interesting, including the ending, which should have been a high point but wasn't. Several of the characters were portrayed in what to me was a very unrealistic manner. That may be because I am not familiar with the teenage sexual habits that Iles described in such great detail. Maybe he is giving an accurate rendering, but I found much of it offensive and pandering to the least attractive aspects of sexual interaction. Maybe, by today's standards, I'm just a prude. Finally, the portrayal of Mia, the teenage girl who is at the center of so many aspects of the story, was strangely missing the kind of internal depth that could have made her emotionally compelling.

Too bad it took most of the world so long to understand and react, since there were many opportunities to stop Hitler, not just at Munich in 1938 which was, after all, rather late in the game. My new novel addresses the ways Hitler could have been stopped before 1933 when he was appointed Chancellor. It is infuriating to understand what important people knew and how they didn't act on that knowledge, always for a self-serving agenda which turned out to be less important than the grave dangers they ignored, and the 60 million people whose deaths Hitler caused.

I posted this  to another book of the same name ... now it's where it belongs.I read this for a course I am taking at Oxford this August on the Middle East. It is a series of chapters, mostly written from a non-western perspective, which is quite valuable for westerners to hear. I was particularly interested in the sections on Israel and the US, which were favorable to neither but did make an attempt to understand the Israeli and American perspectives and actions even when critical. FROM THE ISRAEL CHAPTER ... ""Israel sees itself as the victim of Islamic encirclement with Hezbollah from the north, Hamas from the west, and the Muslim Brotherhood from the south ... and growing fear from the 'poisonous crescent' of Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Lebanon ... what is utterly missing from this bleak Israeli mindset is any understanding of the part that they themselves have played in generating so much hostility all around them.""I think many Israelis are well aware of the part Israel has played but they would contend that unrelenting Arab hostility to the Jewish presence in Palestine (many still do not even recognize the existence of Israel) has created an existential threat that provides Israel little flexibility. Recognizing that threat, I still believe the Israeli rejection of the 2-state solution and continued aggressive expansion of settlements is not helpful. Whether any other policy is possible, given Israel's internal politics and the constant threat of attacks, is not clear.FROM THE US CHAPTER ... ""The US should wish the Arabs well as they reshape their ossified political institutions, but it should largely remain on the sidelines at this point ... it should be serious about supporting the new democracies - economic aid, trade, investments, technology, education ... try to help wherever possible but do not try to control the process.""The situation is so complex, and continually changing. US interests are not always clear, and there is much dispute about what they are, especially in an era where the Republican objective is to object to anything President Obama proposes. And, since this book was written, we have the emergence of ISIS. Obama is cautious; he does not want to involve us in another mid-east war. But when is it our interest to intervene? The conclusion above seems to say - send us money but no conditions. Not likely.Perhaps the greatest frustration is that this book, as comprehensive and well-thought out as it is, does not and cannot answer any of the fundamental questions facing either Israel or the US. We have decades of confusion and mis-steps ahead of us. It should be an interesting week in class....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Apr 08, 2016","Sep 09, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/20564163-the-new-middle-east

Poland, Russia, Wannsee, Auschwitz... Heydrich understood better than some of the Wehrmacht's senior officers that those implementing the policies most attuned to Hitler's wishes would be rewarded with enhanced powers to enforce them.... Heydrich's Gestapo and SD had prepared for war against Poland since the spring of 1939. The Security Police would ‘neutralize’ centres of potential resistance and destroy those classes of society thought to be carriers of Polish nationalism. The card index was used to compile a ‘special arrest list’, which carried the names of some 61,000 Poles to be arrested or killed immediately. ... Behind the regular troops, Heydrich's SS task forces swiftly moved across the border and descended on Poland's civilian population, informing Heydrich personally of the ‘progress’ of their work through daily reports. The conquest of Poland, widely perceived by the Nazis as a racially inferior country, significantly expanded conceptions of what was possible and permissible.... Of the 16,000 Polish civilians killed during the first six weeks of the war, 5,000 were Jews. ... within the first few months of 1940, Eichmann was to ensure that 600,000 Jews from the annexed territories, ‘without regard to age and gender’, were deported into the General Government.... The Wehrmacht successfully used the Polish (SS) atrocities as an argument against any SS involvement on the Western Front. ... Nazi Germany's victorious campaigns in Western Europe thus constituted a setback for Heydrich.... new opportunity arose following Hitler's decision to attack the Soviet Union. Heydrich was determined not let this opportunity pass him by ... On 22 June 1941, a historically unprecedented invasion army of 3 million German soldiers … Heydrich's Einsatzgruppen followed in the armies’ rear, grimly determined to excel in carrying out their orders.... by the end of 1941, Germans and their local helpers had murdered between 500,000 and 800,000 Jewish men, women and children in the former Soviet territories, often between 2,700 and 4,200 per day, with most of the deaths resulting from shootings at close quarters.... Göring authorized Heydrich to make ‘all necessary preparations’ for a ‘total solution of the Jewish question in the German sphere of influence in Europe’. … he empowered Heydrich to submit a ‘comprehensive draft’ of a plan for the ‘final solution to the Jewish question’. ... On 20 January 1942, a snowy Tuesday morning, Heydrich gathered fourteen senior Nazi civil servants, party officials and high-ranking SS officers in a former industrialist's villa on the shores of Berlin's Lake Wannsee. As Heydrich indicated in his invitation letter of late November 1941, the purpose of the meeting was to establish ‘a common position among the central authorities’ in regard to the final solution... Heydrich outlined the scale of the task that lay ahead of them. Roughly 11 million Jews – including those living under German occupation, the Jews of neutral European states such as Turkey, Ireland and Sweden and those living in states still at war with Nazi Germany, such as Great Britain – would be affected by the final solution.***UPDATE 7/14/16 ...I just read the sections covering Reinhard Heydrich's activities from when Hitler became Chancellor in Jan 1933 until he helped Hitler murder over 200 opponents in what is known as the Night of the Long Knives in 1934. Gerwarth provides a very well done picture of Heydrich's role in the Nazi transition to a state were open opposition led to imprisonment and death and all good Germans were encouraged to spy on and denounce each other. Heydrich, who was briefly introduced in Book One of A FLOOD OF EVIL (just published) will be a central character in Book Two which I have just started writing.***I read the parts that correspond to the time line of my novel, ie, before spring 1933.

Skinner is very human, making lots of mistakes in judgment and action, which makes him a very interesting character.Jardine uses an interesting technique in this novel that I may experiment with in my own new novel. The story is told in the 1st person by Skinner, but it's a case that happened many years before. This allows Skinner to make comments about what's going to happen in the intervening years, a forewarning of future events. My novel takes place between 1923 and 1933, but the main characters also appear in what I call Interludes, which take place in 1990. I originally intended this as a means of allowing the reader to feel closer to the characters, but it also provides an opportunity to ""forewarn"" regarding my characters' participation in events which occur after 1933. Experimenting like this is part of the fun of writing....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"May 09, 2015","May 17, 2015","May 09, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10165038-grievous-angel

Singer (the older brother of Isaac Bashevitz Singer) tells the story of three generations of a Jewish family, from Poland to Berlin to New York, from the early 1900s to the 1930s.German Jews thought they were safe, with careers and sufficient wealth to live comfortably, to work, marry, have children and pray. They assimilated and they had become, as Singer puts it, “Jews in the house and Germans on the street.”Then came the Nazis and everything was turned upside down.The scenes describing the impact of the brutal, ignorant Nazi beasts are frightening and difficult to read, but impossible to put aside. In their minds in the German Jews of Singer’s novel were as good as any other German, but in public, in the “streets,” they were not Germans at all, but simply despicable Jews, to be robbed and beaten at will. They had done everything they thought was right and they had succeeded in building satisfying and productive lives, and now they were nothing, barely able to stay alive, with nowhere to turn for help.I read this as a library copy, but immediately my purchased own, to read again as I write my still untitled story of how Hitler came to power, who supported his rise and why, who stood aside, and my young fictional characters who tried to resist....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Apr 29, 2015","May 08, 2015","Apr 29, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/718650.The_Family_Carnovsky

In my case, he wins his bet (but loses 1*). The pieces do come together, except for those I suspect he purposely leaves unresolved in order to address them in the next Penn Cage novel.Difficult decisions are faced by good people who are pressed towards actions they know are wrong, but perhaps less wrong than any alternative they can see. Several times, characters decide that their best course of action, no matter the danger, is to go right after the evil, and those scenes are thrilling, even if the results are not always those desired.I do believe Iles could have cut at least 100 pages and have a better book, but it is what it is and overall, it is a terrific tale of hatred and vengeance set in the despicable landscape of the still alive KKK south now enhanced by a sophisticated understanding of how to use the internet for criminal purposes....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Sep 10, 2015","Sep 28, 2015","Apr 17, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18505832-natchez-burning

The play was first performed on the New York stage in 1892, during the height of a massive emigration of Jews from eastern Europe to America. The setting is the celebration of Purim and the plot shows the shifting of fortune between the older and younger generation, between traditionalism and modernity, between religion and secularism. In Gordin's view, the transition taking place on the stage is also taking place in the audience, as parents are suffering when their children no longer honor them. Notes by Ruth Gay and Sophie Glazer convey Yiddish secular theater as a thrilling seductive experience, arousing passionate responses from the audience who saw 'realistic' situations portrayed in everyday language and were carried away to another world.Also described is ""Sappho,"" another play by Gordin, which presents out-of-wedlock pregnancy and a proud statement by the heroine Sophia: ""I made a mistake; it is nobody's business; I take full responsibility; if I am to be a mother, I can care for my child by myself; I will be free and honorable in my actions, honorable the way I understand it, not Aunt Frade's way and Uncle Melekh's and all the rest.""In my new novel, I am thinking of showing the impact of Gordin's modern thinking and the spectacle of a riveting performance in the shtetl of Ciechanow, when a play written and first produced in America returns forty years later to its roots in eastern Europe....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Apr 02, 2015","Apr 08, 2015","Apr 02, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1467775.The_Jewish_King_Lear_Comes_to_America

I'm reading parts of this again as I get to the point in my novel when Korczak and his children marched off to die at Treblinka. AUPDATE 12/13/18 ... I'm reading parts of this again as I get to the point in my novel when Korczak and his children marched off to die at Treblinka. A horrifying story told with power and emotion. In case you need any more reason to hate the Germans, this is it.***There are many tears to be shed for the way Janusz Korczak died, marching at the head of his final group of orphans off to a German death camp, but one cannot fail to be thrilled by the way he lived. For 30 years, he ran an orphanage in Warsaw, out of love for the children he was able to care for and as a means to study what worked and what didn't in the interaction with children. His ideas - a court system run by the children, a newspaper written and largely managed by the children - are astonishingly on target, even today. Betty Lifton did a superb job of capturing the emotion and the quality of Korczak's work.I have already written one scene in my novel-in-progress where Anna Gorska (my main fictional Polish character) shares a pre-Hanukah play session at the orphanage, and I have now outlined another 3-4 scenes involving Korczak and the children that I think will help me communicate the great richness of the world of Polish Jewry, the memory of which has survived even the German attempt to eradicate it.Here are some of my notes ...... children's court … not an instant success … children did not want to tattle … finally got going … counselors as prosecutor and defense attorney; three children as judges .. any child could bring a suit against another child … Korczak learning as he watched... using the orphanage as a laboratory, Korczak wanted to work out an educational diagnostic system … children to run their own parliament, court and newspaper … a moral education based on respect for others as a prelude to self-respect...
