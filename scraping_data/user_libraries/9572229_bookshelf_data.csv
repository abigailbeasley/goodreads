In other words, the f3.75 starsA very acceptable updating of ""Jane Eyre"" to C21st Toronto, with most of the strengths and weaknesses of the original. In other words, the first part (Jane & Edward) is the more compelling. There's a lot to enjoy in seeing Jane come into her own, and the developing relationship with Edward is energetic and witty (even if Edward's inner teddy-bear is a little too obvious). This was heading towards definite 4-star territory. However, moving from boss/assistant to an affair does grate, both because C19th Jane's qualms don't quite stack up for C21st Jane, and because of the rather dodgy power dynamics.The second part, after ""Mrs Rochester"" is discovered, loses energy with Edward off the scene. Modern-day St.John Rivers is also subtly off course: the original had at least a strong moral centre to him. The differences between C19th / C21st are also at their most obvious. C19th Jane had few choices, so walking away from Rochester was truly brave; C21st Jane is more independent, so her refusal to compromise in any regard has an air of priggishness about it, which eroded my sympathy for her. The biggest difference is in the treatment of Rochester. The ending of ""Jane Eyre"" punishes him with blindness: it's a punishment of biblical proportions. Edward, on the other hand, loses his partnership and has to relocate to the other side of the country to teach. Um, one of these things is not like the other. I can absolutely see why Melodie Edwards stepped back from the high drama of blindness, but the watered-down ending left me feeling a little flat. More: ""Oh, right, OK, they've got together again, not sure why they split tbh."" Not, ""Oh, thank goodness, they're together, they have fought so hard against all the odds, I never thought they'd make it."" Not the exultant, ""Reader, I married him.""By and large, though, this is definitely worth a read.

In lesser hands this could have been a wallow-fest, but Rowland keeps it real. That's achieved partly by using Kadou & Evemer as light-relief for the most part. The ""what next?"" questions from ATOGAI aren't completely answered, but enough for their presence in this book to be supportive without distracting from the main story.I like the way Rowland constrasts Tadek's sense of space between ""Then"" and ""Now"". The young Tadek was always in motion, running through the town, describing the streets and districts; he had space to roam, room to grow. Gradually, his horizons have closed in, until ""Now"" he's almost confined to a single room and a claustrophobic set of memories. One of Rowland's strengths is the value she gives to tactile experience.

Far fewer ""filler"" books in 2023, but much more re-reading (R. Cooper & A mixed year - 363 new-to-me books read, down from 453 in 2022 & 587 in 2021. Far fewer ""filler"" books in 2023, but much more re-reading (R. Cooper & K.L. Noone both feature frequently). That's partly a reflection of my dissatisfaction with the ""churn out another"" fare from authors I'd enjoyed in the past, and partly the result of my decreased free time: if I've only got so long to read then it's going to be something I'll really enjoy. In the background, I'm also reading a lot of non-fiction round and about the year 1819 for writing research purposes. I dip in and out of these books so I never feel I can properly  them, bar the odd one or two that suck me in (Rory Muir, I'm looking at Gentlemen of Uncertain Fortune: How Younger Sons Made Their Way in Jane Austen's England). Anyway, my ""Best of 2023"" is the books I could not put down, which have stayed with me, and which I will certainly re-read. Alphabetically by author:Pack of Lies - Charlie Adhara transforms the tired shape-shifting trope into a political statement, throws in messy emotions, excellent characterisation and tops it off with some decent snark. I need book 2 now.Show Girl - Alyson Greaves charts Alex's sunny journey to discovering he's a girl and in love with sweet clueless James. The best kind of unrealistic story where you end up thinking, ""well, why not?""Work for It - Talia Hibbert pits tortured tart-tongued Olu against stolid outcast Griff. Hurt/comfort (done as subtly as it is here) leaves me uplifted. Object of Desire - Dal Maclean's murky, nail-biting thriller / mystery would be a winner even without the difficult second-chance romance. This is one book I had to put down from time to time, because the tension became unbearable. Superb.Ocean's Echo - Everina Maxwell's first book (Winter's Orbit) showed how good her world-building skills were, and that's true here too. On top of that, she's layered a twisty twisty plot and one of the funniest, most unlikely heroes in Tennal. My only criticism is that the ending (an HFN) doesn't offer the pay-off Tennal & Surit's relationship deserves. Still a cracking read.The Emperor's Soul - Brandon Sanderson weaves together elements of a heist plot with a clever exploration of what it means to be human. His heroine, Shai, needs to recreate the soul of her world's Emperor before the empire disintegrates into a bloody civil war. Polished writing and a real sense of tension.Luke and Billy Finally Get a Clue - Cat Sebastian can transform oblivious pining and tiny domestic details into romance gold. Just 26k words to create complex characters, relationship and a North Carolina farmhouse. Agents of Winter - Ada Maria Soto's sequel to her hymn to silence, His Quiet Agent—which you should totally read: it's wonderful & in my top 10 romance books ever. Nothing happens in AoW except for Martin slowly uncurling a tendril or two of connection; it's impossible not to cheer / be moved by each tentative advance. AMS manages to make so much happen in the unwritten pauses between conversations. I re-read this when I need my fur to be stroked the right way. Probably my book of the year.Liar City - TBH, I didn't especially enjoy Allie Therin's earlier books because there was a naïvety about the writing that didn't sit well with me. But Liar City is on a different level: top class, tension-rich world-building and a carefully managed antagonism between the MCs. Both plot and relationship are unresolved & my fingers are crossed that Twisted Shadows maintains the suspense.Terry Pratchett: A Life With Footnotes: The Official Biography - Rob Wilkins has written an affectionate & acutely observed book about one of the greatest authors of modern times. Lots to cherish, ugly tears at the end. Wilkins reminds us that good authors always deal with the verities, and the best authors do that with humour, intelligence and a hard-won tolerance & humanity.

A life, three pleasant daughters, and This was excellent—funny, sensible and very more-ish.Patrick's got a life he's happy with, thank you very much. A life, three pleasant daughters, and a house with...potential. Sure, his wife's walked out on the whole family, his kids are pushing for a puppy and for him to date, and he's having inconvenient dreams about the man he walked away from 15 years ago. But still. It's all good. I really enjoyed this long-set up, mainly because the children are (if not completely believable) certainly very good value, and it's good to see the familial respect (which goes both ways) behind the top-quality snark.Matt's re-entrance into this more-than-OK life is just as jarring for the reader as for Patrick, blind-sided by the scheming charm offensive that's immediately blasted at him. Matt is not altogether sympathetically portrayed to begin with: there's a touch of the entitled force-of-nature to him & the second half of the story shows his gradual rehabilitation. I loved the way that the MCs' coming together was shown through their music, both symbolically (they write a song together) & physically (in sharing a piano stool). The story's predominantly from Patrick's POV, and I was relieved that Ainsley North allowed him to be mature about the whole Matt-barging-in thing. There's a tendency in second-chance stories for the POV MC to waffle around, to be uber-silly and teenager-y, to allow themselves to be pushed about. Fortunately, Patrick doesn't oblige. He's in his 30s, he's an awesome father & has his own successful career: he doesn't revert to stupid dramatics, but stands his ground. At least for a bit—the second half of the book moves very much faster than the first and I'd have appreciated just a little more time for things to work out.If I were going to quibble (which I don't really want to do, because this was hugely enjoyable) I'd have paid more attention to the ""this is Book 1"" bit. I was mildly frustrated that there wasn't more about Patrick's marriage, or what exactly went wrong with Mattrick first time round. Also, because the timeline is pretty short, the ending, while satisfying, is essentially a HFN. Hopefully these dangling threads will get resolved in Book 2 & you can bet I'll be pre-ordering as soon as there's a date.Anyway, I'm highly recommending this. Maybe not quite DIK status, but Ainsley North has taken a standard trope & lifted it with excellent & witty dialogue, a focus on the MCs and just a straightforward maturity about what's going on.PS - the blurb on Amazon compares this to ""Red White & Royal Blue"". Um...no? Other than US-set & m/m, there are precisely zero points in common. Like, NONE. Who writes these things?Cover design by Kelley @anotherwellkeptsecret (Tumblr). Not bad, but the characters look too young, it took me ages to work out that Matt is holding a microphone, not sure why ""Sleeve"" occupies so much space, and Book I just didn't register.

She's an auto-buy of mine (which makes it more than decent of her to let me have this ARC). In ""Be My Endgame"", she's taken the enemies-to-lovers thing out for a really good ride and made it work for its HEA, with a couple of sympathic MCs who don't belabour the Enemies thing past common sense. On top of that, there's a thoroughly 2023-relevant sub-plot involving corruption in high places. It's also good to see input from the MCs of Wear It Like a Crown and Pull Me Under. A particular shout-out for strength of character it must have taken to write the resolution of the final football match - I was actually on tenterhooks. Real spoiler ahead, so really don't read it before you've read the book! (view spoiler)[It would have been so easy for Detand to bring back 1966, but I'm really pleased she didn't warp reality to that extent! (hide spoiler)]So with all the positives (and this is definitely a book I'll re-read), why four stars? Well, I think it's about my reality being warped in a couple of very specifc ways. I read a lot of US-set sports books; I know less than nothing about e.g. ice-hockey teams in the States; it doesn't matter to me whether a team name is real or fictional because I can't tell the difference and I have zero expectations to mess up as a result. A story's about the ""Utah Underdogs"", say, and I go, yeah, yeah, bring it on. But here, because I'm in the UK, and Detand has MC1 playing for Manchester United (a very real, very famous football/soccer team) and MC2 for Liverpool (very ditto), I was thrown out of the fictional world almost before I started. I've got expectations of the sort of players who play for those teams, which the MCs don't altogether fit so I'm holding real and fictional in my head at the same time, in a disconcerting way. It's as if I were reading a book about the Queen doing karaoke: it's not that she couldn't but more that she wouldn't.I absolutely get that this is a totally ""me"" thing—other UKers might not take it that way, and non-UKers may never have come across Man U or Liverpool in the first place, so it simply won't be an issue. The second I'm-not-sure-about-this issue was Alex's status. He's the son of the Duke of Eastwyck. Now I don't know if that's a tongue-in-cheek reference to the 1987 supernatural comedy filsm ""The Witches of Eastwick"" with Jack Nicholson & Cher, but the duke's title was another little detail that derailed my reading. (Props to Detand, incidentally, for nailing ""how to address a duke's eldest son"" & knowing it's a courtesy title.) To be fair, the ""my dad's a duke"" bit was actually integrated into one of the plots, so it wasn't just a ""sprinkle glamour"" moment. And, yes, I know the UK's Premier League is trying hard to increase its diversity profile and you could argue, I suppose, that a duke's son is a member of a minority group... (Even so.)Anyway, long story short—this is an enjoyable read, told with Detand's usual panache. Recommended.Note—this is the third book in a loosely linked trilogy that starts with Pull Me Under, though it can be read as a standalone. If you haven't read any Detand before, then you could start with Bring the Fire which I loved.I received an ARC from the author in exchange for my unbiased  of the book....more",Notes are private!,2,15,1,not set,"Mar 30, 2024","Sep 04, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/198305707-be-my-endgame
