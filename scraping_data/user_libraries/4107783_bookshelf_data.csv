As good as Parable of Content warning: discussion of sexual violence.It took my some time to get around to this second part of the Earthseed duology. As good as Parable of the Sower was, it was bleak as hell - I'm talking The Road levels of bleak - and I hadn't been feeling emotionally strong enough for that.Fortunately, Talents isn't nearly as bad, although there is a great deal of bleakness and violence therein, which I'll come to. I also think it's more realistic look at societal breakdown than its predecessor: I don't think representations such as the Road, or Lord of the Flies, are actually accurate representations of how people behave when society breaks down. While there are some that will take advantage humans tend to group together and seek and provide mutual help. This isn't my rose-tinted view of humanity, it can be seen wherever there are disasters, and in fact when a bunch of schoolkids were stranded in a very Lord of the Flies scenario, they survived incredibly well until rescued.What does happen - both in the real world and in Parable of the Talents - is that most violence is caused either deliberately by those in power seeking to divide and rule, or as a side-effect of the usual societal safeguards being corrupted: think Putin's Russia, or the Colombian drug wars.While in Parable of the Sower, we saw the USA collapsing and fragmenting under the combined pressures of pandemic, economic and environmental collapse, and degenerating into wealthy walled communities surrounded by chaos and violence, in this sequel this disorder is taken advantage of by the Christian America party, who sweep to power with handsome, charismatic president Jarrett (by the way, ever noticed that dictators and autocrats in fiction are always handsome and charismatic, but in the real world they look like Mussolini or Trump?) and immediately start to enforce an extreme Christian Nationalist agenda.Oh. Their slogan is ""Make America Great Again"", and this was published in 1998.I read this in ebook and I don't think I've ever highlighted so many passages in a book, so many jumped out to me as relevant to the current political state of the US.Butler was a superb writer, and can be quite shocking. She writes incredibly powerfully and vividly, and never more so with the matter-of-fact way she writes about the violence done to people, especially sexual violence, both to men and boys but especially, of course, to girls and women. She doesn't go into detail, not needing to, merely stating things like ""I was raped for the first time that week. Twice.""Unlike Sower, however, here there is hope. It continues Lauren's story but each chapter of her journal is prefaced by some notes from her grown daughter - so we don't need to wait for a The Handmaid’s Tale-style coda to let us know that the wheel turned and all was well - and this hope is realised.As I suggested, this is a book about the abuse of power - specifically, like Atwood's novel, a warning about religious extremism - but also about hope and the idea of a secular humanist ""religion"" focusing on unifying our species on greater things.I'm not sure about that latter.

And I read the audiobook, performed by Meryl Streep, which is as good as you would imagine it would be.The narrator, Lara, is always telling us that this isn't the story of the movie star Peter Duke that her girls want to hear, and she is absolutely correct. It is her story, it is the story of her life, her ambition, her choices and mistakes and wrong turns and finding exactly where she needs to be.This is a novel that made me smile so widely my face hurt - the beauty of the writing and the humanity of the characters.

What's more, her writing is both clear and engaging in a way that ensures I understand it, on a non-mathematical, layman's level at any rate.And it is this delivery that takes this to a five-star read. The author - despite her insistence that ""space is easy, words are hard"" - finds a balance between being very informal and very precise and informative, that really got across her passion for the subject in a way that reminded me somewhat of Helen Czerski, perhaps. This was certainly aided by Dr Smethurst's own reading of the audiobook, which is extremely lively and engaging which leads to believe she'd be an excellent lecturer, and I see that she is a science communicator on Youtube and a podcaster. Yes, I will be subscribing.Very highly recommended or anyone interested in astrophysics, who isn't already an expert....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 15, 2024","Mar 17, 2024","Oct 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61391669-a-brief-history-of-black-holes

She also bring her personal relationship with books and stories in occasionally, giving the whole the distinct feel of a passion project.If I were to have one criticism, it is a little Eurocentric; while the Eastern civilisations are referenced occasionally, it stands out that she refers to ""the first universities in Bologna and Oxford"", although there were several centuries after the first Islamic institutions, and completely skips over China in mention of the invention of paper and printing.Still, a remarkable exploration and a great read.One thing that stands out is that she brings to notice in several sections the sheer unlikeliness of any written works surviving from antiquity - due to the fragility of the media, the scarcity of copies, or the active eras of destruction of either certain or all written works (particularly striking is the mention of a scholar on holiday in Brighton realising the toilet paper he had been provided was sheets from an important and long-lost influence on Shakespeare) and it brough to mind with fresh thankfulness Carl Sagan's great words:“What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.""...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,Oct 2023,"Nov 26, 2023","Oct 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63027744-papyrus

The previous book of hers I read, 84K, was something of a departure as it is one of the bleakest novels I've ever read but was still brilliant.When I saw that she was tackling Greek mythology, I was a little surprised but very intrigued. There has been something of a spate of works recently focussing on ancient Greece - from the fairly straight-forward retellings of Stephen Fry to the more novelistic approaches of Natalie Haynes, Madeline Miller, Pat Barker, and others - and I was interested to see what North would do.Wow.This is totally unlike anything of hers I've read, and I think is my book of the year to date - in a year in which I've read the likes of The Essex Serpent, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, Ghostwritten, Philip Pullman's The Secret Commonwealth, and Hilary Mantel's Thomas Cromwell trilogy.North's writing, always excellent, here is simply extraordinary.We are in Ithaca, the seat of Odysseus' kingdom in the 18th year of his absence. His wife, Penelope, is besieged by suitors who, believing her husband must be dead, are vying for her hand and the kingdom. Under the laws of hospitality, she must not only put up with them but make them all welcome, home and feast them, while diplomatically spurning all advances. Not only does she believe Odysseus to still be alive, she knows that showing favour to one will cause the enmity of the rest, and possibly war.In addition, each full moon brings pirates raiding the shores of the island, plumed like Illyrian barbarians but armed with Greek swords.We are told the story by Hera, queen of the gods, initially with hilariously acid wit, but with increasing despair and compassion as the story progresses.This POV is vital. As with many of the other retellings, this is a feminist one. Before being cast as the shrewish, scheming wife of Zeus, Hera was the goddess of the hearth and the home and hence of hospitality, of mothers and childbirth and fertility. Penelope is one of the three great queens born of Sparta - Helen, who chose love; Clytemnestra, who chose power and to rule as a man while her husband was conquering Troy; and she herself is wise enough to know that she must balance the forces and desires and men and politics, or else see her home, her son, her life destroyed.And she must do so without giving the slightest inkling that she is plotting, that she is in any way in control, sitting in silence behind her loom as the men of Ithaca - those too old to have gone to war - and the unwelcome suitors think they are running things.Here the author picks up on something about the Greek tales and what we know of ancient Greek culture: the only immortality is to be remembered by the poets, and so only great acts of which the poets will sing are worthy. That is, war and killing. Man's work.""But what of the wives and the mothers?"" Hera asks Athena at one point. Athena is nonplussed.""The mothers?"" responds the goddess of war, not even trying to hide her scorn. ""Who gives a fuck about the mothers?""The next volume has just been published (I think it may be a trilogy) and I cannot wait to continue.

We follow the changing power dynamics between and within each group as the conflict escalates, and the bodycount skyrockets.A warning: I think this may be the most brutal novel I have ever read. Somehow, Winslow manages to prevent the repetition of torture, of the deaths of faceless dozens and individuals we have grown to know well, from becoming numbing. At one point Pablo, a Juarense journalist, thinks to himself that he has seen thousands of corpses and is brought up short by the realisation that this is in no way an exaggeration.Don Winslow has written another book that is at the same time a superb thriller along with an examination on the horrors of the illegal drugs trade and the effects it has on both the societies and those involved, by choice and otherwise.I'll definitely need a palate cleanser or three before the third volume....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Aug 14, 2023","Sep 30, 2023","Aug 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23602561-the-cartel

We don't learn about him in school in the UK - as with many places, the way we learn history is quite parochial, focusing on our own history and the things that we want to see directly impacting upon it, and Carolus Magnus really didn't do so, directly.And Britain is probably the only part of Europe for which that's true.Only a generation or two from Teutonic War Band chieftain, he built an empire that included most of modern Germany and France, Italy, and much of the surrounding countries. He was central in both stopping the Islamic Umayyad expansion beyond Iberia and Hunnish invaders from the East, as well as building a culture of art and learning that the term The Dark Ages does a grave disservice to.This book is an excellent overview, doing a wonderful job of placing Carl in his context - of descent, and the culture and religion of the time - and also of giving us a view of the economic, social and even technological forces along with the personal and political....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 14, 2023","Aug 16, 2023","Aug 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53808443-the-emperor-charlemagne

Her characterisation and prose are excellent, with wonderfully constructed, humane stories.I confess that when I saw The Half Life of Valery K in the Audible sale I almost passed on it; the story seemed so very unlike her usually alternate-history, steampunk tales I was unsure if it would be my kind of thing.I couldn't have been more wrong.Genius biologist Valery Kolkhanov is taken from the Siberian Gulag in which he's been imprisoned for six years and taken to work at the Closed City nicknamed City 40, or Chelyabinsk 40 - a secret city containing an even more secret atomic research facility - where he begins to discover some terrible mysteries.Pulley advances the plot with a huge amount of skill, whilst revealing the back-story of both Valery and local KGB colonel Shenkov. The novel is very dark and often very tense, but with wonderful touches of humour and the whole thing is carried by the utterly charming character of Valery; funny, outspoken to the point of rudeness and even idiocy, brilliant but naïve.Similarly to the superb TV show Chernobyl, Pulley explores what it means to live in a totalitarian state where making waves is likely to get you shot but, being a novel, delves far deeper into the psychological effects of living under constant fear.The novel is not faultless - some of the details are patchy, such as references to Land Rovers, but this is a truly excellent novel, I think Pulley's best to date.Oh, and while the characters and their interactions are fictional, the rest is true.

At its surface, this novel takes the same concept as Claire""Ideas are wilder than memories.""And, as we know, there are only a finite number of ideas. At its surface, this novel takes the same concept as Claire North's The Sudden Appearance of Hope; as with that titular character, Addie has the ability/curse that she slips immediately from people's memories the moment she is out of their sight. However, each author takes that seed of an idea and takes it in an entirely different - and equally wonderful - direction.In rural France 1714, Adeline knows that, while the old gods can be beseeched, she should never pray to the gods that only answer after dark - but, in extremis, to avoid an unwanted marriage, in her desperation she throws her wish to any gods who will listen, and begs for freedom from the small life awaiting her.Addie's invisibility is more extreme that Claire North's Hope; Addie cannot even leave marks in the world - any words she writes immediately evaporate, even her footprints in snow rebound as though she was never there - so she begins to live as a muse, attaching herself to artists so that over time, even though they forget her each day, she imprints herself in their paintings, their sculptures, their songs.Alongside this thread is the three-and-quarter century contest between Addie and the entity that granted her wish (""I am older than your god, or your devil""); in exchange for freedom, she has promised her soul, to be presented when she has had enough of living this unseen, unremembered, solitary life.But Addie is far stronger, far more engaged, far cleverer than this embodiment of darkness could ever appreciate.Very much a modern fable, this novel explores freedom and connection, art and belonging. Schwab is a fine writer.I only have two minor gripes. The first, something that should have been picked up in editing, are two occasions when it is stated that Addie speaks Swiss. There is no such language, the tongues of that country being French, German, Italian, and Romansh. The other point is something that I cannot help being somewhat irked by, that we encounter great artists - Beethoven and Frank Sinatra among others - who have literally sold their souls for success. Yes, I know this is metaphor, but I can't help but bridle whenever presented with the idea that humans owe their talent to divine or diabolical favours rather than their own capacity and hard work.Schwab has been on my radar for some years and, on the strength of this, I'll certainly be reading more of her work....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 18, 2023","Jun 22, 2023","Jun 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50623864-the-invisible-life-of-addie-larue

GR s are almost all 5 stars.And I just don’t get it. Yes, there are some extremely interesting ideas contained therein but, while I can forgive a lot if the ideas are interesting enough, I found the writing just poor. Ideas expressed in the worst sort of exposition and info-dump by characters with no noticeable characterisation, who don’t talk, behave or react in any way remotely like real people.It is possible that some of this is cultural, or an issue of translation, as I’ve heard others suggest. I don’t think the former is the case – it isn’t a problem I’ve had before, reading literature from many nations and all continents – and without further knowledge the translation has to be taken as accurate.I especially struggled with the final book, perhaps as it as long as the other two put together, but there were certainly other factors. One was a weird sexism that crept in, which I found a surprise given the prominent roles played by women in the earlier parts, but the author seems to lean into a strange gender essentialism that I found jarring, especially a section where the whole male population of Earth is painted as being feminised – this specifically being equated with being weak and ineffective – in a process that is pinpointed as started several hundred years before “in the 1980s”. If this was meant to be satire, it missed the mark.A note on the audio. I’d originally read the Three Body Problem but, such was the praise heaped upon it, I decided to try again, and picked up the audio books. This may have been a mistake, as the reader did not do a good job. I use that phrasing advisedly, as I think even a good reader would have struggled, but this one seemed to lean into the clunkiness of the writing and especially the dialogue to a level that was frankly painful.So, it clearly is “just me”. I won’t be persuaded that these are in any way good books, but I wouldn’t entirely dismiss them. There is some value here.

Each of these stories is a perfect little gem in which she explores characters and ideas and relationships - whether it is the wealthy Igbo student and the poor Hausa market-stall holder hiding together from a riot in A Private Experience, the diverse group of African authors gathered together for workshop on African literature organised by a white Englishman in Jumping Monkey Hill or The American Embassy where a women is seeking asylum in the US following a tragedy.Some of the best of them are slice-of-life tales that explode with a sudden, surprising ending. The final story, The Headstrong Historian falls somewhat into the category, although is quite different to the others, set initially in a late 19th Century West Africa coming under colonial rule (while all the others are set in the present), it shows the deliberate destruction of local culture by force, education and making assimilation attractive - but with a surprising fall out generations later.Many of the pieces share themes - the immigrant experience. or the sudden realisation of inequality and power, or the revelation of distrust or misogyny or a strength or freedom that someone didn't know they possessed.Adichie is an astonishingly good author, writing with both power and subtlety. She paints character and setting and situation with both sensation and internal life so as to make them utterly real. It is the kind of writing that makes you forget you are reading.This is aided in the audio being read by Adjoa Andoh, who has long been one of my favourite actors, and is amongst the very finest voice actors and readers on the planet....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Mar 07, 2023","Mar 29, 2023","Mar 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5587960-the-thing-around-your-neck

I could not possibl(Contains some spoilers for the earlier books)To say that Adrian Tchaikovsky never disappoints is to do him a terrible disservice. I could not possibly hold any writer to the standard of expecting them to completely blow me away every time, but Tchaikovsky somehow manages it.In this third instalment of his “Children of…” series, we see a planet where human settlers are just about holding on, partly due to an earlier terraforming attempt, but are regressing to a pre-information age state – even pre-industrial - due to a lack of resources and the inability to maintain their technology.Our focus character is Liff, a teenage-equivalent girl (years on Ymir are half the length of Earth years) seems more observant and curious than her hard-bitten frontier townsfolk, and is encouraged in her curiosity by teacher Miranda, an incomer from an outlying farm – actually, of course, the character we met in Children of Ruin, or the iteration of her represented by the Nodan parasite entity, here to investigate this settlement along with her companions Portia, Fabian, and Paul (all, of course, masquerading in human form. This will make sense if you’ve read the previous books, which I highly recommend.) Liff is certain there is a witch in the woods, who may be responsible for the disappearance of her grandfather, but none of this is quite what it seems.Tchaikovsky ticks all the boxes. This is a superbly constructed tale that continues his exploration of what it is to be “human” and what it is to the sentient, delving even deeper into those prickly philosophical questions – the discussion of this between the Nodan instantiation of Miranda, the Avrana Kern present in a ship’s computer and a separate splinter of the Kern consciousness, ended by Miranda stating “We three especially shouldn’t cast stones about authenticity” is particularly priceless – taking in themes of the power and importance of story with a brief examination of the weaponisation of fear and distrust in a beleaguered community along the way.Most importantly, Tchaikovsky is a genuinely brilliant writer, capable of vividly painting scenes and worlds and characters while conveying multiple levels of information and meaning, as well as throwing in jokes and references and clever word games that never detract from the story. For example, two of the characters here are uplifted ravens, who have evolved to only work as a split mind – one capable of data gathering and information storage, the other of analysis and cognition – so they are, of course, Odin’s Muninn and Huginn; memory and thought.This is an intensely philosophical, thoughtful and rather melancholy novel, although there is a hopeful lift at the end which – I hope – is setting things up for more exploration of space and consciousness....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jan 30, 2023","Feb 06, 2023","Jan 30, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60850767-children-of-memory

Working again for respected Dr Simpson, they have to cope with bitter rivalry amongst the Edinburgh medical profession, the local gangster and a spate of mysterious deaths.The authors build a gripping plot with fully-fleshed characters in a tale with several parallel themes.Highly recommended....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,Jan 2023,"Jan 04, 2023","Jan 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/44283559-the-art-of-dying

Having denuded the Earth of all its trees and most of its wild spaces and wildlife, we start at a logging operation on the planet of New Tahiti (OK, let’s leave aside the economics of logging and transport lumber from another solar system; this was written in 1972 and that kind of realism wasn’t important in a lot of science fiction then).We start with the POV of Captain Davidson, in charge of one of the outposts, and are immediately in his alpha-male, gung-ho mentality. He see the planet as a resource to be stripped, and hates the native hominids, who he considers lazy, untrustworthy and not even human – making his off-hand remark about raping the females all the more shocking.At first blush, this is a straight-forward parable for the invasion and exploitation of the New World by European colonisers – the othering, enslavement and slaughter of the Native American and Aboriginal Australian peoples – shown with an attitude that, while it is horrifically callous not do many decades have passed since it was commonplace. Indeed, some commentators and populist leaders today seem to hold them up as laudable. There are also clear references to the Vietnam war.However, lying within this blunt allegory is a great deal of subtlety. We see that the natives are seen as lazy by the humans because they have a different circadian rhythm, and live partly in a Dream Time that is real – as real to them as World Time – all expressed with le Guin’s sublimely beautiful writing. At any rate, when we’re not in Davidson’s head, which reads like the completely un-self-aware hero of a 1930s Space Opera, complete with racist views of other humans ethnicities.The book isn’t perfect. The lack of (Terran) female characters is an issue – woman have only been brought latterly to the colony as prostitutes, or “colony wives” – although there is balance in the native Athshe, with wise leaders of both sexes being shown.Especially in the second half of this short book, we see le Guin’s anthropological outlook – although that wasn’t her own educational background, her father was a famed anthropologist and she was involved in his work growing up.Fifty years since this was published, it is still a shocking and important work....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 26, 2022","Dec 27, 2022","Dec 26, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/276767.The_Word_for_World_Is_Forest
