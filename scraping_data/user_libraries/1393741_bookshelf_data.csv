It’s really hard to say how I felt about this book....Following the advice of lots of s and a couple trusted podcasts, I went against my normal inclinations and bought the audio version of this book. And while others loved it, I feel like the constant change of voice was distracting and off putting for me. Every time the reader changes ( which was a LOT), it pulled me out of the story and I couldn’t connect emotionally. Not to mention that for the first 30-60 minutes, you’re just kind of confused.. That being said, I did find the book interesting. I especially loved all of the excerpts from actual historical books, and found all of the contradictory reports fascinating. Goes to show, you can never really know the whole truth of a person. Maybe there isn’t such a thing as “the truth”? Just one persons version of truth? Gave me a lot to think about. The characters in the “bardo” were a mixture of every condition of the human spirit. I found myself loving, hating, pitying, laughing. And mostly just wishing that they could all find peace. All in all, I think maybe I’m just not smart enough to get the point the author was making. I was entertained but not really sure what I was supposed to be getting from the story....Maybe it’s purpose was to demonstrate to me how dumb and shallow I am?🤷‍♀️...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 15, 2018","May 23, 2018","May 15, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29906980-lincoln-in-the-bardo

I didn't really understand most of their motivation and, to be honest, found it difficult to really care about what would happen to them.

I enjoyed going through the journey of war with Mr. March and watching it change him forever. It was powerful and heartbreaking and fantastic!BUT...I love Louisa May Alcott's ""Little Women""! I read it as a small girl for the first time and have loved it ever since. It's such a gorgeous romantic novel that, to me at least, was wonderful in it's idealism. The characters are strong and brave and selfless and good to the core so that even their suffering is beautiful. Realistic? No, probably not. Lovely and inspiring? Yes, absolutely. Enter Geraldine Brooks, who decides to take it upon herself to take a classic piece of literature and paint over it with ""realism"". She basically takes all of the romance and idealism of Alcott's novel and shatters it completely. I'm not sure I can ever forgive her for that.

Ms. Marillier is heading steadily downhill, and it was such a promising beginning. I don't even know where to start--the main character is completely unlikeable, she spends 80% of the book locked in internal debate about whether she's destined to be evil or not. NOTHING of import happens until the last 100 pages of the book. The ""love story"" is nonexistent: we're supposed to believe that these two people have this intense bond but the leading man is not even in 75% of the book, so it's definitely hard to buy. The only character I felt any kind of emotional connection with was Finbar, and that's only because I have residual feelings for him from the first book! And each book is getting longer and, yet, less fleshed out than the previous one. Lots of words, less and less action. Lame.I will say that the plot, in and of it itself, is sound. I enjoy where the story is going---it's just being told in such an inane way.

In this book, she talks about their strong bonds, but I never really believed it. For a group of people that supposedly love each other, they seem to think very little of one another. There's no trust, which led to no honesty, which led to isolation for everyone. And I felt like it was taken to the extreme, once again it got tedious.That being said, I really did enjoy the plot.

I love music. And I don't mean I enjoy listening and humming along to background noise. I mean, I LOVE MUSIC! I was raised on The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel and my life has been one long musical journey that will never end. I absolutely love the way music can transport you to another world and evoke images and emotions that you didn't even know were there. I have been known, while listening to music, to imagine entire scenes and stories in my head. I can daydream for hours about these characters and places that were created from nothing more than a lyric or a mood of a particular song. Specifically, I adore The Smiths. They are one of my all-time favorite bands and I know all of their songs like I know the faces of my children. So, to me, the concept of this book was brilliant! If I was rating the book on just the concept, it would easily be 5 stars. Each short story inspired by a certain Smiths song. Gorgeous. Each author wrote a little foreward describing their inspiration and evolution from song to story. The stories themselves is what pushed the rating down. There were a few bizarre ones, a couple really sad ones, more than a few disturbing ones, a couple sweet ones...a good collection, but nothing that changed my life or made me want to re-read. What I did love was the shared experience with all of the authors. Even though I may not have daydreamed the same stories as them (not even once really), it was just fantastic to share that love of music and all the places it can take you. I'm so glad I walked into the library and saw this book on the shelf. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 16, 2011","Jun 20, 2011","Jun 16, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7134634-please

It's a blazing testament to the ""American spirit"" of ingenuity and building something from nothing! So well written, Chabon is a master of metaphors and he paints very vivid pictures. He definetely knows how to capture emotions on the page, you really experienced everything with the characters. Don't know if I'd recommend it to the masses, I think you might have to have a little nerd in you to truly enjoy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 10, 2010","Oct 14, 2010","Aug 09, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3985.The_Amazing_Adventures_of_Kavalier_Clay

I really like the leading man, he's brooding and smart and lethal. I also like the leading lady-independent, funny, smart and saucy. Again, I have to say that the books don't feel very authentic to the time period. The heroine's family is supposed to be very unconventional, but I think the author took it a bit too far. Still, I really enjoy the characters (lead and secondary alike) and the mysteries are fun. The worst thing, by far, about these books are the cheesy romance-looking covers. They're actually embarrassing. The books are not at all what I would consider romance, but strictly murder mystery with a splash of a love story. So don't let the covers fool you, these are fun reads....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 26, 2010","Jul 27, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1943742.Silent_in_the_Sanctuary

The author uses a lot of ""sudden realizations"" rather than action/plot/dialogue to progress the story. I liked the first book more than the second, for sure. I thought Count Kalliovski was an uber-creepy bad guy in the first book...then she took it WAY TOO FAR in the second book, it was just a bad caricature of everything that people consider ""evil"".

It was high school, so I didn't really recall much and wanted to read it again. My first and most powerful thought was ""Holy crow, I can't believe they let high schoolers read this! What with all the government sanctioned orgies and all.""As a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Huxley's writing is very vivid and almost over-the-top in its descriptiveness, but I really like that. It made the world he created seem 3-dimensional and real. The scientific ""knowledge"" behind the story was incredible, that alone warrants a 3-star rating. It's completely creative and unique and very well developed.Obviously, the book is totally creepy. Huxley has taken what is worst about science/government/morality/materialism... and magnified it to the umpteenth degree. It's not really meant to be taken 100% seriously, but in my opinion meant to cause us to examine our lives more closely. It's almost scary to see how many things about this fictional society are not too far off how we view things today, particularly in the moral issues the book brings to light. I have to say I thought it was a little offensive to paint capitalism as ""the big bad"", because capitalism in and of itself is not an evil thing. But different strokes for different folks, right?

I didn't love it nearly as much as I liked ""People of the Book"", but I was honestly really enjoying it up until the end. Brooks' writing is really descriptive and emotional and I was being moved by the story and the heroine's plight. Although it's definetely not a ""feel good"" book, I found myself being uplifted by the strength and goodness of the main character. Then I got to the last 20 pages, where it seems Ms. Brooks took some kind of crazy pill and decided to ruin a story that was, up until that point, beautiful in its sadness. I don't want to ruin it in case somebody is going to read it...but in my opinion there was ABSOLUTELY no reason for the book to end the way it did.

There is a lot of romance in this book, much more than I am really comfortable with, and much more than is needed. To me, sex is not the same as love, and it shouldn't be used to try to illustrate (all the freaking time!) how two people feel about each other. I find it distracting to the actual emotional elements of a story.*the main character's quick transition from 1945 to 1743 didn't seem very believable. she didn't seem to have a really tough time believing that she was sent back in time, it just didn't fit in with her personality in my opinion.*the ""bad guy"", for lack of a better term, is despicable and evil and morally depraved in every way. I don't want to give details, but towards the end of the book there are some scenes that are so graphic and morally reprehensible that I found it hard to read. now the good:*I love Scottish men! There are very few things that I find more attractive than a Scottish accent and a kilt (I know I'm crazy). The author actually writes the dialogue like it's being said with a Scottish accent (does that make sense?). So I could really get into the characters and the entire world came alive for me.*the story was really compelling. I just couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. Obviously there are some fantastical elements, but I wasn't distracted by them. They seemed to fit in with the drama of the story and I just found myself being pulled along. All of the political intrigue and events of that time period are so fascinating to me, and when woven around these interesting characters I couldn't help but enjoy myself.*The characters that Babaldon creates are amazing. The leading lady is smart and funny and willfull. The leading man, Jamie--awesome. Not only because he's Scottish (but that certainly doesn't hurt), but because he's strong and good and just. The secondary characters are very multi-dimensional, you really feel like you can see and know them.All in all, I really enjoyed the book.

It basically blew every assumption I've ever had about Queen Elizabeth out of the water. She was not portrayed as the strong, powerful iconic Queen Elizabeth of legend. Instead, she was written as a simpering, weak-minded, undecisive, immature girl who let's her codependent ""love"" of a man make a complete fool of herself and nearly bring England to ruin. The male lead, Sir Robert Dudley, is reprehensible. I must've missed the part of the book where his blind overwhelming ambition somehow turned into love.

Read the blurb. I really liked it a lot. I thought the author did a good job of capturing a teenager's desire to find a ""niche"", ""clique""-whatever you want to call it. I could really identify with Jessie being drawn to the ""nerds"" but still not being sure if she was willing to put herself out there to the judgement. I get it.

I loved that she fully admitted that she couldn't stand her nerdy crush's dorky tennis shoes (there's NOTHING wrong with that) and it didn't make her seem like a jerk. There was a hilarious camping/nerdy adventure at the end of the book that had me laughing out loud for about half an hour. Okay, disclaimers & mild annoyances:1. She mentions that she's an honor student/math nerd about a gazillion times. We get it! You're super smart and like school. 2. The conversations between the teenagers are (to me) a bit terrifying and what I would definetely classify as inappropriate. That being said, I live in a nice little bubble where I like to pretend that teenagers don't talk about ""the birds and the bees"" and say ""S***"" all the time. I'm guessing they were probably written fairly realistically, I just have trouble dealing.3. Maybe this is just me. But I HATED it that she continued to let her ""friends"" use and manipulate her even after she completely realized how crappy they were. Obviously, that situation is resolved by the end of the book, but her whimpiness lasted too long in my opinion.4.
