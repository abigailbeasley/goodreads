Archer follows the sister’s companion, but both he and the guy he’s following are murdered. When Spade seeks to find justice for his partner, he’s drawn into a world of shady characters, all of whom seem to be looking for the statue of a falcon that was made for the king of Spain centuries ago. The jewel encrusted statue is worth a fortune.Spade’s pursuit of the falcon is big-time fun, full of epic adventures, mystery, murder, colorful characters, humor and a glorious treasure hunt. The Maltese Falcon is hardly great literature, but it set the standard for tough guy books and their authors, including Hammett’s contemporary, Ernest Hemingway. For that reason, I’m giving it five stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,2,"Dec 02, 2022not set","Dec 17, 2022not set","Dec 17, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29999.The_Maltese_Falcon

He’s written 39 books; 22 of them feature the hard living, alcoholic cop Dave Robicheaux, who has the heart of a poet, the soul of a true democrat, a will of steel, a deep disdain for racists, and enough demons to fill a hundred books. “Robicheaux,” which was published in 2018, is his best book yet. Burke, who’s still going strong at 82, published his latest book, New Iberia Blues, a few months ago.Like all of Burke’s books, Robicheaux is a series of plots and subplots that branch out as majestically as a Louisiana live oak. It’s set in a southern Louisiana that he describes with a beauty that’s as lush as the land itself. It’s filled with eccentric and lowlife characters who are ultimately tied to Robicheaux’s epic struggles with alcohol and a past that includes a violent tour in Vietnam and years working in the New Orleans PD with Clete Purcel, a larger than life character who always seems to have Robicheaux’s back when he isn’t getting them both into trouble. Robicheaux and Purcel confront a lineup of potential murders that include a local patrician with designs on the governor’s mansion, a mysterious woman who was either the sister or cousin of the patrician, a Mafia boss who looks like ‘a gelatinous heap of whale sperm’, a crooked cop, a hired assassin who kills without remorse but looks like a circus clown and has a soft spot for abused children, a successful writer who bears a strong resemblance to Burke himself, and the ex-con who works as the patrician’s chauffer. Then there’s Robicheaux’s own battle to clear himself of the murder of the low-life drunk who killed his third wife in a car accident.It's all great fun, with enough zany characters to make “Robicheaux” worthwhile, but the best thing about this and every James Lee Burke book is the breathtaking beauty of his writing....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 18, 2019","May 14, 2019","May 14, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35297186-robicheaux

It’s a fairy tale, a love story, a police procedural, a psychological thriller, a look into the sexually damaged soul of Ireland, a literary gem, a gorgeously written book that defies genre.The author of this marvelous book, Tana French, an Irish American who was born in Vermont, spent her childhood bouncing around from country to country with her mother and her economist father. She studied acting at Trinity College in Dublin and ultimately settled there, where she still lives with her husband and two daughters. In The Woods is the first in her Dublin Murder Squad series. There are actually three story lines to this book. The first is about Rob Ryan, one of the two Irish cops who are called in to investigate the murder of a 12 year old girl. As fate would have it, as a child Ryan lived in the same village where the murdered girl lived. When he was twelve, he and his two playmates were attacked by an unknown assailant. His playmates disappeared, but Ryan was found alone in the woods, terrified and unable to remember anything. Fast forward twenty years, the disappearance of his two friends still unsolved, and he and his partner, Cassie Maddox, are pursuing the murderer of the young girl. Ryan, meanwhile, as he investigates, finds himself visiting familiar terrain and trying to find out what happened to his friends so many years ago. Was there a connection between their disappearance and the murder of this young girl?In The Woods is as much about the relationship between Ryan and Maddox as it is about the murder. French portrays Ryan as only a woman could — sensitive, caring and able to form a deep, non-sexual friendship with a woman — something few male writers would be able to portray. In fact, you really have to suspend your disbelief to accept the relationship as French portrays it. But then, it’s a fairy tale, you’ll remember. Ryan’s relationship with Cassie is one of the strengths of the book — at least until it isn’t. While French has written a brilliant book, the ending is quite disappointing.

The idea of people sucking the blood from other people never appealed to me, so I resisted the urge to indulge until I recently picked up a book given to me by a friend, a book called “An Uncertain Place.” I didn’t know the book was about vampires until I had read enough to be hooked by the zany characters and breezy, erudite style of the author, the French writer Fred Vargas, who’s quite a celebrity in Europe, but virtually unknown in the States. Parisian police commissioner Jean-Baptiste Adamsberg is in London for a conference when his Scotland Yard colleague Radstock tells him about the case of a pile of shoes with severed feet in them left outside the gates of Highgate Cemetery, famous for such notable occupants as Karl Marx, George Eliot and Michael Faraday. Adamsberg doesn’t think much about this bizarre event when he gets back to Paris and is confronted with an equally outrageous incident — the murder of a wealthy old man who’s been cut up into hundreds of pieces with a chainsaw and hammer.Yes, the two events are connected, but Vargas sends Adamsberg through an Alice in Wonderland adventure before he can solve the murder and clear away a half dozen roadblocks Vargas throws in his path. Along the way, Adamsberg saves a kitten from certain death, is framed for the murder of the old man by an ambitious colleague, is targeted for murder himself by a young man who claims to be his son, goes to Yugoslavia to track the killer, learns about the origins of vampires and their connection not only to the murder of the wealthy Parisian, but also the severed feet in Highgate Cemetery, nearly dies in the tomb of a suspected vampire. It all sounds very ghoulish, but Vargas, whose real name is Frédérique Audoin-Rouzeau, makes “An Uncertain Place” a certain delight. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 18, 2017","Feb 15, 2018","Feb 15, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9939253-an-uncertain-place

This richly layered tale stars a bitter old woman, a seductive art teacher and a talented young art student who live in Giverny, the home of Claude Monet and his famous gardens. Monet, who died in 1926, also plays an important role in this wonderful tale. In fact, I learned things about him I didn’t know, in spite of a life long interest in his work, a fascinating day spent in Giverny a few years ago and several visits to The Musée de l’Orangerie and the Musée d’Orsay, where most of his works are shown.The story begins with the discovery of a murdered man in the stream that runs through Monet’s gardens. It meanders through the mind of the old woman, who seems to know something about the murder victim, to the brash young cop who comes to investigate the murder. It flows through to the talented young girl, who hopes to win a prize for her interpretation of Monet’s famous water lily paintings, and meanders into the life of the beautiful school teacher, whose loveless marriage leaves her open to the flirtations of the dashing cop.Black Water Lilies is as impressionistic as Monet’s paintings. Just when you think you know whodunit, the book takes another turn, and you’re left wondering what happened. Michel Bussi has created a beautifully written story that’s both magical and mysterious. But if you’re expecting a traditional mystery novel, you’re going to be disappointed. Black Water Lilies transcends genre.

It’s an epic story about Australian prisoners in a Japanese POW camp during World War II, the doctor who commands them and the Japanese soldiers who brutalize them during their captivity.After the Japanese captured Burma, its army needed a more efficient resupply route. They used 300,000 people they considered disposable labor, including Koreans and allied prisoners of war, to build the Thailand-Burma Railway through jungle thought to be impenetrable. Many thousands died in the process, thanks to the heartless brutality of the Japanese soldiers.The story is told both from the perspective of Dr. Dorrigo Evans and his fellow prisoners and from that of their captors. The story weaves easily from the horrors of war to the life of Evans, a decorated war hero and accomplished doctor whose personal life is an inexplicable disaster filled with self-doubt, disappointing affairs and one true love, a love which is ultimately thwarted by tragedy. The father of author Richard Flanagan was a survivor of that atrocity, which took the lives of more than 12,000 Australian prisoners. Flanagan writes in great detail about each unspeakable abuse the soldiers are subjected to, including the interminable musings of one Japanese officer as he chops off prisoners’ heads. I can certainly understand Flanagan’s anger toward the Japanese officers who orchestrated the atrocity. They had an astonishing capacity for rationalizing and lionizing their inhuman behavior. The last part of the book follows Major Nakamura, the camp commander, to his final days. Only as he’s dying does he begin to come to terms with the horror of what he did in the war.As Nakamura lies dying, he recognizes that what was imminent was a battle not between life and death in his body, but between his dream of himself as a good man and this nightmare of ice monsters and crawling corpses.Most ers call “The Narrow Road to the Deep North” a masterpiece.

Hard to believe, but there was just one cursory  on Amazon. Perhaps because it’s the only book the author has published in English. But if you want to add a wonderful novelist to your library, turn your eyes toward Lima, Peru, where Alonso Cueto writes and teaches journalism at the Catholic University of Peru.The Blue Hour is both a psychological thriller and a story of love and irredeemable loss. When his mother dies, Adrian Ormache, a successful Lima lawyer, finds a letter indicating that she was being blackmailed for crimes his father committed. He learns that his father, an army colonel, was responsible for horrible torture during the war against the Shining Path, the leftist revolutionary group that plagued Peru in the 1980s. Adrian barely knows his father, who has been divorced from his mother since he was a child. But after he finds the blackmailer, a former lieutenant of his father’s, he’s told about one prisoner the Colonel spared and kept as a lover — a young girl named Miriam.The Blue Hour tells the story of Adrian’s heart-rending, sometimes heart-pounding, search for Miriam and his attempt to right the wrongs his father committed. In the process, he learns about a Peru that’s a thousand light years removed from the civilized Lima he grew up in, a Peru that’s still haunted by a war that destroyed families and continues to destroy years after it’s over. When Adrian enters this unfamiliar world, he also dredges up some deep, unsettling secrets about himself. Alonso Cueto is one of those rare writers who can grab you from the first page and hold you to the very end.

Capote’s style is simple and unadorned, but his stories are full of marvelous and unexpected characters. One of Capote’s greatest gifts was his ability to win the confidences and friendship of people ranging from his cleaning lady to criminals to the elite of American society.Music for Chameleons is a collection of six short stories, a ‘nonfiction novel’ and seven ‘conversational portraits’. The longest piece in the book, “Handcarved Coffins”, is a real-life account of the hunt for a serial killer in “a small western state”. (Are there really any small western states?) Some of the stories are about anonymous characters in Capote’s life. Some are vignettes of famous people in his life. Derring-do is a fanciful story about how Pearl Bailey helped Capote avoid jail in California. Then It All Came Down is about a jail cell encounter with Robert Beausoleil, whose homicide Charles Manson was trying to cover up when he killed actress Sharon Tate and four others. A Beautiful Child is about a day Capote spent with Marilyn Monroe. Nocturnal Turnings is a confessional Capote wrote about himself.The pieces in Music for Chameleons are often shocking, always wildly entertaining, even if Capote may sometimes stretch the truth to turn a good tale.

Yes, the book is beautifully written, although Harrison sometimes trips over himself and lapses into incomprehensible musings.Ironically, the title story is the least interesting of the three. It follows the troubled son of a Montana rancher through a life of adventure and misadventure.

The first story, which is set in northern Mexico, is appropriately called Revenge. It’s about two lovers who are brutalized by the cuckolded husband, and the quest for revenge on the part of the male lover.

Death, which takes many forms, is a constant presence in the lives of the brothers.The story, seen through the eyes of the older brother, Frank Drum, forty years later, starts with the mysterious death of a young boy who’s hit by a train on the tracks that run alongside the Minnesota River. Frank and his younger brother Jake are the sons of a Methodist minister and a mother who sometimes has trouble relating to her stoic husband’s God.

While living there, I traveled to Machu Picchu, the wondrous Incan ruins which were built on a bluff high up in the Peruvian Andes. I met a Japanese archeologist in a small village near the great ruins. He told me he was going to prove that his ancestors had sailed the Pacific and come to Peru many centuries ago. He was convinced they had established a great civilization in the jungles and ultimately came through the high Andes pass beyond the village and built Machu Picchu as a fortress against their enemies.The Japanese archeologist was just one of many people who believe that ancient civilizations are hidden in the impenetrable jungles of the Amazon. The stories are never-ending. El Dorado, the Cloud People of Peru, the earthworks of Western Amazonia, the Lost City of Z. . .Before I went to Lima, I had spent many weeks in a dugout canoe on the Rio Napo, a tributary of the Amazon that begins in the Ecuadorean Andes. The Amazon was so hostile we spent most of our waking hours battling it. No-see-ums and mosquitoes bombarded us day and night. Poisonous snakes and insects were a constant threat. When it rained, it came down in sheets so heavy it was impossible to see five feet in front of you. Huge logs crashed down from the Andes and threatened to crush our canoe. It would take hours to light a fire, the land was so wet.The jungles were so dense and hostile I was certain that the only way to travel was by water and the only places to live were along the hundreds of waterways that tumbled out of the mountains. I was also certain that the people who lived there centuries ago would be so busy fighting the elements they couldn’t possibly have the time or the will to create an advanced civilization. So I started reading The Lost City of Z with my own prejudices. Early in the twentieth century the English explorer Percy Harrison Fawcett regaled the world with his stories about his efforts to find Z, the fabled city that was supposedly built in the middle of the Brazilian jungles many hundreds of years ago . Some eighty years later, David Grann wrote this fascinating book about Fawcett’s adventures.The book is actually two stories. The first is about Colonel Fawcett, who spent much of his life exploring the Amazon searching for Z. Fawcett made six forays into the Bolivian and Brazilian Amazon between 1906 and 1914. Each time he returned to New York or London, he wrote and lectured extensively about his adventures. By the time he made his last trip in 1925, he was world famous, and so was the legend of Z. The second story, which is interwoven with Fawcett’s, is about the adventures of David Grann, the American journalist who wrote this fascinating book. First, Grann spent many months doing an exhaustive study of Fawcett’s journals and other documents about his expeditions in search of Z. When Grann’s research was done, some eighty years after Fawcett’s last expedition, he decided to follow the path Fawcett took on that fateful expedition. Even though travel in the jungles was a bit less brutal than it was in 1925, when Fawcett, his son and a friend disappeared, Grann’s adventure was every bit as exciting as Fawcett’s. And the conclusion to his story is both surprising and completely unexpected....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"May 02, 2016","May 30, 2016","May 30, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3398625-the-lost-city-of-z

The artist sees a tree fancifully — from the hard core of the trunk, from its roots, from its shadows, its seeds, its leaves, the interstices between its branches, from its possibilities, its spirit, its hopes, its dreams. Barbara Kingsolver is a true artist. She sees the world around her from such unimaginable angles it takes your breath away. In the Poisonwood Bible, she uses all her artistic powers to the fullest.The Poisonwood Bible is actually two stories: the story of Nathan Price, a Baptist missionary from Georgia, and his wife and four daughters, and the story of what happens to the Prices and to the Congo after the country becomes independent from Belgium. The first part of the story takes place in the two years before the Congo gains independence. It documents the Prices’ time in the small village of Kilanga. Nathan Price is a Baptist minister whose narrow-minded insistence on bringing the word of his God to the people of Kilanga has tragic consequences for the entire family. Price’s inability to understand that the only thing the villagers want saving from is Nathan Price is told from each of the girls’ viewpoints. “No matter what happens on God’s green earth,” Rachel says, “Father acts like it’s a movie he’s already seen and we’re just dumb for not knowing how it all comes out.” It’s often funny, sometimes shocking, ultimately tragic.The second part of the book documents the sad history of both the Prices and the Congolese people after Belgium grants the country “independence”, an independence that is brutally thwarted by the greed and cruelty of U.S. and Belgian diamond miners, who have the elected president, Patrice Lumumba, assassinated and the dictator Joseph Mobutu installed with the approval of President Eisenhower, the man with “the clear-rimmed glasses and spotted tie, the broad smile, the grandfatherly bald head like a warm, bright light bulb. He looked so trustworthy and kind,” Orleanna Price says as she looks back at the way her family was destroyed by the blind faith of her husband and the cruelty of the puppet masters who manipulated the people of the Congo.The Poisonwood Bible is in turn riotously funny and unbearably heartbreaking, personal and historic. Kingsolver is at her best in this book, which is one of the great books of Twentieth Century literature.

The withering sun, the torrential rains, the unimaginable swarms of insects biting and jabbing their poisons into any piece of flesh they can find; the snakes — anacondas, which can swallow a man whole; lanceheads, green mambas and a dozen other poisonous snakes; the jungle itself, impenetrable and unforgiving. Years ago, I spent a month navigating a tributary of the Amazon in a dugout canoe during the day, looking for a safe spot of land to set up tent at night while the mosquitoes tried to suck the life out of us, so I can tell you Ann Patchett has done a magnificent job of describing the dangers in her wonderful novel, State of Wonder. Here’s Patchett on the brutal Equatorial heat: “Marina felt the top of her head turning soft as the sun worked into her brain, unloosening its coils.” Here she is on the insects: “At dusk the insects came down in a storm, the hard-shelled and soft-sided, the biting and stinging, the chirping and buzzing and droning, every last one unfolded its paper wings and flew with unimaginable velocity into the eyes and mouths and noses of the only three humans they could find.”Here she is on the mighty anaconda as it tried to suck the life out of its unsuspecting victim: “Easter’s lips were turning blue. From either the weight of the snake or the lack of oxygen he…” Never mind. I’m not going to spoil even an iota of this extraordinary scene for you.As brilliantly as Patchett describes the jungle and its dangers, she’s even better at creating memorable characters. Dr. Annick Swenson, the research scientist who’s working in the Amazon jungle a day’s boat ride away from the Brazilian city of Manaus, is one of the most unique and imperious antagonists in contemporary literature. Swenson was sent to Brazil to develop a new drug for a large pharmaceutical company, but after five years, with no idea about exactly where she is and no way to communicate directly with her, the company’s CEO sends Anders Eckman, one of his scientists, to find her and tell her to wrap up the research so they can begin developing the drug. After Eckman has been gone for several months, the CEO receives a short, cryptic letter from Swenson telling him Eckman has died and been buried in the jungles.Enter Marina Singh, a colleague of Anders Eckman, who goes to Brazil to find out what happened to him. Singh is a wonderful, multi-dimensional character, whose strengths ultimately outshine her weaknesses as she flies to Manaus to find Eckman and bring his remains back to Minnesota. She first has to find Dr. Swenson, who doesn’t let anybody know where her research site is except a young surfer couple she’s hired to be her agents in Manaus. Marina has to wait weeks until the insufferable Dr. Swenson appears in Manaus. With Swenson is the adorable young deaf mute Easter, who was abandoned to Swenson’s care by a tribe of cannibals. In spite of Swenson’s vigorous objections, Marina insists on going back into the jungle with her to see where Eckman died. Once she, Swenson and Easter get into Swenson’s pontoon boat for the trip to Swenson’s research camp, the three of them seem to fall into the rabbit hole. Yes, the story veers into an Alice in Wonderland fantasy, but who cares, it’s a helluva story. Sure, much of the ‘science’ lacks credibility, but who cares. State of Wonder is a marvelous tale, with two of the great characters in contemporary fiction. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2015","Nov 13, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9118135-state-of-wonder

It doesn’t hold the promise of anything particularly unique. But in the blue moon case of Paul Harding’s debut novel, Tinkers, the result is extraordinary. This slim volume is a poem, a finely wrought gem, a piece of magic ripped from the soul of a man who’s vision is so uncommon it often takes my breath away. The story itself is simple — a man who was born and raised in rural Maine looks back at his relationship with his father, an iterant peddler — a tinker — whose life is beset by some unique challenges. But once in a while, a simple story can be achingly beautiful, like fresh snow on a grove of evergreens. Tinkers is just that kind of story.Here’s a description of what Howard, the father, saw on his daily rounds.“The rutted road ran between two mild slopes. The trees that grew on the slopes leaned in toward the road, so that their lowest branches brushed the grass. The sun lowered and there was brightness in the treetops and brightness in the long grass, and in between a band of shadows gathered and held in the skirts of the lowest branches. Howard rode along the track and had the sense that once he passed, the shadows leaked out from the edge of the forest, down the incline and out onto the dirt. Behind him also, along with the shadows, animals came to browse in the grass at the verge, and a black-booted red fox darted across the bright road, from darkness to darkness. To Howard, this was the best part of the afternoon, when folds of night mingled with bands of day.”Then there are the shorter snippets of poetry, scattered lavishly throughout the book.“The river was high after an early, fast melt, and loud. Voices seemed to mingle in the water, as if there were a race of men who dwelled among the rapids.”Or this:“We watched the leaded glass of our windows knit frost into lace.”I keep a copy of T.S. Eliot’s poems by my desk, pick it up when I need some inspiration and open it randomly and read. The words are so electric they always energize me.

The one notable exception was the Vietnam War, which the U.S. abandoned when the tide was turning in favor of North Vietnam and sentiment among Americans was overwhelming against our continued involvement. We left our South Vietnamese allies to fight the war by themselves, a war which ended when the North Vietnamese took over Saigon on April 30, 1975.Until Viet Thanh Nguyen wrote The Sympathizer, Americans only knew the war from American news reports, and the Vietnamese people were all but invisible in those reports. The Sympathizer, a first novel by a Vietnamese born, American educated writer, is the story of an unnamed young Vietnamese man whose mother is Vietnamese and father a French priest. Because he’s a bastard and Eurasian, he’s an outcast in his own country, but his dual heritage gives him one unique gift — the ability to see things from both sides. The Sympathizer is a sometimes gruesome, mostly hilarious parody of American involvement in the war and its aftermath, when a South Vietnamese general, his family and a few confidants are granted asylum in California at the disastrous end of the war. Among those confidants are the unnamed narrator, who is not only the general’s aide, but also a communist spy. The narrator tells his story as a confession written in a Vietnam isolation cell. It follows the General and his entourage from their ill-fated escape from Saigon through the years spent adjusting to life in the L.A. refugee community, where the narrator does the General’s bidding in his paranoid efforts to send an army back to liberate his homeland. At the same time, the narrator is sending coded messages to Man, his communist handler in Vietnam, telling him all the General’s plans. Nguyen’s ultimate goal with The Sympathizer seems to be to confirm the futility of the war not only for the U.S., but also for the Vietnamese people, both North and South. But the most brilliant takes in the book are about the people who walk its pages. Here’s Ms. Mori, a secretary at the California college where the unnamed narrator gets a job after he’s evacuated from Vietnam. She’s discussing a conversation she had with the chairman of the Department of Oriental Studies, where they both work.""When he interviewed me, he wanted to know whether I spoke any Japanese. I explained that I was born in Gardena. He said, Oh, you Nisei, as if knowing that one word means he knows something about me. You’ve forgotten your 	culture, Ms. Mori… For a long time I felt bad. I wondered why I didn’t want to learn Japanese…why I would rather go to Paris or Istanbul or Barcelona than Tokyo. But then I thought, Who cares? Did anyone ask John F. Kennedy if he spoke Gaelic and visited Dublin or if he ate potatoes every night or if he collected paintings of leprechauns?""Then there’s his take on the Auteur, a Hollywood director making a film about the Vietnam War. The narrator is hired as a consultant, ostensibly to verify the authenticity of the Vietnamese characters. But as he sits in the famed Auteur’s office, he’s “flummoxed by having read a screenplay whose greatest special effect was neither the blowing up of various things nor the evisceration of various bodies, but the achievement of narrating a movie about our country where not a single one of our countrymen had an intelligible word to say.” Nguyen manages to thoroughly eviscerate the great Auteur, who’s based on a well-known director who created one of Hollywood’s all-time top movies.Nguyen’s greatest achievement in The Sympathizer is getting us American-born readers to see that red is not necessarily red when seen through a different pair of eyes. It’s a great addition to American literature. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Sep 18, 2015","Sep 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23168277-the-sympathizer

On the flip side of that coin, sometimes I’ll come across a book that has such great dramatic tension, or whose characters are so compelling — or both — that I can’t put it down. Stieg Larrson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is like that. Written in a very prosaic style, but keeps you on the edge of your seat from first page to last. Unfortunately, All the Light We Cannot See doesn’t do that.Anthony Doerr knows how to put sentences together as well as anyone writing today. And he knows a lot about a lot of arcane things: radios, how electricity works, snails on the beach, diamonds, blindness, Hitler Youth, birds, the sexual dimorphism of Caribbean volutes. But facts don’t always make for good fiction.The novel is set in occupied France during World War II. It’s actually two separate stories, one from the French side of the war, the other from the German. Marie-Laure is a Parisian girl who becomes blind at age six, and is taught to live with blindness by a loving father. She and her father are forced to leave Paris during the German occupation. The father, who works in the Museum of Natural History, is entrusted with a valuable antique diamond that the curators want to keep from the Nazis. Legend has it that the person who holds the diamond will live forever, but terrible things will happen to everyone around that person. The father and daughter end up in St-Malo, a coastal town where Marie-Laure’s eccentric uncle lives. Once there, terrible things do indeed happen.Werner Pfennig is a German orphan whose instinctive brilliance with radios puts him in a unique position during the war. Werner, whose father died in the coal mines, grows up in an orphanage in the mining town of Zollverein. At the age of twelve, he’s chosen to join the Hitler Youth. His skills with radios keeps him out of danger not only during the years of brutal training, but also when he’s recruited to join the regular army.The story follows the two young people to the end of the war, where they meet in the one compelling part of the book. Alas, though, it’s all over before you can say “All the Light We Cannot See,” and the ending is truly unsatisfying.For all its virtues, All the Light We Cannot See lacks passion and dramatic tension. As charming as the two major characters should be, they’re not compelling enough to make me fear for them or cry for them. There’s something mechanical about the way Doerr presents them to us.

But unlike a lot of writers who visit the seamier side of life, writing about crime and street life in the big city comes naturally for Price. He was born in a housing project in the Northeast Bronx in 1949 and grew up there. He was lucky enough to be accepted into the prestigious Bronx School of Science, which gave him a taste of a life far removed from the hardscrabble streets of New York. Some of the nation’s finest scholars and scientists cut their teeth at Science.Price writes about what he knows, from his first book, The Wanderers, to Lush Life, a book that begins as a murder investigation on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, but ultimately becomes so much more. Eric Cash, a restaurant manager and would-be writer, and his new bartender, Ike Marcus, are walking Ike’s drunken friend, Steven Boulware, home from a night of barhopping when a shot is fired and Ike is killed.The nexus of the story — who shot Ike? — seems simple enough to the two detectives who interrogate Cash about the details of the crime. Cash contradicts himself so much they’re sure he did it. However, from that point on, the story becomes far more complex, soaring like the high rises that are about to replace the decaying Lower East Side tenements and housing projects that have been home first to poor European immigrants, then to even poorer blacks and Latinos, and now to the artsy types who are gentrifying the area. Lush Life quickly moves beyond a murder investigation and becomes one story layered over another over another. The story of Matty Clark and Yolanda Bello, the cops who interrogate Eric Cash and ultimately try to track down the real killer. (Cash’s interrogation by Clark and Bello is a masterpiece of inner city dialogue.) The story of Cash himself, who turns out to have a lot of unfulfilled dreams and an unfinished manuscript in his digs. The story of Ike Marcus, who was as cocky in death as he was in life. (“You picked the wrong guy,” he tells the two black muggers, one of whom turns around and shoots him.) The story of Tristan, a teen from the projects who’s stuck in an abusive home taking care of his younger siblings when he’d rather be on the streets hustling for the local drug king. The story of Billy Marcus, Ike’s father, whose grief is so tangible Matty Clark ends up letting him tag along as he looks for the killer.The only thing lush about Lush Life is Price’s writing. Price has a special affinity for the way cops talk; the most brilliant passages are cop-to-cop and cop-to-perp conversations. Ironically, he saves his most acid observations for the Bohemes, the artsy types who are pushing the poor people out of their shabbily feathered nests. Put it all together and you have a colorful patchwork quilt of the Lower East Side at a time of transition. Price gives us a unique and lush look at one neighborhood in the world’s greatest city. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 16, 2015","Jun 17, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1862313.Lush_Life

No matter how monstrous he gets, you’re captivated by him, always rooting for him. Theo Decker, the protagonist of The Goldfinch, could have been an antihero, but it’s difficult to find anything heroic about him. He could have been a modern day Tom Sawyer, but all his adventures are chaotic and uninspiring. Theo is an alcoholic, a junkie, a whiner, a nihilist, a con man, stumbling through life in a chemical haze. He can be charming, you can feel sorry for him, you can even root for him, but he never rises to the level of heroic.The Goldfinch is Theo’s story, from age thirteen, when he loses his beloved mother in a terrorist bombing in Manhattan, to his mid-twenties, when he’s traveling the world trying to make amends for the crimes he’s committed. After his mother dies, he’s taken in by the Park Avenue family of a schoolboy friend because his feckless father is busy gambling in Vegas with his new girlfriend. (Tartt has a great eye and ear for the snobby Manhattan social set.)When Theo’s father finally takes a breather from his gambling long enough to come fetch his son, Theo’s Las Vegas adventure begins. Here he meets Boris, a Russian kid whose mother has also died, a kid who also has a less than ideal father. Boris introduces Theo to drugs and a world far removed from the world he knew under his mother’s protective wing. Theo manages to keep his mother’s memory alive with an unlikely memento: a small painting of a goldfinch he took from the site of the terrorist bombing that killed her. The painting, which at first is a source of comfort, ultimately becomes one of many sources of trouble for Theo, whose life becomes more and more reckless as he ‘matures’.Tartt’s writing can at times be breathtaking: “As I moved about through the stagnant silences, the pools of shadow and deep sun, the old floors creaked underfoot like the deck of a ship, the wash of traffic out on sixth Avenue breaking just audibly against the ear.” It can also at times be unbelievable, incomprehensible and full of clichés, so overwritten it was difficult for me to slog through to the end. Tartt could have lopped off 300 of The Goldfinch’s 784 pages and come up with an entertaining adventure/mystery novel, but too often she seems to be writing without much regard for the story, veering off into long asides about making antique furniture, eating, drugs, you name it. The Goldfinch is like a beautiful child that Tartt keeps feeding until it’s gross and overweight, with unsightly fat hanging off its limbs....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,May 2015,May 2015,"May 01, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

He writes beautifully about both in The Painter. But the tale interwoven between Heller’s musings on art, nature and fly fishing is something else again.The protagonist of The Painter, Jim Stegner, is a successful Colorado artist. Stegner makes his living by painting, but painting is, more significantly, the way Stegner tamps down the anger that rages inside him. He’s a tornado, wreaking havoc wherever he goes. The story begins peacefully enough, with Stegner spending his days painting his beautiful young model, fly fishing and musing about poetry. It takes a wild turn when he’s out fishing one afternoon and comes across a man viciously beating a horse. Stegner’s trouble begins when he intervenes and incurs the wrath of a man who’s even angrier and more dangerous than he is. Heller is a good writer. Good enough to almost make me believe Stegner is real. Stegner is so arrogant, so self absorbed, I don’t know how he gets through his days without breaking an arm trying to pat himself on the back. But then, he obviously has reason to be proud of himself. After all, every beautiful woman on the planet is attracted to him.(Note to myself: try not to make your protagonists so macho, so irresistible to women that you make your readers sick.)Heller strings words together quite beautifully. However, he has created a story that stretches his credibility and the credibility of his characters. Without giving away the end game, let me just say that The Painter stretches suspension of disbelief beyond the breaking point.

Especially one as inscrutable and vilified in the U.S. as Vladimir Putin.Well, Jennifer Ciotta pulls it off magnificently. I Putin is actually written both from Putin’s perspective as he dictates his memoirs to his fictional personal aide Gosha Golubev and from the perspective of Gosha himself. It’s a sometimes delightful, sometimes unsettling look at the private life of a man who is usually portrayed in the U.S. as a megalomaniac, a dictator, a ruthless imperialist. Much of the book’s charm comes from the portrayal of Gosha, a humble kid who never does understand how he became the personal aide to the President of Russia. I Putin chronicles the man’s life from his dreadful early years when his parents shared a one-bedroom apartment with two other families to his rise to President of the Russian Federation. Young Vladimir was small and frail, the perfect target for bullies. So he learns judo, gains confidence, evolves from a poor student to a high achiever, quickly showing that he’s destined for greatness. After graduating from college, he joins the KGB, and quickly becomes a star. In 2000, he replaces Boris Yeltsin, who struggles with a serious drinking problem, as Acting President of the Russian Federation.Perhaps the most compelling part of this slim book is the way Putin handles the 2000 explosion aboard the Kursk, Russia’s premier submarine. Although it appears that all 118 seamen aboard the sub will die under the Barents Sea if Putin doesn’t accept foreign intervention, he does nothing until the Russian people cry for his ouster. He leaves Moscow in fear that he’s about to be overthrown and goes into hiding on the Estonian border. While there, he meets with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who convinces him to accept help from the U.S. and Britain. It’s too late to save the sailors on the Kursk, but it does save his presidency.Although Ciotta’s Putin can be cold and aloof, she’s managed to write a book that also shows a more human side. I Putin is both charming and insightful. It’s particularly timely today, when the man is accused of fomenting revolution in the Ukraine and renewing the Cold War between East and West. I Putin is Jennifer Ciotta’s first book. It’s a terrific debut.

Jhumpa Lahiri whispers, barely audible above the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The Lowland is her tale of two brothers, little more than a year apart in age, who grow up in Tollygunge, a suburb of Calcutta, in the 1950s. Although they’re inseparable, they’re also opposites. Subhash, the oldest, is quiet and obedient. Udayan is charismatic and defiant. In the 60s, Udayan marries his sweetheart and joins the Naxalites, a revolutionary group that fights to eradicate injustice and poverty in India. Subhash goes to Rhode Island to study science. When Udayan suffers a terrible fate in the marshy lowland where they played as children, Subhash returns home. Gauri, Udayan’s pregnant wife, lives with her in-laws because she has nowhere else to go. Subhash sees how she’s treated, and decides he owes it to his brother to care of her.Although Guari doesn’t love Subhash, she feels trapped by her culture and her circumstances. So she accepts his marriage proposal and invitation to go to Rhode Island with him. Once there, Guari struggles to adjust to her new relationship and her new country, neither of which she chose with complete freedom of will. Her unhappiness, her inability to move forward, becomes apparent just before her daughter is born. She and Subhash are walking on the beach, talking about the soon-to-be-born child.Your brother was supposed to be here… This child should have been his responsibility, whether he wanted it or not.I’ll make it mine, Gauri. I’ve promised you that.She was unable to express her gratitude for what he’d undertaken. She was unable to convey the ways he was a better person than Udayan. She was unable to tell him that he was protecting her, for reasons that would cause him to regard her differently.She looked back at the set of footprints they made in the damp sand. Unlike Udayan’s steps from childhood, which endured in the courtyard in Tollygunge, theirs were already vanishing, washed clean by the encroaching tide.It’s all downhill for Gauri from there.The Lowland is a rip-your-heart-out, unrelentingly sad story. It’s the story of a man whose efforts to enjoy a new life in a strange land are thwarted by the unseen, but ever-present spirit of his brother. It’s the story of a woman who’s spiritually isolated, like a ship torn from its anchor and left to drift aimlessly in a hostile sea. It’s the story of a child who is forever cursed by the death of a father she doesn’t know exists until she’s a grown woman.Jhumpa Lahiri is a masterful writer, elegant, poetic, subtle. She’s also a master of sadness and heartache. If you choose to read The Lowland, be aware that the sun seldom breaks through the pages of this mournful tale, and when it does, it’s only for the briefest of moments. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 24, 2015","Jan 24, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17262100-the-lowland

It’s the story of the first expedition to travel from the source of the great river — 17,000 feet up in the Andes — to its mouth 4,200 miles away in Brazil. I began reading it with a huge dollop of skepticism. After all, I knew it wasn’t as romantic as it seemed. I had spent much of my time on the river swatting no-see-ums during the day, being devoured by mosquitoes at night, sometimes paddling for a full day in the blazing heat without seeing another human being, the river so wide at times you can barely see the other side. But I also knew that when you have a group of people bound together under difficult conditions, especially people with outsized egos, sparks can fly. The conditions for Kane and the nine others in the expedition he joined as its chronicler were difficult beyond imagination, far beyond my limited sea-level knowledge of the river. They had to battle oxygen deprivation at the top, rapids that roared through immense canyons on the way down, Peruvian revolutionaries who threatened to kill them, drug traffickers, unimaginable fatigue, the vagaries of nature, and most of all, their own emotions and those of each person on the expedition. The result: one of the most thrilling true adventure tales you can imagine.Joe Kane is a wonderful writer, and he had a unique cast of characters to write about. Imagine ten people with egos big enough to take a journey that no human being had ever taken before, one that would be dangerous at best and deadly at worst.

The others — Tim Biggs, Zbyszek Bzdak, Jack Jourgensen, Jerome Truran, Sergio Leon and Pierre Van Heerden — all have skills that should have made the expedition stronger.

This roman a clef begins in 1977, as CIA agent Tom Miller reminisces about the 26 years he spent in the agency until new director Stansfield Turner summarily canned him and 800 other agents. Most of the characters in The Old Spook are real people involved in real mid-Twentieth Century political intrigues. The action begins in 1954, with Miller’s first job as part of the CIA team that orchestrated the overthrow of Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz. After Arbenz is ousted, Miller moves on to Mexico’s National University, where he poses as a researcher from Tulane so he can infiltrate the growing leftist movement in Mexico. Tom Miller spends much of his career being bounced around from one Latin American hot potato to another, including the CIA’s attempt to have the Mafia assassinate Castro, the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion, the downfall of Salvador Allende and the brutal dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile. Ironically, though, for all the Big Stage projects in Miller’s career, his life doesn’t get really exciting until he leaves the CIA.

It isn’t until 2009 that he begins to look into the reasons, and when he does, he takes us on quite an odd, fascinating journey.With this book, Juan Gabriel Vasquez shows us that he has the makings of a major literary talent, but his style and intent are far different than that other major Colombian literary talent, Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Vasquez writes with stark realism about troubled people. He does so beautifully, with exquisite control, revealing just enough of the unraveling mystery behind Laverde’s murder to lead one New York Times critic to call the book a page-turner, a label I wouldn’t give it. As beautifully written as the book is, it suffers from literary ennui, perhaps like the ennui Colombia seems to have suffered following Escobar’s takedown. All the major characters are troubled. Yammara, the protagonist, is an intelligent man with a prestigious job, a loving wife and a healthy baby girl. But he’s so depressed he’s depressing; he takes years to get over the gunshot wound he received when Laverde was murdered. When he does recover, he’s unappreciative of and insensitive to his wife and child. He’s not a sympathetic character. Laverde, whose life is looked at by Yammara years after he dies, is a more sympathetic, but equally troubled, character. But Laverde, we learn, has reasons to be troubled. Maya, his daughter, who Yammara tracks down in his effort to find out why Laverde was murdered, seems to glide through life as if she’s lost in a fog. Juan Gabriel Vasquez is a talented writer, and he’s young enough he probably has many more books to show us from his inner library. I just hope the characters he chooses to write about in his next book are more heroic and worthy of his talent....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Oct 06, 2014","Sep 04, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16171259-the-sound-of-things-falling

Such is the Kafkaesque tale of Abdulrahman Zeitoun, a New Orleans painting contractor who stayed in the city during Katrina to protect his home and experienced twenty three days of unimaginable duress and, ultimately, injustice. The story, as told by Dave Eggers with an unemotional journalist’s eye, follows Zeitoun through the early hours of the storm, as windows blew out, branches crashed on the roof, and the house moaned in agony. As the eye of the storm got closer, he dragged his second hand canoe from the garage, just in case the city flooded. When the worst of the storm had passed, he looked at the house and felt it could have been much worse. By afternoon, the flood water, which had risen to eighteen inches, was almost gone. He called his wife, who had taken their four kids and dog to her brother’s house in Baton Rouge. “Come back,” he said. Fortunately, she decided to wait until the next day. The next day, the levees broke, and New Orleans was under water again, but this time the water didn’t stop rising until it reached the rooftops. Most of New Orleans, you see, is below sea level. Zeitoun thanked Allah he had his canoe. Over the next seven days, as the city lie under water, Zeitoun roamed the flooded streets in his canoe, helping stranded people and dogs, looking for help from the few aid workers who seemed to be in the city, watching the fires burn all around the city, trying to avoid the murderous gangs that had taken over downtown. On the seventh day, as the water receded, when it seemed the worst was over, Zeitoun’s troubles only worsened….Zeitoun is a tale that could only happen in New Orleans, a city that lives on both sides of darkness and light. It’s at the same time one of the most tolerant and racist cities in the U.S. It’s a study in contradictions, filled with both art and ignorance. When I lived there thirty years ago, a friend knocked on my door one night with clothes torn and face bruised. She told me someone had tried to rape her. I called the police. Ten minutes later two young officers arrived. One of them took a statement from my friend, while the other nodded off on my living room couch. When my friend finished giving her statement, the two officers rose to go. “If it happens again, let us know,” one of them said as they walked out the door.If it happens again…Sadly, I don’t think much has changed in New Orleans since then. For all its charm and beauty, it’s a city that’s being consumed by its own lunacy. Zeitoun is only one small, heart-wrenching chapter in the city’s bizarre history. But if you want to know the dark side of New Orleans, you must read this troubling tale....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,Nov 2013,"Aug 07, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6512154-zeitoun

Like Mozart when he wrote Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, McCann must have been in an artistic trance when he wrote this book, which follows eight New Yorkers of very different backgrounds whose lives intertwine almost magically. Some of the writing is so beautiful it will take your breath away. But don’t be fooled. This is no fairy tale. The story begins on a day in the 1970s when a young street artist tightrope walks between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. His nearly supernatural feat stops downtown Manhattan in its tracks and serves as background to the rest of the story. Much of it takes place in the South Bronx at a time when the Bronx was as dangerous as Baghdad is today. It follows the life of a God-intoxicated Irish priest whose “parishioners” are the hookers who work the mean streets around the Grand Concourse. The story takes an unexpected turn south to a luxury apartment on Park Avenue, where a group of mothers who lost their sons in Vietnam meet to share their grief. Two of the mothers, the wealthy white wife of a judge who lives in the Park Avenue apartment and a poor black woman from the Bronx, form an unlikely bond.After a tragic accident on the East Side Drive, the story follows a pair of young married artists who forsake the New York art scene for a more quiet life in rural Woodstock. It takes a detour to Dublin, where the priest and his brother were born, then ultimately comes back to New York City, where these disparate souls manage to find common ground.

I’ve read most of the novels he’s written since then. His death last year ended a brilliant writing career, but his books still have traction. He writes about crime with the best of them, but if there was a book genre called ‘entertainment’, I’d put him there, right at the top. Leonard will sacrifice anything, especially proper writing, in his efforts to entertain. “I try to leave out the parts readers tend to skip,” he once said.Many critics cite Get Shorty and Rum Punch as his best, but you could pick almost any of them; he never wrote a bad one. Pagan Babies is right up there with the best. Leonard’s main characters are always rogues and con men, and Pagan Babies stars one of the great rogues of modern literature. Match him up with a young insurance investigator who wants to be a stand-up comedienne and you have the funniest pair of scoundrels walking the pages of any of Leonard’s books. Pagan Babies begins in post-genocide Rwanda and winds its way from Africa to Detroit, where Father Terry Dunn meets Debby, the insurance investigator, who spent three years in prison for deliberately running over her ex. Father Dunn and Debbie join forces in an effort to extort $250,000 from the ex, who now owns a restaurant frequented by most of Detroit’s top wise guys. When the head of the Detroit Mafia gets involved in their scheme, the book takes so many hilarious twists and turns you don’t know where it will end up.It might seem unfair to give a book like Pagan Babies the same rating as War and Peace, but given the limitations of the Goodreads star rating system, both get the same five star rating.

If anything, greed has gotten worse over those years. Much worse. Today, Americans account for 5% of the world’s population, yet we’re responsible for 50% of the globe’s solid waste. The U.S. has so much of everything, yet we elect a President who tells us the rest of the world is cheating us, that we’re not getting our fair share of the pie. America has so much, yet some of us are still poor. We have so much, yet we’re destroying the world for our children. Our hyper-consumption of fossil fuels has caused the earth’s temperatures to rise dramatically. Each of the past three years have been the hottest on record — for the entire world! — and the polar ice caps are melting so fast we could soon face uncontrollable climate change. Yet we elect a president who’s blinded by greed, a president who says global warming is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Greed and the suffering it causes have been themes in great literature throughout history. In Greek mythology, greed was the catalyst for Midas’s golden touch. In Shakespeare, Macbeth’s greed leads to his own death. Balzac, Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald – the list goes on — all wrote about greed. But in my opinion, the classic on the subject is John Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath. It’s the story of Oklahoma farmers who are forced from their land by the bankers who hold their mortgages. In some ways, the world portrayed in The Grapes of Wrath, which was published in 1939, seems quaint compared to the high octane world we live in today. Yet The Grapes of Wrath remains the quintessential American tale about greed and human suffering. Steinbeck uses the story of a humble Oklahoma family, the Joads, to portray the plight of thousands of Dust Bowl farmers who migrate west after the great drought of the early 30s makes it impossible to earn a living in Oklahoma. The Joads and thousands of others head for California, where they hope to find work on the vast farms that cover the state. They suffer unimaginable hardships both in their journey and after they arrive. The migrants are treated so harshly by the rich, greedy farmers that Tom Joad and his friend Jim Casy decide to organize them. They’re attacked by the farmers’ thugs and Casy is killed. Joad kills Casy’s killer and is forced to flee. Despite the terrible hardships the Joad family face, the book ends on a note of optimism.

More likely a whimper, a cry of agony, a prolonged series of painful fits and starts. And that’s exactly how the great family saga, The Son, ends. But before that, author Philipp Meyer takes us on a helluva wild ride through four generations of the McCulloughs, a Texas family whose patriarch, Eli McCullough, was captured by Commanche Indians at the age of twelve, and who managed not only to survive four years in captivity, but to become one with his captors.Ironically, Meyer manages to humanize the Commanches, in spite of their brutality, which is often so inhumane they make the Khmer Rouge seem tame. They tear their captives to pieces as easily as they eviscerate the buffalo, which is so vital to their lives. In some ways, they have a great deal more reverence for the buffalo. Meyer goes into great detail about the ways they use every last hair of the animal, not only for food, but also for weapons, clothing and an endless number of other creations.In the end, though, Meyer makes me wonder who the real savages are: the Indians or the people who ultimately drove them from their homeland and murdered them. Eli McCullough, who builds a Texas empire based first on cattle and finally on oil, is every bit as savage as the Indians.The Son is an epic, sometimes lyrical in its writing, sometimes blunt and crude, sometimes difficult to follow because of Meyer’s unusual way of moving from the 1850s to the early 1900s to 1930 and back again — on and on throughout the book.

This is a much more sober man, one who was determined to chronicle the most bizarre and awful chapter in the history of Colombia with utmost precision and clarity. It’s the story of the abduction of ten Colombians — some of them prominent journalists — who were abducted by the drug lord Pablo Escobar as bargaining chips against his extradition to the U.S. Garcia Marquez tells the story from the viewpoint of the people who were kidnapped and the family members and government officials who tried to negotiate their release. His research is impeccable, giving the reader intimate details of how the hostages lived during their long ordeals. He portrays their boredom and frustration so well the book at times becomes boring.His style here is much different than the style he used in his fictional masterpieces. It’s very straight-forward, sometimes boring, sometimes powerful. When he describes the tragic death of Diana Turbay, who is killed by the police during a botched rescue attempt, he lets her provide the details:	“They killed me,” she screamed. “I can’t move my legs.”	She could not, in fact, but she felt no pain either, and she asked Richard to look at her back because before she dropped she had felt something like an electric shock at her waist. Richard raised her shirt and just above the left hip bone saw a clean tiny hole, with no blood.The book shows how crazy Pablo Escobar really was, but how effective he was at holding the people of Colombia hostage. The poor people loved him because he gave them soccer fields and paid their children more money than they ever imagined to do his dirty work. But they seemed to overlook the fact that he also killed anyone who challenged his absolute authority, including those children, four former presidents and even his own lawyer.One of the exquisite ironies of the book is the enormous amount of time and energy taken by Escobar during the hostage negotiations to discuss the numerous ways the government violated his human rights. This is an important book, even though it gets tedious at times, because it shows how a psychopath with unlimited money can not only recruit enough thugs from the slums and bribe enough law enforcement people to hold an entire nation hostage, but also destroy a culture. It should serve notice to Mexico, which inherited Colombia’s drug problem, and is now facing many of the same legal and social breakdowns that plagued Colombia in the 1990s. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 24, 2013","Aug 02, 2013","Jul 24, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16251.News_of_a_Kidnapping

Isabel Allende is as much an historian as she is a novelist. Her depiction of the French slave owners in Saint Domingue — present-day Haiti — is absolutely mind numbing. It shows how human beings can completely abandon morality in the name of economic gain. The way the plantation owners of 18th century Haiti treated their black slaves can only be compared to the way Hitler treated the Jews.Allende’s heroine, Tete, a beautiful slave who is raped by her master when she is only eleven, is an admirable woman, full of dignity and strength. Throughout her life, she suffers one indignity after another, and emerges stronger than ever.Toulouse Valmorain, Tete’s master, is the quintessential despicable character. Even after Tete and her young lover Gambo save him from certain death at the hands of Saint Domingue’s revolting slaves, he treats Tete with disdain and disrespect. When the Valmorain family escapes to Louisiana and Tete is given her freedom, he refuses to recognize the daughter he had with her. Valmorain is at the same time high-handed and weak. He’s terrorized by a she-devil of a second wife, unable to accept his legitimate son’s anti-slavery ideas and is so stubborn he betrays the people who should mean the most to him. This is not an uplifting book, and Allende’s broad-brush approach to her story often makes it difficult to relate to her characters. Seldom does she show you enough of the main players for you to empathize with them — or despise them. Most, even Zarite, are foils for Allende’s broader purpose — writing the history of slavery and its victims, first in Haiti, and ultimately in Louisiana. In spite of that, Island Beneath the Sea definitely enlightened me about an appalling chapter in the history of the Americas, one that’s been kept in the shadows for centuries. This is an important addition to our literary history....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 19, 2013","Apr 06, 2013","Feb 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7005479-island-beneath-the-sea

He is drafted by a pair of CIA agents to come with them to the fictional country of Tecan.	• Pablo Tabor is an awol, drug-addled Coast Guardsman who joins up with a group of gun runners who are heading to Tecan.	• Sister Justin is a beautiful young nun who works in a mission on the Caribbean coast of Tecan.

Robert Stone has written a story that is at times brilliant and mystical, at times unfathomably abstract. He beautifully portrays the lives of four people suffering from the disillusionment and drift that infected so many post-Vietnam Americans. This is not an uplifting book.

That’s precisely what Jeffrey Eugenides does in Middlesex, his epic work about the Greek migration from the homeland to the promised land.  Middlesex is historical in its scope. Its narrative ranges from the Greco-Turkish war of the 1920s to the Greek flight to Detroit and the dramatic changes in that city over the next 50 years. At the same time, it is the personal story of a family with a very confounding biological identity. Eugenides’ poetic touch is everywhere: in the utterly unique way he describes the sexual awakenings of the narrator’s grandmother Desdemona Stephanides in the Greek village of Bithynios and his mother Theodora in Detroit twenty five years later. You see it in the maniacal ride of Jimmy Zismos across Michigan’s Lake St. Claire. It shimmers in his chronicles of the early days of the Nation of Islam, in his description of the brutal working conditions in the Ford Motor Company of the 30s, in the lyrical depiction of the birth of the narrator, in the way he describes the events that spawned the Detroit riots of 1967. And finally, in the fascinating way he describes Callie’s sexual transformation, like watching a tadpole morph into a frog.Middlesex is both hilarious and dead serious. Eugenides has reached the height of his genius in this brilliant book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 12, 2013","Dec 07, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2187.Middlesex
