Once in their new country they remain locked in, limited and trapped. The story follows their thoughts about this new life as contrasted to their memories. Separately, they take their knowledge and use their instincts in an effort to find a way forward. This can be hazardous but always a preferable option to what they left behind. They place limits on themselves while coming to realise it’s perhaps more unwise to allow others to place their free choice, self expression and destiny under the lock and key of others. They exist, both needing to wait, until the moment presents itself to remember who they are and what they mean to each other. To wait is a skill. To hesitate is a mistake. To know when to act - that is their lifetime’s work. ...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jan 19, 2020","Jan 21, 2020","Jan 21, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24887441-black-rock-white-city

And just like these birds this is a story of a man’s migration. Birds know when it is time to move on, expand their horizons and find their way into new possibilities. A man travels many roads stopping along the way in search of warmth, belonging and identity.

Together they hear the heartbeat of the drum and sing songs to lift the spirit and make it soar like the eagle. Here they are, together, reborn to a new day, praising Mother Earth and the sunrise as they welcome new hope. They are alive to all that may now come their way. As they sing, they notice they are joined by others genuinely moved to the feeling carried by the wind.

Parry’s writing brings the events and people to life with all the anxieties, despair, anger and sorrow imaginable. I found the Reverend Taio Kaneta’s description of his experiences poignant and profoundly spiritual. Here is an example of his thoughts - “We realised that, for all we’d learned about religious ritual and language, none of it was effective in facing what we saw all around us. This destruction that we were living inside - it couldn’t be framed by the principles and theories of religion. Even as priests, we were close to the fear that people express when they say, we see no god, we see no Buddha here . I realised then that religious language was an armor that we wore to protect ourselves, and that the only way forward was to take it off.” He would be observed, by the author, sitting apart with one person in private and visibly tearful conversation. Not a one had rarely been more conscious of human suffering. Highly recommended reading on the aftermath of an epic tragedy....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Dec 11, 2019","Dec 13, 2019","Dec 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30335545-ghosts-of-the-tsunami

Could it really be that some people want someone to watch over them and spare them the anxiety of confronting life situations on their own? A one way ticket delivering them from the need to ever have to think for themselves? He writes that we can’t fault people’s sincere attempts to find answers. Agreed. Does this mean that in one’s search they leave critical thinking behind? In one of the interviews he held a member remarked that it is spiritually immature to be angry. I guess that means I must be spiritually immature. I definitely felt anger towards those that released sarin gas on innocent men, women and children. For what? This is never explained. In another interview a member reasoned that killing someone would be acceptable once you were initiated into the highest level - some distorted version of Vajrayana. This affords one, per this man, to fully grasp transmigration of souls. Somehow this makes murder okay. To achieve the higher levels of consciousness the leaders subjected initiates to shock treatments, sleep deprivation, verbal abuse, massive doses of LSD, extreme heat, blindfolds, isolation, inadequate nutrition and something they called the Christ initiation. I can imagine these folks would believe they saw their false prophet levitating after taking that much lsd. Beware those that claim there is only one true way. The interviews with those on the subways when the sarin gas was released became repetitive. I found myself losing track or more accurately resorting to going numb with the horror of it all. The second half when the cult members are interviewed was an improvement as here Murakami at times manages to dig in and ask some pointed questions. I understand this was not his intention but I feel the book would have benefited from some analysis. I was left with many questions which will need to be answered elsewhere. Then again I’m not likely to ever fully comprehend voluntarily joining a cult let alone a doomsday cult....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Dec 06, 2019","Dec 09, 2019","Dec 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17801.Underground

It begins with a mysterious feeling that doesn’t let up until the end. You just know there’s not a character in this story who will emerge unscathed. Mandel reaches down deep into the emotional realms where I kept hoping the inexplicable would become understandable. Much of the writing affected me on a gut level. There are those people who seem to live their lives skating on the surface of the world. Then there are some who become fully immersed in all the chaos and fate life presents them.

Yet this isn’t solely about finding her sister. As one might expect it is also about finding herself. She chooses a direction based on previously gained information and an understanding of what she will encounter. Fiona, from my reading, hopes for an individual resurgence accompanied by a resurrection of her sister, as she steps unto a new path. Kirstin Innes leads the reader in shaking off stereotypes about sex workers in a similar manner that Fiona shakes off the chrysalis she previously inhabited. Although her metamorphosis seems complete for this phase of her life, I was left believing there would be others in her future, just as there were in her past. An interesting view of how we transform and transfix on new horizons. She rejects the role where she once lay down as a victim of painful changes, to stand on her own two beloved feet. Although this could easily have strayed into high drama or simply good entertainment the restraint and realism in Innes’ writing avoids cheap thrills. Within these pages, I consistently perceived the message that life is not our enemy but our teacher. It is all about walking toward your future with a sure step and steady gaze. Once we recognise ourselves in the mirror that self knowing becomes our bedrock, giving us unshakable faith, even when meeting strange new circumstances. Even in the dead of night, on a lonely shore, buffeted by the winds of fate our faith in ourselves can hold.

She takes you in so many directions. You come to a crossroad and she gently suggests sideways options. I could read and go to either side and find a route that served me. I might meander along or force myself to take the direct route. Most importantly, any move felt right instinctively. Healing from loss has no time limits. Marie Howe helps us heal with wisdom based on experience. Her poems will catch you when you feel you might fall....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Dec 05, 2019","Dec 06, 2019","Dec 05, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/206472.What_the_Living_Do

Back and forth her thoughts carry her. Back she goes to the places she knew well, for many were the hours spent there. She drifts and loses time as she re enters scenes of passion, love, loss, disappointment and failure. A complex and flawed human she can now see herself for who she is. Visitors come and add messages to her memories. As she really hears and feels the messages from others around her, and those long gone, she responds, at long last, with honesty. This is not always what others want to hear. Yet it is only then that she can pass on wisely and well. A story of a woman facing her end, naked and unashamed, her true nature revealed. Once an unstoppable hurricane she is finally able to find her peace. This is not an easy book to read for anyone who has sat beside a dying loved one. It is beautifully written and honest in its portrayal of our human foibles and frailties. The melancholy last passage is so realistic it offers a true sense of a life’s end....more",Notes are private!,0,55,2,"Nov 26, 2019not set","Nov 28, 2019not set","Nov 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/130028.Moon_Tiger

It could be a warrior, voodoo doll, goddess, corpse.”Overhead the cockatoos screech as the seasons change. A seemingly unrelated group of young women are held prisoner by a trio of sadistic and unbalanced people. We question why they are there, who is in charge and how long will this go on? The hate that is fueled and maintained spirals into fantasies of revenge and the wish to destroy or escape. This provides a harrowing and complex look at the emotional entanglements that always accompany what or whom is hated. An unusual and provocative book, Charlotte Wood triumphs in revealing where strength may be found and the gruesome manner in which it can be shown. The fiery spirits of women abound to agitate, anger and ultimately inspire....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Nov 24, 2019","Nov 25, 2019","Nov 25, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25876358-the-natural-way-of-things

Linda Bostrom Knausgaard shares the story of a child named Ellen. Children’s hearts can be easily pierced. Once an overlay of guilt is added the results may prove catastrophic. At the start we learn that Ellen’s father has died. She believes with all her being that she is responsible. She says a prayer and wishes him dead. Her wish comes true. The subsequent feelings she experiences confuse and distort her memories. She shows her confusion by refusing to speak. There is much power in this choice. No one is clear on how to handle her tenacity. You can imagine her steady stare and steadfast perseverance when questioned by the headmaster. He can’t win this battle. She’s discovered the ultimate weapon to use in the face of adult chatter. Yet, she certainly has a story to tell. Trapped in her thoughts she begins to rearrange her life. We explore, along with Ellen, where hurt and desperation begins in a child’s mind and where it can take them. This zeroes in to acknowledge what children can experience when parental awareness and understanding are limited. Knausgaard clearly understands how a prison can be created from thoughts and what it might take to break free. Raw and candid in its honesty....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Nov 19, 2019","Nov 20, 2019","Nov 19, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48507788-welcome-to-america

It was as if the author was reciting a mantra about her father’s final will to calm herself. As each page melted into the next there were small hints revealed as to where the story was headed. By page 84 the narrator is angry. She’s hammering out emails to her younger sisters calling them on their self righteousness. She forms an alliance with her brother as the family unravels. Something is terribly wrong. The narrator has voluntarily estranged herself from all but her brother. There are, she tells us, situations which can’t be balanced out, talked over and round. You must pick a side. She finds herself at home in the winter darkness. This darkness erases her and the forest shields everything in a protective cloak. Seated on a downed tree she watches her dog running. The snow begins to fall. In these moments she feels fine and light. For a time, albeit brief, she is without pain. What follows is her endless examination and exploration of her state of mind. Whichever road she travels she is met with dead ends and distressing flashbacks. Ever so slowly she reveals her past. Repressed memories have the effect of a time bomb that ticks quietly but never harmlessly. We learn of her attempts to make an emotional getaway through psychoanalysis. Other times the memories are buried more deeply. Like a series of land mines that might lay dormant, if only. There are many moments of if only for the narrator. As if on a seesaw she will be confidently high at the top with her truth only to be cruelly dropped to the ground when called a liar. Up and down she rides. This is a brutal narrative full of anger, hate, doubt and self recriminations. Self esteem is eroded. Her close friend, husband and children offer support. It circles back round to a question of balance. Can anything or anyone counteract the toxicity of her sisters, mother and yes, father? The narrator exists in a prism of hate. Her past is all pervasive. There is no way to compartmentalise. There is no luxury of denial. There is survival even when adrift in the unpredictable waters of memory. I experienced an involuntary shudder and released a deep sigh when I read the last page.

Are there those that feel as if they’re made for us? For Jake, a strong woman, to choose to live her life on an isolated sheep farm is to try and stay at a distance from her past. She is alone with Dog her animal companion. Her fear creates an inability to imagine, let alone participate, in the human interactions that surround her. Going to the pub to familiarize herself with the neighboring farmers carries far to great the risk of more humiliation and pain. She rationalizes this by saying they all hate me anyway. These moments of insecurity feel endless. She lacks an internal map to assist her with understanding that these feelings could pass. There might be no antidote for emotions so potent. Her fears are capable of dredging up any and all of her worst memories. As her story moves on she discovers a stranger in her shed. Her immediate response is to protect herself. Is he another victimizer or could he possibly be the empathic link she so desperately needs? Evie Wyld looks deeply at just how easily a painful past can maintain a relentless running to yet one more place in search of safety. Written in a style that is both sharply detailed and enigmatic. We are brought so close to the mirror Jake peers into we may occasionally manage to see a bit of our own reflection there. A story of a haunted woman searching for the way to peace of mind. ...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Nov 09, 2019","Nov 10, 2019","Nov 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18142324-all-the-birds-singing

A dreamlike dance in the alienating aftermath of life’s afflictions. Katherine Forbes Riley grapples with the complex suffering of two people. Laurelie is experiencing a disturbance of self. The man she calls the hiker is as well. Laurelie is unable to explain to anyone why she is so tied up, walled off and frightened. Her paintings are where she expresses herself. She is guided by her thoughts but she’s having trouble perceiving accurately. Her internal experience may not be a necessary call for action. Then, one day she thinks she sees something. She’s not sure she can trust herself. Yet she is babysitting a little boy that she must protect. Trying to keep safe is paramount for her. They encounter the bobcat. The little boy is fascinated and curious. She is terrified. The scene intensified as the hiker emerges on the trail. This story maintains an exquisite balance of fear and love. Fear assists one in keeping safe and alone while love can keep us connected even when we face conflicts in our relationships.

This is a memorable and ultimately thought provoking story of perfection as the enemy. When I used to run counseling groups with children I would sometimes get things started by asking each one to name a super power that would like to have. The majority wished to be invisible. Once invisible they became very creative about what they would do and get away with. This story brought those discussions back to me as becoming invisible, in a sense, is at the core of Hope’s narrative. She has grand plans for never being remembered as well. She becomes a jewel thief.

Rescue, albeit temporary, will come for the boy in the bonds ofLife can prove an abiding struggle for children who have been chronically traumatised. Rescue, albeit temporary, will come for the boy in the bonds of a friendship. A friendship that will for a time soar above his terrifying and painful past. This is a complex and astounding look at the internal experiences of the two friends. Tommy, the boy who in anger refuses to succumb to his circumstances, and Jim, his best mate who fully accepts and takes on Tommy’s pain. No one will come out of this unscathed. Time switches between their childhood and thirty some years later when, by chance, they meet again. There is a scene in the story where the abusive father and son also meet again forty years later. Per Petterson’s description of their meeting is so true to life your senses reel. Tommy thinks to himself, “ Then I stood up. No peace, I thought, nothing that binds us together. I refuse.” This is a melancholy and uneasy story. It is a story of the breaking down and tearing apart of humans and the ordeals they must survive. It is a story of people’s capacity for intimacy. The ability to act well is, in the end, all they have.

In this nightThere is a place that exists, rarely glimpsed by humans, where the communication between a heron and a golem will bring lovers together. In this nightmare world of the holocaust the heron carries messages and the golem protects the girl, Hanni. The female characters are exuberant, unstoppable and full of natural power. A pattern emerges of spiritual renewal like an endless rippling river. The golem has made a vow and sealed it with human blood. Throughout the story Hoffman links sacrifice and love. In the female golem’s visions she sees how things will be. She is like, but not quite a mother, yet she holds Hanni to her easing the suffering around her. She is a wild force, a mere visitor created to assist in the continuity of life where it seems only death and darkness prevail. I loved the symbolism of the wolf, hunted to near extinction yet still living on. The heron is the messenger charged with keeping one’s faith alive for an eventual reunion. And, the golem, my favorite - the soulless protector who experiences much if not all of what it means to be fully human. A story that takes you to the peaks and valleys of emotions as you experience the possibilities and potentialities in a time of madness. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Dec 24, 2019","Dec 25, 2019","Oct 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43822062-the-world-that-we-knew

This slice of life story of a family at the breaking point is replete with secrets and sickness. Andrew Porter wraps up the breakdown of a family in accelerating suspense. You want to keep reading to discover if all the broken pieces can ever be picked up and repaired. This family is in so much pain. Each person is trying to find a way past the hurt as in the process, they unravel. We follow along with their introspective moments as they reveal their vulnerabilities. But can they ever translate their self awareness into empathy for others? Clearly this author has done his homework as far as the roles that are assumed in dysfunctional families. One child will act out in an effort to draw attention away from the parental discord in an effort to bring them together again. However, he does this with a twist, with an unexpected and unplanned outcome. Closed doors are opened. Behind one they will find sadness, so blue and lonely it makes them cry. Open another door and maybe find happiness only to slam it shut and move on. There’s a door in each of their heart’s so full that once opened everything comes tumbling down - frustration, hate and love. Always one more door to open. Somewhere in there the perfect life, the perfect self. This is one hungry family overwhelmed by their search for answers. They will either keep running without direction or freeze in doubt. Human drama at its best....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Oct 17, 2019","Oct 19, 2019","Oct 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13326427-in-between-days

It contains all the elements you would expect to find in a gothic ghost type tale. There’s even the concern that the scratching sound could be rats. Flashback to The Exorcist, a genuinely frightening story, when the mother goes to the attic searching for rodents. She gets after poor Karl, the housekeeper, to set some traps. I suppose the possible presence creating that disturbing sound is to enhance the overall dread. There’s a pregnant widow who fears she is “going mad”, a decaying inherited estate in a desolate setting, and plenty of supernatural occurrences.

How stinking appropriate that the opening scene takes place as theyCandy coated cruelties scatter all about with the arrival of a new family in town. How stinking appropriate that the opening scene takes place as they encounter one of their long term residents as they exit church. From here Ms. Hartnett offers up a deep dive into the rotting underbelly of family life in suburbia. Once the thin veneer of respectability is stripped we get up close with two sets of parents and the destruction they reap on the “neighbourhood ruffians.” One father, the dentist, is overly eager to befriend the kids. He is the father of the golden boys. The other is an unpredictable alcoholic who terrorizes his six children and dependent wife with verbal abuse and violence. The children in both households exist in a chronic state of anxiety always dreading what dad will do next. It becomes the self elected responsibility of the oldest children, one male, the other female, to do their part to redress all that is wrong. Role reversal is never fun. The loneliness and desolation they experience in their attempts to be heroes is almost overwhelming. Parentified children take center stage in this dark tale of self sacrifice. The story made me ache with sadness for the little children. Hartnett thrusts their fears right up in your face. This will prove an emotionally heartbreaking and wise novel for those who will find themselves revisiting that mysterious pull between love and hate that lies at the heart of every damaged family....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Nov 20, 2019","Nov 20, 2019","Oct 11, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20621185-golden-boys

Where to turn which way to go to find the crucial missing pieces of knowledge? He wants to understand the border. Against the advice of his mother he joins the border patrol. She worries what this will do to him and what he might become. He protests, seeing himself as a person who speaks Spanish and can possibly offer help. He needs to know. With that, this naturally inspired man journeys on in his new career. Troubled by nightmares, where his internal conflicts are revealed, he continues to search for answers. As time passes he finds himself growing apprehensive of the Mexican side of the border. When people ask him questions about his experiences he finds himself holding back and instead sharing platitudes. His thoughts remain locked inside. Are his mother’s warnings coming true? The wolves outside are howling and the ghosts are calling his name. As I read this I wanted this man to find the peace of mind he so richly deserves. I hoped that he would always find that person, to remind him of the humanity in all of us, that would break bread with him, on either side of the border.

He has seen a bird, a crane he thinks, that is frozen in the river. Will he set it free and afford it another chance at flight? This, for me, was the essence of the book. Men going underground to dig a tunnel and rising to return to thier homes, sometimes. There is a constant shifting between dark and light, being earthbound and flying, stepping lively with elegant balance on steel beams and parking meters. McCann’s writing is beautiful and brutal. At one point Treefrog passes some mothers pushing strollers. He greets them but they look down and hurry on. He is accused of being smelly and dirty. Do others fear him? We see him as a baby at the start of his life. Later he no longer remembers his name and lives in the tunnel estranged from his wife and daughter. His grandfather dug the tunnel he lives in. So this is a story of the cycles of life. Each character begins with hope and enthusiasm. Later, those still alive, look back and see themselves as they want to be again, renewed in another time and place. Inside them is raw energy that could be transformed again, maybe one more time. Maybe one more time to be freed and fly like the crane....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Oct 09, 2019","Oct 11, 2019","Oct 09, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1196017.This_Side_of_Brightness

As the ice shifts and cracks the sea releases a trapped body. This sets the tone for the story of how each character is trapped. They are trapped, in part, by the time they live in. A time that punishes by death those who practice the old beliefs, demands a female always remain obedient and frequently forbids the expression of love. When one is forced to hide one’s true feelings it follows that secrecy and fear take hold. Left alone in her croft Elsa becomes fearful. She experiences strange sounds from above and feels something moving past her in the dark cold nights. Her thoughts begin to torment her. She wonders if she might die from loneliness. The source of her fear is invisible so she searches her memory for answers. Does she hold an experience from her past that is capable of creating this much fear? Without any real experience to rely on her mind moves to superstitions. She tells herself she must be imagining things. If only she weren’t so alone and afraid to ask questions. Yet through her torment and the web of secrecy and lies around her one always discerns love peeking out from the center. Each character loves someone and with this love comes desperation. They love someone so much they will do anything to protect them.

Two young women, superficially so different and yet so alike find one another. They gradually discover that some troubles and distress can be alleviated in learning to share the pleasures of friendship. Together they head off to develop a connection that just might see them through the best and worst of times.

Prisons in the United States are an apparatus for stigmatizing and exiling those who we were once told would be rehabilitated. Then there are the innocent ones who have been tried, found guilty and sentenced to death. Bryan Stevenson writes of his transformation from fear to courage and commitment as a young lawyer to come to their defense. He writes of the legacy of racism and other constructs of power and privilege that continue to exist. The statistics and facts he shares leave one furious. In these institutions of medieval awfulness and racist courtrooms the repeated outcome is an ever growing underclass, homelessness and death. In some states if a woman has been convicted of a drug crime she will no longer be eligible for low income housing for her and her children. This enforced discrimination would envelop and destroy most people. Mr. Stevenson has dedicated himself to helping those locked away and mostly forgotten with his distinguishing attributes of humility, compassion and courage. He’ll have you rethinking your ideas about lawyers. This book brought me to tears, anger and hope.

As she gazes out the window the mother, Myra, sees her daughter being forced into a boat while screaming no, no not without mommy. In a flash she is gone and Myra’s mission to find her begins. Myra and her 7 year old daughter Pearl depart in their small boat facing life on the floodwaters. Myra must learn fast using her intelligence, hyper vigilance and when needed, manipulation. She is plagued with anxieties. She fears Pearl might be abducted or lost. She is distressed that she may have to sacrifice one child to save the other. Lucidity is sporadic. Yet together they are unstoppable, willing to learn, to grow strong and find the missing girl, Row. Myra trusts no one. Pearl, a lively and bright child, seems to have an innate sense of who she can trust. Along the way they encounter many others in this apocalyptic world. As expected some are vile and dangerous while others are simply doing what they can to survive. The trick is to make a quick and hopefully astute assessment of each person along the way and to be prepared for the possibility of good or bad. All the while Myra can’t lose sight of her goal. At times, she looks at her youngest daughter, her tiny figure dashing about and becomes almost half mad with confusion and fear. A story of survival, loss, and learning to understand yourself and others. To truly shine one must find the strength within them. Where will their courage, creativity and sheer determination take them? The path towards finding what they seek is rarely easy.

How could anyone not want to read this after reading their thoughts?Elif Shafak shares that researchers have observed brain activity in those who just died. Some last as long as 10 minutes and 38 seconds. What happens in this span of time? Tequila Leila connects her memories, as she lies dying in a dumpster, with scents. Her sense of smell, still present, floods her with memories of self and those of her five friends. Our sense of smell is so powerful - like a direct line to the past. Our sense of smell can instantly take us to where there was once pain or pleasure. It works without a censor allowing her, in the final 10 minutes and 38 seconds of life, to recall all that has mattered. Why this name? Because “she wants life to run fast. But she’s resilient too. She can guzzle the sour and the bitter, like downing tequila shots.” From inside the walls of a dumpster, as she lays dying, she recounts her life. As a child she held inside her the demand and desire to flee. Off, she is off into the night, with stolen money on a bus bound for Istanbul. She relates an old saying “ he who has not traveled has no eyes.” Call it travel or flight she moves into her next set of memories. Istanbul the city where you can walk across the Bosporus Bridge from the Asian to the European continent and back. Istanbul, where your appearance is political. Istanbul - will this be where she will finish life as a nameless number in the cemetery of the companionless? No marker, no stone. She could become like her surroundings where no one can distinguish her from the ground. Yet there is that group of five. Her five friends, closer to her than blood. Her five friends are her water family. In the end blood is not thicker than water. The water family can and does wash away all that blood. A magnificently realised and tender story that honors those who live on the fringe, those who have been dealt a cruel hand and yet together in companionship find enough beauty, strength and hope to rise above it....more",Notes are private!,1,62,1,"Nov 12, 2019","Nov 15, 2019","Oct 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43706466-10-minutes-38-seconds-in-this-strange-world

You can feel her aching loss. This book, in my opinion, will influence the way we look at schizophrenia.

Nah, I replied, I’m past that. Nope, I’m not. I approached this book with several defense mechanisms firmly in place. Or so I thought. I wasn’t too far in before that recognition set in and all my defenses crumbled. I found the recognition that sees in Nancy Bevilaqua a sister traveler along the past paths, cluttered with experiences, that one had hoped to have cast off along the way. She tiptoed down those same hospital corridors, stumbled up back stairways in anger, and crossed into that place of pain that tears you inside out. She left to put on his favourite blue dress - her mourning apparel - to look her best for him as he lay dying. I conjured up images as I read of a solitary eagle hunting for food or a vine searching for a wall - some kind of support. I was humming a traditional song , “down in the valley, the valley so low; hang your head over, hear the wind blow.” As the waves ebb and flow so does our grief. There are those we meet along the way, those angels that enfold us in their understanding wings and hold our breath when it hurts, till we are ready to once again breathe on our own. I took a walk when I was done against the mild protests of visiting friends as it was pouring rain. I knew that when I came back I wouldn’t have to explain my tears as I’d have the ready made excuse of simply needing to dry the wetness from outside off my face. Because any explanation would feel inadequate. It’s too big a story, far too big for my words. So I find myself grateful that Nancy, dear soul, has done the talking for me and for many of us. She matched the pace of my sorrows. We should all strive to be kind as her particularly to those least among us. There was that last promise. Will you stay with me till the end? I promised and I stayed. Oh, where have you gone to wildest spirit? I’d like to imagine you in some other dimension, still smiling and laughing.

His stories echo along the Amazon rolling out to the Atlantic Ocean....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 04, 2019","Oct 06, 2019","Oct 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34930822-the-third-bank-of-the-river

Nayeri describes the West as “as a mother who once adopted us, the exiles and outcasts, and now needs us to intervene An electrifying essential read. Nayeri describes the West as “as a mother who once adopted us, the exiles and outcasts, and now needs us to intervene as calluses harden fast around her heart.” This is her story as well as the story of the many. She sets out to volunteer on Lesbos and finds the stories of the people there bring her past tumbling back. While working in a “store” handing out donations she encounters the rotten attitude of those who will only give to the worthy poor. Those that deserve it. “Many donors want to assign criteria to the food that is given out...They want to police.” I can recall this same attitude at a place I once worked when people donated food baskets at holidays but attached the prerequisite that the parents not smoke or use their food stamps to buy cookies instead of powdered milk and peanut butter. They had to prove they were worthy to receive charity. This is the classic blaming the victim. The men, women and children in this book have been to hell and back. They’ve had to face and overcome defeat again and again. Although there are those who stand in their way, these people have dreams that are stronger than the selfishness and ignorance of the many. Their stories contain the hopes and wishes that they carry inside in an unstoppable movement. They, like all of us, seek a place of safety. Their stories are also full of risk, hurt, pain, terrible images and harsh refusals. I couldn’t look away untouched by what I read. Oh for a renewal of loving, welcoming and understanding in this land....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,Oct 2019,"Oct 03, 2019","Oct 01, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43835469-the-ungrateful-refugee

Parry is another journalist with an unprecedented talent for connecting his readers to the people in his books. His caring and respectful treatment of this story will remain in my memory for a long time. Parry avoids passing judgement. Neither does he come across as a writer that needs to be seen as noble for doing this. There’s no self aggrandizing here. Rather, we get a journalist telling a story that in less capable hands might feel voyeuristic, prurient or hunting for blame. He reminds us of the meaning and beauty of life and its darker side where mindless and senseless violence lurk. His conclusions about the myriad ways we respond to tragedy, death and the nature of evil made me want to reach out and shake his hand for writing this masterpiece of modern journalism. Lucie will live in all the memories of those who read this story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,not set,"Sep 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8491980-people-who-eat-darkness

It is cold in Hobart and Isla is afraid of the dark. Mother, daughter Isla and her brother arrive with little to their name in search of a new start. As the story begins their reasons for flight are more implied than stated. Once they are settled Isla waits for the ferry and sees a stranger wave to her. Unsure at first, and without knowing why, she waves back. There is something they recognize in one another though they be strangers. There are those rare times when a person enters your life, if only for awhile, yet manages to leave behind parts of themselves you forever hold close. Such is the story of the girl, Isla and the sea going man, Bo. This man shows so much respect for people and nature. An extraordinary fellow not afraid to enter the world of children with wisdom, compassion and vision. He dramatically and positively impacts Isla’s life at a time when she most needs this. Over two summers he comes and goes always careful to leave a trace of himself behind. Through his words and actions he teaches Isla about holding on to one’s internal warmth and light when the world becomes cold and confusing. Then, he will always be with her as she finds her way, no longer afraid of the dark. Bo and Isla follow the circular procession of their time together, alone and together. While traveling to and landing on Anarctica Bo finds he must push himself to previously unexplored limits moving above and beyond. It is In the sea terns, seals, and frozen landscapes that he finds sparkles and glimmers of hope for his new beginning away from his haunted past. Favel Parrett writes such graceful and gentle prose. Nothing feels forced. This book is, for me, near perfect. It leaves you feeling like you’ve been softly embraced with all that is good in our world....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Sep 18, 2019","Sep 20, 2019","Sep 18, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22043013-when-the-night-comes

His body, from childhood, was his instrument of expression. As he learned what his body could do he built a picture of his world. His dance became the mother of all tongues, cutting across language barriers and speaking to individuals on a primal emotional level. Colum McCann writes of Nureyev’s life using vivid descriptions. His emotional delivery adds weight to his words. He speaks the truth with a twist of fiction to make it more entertaining. There’s no expounding dry facts in a dead pan way. The result is a story that is as spontaneous and flowing as Nueyev’s dance. This is about his dance of life with all the sexual enthusiasm and sensuality it contained. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Sep 25, 2019","Sep 27, 2019","Sep 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/110896.Dancer

The thin child at war time has moved to the countryside where she learns to live in the black world of myth. As a way to make sense of the events around her she turns to reading Asgard and the gods. This fulfill her yearnings as she crosses over into their world and forges fantasy with her reality. This book reminded me of being a child first discovering the magic of reading. All those otherworldly and enchanted realms were right there. All one has to do is find a comfortable spot and open up a book such as this and let your imagination take over. This is a truly wonderful reading experience that leaves you with much to think over. A.S.Byatt has given us a relevant and elegantly expressed myth for our times.

A father tenderly guides his son, Pavlov, through the ceremonies of cremation for all those the state denies a burial in consecrated ground and those preferring a fire funeral. They believe fire is a passage and a dance. Its destruction brings renewal. Hage offers a sardonic view of petty rulers, organized religion, government, and war. He wields words like a weapon blasting into the banality of unambiguous morality during war time. Spiked with occasionally humorous conversations, mysterious texts in Syriac, Arabic and Latin, and a narrator like no other. Where his father leaves off a talking dog named Rex, and a war traumatised, our lady of the stairs, picks up to offer friendship and lessons in love. In the end there is music, dance and fire. Lots of fire and the joyful release of the howl as modeled by Rex. As their light forever burns its time for the dead to dance. “ That night echoes of a howl rose from the valley and up into the clouds towards the elsewhere of the stars.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Sep 15, 2019","Sep 16, 2019","Sep 16, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41817567-beirut-hellfire-society

Grief can work as a great divider, separating each personLoss - verbalization being too difficult one turns, at times, to their own system of coping. Grief can work as a great divider, separating each person into their own worlds, a private world of shadows. In this compelling story we learn at the outset that husband and wife are attempting to exist in the war zone of Syria. Family and friends have fled. The woman, wife and mother, has lost her vision. She is near completely dependent on her husband to care for her. She is reluctant to leave. There is the invisible magnetic pull to remain. The pull of a missing or dead son. The man, husband and father, can not make up his mind. Do they remain and risk the likelihood of death or will they place themselves in the hands of smugglers to hopefully get the hell out of there to safety? They carry on in a landscape that is constantly shifting before them. At times they individually fall into their fears, conscious and unconscious. Hope often remains hidden as their awareness of danger grows. They make the emotional and physically harrowing exodus from danger and despair towards a place where the shadows and fears no longer darken their lives. Lefteri writes of the transformative boundaries as in mythology. There is the ever present aching and longing for home - the movement beyond desperate sadness to find a way to try and make sense of the unimaginable. Along the way they are sometimes joined by others, respectful of their moments, gentle and genuinely moved to join them. See the woman, lying close to the comfort of another refugee woman. Their shared comfort is so simple and basic, yet it is heartfelt and that feeling carries on the air, mirroring the cycles and patterns that we celebrate with our loved ones. In that incredibly tender moment of communication, with the rising of the sun, may all readers see a glimpse of those gentle understanding souls, who are always among us as we mark the passage of time in thought and kind embraces.

Tassie enters into the household where she quickly becomes indispensable. There are lots of odds and ends here that sometimes tie together and other times are left to float away into the ether. Tassie approaches life wholeheartedly. She’s still learning these parents and what they want and need from her. She’s prepared to work hard for them and offer the child all the love within her. Her philosophy reads something like enjoy yourself in this place as long as it harms none and those around you are willing to periodically revel in in the wonderful sensation of being alive. But the parents confound her and with their eventual disclosures she is not all that closer to comprehending or daring to dispute their final decisions.

The bulk of his efforts are invested in the youngest boy. He and his brothers are taught by their father that in battle, to defend one’s ways and their ways, in the home and community they must be strong, confident, decisive and confident. Father is vain and dictatorial without being entirely selfish. In his own way, and in the big brothers’ ways, they strive for what is best for their tribe.

Vuong’s choice of words, his beautiful way of expressing experiences add up to a magical alchemy of story telling. I waited so long to read this. I was so excited when my library let me know it was finally ready. Sitting outside on the deck alternating reading with looking off to the endless horizon of the Pacific I felt almost under a spell. Almost. Here is where I’m likely to part with many of the 5 star s. I found myself wondering why a man would write a letter to his mother describing his sexual experiences. Not to mention she couldn’t read. Was she never meant to really ever read this letter? Was it more a letter to self using the unresolved issues between his mother and him as a means to free himself? His genuine expression and openness might have served as a way to match his outer words and behavior with his inner feelings. His real feelings of the moment, the grief and hurt could steer him away from a pretended strength. I’m not sure. Either way, it is an amazingly beautiful piece of writing with the writer stepping boldly into the moments of his life. At times I savored every word, cherished each emotional wave and respected his love-enhanced vision in his soul memory. These are the treasures within the covers of this book. Treasures that sustain the reader when we see his world turn to grey and we wish for him to walk on to his next chapter in life. Vuong is never alone in his truth, but always bonded by us his readers, by our soul ties to one another. There is an uncanny timeless quality behind his words that so affects the emotions in an inexplicable way - like poetry and music it reminds us,of the meaning and beauty of life. As his title suggests all the things of the earth must pass away, yet the emotions beyond words, beyond emptiness, that poignant and pertinent moment of feeling briefly gorgeous, somehow remains.

Laughed like a wild hyena from the first sentence. Richard, the main character, is a man at a crossroads. Life isn’t turning out as he’d hoped. Divorced and lacking any genuine closeness with his son, brother and parents he is facing a huge hole in his life and on the hillside property where he resides. Notice I didn’t say lives as what Richard does is to exist. He goes through life not noticing or feeling much. He behaves out of habit in the same old ways. In other words, he is stuck. What follows is his adventures in transformation land. He encounters a host of amusing and lovable characters who figure, in varying degrees, to his finding a new way to be. If you sometimes find yourself forgetting what it is you really want to do with your life, or what makes you laugh, then read this book and remember Richard. He’ll remind you of how simple and fun it all can be, really. Finished this book with a big smile on my face and wrote a quick thanks to my friend for the suggestion. Don’t ever be afraid of laughing as you trip over your own foolish pride.

I felt as if I’d held my breath the entire time I read this. In the end I can remember letting out a huge sigh of relief that it was over. Not that I was glad it was over, just relieved that maybe, just maybe, Sammy’s problems were over. This character knew just what kind of problems he faced and for the most part, he didn’t stand a chance living in a world that is twisted and bent. There’s this relentless sense that maybe his problems are too huge to run away from. There is a Kafka like interview with social services when he attempts to obtain assistance for the loss of one of his senses with the blackest humour possible - “ maybe it’s a load of fucking shite. All these different ways you have of kidding yerself on.” Sammy is a character who takes the reader along on his series of challenges, obstacles and rotten luck. He grabs you in and makes you feel his feelings. He is flooded with the unfamiliarity of it all - all the new emotions, and so was I. A raw, and relentless tale where every day is another step towards an unknown destination. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 19, 2019","Jul 20, 2019","Sep 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89208.How_Late_It_Was_How_Late

I’ll read just about any book set in Australia, a so far away from me land of my dreams. This is a combination mystery and coming of age story. A woman returns, 20 years later, to her home and a missing cold case. Does she return to expiate her guilt? The story, from days past, swirls around the Van Apfel sister’s - Hanna, Cordie and Ruth - “the unholy trinity” , their religious fanatic father and the returning character, Tikka. The girls are separate yet strangely aligned. There fate is sealed on one dark night. Some of the writing is superb in it’s elegant descriptions. It gives a sense of the rhythm of life itself, at times languid and sultry and then chilling and unexpected. The prose can cut like a knife. Yet, for me, there was simply too much filler. Nonetheless I found it troubling yet triumphant in it’s celebration of female self determination against some nasty odds. It takes a lot of strength to endure a father like this one.

His thoughts pushed me to find this book. This is a dreamlike story where the world is filled onceFirst off, a big thank you to Peter for his . His thoughts pushed me to find this book. This is a dreamlike story where the world is filled once more with endless possibilities. From a distance the angel Gabriel hears music. There’s something distinctly different in what he hears. This piano playing might restore his hope to bring light to the world. He spreads his tattered wings and flies to its source. As he listens he is transformed. He becomes a bright vision sparkling with promise taking on the appearance of early morning leaves when strung with dew like iridescent pearls. He offers a lonely and abused girl safety and fame in exchange for his control. All time collides in this moment. Her music in the present summons a distant past of dancing in and with the revolving universe. Her music is also of the future. If only Gabriel can prove that he brings light, transformation and love. Or does he? Wendy Waters encourages the reader to look up and see the stars themselves dancing against the midnight velvet sky. To read this story is to believe in the enchantment of love again. Her words remind us to celebrate the power of music as nothing less than the nectar of the gods. Waters writes with the pen of a writer, the understaning of a therapist and the endless empathy that reflects her belief in beauty and compassion. An extraordinary story that one wants to believe....more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Oct 21, 2019","Oct 22, 2019","Jul 04, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26830184-catch-the-moon-mary

A radiantly imagined tale of conflicts and their resolutions. There are many interesting characters but The Orenda is a 17th century adventure story. A radiantly imagined tale of conflicts and their resolutions. There are many interesting characters but at the core is Bird, the leader of his people, Gosling, the woman he loves and a seer, Snow Falls, a lone survivor of an attack between the Huron and the Iroquois, and Christophe, the Jesuit missionary renamed the Crow by the Huron. Gosling and Christophe Crow have their very own conflict. He accuses her of being of the devil and using trickery and sorcery to fool the people. Is his mass calling for rain any different? She chants and sings. He prays on beads with a shiny miniature man on the end. He calls her a wretched witch and charlatan. She calls him a mad man. Their conflict escalates as the people decide who to follow. It may not be wise for the Jesuit priest to forget whose country he is in. Perhaps the people you’ve come so far to save will either fear or scorn you. There is also endless internecine war between the Huron and the Iroquois. Both sides engage in atrocities that on the surface are a close match for the Jesuits’ inquisition. Then there is the conflict between Snow Falls, the girl with the power to become a seer and the older Gosling. Each conflict and character are brought richly to life in this intense story. At times the truth is what any character imagines it to be. Joseph Boyden has written a finely balanced story where all sides have strengths and weaknesses. There are horrific descriptions of torture, tender scenes of love, and the heartbreaking futility of war. There is a beauty to his words that made me lean in until the last pages....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jul 07, 2019","Jul 08, 2019","Jun 28, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17661831-the-orenda

Daniel and Claudette are a married couple - here they stand at a turniA magnificent story about reaching the crossroads and selecting your direction. Daniel and Claudette are a married couple - here they stand at a turning point. Their stories are told separately and then together, moving back and forth in time, bringing them to a place of decision making. Each time they choose a direction with mixed amounts of integrity and minimal foresight. Decisions are made at different stages of their lives with an understanding, at that exact moment, of who they are and what they’ve done in their worlds. Each new journey is taken with the hope of either escape or a resurrection of the self. The previously inhabited past serves as a catalyst to come together on a new path. They stand together transfixed on a new horizon but can it last? It’s a winding path these two follow. It’s as far from linear perfection as possible. At times they seem to lay down like the victims of painful change. It will either reduce them to ashes, or, with a big kick in the arse allow them to rise again. Separately they take their time to assess their broken hearts and lick their wounds clean. Both must find ways to heal before they decide if they can travel together again. How many times will they be able to get up and walk again after being struck down? Will they make life their enemy or their teacher? Their stories are never tedious as Ms. O’Farrell allows them to dance in the full range of emotions. She graces her characters with an unshakable faith along with their weaknesses as they face life’s circumstances. She makes it clear that events can’t be altered once they occur but there’s always a future waiting if they’ll just find the courage to make the right choice. The choice they both know feels instinctively right. O’Farrell’s characters have a way of taking charge of themselves no matter how deep their personal wounds. They are transformed because they want to be. I found it refreshing to read a book where free will and finally coming to really know oneself were combined into a creative and heartwarming story....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jun 27, 2019","Jun 28, 2019","Jun 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27272236-this-must-be-the-place

As I read this I found I was comparing my life to date with Ms. Albertine’s. I found myself debating her conclusions. Did I expect a woman like her to be tougher? More resilient? I kept on and somewhere amidst all those personal recollections my judgemental attitude slid away. At one point she asks the reader, “Are you still with me? I’m barely with myself.” Made me smile and recognise how, in many ways, we are alike. After her mother dies it’s as if she is finally freed to grow up. In the section called “meadow” I was halfway in before my tears started. I felt like saying to her, “I get you now! I understand exactly what you are going through.” She finally reached in and touched my heart. Her edges, like mine, were softened. I finished, silently thought over all she’d said and concluded that she is one brave woman. The last part of her book brought me such a feeling of peace. Her writing is exuberant and full of natural power. All that she went through, all that once stood in her path became integrated. It felt like a surge of a river, with branches and rocks, like hopes and wishes, carried along with the current, to finally be made one with the overall tide. And, like that river, she’s unstoppable....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jun 28, 2019","Jun 29, 2019","Jun 27, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35406497-to-throw-away-unopened

Where to begin when an entire book proves so quotable? Florence, the girl with the power of making herself invisible and hypnotising those who threaten, is a great start. As Smith describes her she is the girl who makes people behave like they should or like they live in a different world. Florence is the fixed point that remains so all the others can find their way. She’s a point of reference - the return of Spring. A keeper of wisdom gained from remaining in touch with all that is really going on around her. She’s the bringer of hope in troubled times. Through her and Alda, the reckless van driver, Richard/Doubledick and Brit achieve personal revivals. They feel the hope - vivunt spe- of the collective. Spring, an opening of hearts to new possibilities and the healing of spirit towards reconciliation. It’s a beautiful time to achieve an understanding of the world as it could be. Emerging from the longest and coldest nights of death and loss here comes Richard’s spring. A time for him to finally let himself be open to the challenges of the times we live in. Ali Smith is the ultimate wordsmith. Like an orator she sends out her call to bring groups together and work as a single force for change. You can rely on her to use her words to keep you grounded as the winds of change blow all around us and this story. She’s given us words to humanise the machine. We are, as humans, one another. We are the people. We of the same source need to stop drawing lines and building fences between colour, species, religion, and abilities. The man made rules and barriers need to be removed like a blindfold from the eyes or a vicelike grip around our hearts. We affect the all because we are the all. Hell, she says it so much better. Please read Spring and let Ms. Smith share with you the highest of magic and the simplest of truths. She’ll guide you, like Richard’s imaginary child/Paddy as a child, to wake the fuck up....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jun 26, 2019","Jun 27, 2019","Jun 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40545817-spring

A girl feeling alone as she knows beyond all knowing where her mother really goes when she leaves each night. The man and the girl are fated to meet and in that meeting provide something for each other that they are missing. There’s a magic in the friendship they form as they play with words and create whole new stories. You can find Daniel in the fresh morning dew glistening atop a small leaf. Look for the flashing lights of Elisabeth on her rollerblades tearing down the asphalt much akin to a leaping spring lamb. Their relationship will be felt in the heart of everyone who has found a loving friendship. Even with the passing of time and a separation based on Elisabeth’s misdirected hurt they come back together to experience more stories and Daniel’s eternal question, “what you reading?” Inquisitive, joyous, sardonic and humorous all these emotions and more shine through in this gift from Ali Smith. Her book opened my eyes with wonder at her creative and exciting use of language. These words teach us much about life’s lessons. When we allow someone’s positive and buoyant ways to blend and mesh with ours a new way of being is created. All the characters find a fresh vision, bright and shimmery, on their journeys of discovery. Moments lost can be found illuminated with a brilliance only previously guessed at or hoped for. In Daniel’s words, “we have to hope that the people who love us and who know us a little bit will in the end have seen us truly. In the end, not much else matters.” Amen....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Jun 17, 2019","Jun 17, 2019","Jun 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30269094-autumn

My alleged good ear and musical memory have done little in the way of mastering Chopin’s music. I approached this lengthy book thinking it would somehow provide me with whatever element I seem to be missing. No such luck. I continue to be frustrated with my lack of expertise but I sure learned a great deal about this musical genius. Chopin’s lack of interest in technique as an end in itself offers the first key to understanding his approach. He subscribed to no dogma. All he knew of piano playing had been self discovered. It is said that his music was instantly recognizable. He lived a short but amazingly full and exciting life. He was under surveillance by the Russians in 1835 whereupon he assumed a French identity. He considered his love life to be a failure after suffering numerous rejections related to his illness and lack of financial resources. It was in his music that he shined like the brightest star and this shine has lasted. There are more sketches for his polonaise fantasie op 61 than any other he wrote for solo piano. Indeed, he was poised to give birth to a new genre but his early death would ensure this would not happen. His music is written from his harvest of sorrows - his ill health, his failed proposals, his tumultuous relationship with George Sand and the death of his family. A complex being - he didn’t like to read, except newspapers never liked or consumed alcohol and through his life remained a proud Pole whose deep love for country never wavered. One critic described his piano playing this way -“ it is not a piano that speaks but a soul. And what a soul.” Much of this book is dedicated to details re: his techniques, background in each piece of music he wrote, and his psychological states of mind when facing a terminal illness and his world at war around him. If you love his music, or like me, hope that learning about him will potentially improve your efforts to play his complicated and challenging pieces, this is the biography for you....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 09, 2019","Jul 11, 2019","Jun 15, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37860165-fryderyk-chopin

Sometimes I felt like a voyeur reading about such private behaviour. A close up look at families, loyalties, infidelities and freedom. The freedom to make many mistakes. These characters operate as if just when they thought they had things all sorted out holes appear in their logic. They’re trapped. They’re ambushed by their needs and stupidity. They are repeatedly looking for ways around their dead ends. There will always be problems with what they do. It’s almost as if there’s rogue forces at work that holds them hostage to their foolish oversights. In their youth they, like many of us, failed to acknowledge there would be difficulties in the future and suddenly here they are. As they questioned how to work their way out of each sticky situation I kept right along reading. Not a one of them is infallible. It takes some of them longer than others to realize this. Franzen has told a story about people who irritate and make the reader uncomfortable. Yet there is something both deeply human and comic in their flawed characters. A story of the cyclical nature of life with all the failures and triumphs it contains....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jun 30, 2019","Jul 02, 2019","Jun 14, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7905092-freedom

Maybe you are familiar with the illustrations of Arthur Rackham. His drawings of forest creatures and faces in the ancient oak trees are a wonderful invitation to this story. Max Porter hypnotized me with his words. He’s created a distinct mood for each of the parts of this book. All my senses were engaged as the story moved along. The focus is mainly on Dead Papa Toothwort, the misunderstood and maligned mythical creature of nature, Lanny’s parents, Pete the artist and, of course, Lanny. Lanny - the unusually wonderful singing boy who builds a bower, like the bird, in the forest. Lanny wants to live in harmony with nature, free and happy. He is ever so inquisitive. He loves the forest where the fairy people dance and life is still magical. He is innocence, magical spirit and unconditional love. He is the child that lives in all of us. From the beginning Dead Papa Toothwort recognizes Lanny’s voice. Out of all the snippets of the villager’s conversations he selects Lanny’s song. What are his intentions? As the story unfolds the suspense builds. It moves and grows unlike the forest which shrinks as pollution and buildings take over. I was constantly reassessing and processing the new ideas and information the author offered. He reminds the reader that it’s foolhardy to believe that in life nothing can go wrong. This story can be read on different levels. Each character can be viewed as a symbol of how humans perceive and treat the natural world. Or, you can read it at face value like the fairy tales that Arthur Rackham illustrated. Any which way you proceed know that this is a wonderful story flowing with the tides of life. It contains the essence of the universe. You can smell and taste the storm brewing. You can look with a steady gaze and focused intent on how nature works with the movement of all things. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was wild, full of foreboding and joy. When I closed it I felt nourished in my blood, bones and spirit. It made me want to get outside in the leafy realms and search for treasures in those places where humans seldom go. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Jun 20, 2019","Jun 21, 2019","Jun 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39738353-lanny

HA dense and colourful story of a father who risks all, time and time again, in his efforts to save himself, his sons, and allies from inner turmoil. He holds an ugly and painful past deep within himself with glimmers of the past, present and future. This begins in a bewitched and timeless place. A father has brought his sons and war weary hunter “friend” to take up residence in an abandoned game reserve. There’s a war going on in Mozambique and with most people fleeing to the city he heads into the interior. It’s only midway, with the arrival of a strange woman, that the story feels like it’s been propelled into the 21st century. Cell phones and computers coexist with women carrying huge bundles of hand washed laundry on their heads. The strange woman, Marta, also seems under a spell.She’s believes she’s come to Africa to find the husband who abandoned her. Yet what anyone believes in this story isn’t always real. The father sees her as a threat without understanding that larger threats loom on the horizon just outside the gates of his hideaway. “I was waiting for God to come to Jezoosalem, but in the end it’s a bunch of private foreigners that are coming...maybe they are the new gods?” Sometimes the characters have burdens so great all they can do is weep for the pains and worries of the world outside. They speak to the reader about what is usually hidden from our eyes and revealed only in their souls. A story that felt both achingly familiar and with echoes so strange they were almost beyond reach. Mia Couto writes with the profound intuition of a visionary.

A story that takes inspiration froAn enchanting story that gives expression to a supernatural pattern of actions which are unbroken since time began. A story that takes inspiration from from vodu, the masters of horror, and the Bible.It invites the reader to carefully consider the importance of rituals that connect the everyday world and the world of spirit, be they praying and/or casting spells. Just remember, it’s not wise to fool with things you don’t understand. Who knows what forces you might let loose in the world? These rituals and spells are best left to those familiar with the old ways, like the Touissants. In this tale a brave woman takes a giant risk to call upon her spirit ancestors and move into the other realms. With little but a ring as protection she tries to find her way to use the ancient wisdom of her Grandmother Marie to save the home and people she loves. Entertaining and at times shivery scary. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jun 15, 2019","Jun 17, 2019","Jun 09, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41539.The_Good_House

You look back, and sometimes you think, Did I really do all that? And other times you think. Is that all there is? Is that all I managed to get done? We are never satisfied. Don’t even know the meaning of the word.”Daniel Wier has a story to tell. A story of his search for satisfaction. A writer of songs, a bass player and a man who nearly loses his way as a member of the successful band, Frozen Gold. Despite, or due to his tendencies towards self doubt and pessimism, he knows how to make music. He surprises himself once the words that previously existed only in his head go live particularly with Christine singing his words. His music takes the band and fans to places of ecstasy and abandonment. On his journey he is saddled with the hefty baggage of Catholic guilt, an absent father in prison, childhood trauma, and what he describes as a less than pleasing countenance. Is he confused? He is. Better confused than bored, miserable and serious. His confusion teaches him to think for himself which at times is in conflict with acting the rock star. He feels he has a duty to his public. He must act the part. In these moments he can almost convince himself that nothing is really all that important, so why not party. These irresponsible moments are the most comic. But, just when you think you know this character he upends the chaos and reveals his other sides. He is gentle, humble, longing for closeness and genuinely caring for and about others. Rarely self absorbed or self righteous he strives for a balance amidst the decadence. In his most self reflective moments he reminds us that life is a dance and if you aren’t dancing but holding fast to rigid frameworks you might consider allowing the tide of music to sweep you away. There is immense loss in his story. These losses are so vast they nearly take him along. Fortunate enough to see another sunrise he acts on his final decision of the story. A decision so important it’s as if he knew all along he would arrive exactly where he does.This is an altogether gratifying story which offers insight into survival - how to survive the random and unexpected events life throws at us. Daniel finds his strength and satisfaction through surviving and this is what makes him a real star....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jun 07, 2019","Jun 09, 2019","Jun 07, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17465169-espedair-street

Not any performer but the one in the quartet you came to hear. He plays second violin. Few people like to play second seat. You don’t get do play all those fancy solos. He loves his violin. It’s been with him in a tender devoted relationship longer than most people. His fingers move upon his instrument in fluid motion that holds your attention, hypnotizing you until your eyes meet his. You look down and see his foot, barely perceptible, tapping out the beat. Then your eyes move upwards again and you see his smile. He is smiling at you, in welcome and acknowledgement. Do you know him? Is he an old friend, a school companion, or the man you once loved? Does he recognize you? Why else would he be smiling like that unless he knew you? The two, once upon a time lovers in this story, do know each other. It’s been years since they’ve been together. They meet after the concert unsure what to say, how to behave. She looks different. Her hair is longer. Her face thinner. She is still beautiful to him. As beautiful and familiar as his beloved violin. They remind each other, without words, of the past. What now do they want of each other? It must be something to smile at each other like that. They slowly tune each other’s existence as it was meant to be heard, rising up from the wells at the very core of their beings. But, like Kurt Cobain’s song, somethings in the way.In the present things are difficult. Like his loaned violin they could disappear from each other without a trace. This is a moving story of two musicians who love to make music and love. There is always a constant threat of potential loss which maintains the book’s melancholy and minor key. It’s all experience. They feel it. They make music from it.

A boisterous dark comic tale focused on the bizarre and often hilarious behavior of the Catchprice tribe. This is an anatomy of a truly dysfunctional family. Along comes the pregnant, soon to deliver, tax inspector, who also happens to want to cut loose from her past. She just doesn’t realize the extent until she joins up with this lunatic fringe. Granny leads the pack with her determination to seek revenge. She serves as a role model for her family as one after another recognize it’s time to move on. Each of them flies off into the realms of all kinds of possibilities. Each family member has their own journey be they in search of love, a music career, becoming an angel, or maybe a Hare Krishna devotee. They all want a way to escape or destroy life in the present for a fresh start. They argue, disarm, threaten and dare one another to take that first giant step into change. Each in their own way would rather risk danger or uncertainty than stagnate in the decaying car garage. Endlessly humorous Carey affords each character a voice to share what they see as a whole new perspective just around that next bend. A free flying story built around some of the most unstable characters imaginable. They fear nothing but being stuck. The story starts slowly only to gain a fast paced momentum with a genius ending....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"May 20, 2019","May 24, 2019","May 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1000422.The_Tax_Inspector

Sieglinde is hard at work hunting for clues that will lead her to a person from her past, Erich. Something extraordinary occurred between them some fifty years ago. That something keeps her searching for what once was. The story then turns to 1939 with the focus on two German families, one near Leipzig where Erich is a child, and the other in Berlin where Sieglinde lives. Hitler is coming to power. Both families adhere to the party line until the collapse of the Reich. Their steadfast commitment to the lies, assumptions and beliefs they hear nightly on the radio serves them like a shield. Beneath it all they seem so sad and lonely as they ally themselves with torment and mistrust. Everyone is suspicious. All words, spoken and written, are censored. Words are misused and misinterpreted resulting in repression, skepticism and persecution. It is all for the benefit of the few - those who twist words to support the Nazis. The story moves between this cold harsh propaganda and ethereal dreamlike sequences depending on the narrator. Enter the wish child. “Over the years you have tried to name me, pin me down, but I change my shape and slip away, a phantom, a rumour ...Where am I now? If you lo0k for me, I am not there. I am the wish child, the future cast in water. I am the thrown coin, the blown candle; I am the fallen star.” The wish child, a spirit presence, watches over Germany. In time he focuses on Sieglinde and Erich as they separately run from the war only to join together as fate dictates. The wish child is a fixed point through all time. He is an observer. He shares his perspectives and omens. He is a mediator between earth and sky. He offers insight and wisdom regarding Hitler’s rise to power, the people’s willingness to uncritically believe and their eventual collective realization of betrayal. He is there to remind us of the world as it was and could be. He watches as Sieglinde and Erich find escape in an abandoned theatre in Berlin. Amidst the bombed out landscape of desperation they discover their very own peace, albeit temporary, and bonds of trust. They make promises. The promises that fifty some years later neither will have forgotten. They create an alternate reality, costumes and all, touched only by the strands of starlight. As the wish child watches he feels the grace that radiates from the universe they create. At times this book reads like soothing poetry. It soars with elegance. At other times it is harsh and demanding. No matter the tone it is consistently captivating.

If so, you might find yourself saying I knew these characters or people who were very similar to them. Irvine Welsh is a master at creating characters that are so real, with each so flawlessly described, that you don’t lose track of who’s who in his books. This prequel to Trainspotting felt more desperate and ominous. Perhaps that was on account of having that feeling of dread when you knew where things are headed. It is a searingly graphic and brutally honest depiction of a deep dive into the abyss of heroin addiction. There is still plenty of humor with some characters being quite adept at self deprecation. The political situation of the time continues as a backdrop to the story. The city shuts down the needle exchange indifferent to the inevitable outcome of AIDS. Who in government or the general population gives a care about junkies? Laced throughout there are references to philosophers, Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard, used by Mark Renton, the character who loves reading, to help himself better understand the predicaments of his life. He has a clear comprehension of the choices he’s made. The choice to leave life behind as he once knew it and commit himself to stealing, scoring, and using. A life of daily obstacles and limitations. A life on the periphery - lawless, unwashed, and nearly corrupted by want. Yet the story ends with the elegant Welsh trademark. There Renton and Simon spew poison out in every direction as they climb a rickety staircase to stand up in truth. It gives me chills to think about it. There is between the two lads that tiny spark of honesty which ends the story with hope....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"May 11, 2019","May 16, 2019","May 11, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12926063-skagboys

A graphic depiction of life that transcends time and place. Life is, at times, painful. Not everyone chooses to face the pain that life presents. Yet, this story rarely slips into total despair. There’s a generous supply of sardonic humor, candid and wise self exploration and ample commentary on class, politics and racism. It’s mostly about addictions. “Thirs nivir any real dilemmas in junk. They only come when you run out.” It’s a brief journey to a demanding habit that from the first offers sweet oblivion. The characters dance around their indulgences and addictions with flamboyance and sadistic violence. And, then there are those few who in spite of their flaws hang on to their hearts and goodness. This is not just another book about addiction. The wisdom is interspersed with the raw ugliness and when articulated it’s undeniably authentic. Some of the characters are more damaged and severed from their souls as in any group of people. It’s too simplistic to cast scorn. It’s harder to allow oneself to feel empathy with the character’s sense of insignificance and despair. This is a complex look at denial, manipulation and fringe existence. When the characters spiral into addiction you hope for a miracle. Some won’t make it. The funerals increase. There’s little left once the addiction, and in some cases AIDS takes over. Some do find a way through in the kind of change that demands one let go of the familiar and move on to another place in time. Irvine Welsh offers the reader a close up view of a world filled with pathetic rebellion, hollow acts of revenge, and disillusionment. It’s all captured in his original ironic style....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"May 06, 2019","May 11, 2019","May 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/135836.Trainspotting

It moves across time, from Adam and Lilith to Sheherazade to the 2011 Casablanca. Maryam Tair is frequently accused of being a witch. What if she is? She doesn’t cackle nor ride a broom. Maryam rides a bicycle gifted to her by the giant, Hamza. Maryam is that girl and woman whose eyes some are afraid to meet lest they bewitch you or reflect back to you who you really are. Both feared and reviled she is the stranger, alone, and as I like to think of her, floating away. Some are pulled to her often against their will. Call her what you want she doesn’t care. Even after imprisonment and torture she remains powerful. This magical story is filled with dissent and mystery with the power of disobedience being a constant message. The people of Morocco awaken, listen and arise. As a leader Maryam must learn to stand naked and unafraid believing she has a full right to be who she is - Lilith’s daughter, past, present and future. She is taught to work with signs, dreams and visions in the service of magic. Her will is consistently directed in accordance with Scheherazade’s stories. She smells and tastes the brewing storms of change. There are tests and obstacles to overcome as she becomes one who knows beyond knowing. Her choices affirm her uniquely wild dance of life. After riding her bicycle between worlds she will return to pass on the the world her insights and wisdom - perception, thought and heart. There was something about this story that kept bringing my Spanish Moroccan mother to mind. It reminded me of some of the bedtime stories she would tell me as she forced herself to only speak English. For that, as well as the content, I read this with a feeling of wistfulness and nostalgia. It is beautifully simple yet highly complex, a paradox, the result of combining legends and reality and listening to what is all around us of which we, yes you and I, are a part....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"May 31, 2019","Jun 02, 2019","May 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25438706-dreams-of-maryam-tair

What is a medicine walk? “Everything a guy would need is here if you want it and know how to look for it, heThis was, for me, a deeply personal read. What is a medicine walk? “Everything a guy would need is here if you want it and know how to look for it, he said. You gotta spend time gatherin’ what you need. What you need to keep you strong. He called it a medicine walk.” He goes on to say that there are many times in our lives that you don’t even realize what you need until you lay your eyes upon it. This is at the core of the story and an often returned to lesson. A long estranged father asks his 16 year old son to go with him to a long remembered place of peace to die and be buried like a warrior. Despite their traumatic history the son agrees. He walks, the father desperately sick, does his best to stay astride the horse as their medicine walk takes form. As they make their way the father finds his voice and tells his stories that his son has waited his 16 years to hear. He learns of his mother, a Cree woman who could hold his attention by telling stories of days gone by or places that perhaps never were. She can bring tears to his eyes telling her story of the sea that he had forgotten were in him. She could do all that and more. The love of his life she bears him a son. This is a story about the need to tell stories to those ready to listen, to unburden oneself beginning with one word. These are beautiful stories and sad stories that guide the son to understand where he came from and who he is. The father’s stories also reveal many hidden secrets about life itself. And, in the telling they complete their medicine walk, father and son finding their own ways to apologize and ultimately forgive. The walk was hard, very hard. The son felt, in some respects, ill prepared to look at death straight on. Yet, this noble young man, wise beyond his years, digs deep into his being and dedicates himself to this final walk. On his way home he learns the lessons of grieving. It will take hours, days, and yes, years to order the tales in his head and make them his own. A terribly moving story of a father and son’s final days. There is an honor in the telling - a wisdom that while breathtaking was difficult for me to read. It involved self exploration and recalling memories which are both harsh and deeply personal. I read this with a quiet respect and acknowledgement of their walk trying to manage my tears to keep my mind available to the wisdom. The story ends with a feeling of calmness and comfortable silence. Sometimes loss is so personal that you don’t think anyone could understand. Yet, Richard Wagamese does and he leaves you surrounded by the great healing power of nature, grounded and at peace....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"May 04, 2019","May 05, 2019","May 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18050139-medicine-walk

A completely endearing family decides to take the trip of a lifetime to Australia. This book is almost constantly humorous. You are never laughing at the family but with them. The author is a natural story teller as he takes you along on their adventures, mishaps and all. You will read about the anthropomorphisizing -is that even a word - of the rented camper, referred to as the “malevolent creature”, the oldest son’s willingness to fake projectile vomiting in the rental office in the event extreme theatrics are required, and the importance of cleaning the hotel rooms before the maids arrive. There’s plenty of lovely descriptions of the journey with the Great Barrier Reef being a highlight for the family and me. I felt like I was right there snorkeling in those turquoise waters. I read this in one sitting cover to cover. It’s that good, that entertaining, and full of humor that kept me laughing. I’d love to read another travel book by Adrian Fingleton.

He’s a thoroughly unlikeable character who dismisses and insults those he encounters. He can’t bear to see himself in mirrors, seeing an old man where once he was firm and taut. His initial encounters with his estranged daughter are fraught with misunderstandings and more distance. The woman he perceives as a potential love interest will not reciprocate his interest which only adds to his bitterness. Yet, the story evolves, reading like the merry go round of life. It goes round and round and with each turn he comes closer and closer to self understanding and by extension, understanding of others. His house burns to the ground turning all his possessions to ashes. It is a tale of the Phoenix rising. His emotions transform over time as he permits himself to cast off his defensive posture and fear of intimacy. He risks becoming vulnerable and finds a way to love others. Through his loss and renewal he learns to be generous and giving. He becomes a whole person. He finds he can wholeheartedly celebrate the natural world. In the end he takes stock of who he is as he reaches gently upward and outward. He establishes his place in the world and discovers he is no longer alone. He is never alone again. A quiet, slow moving story of a man’s discovery of himself....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Apr 24, 2019","Apr 25, 2019","Apr 24, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33797947-after-the-fire

As one reads on through temporal leaps and shifts the answer is revealed. Aaliya- godless, fatherless, childless, and divorced sees herself as an unnecessary woman. Or, is that how she is defined by others? Having reached the winter of her years she surrounds herself with books which she takes her time translating. She imagines a future where she and her books will be incinerated together. As the story unfolds you arrive at a restful place that allows for much introspection. She thinks of death, the end that will come as surely as night follows day. She recounts her life lessons to include her disastrous marriage and those times when she shined most brightly. She recalls those times when she truly related with the guard at the museum, when she gave her mother a pedicure, and found companionship with the neighborhood witches. She shares the knowledge she collected from her favorite authors and her beloved friend. They provide her with enough glowing light to see her way through what journey she has left. This is a book filled with reflections of wisdom and hope. A story that offers a way of seeing oneself through the inevitable changes of growing old. I pondered all it offered and closed the book.

This book kept me present in the moment - completely and authentically witnessing whatever was being conveyed. Few books manage to accomplish this. When those times came where my reading was interrupted I couldn’t wait to return to the story. Coe makes it so easy to pick up his character’s transmissions. There is zero interference. This book is a celebration of life from the pathetic and ridiculous to the untamed and unspoiled kingdoms of bliss. There are acts of irresponsibility and self indulgence and of passion and pride. The trick is how he balances it all. He keeps you on the move emotionally speaking. Best of all I enjoyed the sensual expressions of the characters out in the world - some causing me to erupt in laughter to the point of tears and some to make me quietly smile and sigh with an oh yes expression. This is a story full of energy and vital potency. It’s wild and strong. It suggests, for me, that we not play to win but to laugh, feel, and grow.

For me, it was all about Prentice sorting through his personal strategies to life. He likes to think of himself as an individual who stands on principles, shakey though they may sometimes be. If only his concepts of love and jealousy didn’t get in his way. Egotistical and witty, a kind of hero in the making - a spying voyeur hidden in the shadows, sometimes in rare moments slipping into silence. After ingesting just the right amount of substances he will leap in to dance and save others. A young man of many guises in his silk moebius scarf. Experiencing the deaths of several family members he imagines he can quick jump over such obstacles. And, what do we learn of what he learns? How to temper his wild ideas with a hint of common sense, to take emotional risks, to find release in loud moans and howls, and to come to terms with the crow road. As to sharing his feelings for Ashley-“thanks to my own stupidity, my hesitation, my indecision, my negligence-I’d missed it, and that too was gone from me, over.” Or is it? This story wins the day with humor, fresh dialogue, and summary sentences that glow in their beauty. There is a fantastic ending that includes a pelvic floor Morse code message and a completely satisfying final word.

How do you rate a person’s experience with tortures, murders and forced exile? When I was littThis is one of those books which feels awkward to rate. How do you rate a person’s experience with tortures, murders and forced exile? When I was little I would sometimes see my mother get this faraway look in her eyes as if she was in a trance. I’d tug on her arm and ask her what she was looking at, what was she thinking? She’d reluctantly shake her head and say, “home, I was thinking of home.” No matter how I begged her to say more she would insist it was best to forget the past. She didn’t have time to dwell on all that. Rahul Pandita feels differently. He brings us a story not only of his past but that of the Hindu minority’s within Kashmir in 1990. He could not allow himself to forget. His story begins with his carefree and happy memories of childhood. This, in contrast to the terrifying and grim realization, when he turns 14, that the time had come for the family to flee to a great unknown, forever. They flee to times of fear, confusion and endless anxiety. You can almost hear their pounding hearts, as he bears witness, with his plaintive refrain of the loneliness of exile. There was little hope in the new landscape just endless moves from place to place one worse than the next. He watches his parents become ground down in their single mindedness of survival. As they lose their health, hearts and spirits he holds tight to his humanity. He asks the question we all do, why does this keep happening? These words remind us that right now there are people fleeing for their lives. He asks that we try to understand what it feels like to be bereft of simple hope. He wrote this book, I think, to remind us of the dire consequences of ignorance, prejudice and injustice. We need to be aware of those who strike out wildly in misdirected rage from fanatical beliefs. Mr. Pandita ends the book with his thoughts that he is waiting, waiting for his time to come again. I hope his memories will be more than tattered remnants on the wind. This is not a book one closes and forgets but one that encourages us to do our part for more harmonious days and a brighter tomorrow....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jun 02, 2019","Jun 04, 2019","Apr 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17265065-our-moon-has-blood-clots

Perhaps it was too great a responsibility to hold in all those secrets and then to convey them as if they were meant to be written to the world. She sorts through what she thinks is expected of her all the while trembling inside. She risks ridicule and her reputation as she searches for answers that hang like smoke in the air around her. Sometimes all she can do is weep, for the worries and pains of her own and of the world. All those nightmare like memories and dead animals. Sometimes she tries to be like others but this ends up a pointless creation. She cries openly and uncontrollably for the things she’s lost and for the changes she knows she must make. She’s got to adapt to survive. At last, growing tired of the sameness of her environment ,she boards a ship at sea. I think this is her way of letting go of the past. This comes with great sadness for it holds who she was. The future is only a possibility of who she might become - if she can just get through this....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 04, 2019","Apr 16, 2019","Apr 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30971749-a-line-made-by-walking

A story of a woman beginning with her mother’s funeral as a little girl in Ireland and ending with her trip back there from her new home in New York. I’m not exaggerating when I say that this book had me in tears on nearly every page. I’d read for awhile, begin to cry, get up and wander outside and resume. As a little girl the loss of her mother is devastating. I don’t feel she ever recovers. It shapes her life. The losses continue as does the expected heartaches. “She remembered warm evenings that first summer, walking downtown with him, this golden, blue eyed brother, stopping to listen to the sounds of a saxophone drifting out a window. He could be anywhere now. He could be happy. He could be dead. He might have opted to drop from the grid and disappear. This was America. As she walked along unfamiliar streets she wondered if the self she had become, and the self Oliver had become, and the self Claire had been, would have been different if they’d had a mother who lived.” Tess, the questioning person has looked and tried to discover what tugged at her heartstrings and inspired her spirit. She does her best to attain some understanding through the profound feelings that life creates for her. There is respite when she reads. Through books she comes closer to the meaning of life. She’s always wishing to find someone with whom she could delve deeper, to experience shared emotions on a level she’s only dimly perceived. She wants to find love. Through the enchantment of myths and hymns she can almost find a fountain of knowledge so pure and fresh it cancels her pain. Yet, there is a silent strength inside her - a reservoir of acceptance. There is always something just out of reach, that which through her life she is only given a mere suggestion of, something which is otherworldly. In the end she concludes “ there was no Eden...just time and tasks made lighter by the memory of love, and days like all others when she would put one foot in front of the other and walk on, obedient to fate.” Phew, this is a tough book to lightly step away from....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Jun 25, 2015","Jun 26, 2019","Apr 01, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22841065-academy-street

I need to know that even though I’m small and land bound, right in front of my face it’s enormous, endless. Can you smell it, can you smell the endlessness?” This is a story that is nearly impossible for me to . A truly cathartic experience. Ray and One Eye, are creatures no one else wants. One Eye comes into Ray’s life at first without choice and later attracted to stay near through Ray’s care and kindness. He shares his secrets with One Eye and I defy anyone who believes that One Eye isn’t listening. Not only does Ray share his inner most turmoil but also his observations of the world around them. What is left but paw prints in the sand? Ray has never been a part of a family or community that valued him. These times with One Eye bring him temporary respite and companionship without the brutal intervention of humankind. It is as if they decide together, united by their wild essence, that they both want the same thing and they will that freedom to make it so. May One Eye carry on running, running running where the humans seldom go. And, may Ray find peace in the endlessness of the sea outside of his earthly self.

He’s controlled by his hormones, a relentless drive to A memoir of a young man who lives in the moment and acknowledges his behaviour with the title. He’s controlled by his hormones, a relentless drive to rebel against his parent’s attempts to impose their religious beliefs on him, and the endless search for an elixir to provide the ideal altered state of consciousness. There’s a beauty and fluid motion to his writing that kept me reading. I could imagine him smiling a welcome along the way. Did I recognize him? I certainly did. The mud brown eyes he describes himself as having must have also looked full of life to most he meets - unadulterated and authentic when not obliterated on substances. He has lots to say about sex and drugs with occasional detours into humour and politics. Early on he develops an awareness of how people are treated differently based on the colour of their skin and their income level. There are aspects of his personality that blend the comic with the cosmic. Behind the scoundrel is a kid who reminded me of the fun of childhood spent by the ocean with the glint of sunlight on breaking waves. Reading and writing in his collection of notebooks offer him periods of distance from his surroundings. His story from childhood to his mid twenties rises and falls like the unique beating of a heart. There’s a simple eloquence and eventual happiness in his words. These are sometimes overshadowed by shame, anger and the disapproval of others. This doesn’t slow him down as there’s never a shortage of friends who will merrymake, thumb their noses and stick out their tongues and fight at the least provocation. From adolescence on he goes anywhere, where anything might happen, holding on to nothing. Travelling the roads of Australia he brings forward a taste of life outside the rules. There’s sorrow, lonliness and moments of pain as he searches for finding fresh hope in the next destination. Change comes knocking at his door when he least expects it. The final paragraph reads like a man who can at long last drop the armor and allow himself to experience what he’s been missing out on until that very moment in time....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jun 14, 2019","Jun 15, 2019","Mar 31, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32508561-scoundrel-days

Orphaned at so young an age she has no memories of her parents. Moved to an overcrowded relative’s home she is sent to live at a girl’s school. Here she discovers something that graces her with a sense of achievement as well as an outlet for her emotions. She learns to play the piano. It gets her juices flowing and becomes the driving force of her life leading her to those inevitable twists of fate that life is made up of. What can a girl who never knew nurturing from others, who never attached, know of giving and receiving love? Don’t fault her for what she doesn’t understand. She has no template, no experience, no models. As the story unfolds she becomes involved with two men, Orren and Bell.It’s in these relationships that she carelessly tests and pushes the men’s boundaries. Her fear of being stuck in a grey world without escape leads her to risk losing what she has. But, how much of a loss would that be? She recklessly compounds the already existing hurt in Orren and Bell. It cuts deeply, for if her relationship with Orren was so average her behavior wouldn’t prove so potentially damaging. The combined fears and cultural prohibitions prevent all three characters from enjoyment of the present. They are in a constant state of what if. There is betrayal and lies. The kind of terrible lies that lead to a howling anger at a world left less sparkling.

An outstanding swimmer he shows all the potential in the world to become a world class athelete. Singled out by his coach at an elite private school it feels as if he may find redemption. He heeds his coach’s advice learning to stand up for himself. Sadly this is not the solution to the complex and myriad self doubts of Daniel’s persona. The story continues with the promise of a way out through a relationship that takes him to Scotland. The pull of home and unresolved familial problems serve to interrupt this. In essence this is a story of how a self punishing mindset can take one to the depths of despair. Tsiolkas does a commendable job of exploring sexualty, friendships, loyalty and the crooked path towards the meaning of love for self and others. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Aug 17, 2019","Aug 19, 2019","Mar 27, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18634859-barracuda

Kerry, Black Superman, and other Salters have their reasons for flight. Flight as in a movement away from your home and family. They want to try out their wings and feel the winds of freedom on their backs. At first it is so exhilarating- simply being so full of energy and finding new sources of inspiration. They want to escape from and forget the bad times and create new homes. In that flight they form new beliefs that exist alongside the old ones. Life has a way of teaching them to recognize which to hold on to and which to release. Then a time comes when family beckons. They want you to come home. This is a story about the strength of family bonds and remembrance of a place you once called home. These stir up old harms as well as feelings of safety. Which will prove stronger?

A girl standing alone and embattled surrounded by shame and the roiling sea of mindless chaos. She shakes her terrified fist at her mother, religion, the world. Moving, ever so slightly from helplessness and resignation to erecting walls built with rage and self destruction. Any joy is fleeting. McBride brings you into immediate contact with a broken human staggering in the dullness of a blind and mindless fog. The author’s vision of human nature is jarring. She groups her words to serve this purpose. Her created conditions of life are not easy to process. She’ll knock you out of the hypnotic trance some writers create straight to the hell of suffering. Reading this requires an approach that many will abandon and even ridicule. All I know is that she captured the ugly and disturbing essence of abuse and alienation. Written in staccato screams. The wording is abrupt and stabbing out at the world. It is pure pain put to words. “Till I close my eyes I keep them shut. I know where the darkness goes. Where’s comfort where’s safe. From here. I run from where you are not.”...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 19, 2019","Mar 21, 2019","Mar 19, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20702408-a-girl-is-a-half-formed-thing

This piece of music instantly awakened a host of emotions - awe, wonder, longing and melancholy. When I saw this fictionalized story of his life I was thrilled. The Vexations begins with the grieving Satie family arriving, from Paris, on the doorstep of Mr. Satie’s mother. In a flash the widower departs leaving Erik, his sister and baby brother in the dubious care of their grandmother. Each child must then endure forced separation from one another as Erik is sent to boarding school, his sister to live with a great uncle and little brother to return to their father and his new wife. Their stories are told in alternating chapters as they subsequently seek ways to form relationships, a sense of family and reconciliation. The early loss, abandonment and separation figure intensely in each of their futures. The author does a fantastic job of creating the historical setting as a background with which to better understand the cantankerous and self destructive Satie. She possesses a deft touch, confidently expressing the highs and lows of Satie as well as his close contemporaries. She also offers more than a glimpse into the private hells of single women during la Belle Époque. Few escape spiraling downward. Some are redeemed. Satie dies young still tortured by self doubt, frustration at his inability to externalize his imaginative inner world, and feeling rampant jealousy towards others deemed more successful. It is clear that the years of pain and loss wore deeply on this family. Even without this book Satie would be remembered but the author has delivered a fascinating story worthy of such a creative man, his close companions and siblings....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 20, 2019","Sep 23, 2019","Mar 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42283234-the-vexations

The story perpetuates some myths while also managing to dig into the harsh realities. It revolves around two main characters. The man is an outtlaw on the run always looking over his shoulder for those who pursue him. He also happens to be a cameleer in love with his camel. He runs from the law towards the unknown. Some years back he discovers himself to inherit the wants of his surrogate brothers who just happen to be ghosts. From then on he is careful to avoid touching or in some cases gazing too long at the dead for fear of catching their wants. The woman is essentially on her own in the Arizona Territory. Her husband has left in search of water. Her oldest sons also disappear. She knows not where. She is in desperate need of water. There’s little help from those still with her - her young son, her husband’s distant cousin, and her mother in law who has suffered from a stroke and wheelchair bound is unable to move or talk. Although the woman is an almost stereotypical frontier type she is pictured as unique in her constant dialogue with her dead daughter’s spirit. So the outlaw and the woman share this. They communicate with the dead and have few options but survival. They carry within themselves their mistakes and the lies told for self preservation. They rely on ghosts to remind them of clarity, being true to oneself and to try their best to do what is right. There’s plenty of classic old west moments where the characters stand stubbornly proud against all odds. There are difficult choices to be made. This is an entertaining story of people who come to know themselves through the challenges they must face. Their connection to spirits becomes a conduit for sensing which decision to make. Overall the story maintained my interest. I found myself slightly frustrated towards the end when the author goes into what felt like an unnecessary detour. The story offers a look at how humans can find ways to be capable, strong and resilient against seemingly impossible odds....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Sep 28, 2019","Sep 30, 2019","Mar 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43064559-inland

Although it clearly paints an unrealistic pictures of life, it is, in the end, a story. A child claiming to be an alien appears seemingly out of nowhere. She inhabits the body of a dead human yet she’s managed to retain a luminosity which could reflect a higher dimensional frequency. Or, is she a barefoot and bruised runaway? How do you explain her sensitivity, incredible intelligence and highly creative nature? There are two humans, the woman scientist and her bearded neighbor, the egg man. Both in need of healing and understanding. The alien girl, Ursa, is on earth to earn her PhD by experiencing five miracles. She makes good things happen for those humans who are nice to her. Afterwards she will return to her home in the stars. The humans doubt her story, sometimes. They vacillate about what to do. Call the authorities? Search the web for missing children? Or perhaps find a way to settle in to the simple goodness she brings to their lives? A warm snug comforter of a story. A fairy tale for those who sometimes, just once in awhile, want to believe in the unconventional ways humans can change....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Sep 16, 2019","Sep 18, 2019","Mar 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40545956-where-the-forest-meets-the-stars

Not only the actual story but the writing. I am not going to repeat what it’s about and how lush the descriptions are.

This book made me angry.A woman who is vastly aware of her sexuality and using this to distract herself from her emptiness. The book ends with them in their 40s and they act like they’re 90. Oh no, more wrinkles. Distract yourself. Have another drink, consume, have sex with whoever and drink some more. It’s never enough. The whole lot of emptiness in these characters is never going to be filled. Is that the point? When your oldest daughter tells you that she doesn’t want to be like you then, and only then can you cut that elastic umbilical cord. You can also bail on your artificial marriage and travel the world to essentially do the same thing you have always done. And they wonder why their lives felt like one long day? Did I read the same book as others ? P.S. They routinely left lousy tips. Pretentious people in a world of veneer.Add on : suddenly I’ve come to realize or is that recognize why I disliked this book so much. Near the beginning the author writes words like - a Jew without money is like a dog ( or is it wolf ) without teeth. This pissed me off but I kept on. I finished this book which is loaded with stereotypical crap about Jewish men. I very wrongly assumed Salter was a dyed in the wool WASP. Ha! That’s exactly what he wanted the world to perceive he was. Salter, to my surprise, was Jewish. Probably no surprise to any of his many fans. What’s up with this man? Self hatred? Fear of not being successful because of his religion? Or was he an atheist? He changed his name. He didn’t want to be recognized.

His memories of his family flood his consciousness preventing him from both being present and connecting with others. He gets lost easily, falls asleep outside in the frigid Norwegian night, and struggles to recall events from the last 24 hours. Arvid wanders in the miasma of grief. His grief covers the range of human emotions as the reader finds him filled with rage followed by episodic sadness. His parents and younger brothers have been killed in an ferry accident years ago. Yet it seems time has stood still with each year adding another layer of alienation from others. Two people do enter his life with their very own versions of kindness and understanding. This book offers extraordinary insight into the world of survivor’s guilt.

He begins by contacting those “closest” to the dead young man, Samuel, and interviewing them to capture Samuel’s life before death. Each person that was deemed important in Samuel’s life has an opportunity to speak their mind. Few of them agree as to why he is dead and if it was a suicide or accident. Fingers are pointed. Blame is directed everywhere but on themselves. No one feels responsible. It is always the next character who is at fault. Slowly the narrative builds with each person’s role and their version of truth to culminate in the shattering conclusion. This is an examination of the inner workings of the mind. A story of people who are stuck at the point of seeing themselves through the critical gaze of others both in personal relationships and as immigrants. The author has an almost limitless understanding of what drives behavior, both productive and destructive. This is an intensely real story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 04, 2019","Mar 05, 2019","Mar 04, 2019",,,view (with text),/book/show/25750539-everything-i-don-t-remember

I still recall this odd mix of reactions when done. What did I just read? Why do I feel bereft and at odds with myself? Was that the author’s intentions? So I went for an ocean side walk and thought about Outline. For me, this book felt very distant and even cold. Sort of like forcing myself in Biology class to dissect a frog. The narrator felt so aloof. It was as if she perceived herself an empty shell who needed other people’s stories to flesh herself out. Or maybe her own life felt distant and she grabbed at other’s to find some equilibrium. And maybe I’m over thinking it. I likely missed something. I couldn’t find my reading rhythm with this one. It was tough going. I concluded imagining that maybe the next one in her trilogy would pull me closer - reveal what felt missing in the narrator.

She sheds light on the misery and harm induced by the flagrant abuse and elected ignorance of the powers that be in Putin’s Russia. Throughout this book, as well as her others, she exhibits an open minded willingness to grasp for the truth. Her way could never have been comfortable. In her search she was not one to close her eyes, ears and heart to that which made her vulnerable. As an open and generous soul she could relate to other being’s suffering and truly listen to what the people involved told her. This kind of empathy was central to her guiding principles. She sought to end suffering on both personal and universal levels by becoming aware of the root causes of political problems. When she picked up the sword of truth she had the wisdom and understanding of how to use it to defend those who suffered. There is a sparkling glow that surrounds her words. They are written with a genuine warmth and open mindedness. They effectively work against the dictatorial and brutal regime that sought to crush spirits and take up weapons to destroy. She invites us all to defend the disadvantaged and stand and fight with facts.

You know, where you read something that knocks the breath out of you or where you go through a box of tissues, and you want something “lighter” in the middle, before you dive into the deep end of the reading pool again. This is an enchanting story. Beginning in 1871 where young Maud is learning to not let any of the neighborhood boys steal her marbles. The reader is then taken to the MGM lot in 1930s Hollywood where The Wizard of Oz is being filmed. The story moves back and forth between her life alone, with Frank Baum the author of the OZ books, and on the set. Initially, I was laughing out loud until the feel of the story changes. It is always endearing but there are moments of desperate sadness and loss. It is beautifully written and a far more worthwhile read than I expected. Whenever I hear Somewhere Over the Rainbow it will have a considerably deeper meaning. ‘Magic isn’t things materializing out of nowhere. Magic is when a lot of people all believe in the same thing at the same time, and somehow we all escape ourselves a little bit and we meet up somewhere and just for a moment we taste the sublime.”...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Mar 02, 2019","Mar 03, 2019","Mar 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40265841-finding-dorothy

To understand her ability to concentraEsmeralda Weijun Wang wants to be a high functioning individual while she contends with her multiple diagnoses. To understand her ability to concentrate long enough, organize her thoughts to allow her to write these essays, and to seek costly medical and alternative type medical care is to come to the conclusion that she is financially very well off. She is not homeless, going hungry, under or unemployed,lacking facilities for hygiene, etc. As part of her high functioning “mask” she applies Tom Ford lipstick, Chanel foundation, and dresses in silk blouses. Though I find her writing to be quite interesting and even engaging I have to wonder at her perseverance and tenacity in spite of her myriad symptoms to write books, go on lecture circuits, stay married to the same person, and maintain friendships. My many years in working in VA hospitals, public hospitals, battered women’s shelters and homeless outreach have shown me that this is rarely the case. Does this make her essays less real? No. Just very, very different. Her content took me on a roller coaster ride of reactions. In the end, I close the book with a great deal of empathy for her. I question some of the research she alludes to and consider it anecdotal with much information missing. Nonetheless, I would never question the ribbon she ties around her ankle to stay tethered. Hey, whatever works. It’s a wonderful thing that she is able to express herself in writing as well. I suspect this will also, along with taking her medications, help to strengthen that tether....more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Feb 24, 2019","Feb 25, 2019","Feb 24, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40121993-the-collected-schizophrenias

Father and mother, environmental activists, meet while involved to varying degrees in a protest movement to prevent a dam being built. They join together, based on their initial and somewhat brief attraction. Once the mother learns she’s pregnant the father is gone without a moment’s notice. Sophie and her mother are at odds. Sophie is struggling with an eating disorder which she has thus far has managed to keep secret from her mum. She has nothing but disdain for her hippy mum and all her friends. She’s simultaneously placed her absent father on a pedestal and having spent no time with him in her 15 years easily idealizes him. She is ecstatic when she locates him and they decide to join forces on a long wilderness hike in the wilds of Tasmania. Much happens on this trek which I will leave for you to discover on your own. This is a touching, honest and painful look at a child’s need to be known, a father’s reluctance to honestly examine who he is, and a mother’s fearless love for her daughter. Wherever else happens will there be a family connection again?

For Lara, the 15 year old diarist, it is more like the jungle of interpersonal relationships. Her father and brother have remained in Switzerland as WWII rages on. Her mostly indifferent mother has brought her to live in Mexico along with a group of artists. Lara refers to them as loons. She feels invisible. She writes of how nice it would be to have someone to hold and tell your secrets to - instead of a diary which has no arms. The jungle is a place that hints at the possibility of danger. “ it is an ultimate foolishness to brave the jungle alone.” One of the artists living at the casita has created a painting which includes Lara. It hints at the possible dangers and terrifying possibilities of her sexuality. Her nightshirt stops above her buttocks and then nothing until her slippers. “The pink cleft and blue shoes. Things she is supposed to forget.” All around is the heat. The rain that threatens to arrive. Lara realizes there’s something dangerous out there but with little to keep her at home she hops astride a horse and off she goes.

Told in simple and direct language a story of a man lost to himself. It begins with his childhood as a poor Badawi longing for a sense of being loved, accepted and educated. He is determined to learn, and against all odds he succeeds, but at what cost? As time moves on he develops a relationship with Fadia. They make commitments to each other. Later, she represents a painful memory of his past, his bare feet, torn clothing, and paternal rejection. A piece of his father’s cold indifference cuts into his being. Money, power, and an artificial environment take hold. To recall the gentle empathy and kindness of his first teacher and to allow himself to feel Fadia’s love creates a vulnerability that he stubbornly rejects. The contrast of the oil rich anonymous rooms in prefabricated buildings with the wild perfume and freedom of the desert is at the center of his crisis.

Every now and then one finds a novel that repeatedly invites you to mark your place and do some further research. I didn’t keep track of all the new to me people and ideas. I have barely scratched the surface of exploring. I did make a partial list for the future. Clearly Rachel Kadish has done her research. With that said she didn’t lose me with an overly fact driven dry as the desert story. The characters were all interesting enough to keep me curious. At it’s most basic it tells a story of people who don’t fit the mold of their time in history and/or who limit themselves due to the inexperience of youth.

I almost wanted to understand the title. I almost stopped reading it. This book relies almost entirely on dialogue which makes it an easy and fast read. The whole story felt superficial and predictable. At no time was I engaged in contemplating the meaning of the story. The author explains everything for you leaving nothing to your imagination. It’s just not my kind of book. I had no emotional responses to the story even when the author tries to manipulate this outcome. The main female character practically wore a halo. Perhaps this could be read as a modern day cautionary tale - don’t fall in love in a war zone as a place like Colorado Springs can’t possibly offer the same emotional intensity to sustain your relationship.

One toast for each person. Beautiful stories about the people in his life, who they were and where they came from. He’ll reveal many hidden secrets of humiliations, revenge, loss, and triumphs as the evening rolls along. A never to be repeated offering. If he were a weaver, by night’s end he will have produced a finished cloth with the threads he so lovingly worked on his loom. He has come to the end of this cycle having emerged from the silence. All those experiences told with courage and dignity. His grief and regrets come in waves as his walls come tumbling down. “No one really knows loss until it’s someone you love. The deep down kind of love that holds on to your bones and digs itself right in under your fingernails, as hard to budge as the years of compacted earth. And when it’s gone...it is as if it’s been ripped from you. Raw and exposed you stand dripping blood all over the good feckin’ carpet. Half human, half dead one foot already in the grave.” His final toast to his wife left me reeling. When he recalls reaching his hand to the other side of the bed and finding nothing I felt that emptiness. No breath, heartbeat, whispers or warmth. Once that is gone you choose to live with the pain or get out. As the evening draws to a close, in the solitude of the hotel room, he dances a waltz with his wife-ghost singing just for her as the ferryman patiently waits.

If Mr. Farah had limited himself to the core ideas it would have been less jumbled up at the end. The story begins with parents living in Norway learning their son, who has moved to Somalia, has killed himself in a suicide bombing. The mother has promised her son that she will provide and care for his surviving widow and her son and daughter. The parents move the dead son’s family to Oslo. There the problems begin. The step children of the dead son strive to find their way subsequent to traumatic childhoods. The entire group lives in a place where two groups, Nazi inspired vigilantes and radical jihadists, ultimately victimize those stuck in the middle.

He said it was important to have a true friend - a soulmate. Someone you’d never lose, who would always be there for you. He said it was more important than love...Sometimes I think that’s who you are for me, or me for you. I can imagine us being friends all our lives, and I’m just so infinitely glad we got to know each other here.”Thus begins the emotional roller coaster ride of the soulmates. This is the story of Jules Moreau and his soulmate, Alva. Jules is alone in the world. His parents have been killed in a car accident. His brother and sister though physically nearby are worlds away. Alva enters his life and he is never the same. Over time they come together then separate only to come together again. They are kindred spirits. Their essences poured from a similar vessel. They understand this from the start and through all time. When they meet as separate beings they quickly become mirrors, companions and teachers to one another. They could never be just passing strangers. Fate ignited something sacred within them for good and bad. We watch as they ascend to the heights only to later crash and burn . Although the author references Nick Drake’s music their story reminded me of the Duran Duran song - Ordinary World. “Where is my friend when I need you most? Gone away.” Yet their closeness can’t be divided despite temporary separations. They carry on and over. This story serves to remind us to jump on in to those rare moments of connection. They are so precious. It’s a pull that goes beyond the rational and a shimmer so familiar it can’t be denied. This is what saves and sustains us all in the end. This story swept me away with emotion. When Jules reads Rilke’s poem to Alva - “Before us great Death stands Our fate held close within his quiet hands. When with proud joy we lift Life’s red wine up To drink deep of the mystic shining cup And ecstasy through all our being leaps - Death bows his head and weeps.” - I wept as well. I marked my place and stepped outside to think of all the emotions and memories this story conveys. It covers so much, creating feelings that took me beyond words and emptiness. Turns out his father’s advice was golden. It leads Jules to places of the heart far beyond his imagination.

Almost as soon as you begin reading there is a feeling of desperation emanating from Clyde, the father. For me this book is really about being a parent, more specifically a father. Clyde is a proud and honest man who deals with life and all it’s unfairness on his own terms. There are two sons, twins, Peter, the scholar and Paul, the one born last, deprived of oxygen, and sadly,labeled mentally retarded. Their mother’s Uncle Vishnu, is a mentor type for Clyde. He sees all that is good in Clyde and rewards this. In this land of petrochemical money there are the haves and the have nots. The novel exposes this aspect of life in Trinidad and the sordid underbelly of crime that so often is the end result. Fear supersedes all other emotions for Clyde and he must find the strength to corral this. This is a complex story of good versus evil and greed versus sacrifice.

Hauser practically takes you by the hand, offers you a comfortable seat and sits beside you to tell this story. Written with an intimacy and style that made me feel right at home. By the book’s end I felt as if I’d spent time with the characters rather than read words about them. Two half siblings travel, separately, to an island off Florida in an effort to grieve, discover what happened to their father, and to hopefully heal. I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. There are some twists and turns which though not necessarily unexpected, still result in a highly satisfactory conclusion. This reads with flow and change, the movement of life. The characters may halt what is to be, by crushing it, before their relationship has a chance to express all that it can become. Fresh and open, alive with the joys and sorrows of reunion and the potential of the pleasures in coming back together. Much like the legend of how the turtle got it’s shell which is an inherent piece of this story. A family breaking apart and maybe finding their way towards putting the pieces back together again.

The fact that he’s an immigrant is crucial to this story. There he was trying to mind his own business stepping off the curb after closing his shop. Why him? Did he do something to deserve this? Does he have enemies in this post 9/11 time? His family is astounded and overcome with grief. At first they have no answers. Each character has a chance to not only express their reactions but to travel back in time looking for clues and understanding. Lalami gradually fills in the blanks of the mystery. As the story evolves she reminds us that in those desolate times of loss memories come flooding in. The focus is on how some memories sharpen rather than dull with time. Each character has a different set of memories from the horrors of war in Iraq to watching with amazement the acrobats on the Jamaat el-Fna in Marrakech. Efraín, a Mexican immigrant, can’t escape his memory of witnessing the man, Driss, being killed. One can try to outwait these memories but the ghosts from the past have a way of keeping pace with the present. Then there are the secrets. All these secrets hidden away in private places barely if ever visible to even loved ones. Invisible until they manifest in varied forms - addiction, infidelity, longing for home, racism and love.

I chose this one mostly because of my unfamiliarity with it and it’s size. Before getting situated I thought to read the first few pages in an effort to validate my choice. I was hooked into the story way before I remembered to sit down and lose myself in a new story. Jonathan Weisman has a way with words.

A small group of men becomes transformed with the arrival of two unique women. They join their community adding a feminine element which creates a balanced universe of their own making.

They are there, each with their own reasons, to live away, far away from the rest of the world. Each man has built a cabin. “A cabin to live in was your companion in all your thoughts. With a cabin to live in, you were never alone.” The next woman to arrive has escaped, with the help of her uncle, from the mental institution where she was locked up as a 16 year old girl. Her true identity emerges and she selects a new name, Marie Desneige. The men build her the little house they feel she deserves believing “the insanity might be just that, too much sadness. She simply needed some space.” As she experiences the natural world around her for the first time the men can’t help but share in her delight. Her gift of vision allows her to see things previously hidden from others. The story twists and turns with love and death playing equally vital parts. This is such a wonderful story of a group of people who chose to move away and inhabit a hidden place like foxes in the undergrowth. They live in and with nature full of the rhythms and energies of the wild. The fire, warmth and the sparks of new relationships are a constant. The heat two characters bring each other in the bone chilling cold of winter grows as it’s tended into love. Feeding the wood stove to bring warmth as the group gathers round to tell stories keeps the long winter at bay. The sun’s warmth melts the snow and ice to bring summer around again. Round and around they go as the seasons change so do they. These folks learn to shine. They begin to give of themselves healing each other. They find out what’s been dormant and deep inside and feel their souls thaw. Each offers something, be it physically by holding someone close to allay their night terrors,by painting to express the stories of those long gone so they not be forgotten or by gracefully accepting the gift of a name to forge a new friendship. It just feels so damn good to read this. Everything in their lives they do for the good - never to the detriment of their fellow beings, human and animal. It’s about a journey each character takes to their own place of wisdom and forgiveness. This rag tag group of forgotten souls are united and moved by the mysteries which are seldom seen. A story as pure as birdsong and as full of it’s spontaneous joy and beauty....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jun 05, 2019","Jun 06, 2019","Jan 15, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16057370-and-the-birds-rained-down

The story is told by Adam and then shifts to the love of his life’s perspective. The unfolding events are related in words that glide while evoking a struggle. In less deft hands all the minute descriptions could become tedious. This is not the case with Ms. Olsson as her attention to detail provides the reader with a fine tuned sense of place.

Nunu is a young woman who has dropped this thread to several people from her past. She leaves London and her relationship with Luke behind when she learns her mother is ill. She returns to Istanbul to care for her until her death. With that she leaves a city she no longer recognizes and heads for Paris. Here she meets M an author. She knows M through his books and feels an affinity with him even before they meet. As fate would have it they begin a relationship that is, at first, based solely on corresponding. The loss of her parents and home as she once knew it has left her feeling empty. Those threads are gone. She is seeking a way to reconnect with life. For a time, through their letters, M appears to offer Nunu a way through her loss. He could be a person that will bring some peace into her troubled life. They share stories and a place of refuge. She begins to rely on M as her anchor in the storm. They eventually agree to meet in person. For a time he offers a hand that reaches out to steady her when life’s lessons are hard. Does he guide her to remembering the stories she shares? “That’s how I remember our friendship. We passed our stories back and forth until they merged. And with each pass, we lightened our own burden.” Though she is hard pressed to fully explain why, she acknowledges that her fear causes change. A shield is raised - a shield made of assumptions and anxieties. Words and gestures can be misused and misinterpreted to cause skepticism and separation. The temporary unity that replaced her desolation and fragmentation when they first connected and held the invisible thread seems to be gone.

In fact, it was one of those can’t put down til finished. Sardonically humorous. There are times when I cringed with embarrassment and shame for the characters. This story explores the basis for beliefs, be they the troubles in Northern Ireland or a cargo cult in Papua New Guinea. I shouldn’t forget to throw in the faith healing scene with the cross. The bbc team throw caution to the wind and indulge in what they are told is only slightly mood altering drink. The end result, and the rest of the book seem to, spin rapidly beyond the character’s controls.The book closes on a calmer note with as much resolution as one might hope for.

Family being those we are born into and those we take next to us, for the short or long haul. The female characters, having ample reasons to doubt, mistrust, and ultimately separate from the males, learn hard life lessons that result in their changed perception that monsters are the ones to fear. These monsters might be females. Ms. Vermette has written an incredibly complex story that sticks in the reader’s consciousness. When I was done I sat back, closed my eyes, and became lost in contemplating how our choices in life can take us to places we never intended to go. Each family member has a chance to be heard, those that are still here and those that have entered the spirit world.

There are parts of the story that made my breath stop, heart hurt, and created the visceral need to pause and step outside to collect myself. Yes, it is that intense. The writing style took some getting used to but once I’d aligned with it, the pace grew natural and even smooth. A picture of a family centering on the tormented figure of Clay. His brothers are equally troubled but entertaining as a family unit. The menagerie offers much needed comic relief. Penetrating into separation, loss, death and inevitable grief the oldest sibling narrates. The story meanders through each character’s life some to a greater extent than others. Zusak tells us of the importance of making peace with the past and of the need to both hold and release ourselves from the potential prison of memory. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 28, 2018","Dec 29, 2018","Dec 28, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7767276-bridge-of-clay
