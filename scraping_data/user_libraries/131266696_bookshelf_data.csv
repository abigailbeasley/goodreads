Going to try and give a  without giving away spoilers so here we go:I LOVE a multi-character interwoven tale - especially one over the course of thousands of years. I thought the continuity was very clever and seamless, and I loved the owl symbolism throughout. I really felt attached to Zeno particularly, he was such a sweetly written narrator. His last chapter made me tear up.My warning for this book is that readers have to be patient. It’s a little slow at the beginning and REALLY picks up the pace in the second half. I personally couldn’t put it down for the last two sittings. Don’t let the page count be daunting, there’s a lot of blank pages switching between narrations.My biggest gripe is that I wasn’t so interested in Anna’s or Omeir’s stories and was always a bit disinterested when I had to go back to their POVs. I understood the importance of them but … eh. My second biggest gripe is that we didn’t get enough of Konstance’s story. Her’s was certainly the most exciting and action packed tale, and yet they wrapped her story up WAY too quickly and IMO left the world building severely underdeveloped. Without getting into the weeds of it, I still have so many unanswered questions! Her time jump really threw me off and I was really bummed we didn’t get more context, I could’ve read a book of just her journey alone so I was really bummed that hers felt the most rushed....more",Notes are private!,1,2,1,"Mar 11, 2024","Mar 30, 2024","Mar 11, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/56931626-cloud-cuckoo-land

It’s a very moving portrait of loss, human connection, and how the two are knotted together.Here’s why it doesn’t get the 5 star from me: I felt myself getting aggravated with a couple of the narrators Colum introduced to us to, albeit he wove them together very cleverly. I wished we got less of some characters and wayyy more of others, some of their stories felt a bit unfinished to me.I also found some aspects of his style a bit superficial in terms of character voice (I also REALLY disliked the very long repetitive paragraphs, ie. “Death by _____” repeated I believe upwards of 20 times). But he also creates gorgeous imagery that really transported me.Despite my complaints, I couldn’t put it down when he finally started connecting the dots between characters.

To start, this is such a beautifully written book, every detail feels meticulously planned to create each city scape and social circle of Paris. I really did feel transported to every smoky bar, every uneven street, and of course - to Giovanni’s room.The love story centering this book is such a delight to read (at first). The scene of them eating oysters and drinking white wine at 6 in the morning will always stick with me. It feels very much like a coming of age story, which always have a soft spot in my heart.Now comes the worst part of this book and the reason I couldn’t give this book a 5 star: our narrator, David. David becomes not only the worst character of the book, but to me, one of the most despicable characters that I’ve read. I found myself rooting for every person that lashed out on David for his selfish and manipulative actions. His ‘woe is me’ attitude was the worst, he just got worse and worse as the book went on and I was frustrated to have to “stick with” his perspective throughout the story. This got me thinking; do I *~have~* to like a narrator in order to truly rate a book? Isn’t my hatred of him exemplifying how talented James Baldwin is as a writer? This book is so wonderfully written otherwise, do I really need to identify with the narrator in order to enjoy it? I don’t know the answer right now, but it gave me something to think about moving forward with my ratings.Overall, this is an incredible story if you’re looking for something fast to break your heart. I watched the James Baldwin documentary ‘I Am Not Your Negro’, based off the completed pages of his last, unfinished novel before he died, before finishing the book and it gave me some great insight to James as a whole. I’m definitely going to look more into his work and his life after this....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 13, 2024","Feb 26, 2024","Dec 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17288631-giovanni-s-room

This is one of the most frightening books I’ve read in awhile, and certainly not for the squeamish. Octavia wastes NO time before jumping headfirst into the thick of it. Despite the plot being unfathomable, Dana, our protagonist, is logical in her theories and actions, making this all the more spooky to me; It feels way closer to home this way.The most impressive part of this book is watching the characters sway between protagonist and antagonist. We see characters act on their own volition and turn on a dime—not particularly tied to either side— which makes them all the more fascinating, unpredictable, and real.An absolutely gripping story all the way through.

The plot is repetitive and boring. I felt like I forgot what had just happened in it every time I picked it back up.

Never mind the fact that he’s grieving (which is one of the only redeeming qualities of the book being the depiction of a teen dealing with a traumatic loss), I just never found myself rooting for him. Sure, I felt sorry for him, but that’s about it.Overall this was a huuuuuge let down.

Barbara moves seamlessly between each of our narrators, and her attention to detail is incredible—down to the innocent misspellings of a 5 year old, the eerie palindromes of a stoic and crippled genius, and the incorrect use of words from a vain, dumb teenager. This book is overflowing with beautiful, haunting metaphors and imagery. I was captivated the whole time and invested in each out our narrators’ journeys. She never left me hanging when it came to wrapping up every character’s arc, which I really appreciated. The character development was one of my favorite facets of this novel, I was so impressed by how natural it all felt to read. It just … made sense. There’s no other way to describe this work except incredibly poetic.

I’ve heard wonderful things about Joan’s writing style, and these essays certainly upheld that notion, but I often found myself bored of the topics.

Especially as an only child as well, I’ve never related to a book to this same degree before. I felt connected with Michelle, and everyone else who has gone through the ringer of losing a parent in your early twenties. This kind of loss such an isolating experience, and yet it still unites us at the core to have look into the face of death and hold the burden of knowing the ugliest truth about the world. Michelle does a wonderful job of conveying the trials and tribulations of navigating taking on a new role in her family as a caretaker (and eventually) an executor while balancing it with newfound trauma and grief.This book is so raw and devastating but it’s real. It’ll always hold a really special place in my art as the book that showed me just how beautiful the art made from this type of pain can be. The love she has for her mother is so palpable and it’s shown me the importance and power of creating art as a guide to memorialize a loved one. To be honest, if I hadn’t have gone through this type of loss before I don’t think I would’ve rated this book nearly as high as I did.

I’ve read my fair share of him so I was expecting the all over the place, ridiculous writing style. It was a quick read, but I can’t tell you much of anything that happened in this book. The tangents about characters that we hear from ONCE, and countless descriptions of short, made up sci fi books that aren’t relevant to the plot at all, take up a lot of page real estate, and make staying focused a little difficult. I don’t think this is his best, or his funniest, work by any means. I think there’s a lot of bullshit, a lot of pointless drawings, and not a whole lot of story progression. That being said, I still found myself flying through it, because I did love the storyline itself, but I just didn’t get *~enough~* of it.

Good, fun story, but I found myself annoyed with our two protagonists towards the end and felt like almost, if not all, of the characters lacked depth.Additionally, this book was soooo corny AND horny for no reason. “Of course, she thought, math plus desire equals who you really are.” WHAT does that even mean?

This book is gorgeous and captivating but it is also a cesspool of anxiety and despair. It broke my heart soooo many times. Donna weaves such an incredible story, it’s almost too real sometimes. I’ve never been so anxious over a book before. This, of course, got me thinking: isn’t this what a good book is supposed to do? Immerse readers in a world and make them really feel with the character? To understand and care for fictional beings?? But honestly, it was too much sometimes, especially with how tragic it is from start to finish.This book was an absolute behemoth. It covers SO much ground, sometimes too slowly, but it was never a bore to read. Looking back, there’s a lot of fluff in its nearly 800 pages, but it’s all so beautiful. I would give this a five star  if it weren’t for the anxiety. Despite it being such a phenomenal book, I’m fairly hesitant to openly recommend it.

While I think Jane’s ‘slow burn’ romantic plots are delicious, I find them a little predictable at this point. For some reason, that still doesn’t deter from my audible gasping at one of her classically dramatic declarations of adoration. I love Jane for that dearly.On top of a slow burn, Jane loves to throw in a wrench of two seemingly unsuited side characters getting quickly married in secret. I couldn’t help but be a tad disappointed at this particular plot line, thinking I had the rest of the book figured out already. However, there was another element of deception (that I haven’t seen in her others) that really elevated the storyline for me and kept me engaged.I’m fortunate to have read my Jane Austen’s in the order I did: Pride and Prejudice first, then Emma, and finally Persuasion. It was so sweet to follow her growth as an author throughout her life, and each ranked in ascending order as I went along. Jane’s writing is a fine wine, and only got better with time. As this was her last completed novel, I truly think it’s her best—and to be a little crass— an incredible high note to go out on.There’s something so satisfying about reaching the climax of one of Jane’s books, which tend to happen 1 or 2 chapters before it ends. Some would find it frustrating to have to wait so long for it, but Jane has a way of making all of it feel *~worth~* it. Like I, as a reader, FINALLY deserved it, and how perfect it was.

The reason being because I am the sole er, and thus (probably) the only audience that will read it.I’ll be 100% honest: I got this book in the ‘romance’ section of a rare and used bookstore thinking it was gonna be an old English and slightly smutty read. I was not looking for story. I wanted to reminisce on the time I did a project on Aphrodite in fourth grade and thus was allowed to read promiscuous Greek myths for hours on end under the guise of ‘research’.In short: I was wrong. This book centers around the escapades of Catherine the Great and took on a common theme of sex, jealousy, and death. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a HUGE fan of secrecy and yearning, but it got repetitive and boring. The most popular and closest thing to sexy this book got was constantly describing Catherine’s boobs as anything ranging from ‘massive’ to ‘spilling out the top of her corset’, you get the gist. It was nothing special nor crazy; we get it, she’s got huge knockers.Was it a quick read? Yes. Does the red hardcover look incredible on my ‘read’ bookshelf? Yes.

Certainly not. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Sep 21, 2022","Oct 04, 2022","Feb 04, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/797364.Venus_and_Adonis
