With the caveats that I don't usually read crime/police fiction, and that I read Robert Galbraith's (JK Rowling's) Cuckoo Calling just before--and she is a hard act to follow--I was properly impressed. Dilts does not cuss as much as Rowling, btw. Not by a long shot.For those who live in or near Long Beach, CA, the added treat is that all the action is carefully mapped out for you. Almost to the point of being annoying; in fact, if I lived in Texas or Rhode Island I probably would have found the constant mentioning of streets a bit much. But I don't. I have lived in LB & am now close, so it was fun!Dilts has written three of these Long Beach mysteries. I assume they all feature the same cast so I will be reading the other books as well to catch up. (this was the most recent in the series, not the first.

They did this book a tremendous disservice.I think the problem the ers had was that they wanted to identify the protagonist with Peter Mattheissen. In doing so, they missed the entire point of the character. Possible spoilers here: Reviewers found the flirtation (I won't even call it a romance) odd and awkwardly placed. I did not. Given the character, and the lengths he has gone to in order to insulate himself from the truth, seeing him use any available woman as a distraction made perfect sense to me.I have to say as a 60-year-old who saw those awful pictures of concentration camps first in middle school, where they made a deep impression, the discussion of the Holocaust as it settles into history was eye-opening. Not everyone sees those pictures as I did. The holocaust has become, as Matthiessen says, ""a ghostly horror already withdrawing into myth.""This book is flat-out amazing, and I suggest you also read the last interview with Peter Matthiessen in the Smithsonian Magazine--May 2014.

Enjoyed this immensely, partly because the author took his time telling us how the old man joined up, got into outer space, made friends, got trained--he just didn't plunk him into the middle of a battle, and after a page or two write, ""But it wasn't always this way.

Is Clara a pretty, petty narcissist or the victim of overbearing parents and her cursed beauty? But the best part of the book, to me, is how completely Maguire projects one point of view, through all the complications of growing up in an unkind world, never knowing who the enemy truly is.

Who hasn't felt their life spin out of control, who hasn't lost someone they love, and who hasn't been self-destructive? In two ways it is a lot like Eat Pray Love--which a couple of friends compared the book to. First, it is about a woman who feels she's lost her way and hatches a challenge to get herself right. Which isn't so different than many novels about men, right? The second similarity is that both Elizabeth Gilbert and Cheryl Strayed are fantastically talented writers. Here's an example of Strayed's prose from page 191 of 315, talking about walking:Foot speed was a profoundly different way of moving through the world than my normal modes of travel. Miles weren't things that blazed dully past. They were long, intimate straggles of weeds and clumps of dirt, blades of grass and flowers that bent in the wind, tress that lumbered and screeched. They were the sound of my breath and my feet hitting the trail one step at a time and the click of my ski pole. The PCT had taught me what a mile was. I was humble before each and every one...Beyond those two points, the books are vastly different. I would not call Wild upbeat, and Strayed doesn't really ever tell us what she learned. We experience part of the journey with her and see her surmount pain, etc., but we're not invited to hang around and watch her analyze the lessons learned. That's just fine; we get enough to see what she's made of and can draw our own conclusions, but Eat Pray Love seems almost sugar-coated in comparison.The ending isn't really important in this book, it's the rich, varied, arduous journey. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 27, 2013","Jun 28, 2013","Jun 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12262741-wild

If you like history, especially the kind of history that backs Shakespeare's plays, you will enjoy this series.This is the 5th book in the series, I think, and perhaps if I'd read the first 4 I'd warm up to the character a bit more. We see the daily doings of a 15th-century nunnery through the eyes of several characters, but mostly through Sister Frevisse's. She's the ""Miss Marple"" of the series, but stern and no-nonsense. This particular murder mystery has two boys--age 5 and 6--in the center, and I found it so interesting that, while some scenes were viewed from their perspective and others from the adults' perspective, NO ONE responded to or acted toward these kids as we would towards young children today. No coddling. No talking down to. I've read that children were considered little adults in the Medieval Era, and this book bears that out.I love history, so the only time I read mysteries is if history is involved.

Yes, she overcomes molestation, her mother's alcoholism, and other issues--but the story is much more about moving ahead rather than dwelling on past hurts. As she says on one page: ""Yes, I had a history, but my history was only the foundation for my life work.""There are many gems of wisdom in here and I especially liked the parts where a situation is turned around because of a conscious choice to change one's attitude. Thomas' trip to Agate Beach, for example. And definitely, I want a do-over of the 1970s. Thomas got a lot more out of that era than I did.

The book is full of large and small incidents, some will move you, some not. Some quotes jump out and deserve prolonged thought, but I think they'll vary with each reader. One caveat: in her introduction, Thomas explains that the ""Pebbles"" at the end of each short chapter explain the meaning of each incident and the lesson learned. She says if that annoys the reader--if you'd like to draw your own conclusions without help--just skip them. However, I found that some of the Pebbles contained important elements of the story in them, so I strongly advise NOT skipping them.This is a very gentle book, not a hit-you-over-the-head-with-my-views book.

I wound up with a lot more respect for most (but not all). The Presidents Club describes the relationships between ex-presidents and current presidents, from the time of Truman up through the Obama administration (it was published in 2011.) The authors, both editors at Time, dig into archives and biographies for letters, interviews, oped pieces, and anecdotes that shed light on these men and how they got along (or didn't, in some cases.) These are/were unique men with great abilities--and sometimes, great flaws. Their anecdotal stories are told in chronological order, which is sometimes confusing. Depending how old you are and what you remember, you may want to dive right into the president you remember best, and get some insight into what was going on behind the scenes. But be forewarned--these stories are not biographies and are not thorough. The book maintains its focus on ex-presidents and the interplay of their personalities--not on wives or world events or anything else, except in the most superficial way.In the conclusion, the authors write,"" If the Presidents Club had a seal, around the ring would be three words: cooperation, competition, and consolation."" Those three Cs pretty much sum it up--but I'll add that competition sometimes erupted into feuds that lasted for years, or muttered accusations of meddling and treason.

Not just weeds, but weeds that have worked into the foundation of their home and are struggling to grow while Joe is determined to rip them out and preserve his home. Joe's mother doesn't come home when she should, and Joe's world is never going to be the same. How it changes, and how he adapts while fighting to protect what he loves, is the story.There's violence and death, set against a background of community and unpredictability. Erdrich writes of reservation life, so the community is rich and different from what most readers know. The storytelling is unique and exotic, but the foibles--the drinking and arguing and whatnot--of families are very familiar.No one acts in a predictable way; few people quietly settle for the status quo when they're given a chance to try something new or different. WHether it's Grandma advising young men on juicy sex (her advice is not welcome, but hard to ignore), or Sonja deliberately inciting every man in her life, or Joe's careful and deliberate father losing control--no one does what you expect, but what they do is always exactly right for them.This  may sound meandering because I don't want to give much away.

He's a college professor, so we go with him into the classroom, the cafeteria, the gym, to a friend's home, out to a bar, etc. Along the way we learn why he is alone, what he fears, what he hopes for. He's hard on himself and is blunt about the masks he wears. As a gay man in 1962, there are many masks to be donned and taken off.Nothing blows up, no mystery is solved, no one falls in love with a vampire.Yet this book is absolutely worth your time to read, if only to expose yourself to really good writing and a no-holds-barred character study. My favorite passage, very near the end, describes tide pools. It's absolutely wonderful. But any other summary I could make would do it a terrible diservice, so you'll have to read it yourself....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 27, 2012",Dec 2012,"Nov 27, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16842.A_Single_Man

Her Fearful Symmetry is an unscary ghost-story, but it's creepy in a different way. Niffenegger excels at exposing the little power grabs and games that underlie almost every conversation. In this books, she gathers some truly bizarre characters--one undead--and lets them have at it. Who's pushing whose buttons? What's the real aim? Can you love someone deeply and still manipulate them (in Niffenegger's world--Yes. Everyone does.)And what does the title have to do with the story? Ah, got it from Wikipedia. A reference to a poem.I'm adding one thing to this , as I've read others who (rightly) point to a hole in the plot regarding Robert's actions. That ""hole"" didn't bother me because I've met men like Robert in 2 ways: First, they are perennial students, never finishing their PhDs. Second, they often hook up with older, more stable partners who will pay the bills and indulge their lack of responsibility. That doesn't mean those relationships aren't deeply loving--quite the opposite. So I bought into Robert's actions/lack of action.One criticism: Ms. N: When you let us in everyone's head, you have to be honest. If there's an evil plot afoot--throw us a bone, for cryin' out loud. Maybe there were clues that I missed, but I don't think so.And one note of awestruck praise: No one--except maybe Larry McMurtry--can change point-of-view in the middle of a paragraph. It's verbotten. You just don't. But Niffenegger does, and it works. To all other writers: don't try this at home. (I realize that others have criticized her on this point, but I think the pov changes added a bit of whimsy.)...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Nov 05, 2012","Nov 05, 2012","Nov 05, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6202342-her-fearful-symmetry

No ghost writer, no celebrities, no artsy metaphors. Not that I have anything against artsy metaphors.John Montandon lost his father to AIDS in the 1980s, when it was such a feared disease that no one wanted to be near those infected. The loss hit him hard.More than half this book is the memoir of a childhood lived on a West Texas farm. Parts of it make one cringe (children driving trucks? Argh!) and parts make one envious. We should all have had such fun. The author also recalls dangerously crazy teachers, segregation and its acceptance, and lots of things we don't associate with idyllic childhoods--because it wasn't really idyllic. It just was the way he was raised.Montandon takes us through all this so we'll understand how deeply he loved his father, and how hard the unfairness of disease and the betrayal of doctors hit his family.Whether you read to learn something, or just to be entertained or moved, I highly recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 06, 2012","Jul 22, 2012","Jul 06, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13741974-by-his-own-blood

Wacky book, feels like light reading but it is not.Swamplandia is about a family that lives in isolation, wrestling alligators for the Florida tourists on their own private island. They are unique, proud, and independent...then Mom dies, the star of the show and of their lives, and everything falls apart.The family aches, they abandon each other, they get lost and fall into impossible situations. Life is cruel. The reader is not always sure what is real and what isn't--just like the confused teenagers in the book. The swamplands of Florida are more than just a setting--the story could not exist in another venue. Russell's writing is wonderful; you can feel the close humidity as you turn the pages, tempted to bat away imaginary mosquitoes.I don't know what to compare the book to; Geek Love, maybe. In some ways, A Confederacy of Dunces. It takes place in a world that can't possible exist, but which must have been real sometime. The characters don't just grow; they shatter and reform.

We see through varying characters, changing by chapter. The movie reflected all the action; the book goes painstakingly over every small thought that eventually leads to action.One extreme example--an 8-page chapter describing the thoughts of a woman fighting off a migraine while listening to the small noises in her house--noises that result from actions already described in previous chapters.Knowing what is coming, I haven't the patience to stay with it.

First, without ever being pedantic or lecturing, the narrator completely enveloped me in her world. The prose--which were delicate and passionate at the same time--showed me what was normal, what was a given, what she accepted without question. I could just relax and let her guide me through the story.Second, the story line. If you know the story of Jacob and his 12 sons, you'll be surprised at what is mentioned and what isn't. Dinah does not experience the famine that drove Jacob's sons to Egypt, for example, because of the . . . well, 'protected isolation' she lives in at that time. Because of things like that, the book is not predictable; it can surprise. Third, the pacing. OK, everybody's different when it comes to how fast or slow they want their novels to move, but this book was perfect for me. A slow but never boring beginning in which I got to know everyone, see them change, and then blast me with some action that rearranges everything.Highly recommended for any female who enjoys historical fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 09, 2012","May 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4989.The_Red_Tent
