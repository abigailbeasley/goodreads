DEAD LWe discovered the miniseries of Slow Horses and were completely entertained, so while I wait for new seasons, I'm delving into the book series. DEAD LIONS is the second installment, and a former agent is found dead on a bus; the cause is purportedly a heart attack, but there are reasons to be suspicious. Min and his partner (both romantically and occupationally) get called in to coordinate a mission for Spider, River is investigating undercover, and Jackson Lamb continues to intrigue. Is his disgusting demeanor a front, or is he truly a despicable individual with no care for others?There were necessary departures made when the book was converted to a miniseries, and I enjoyed noticing the differences.

He absorbs knowledge and languages, making astute connections and becoming unrecognizable to his previous self. One could argue he became too smart, leading to isolation and lack of sympathy.Charlie sees his life as never before and enters into romantic relationships. What is the cost and gain of such scientific interventions? Was it really worth it? He realizes his ""friends"" at work were often teasing him at his expense, mocking him without his knowledge. Charlie delves into his childhood memories as they resurface. We are reminded that everyone has innate value, even if that was not fully seen before. The themes lead themselves to discussion and reflection, and the arc of the story is heartbreaking.I listened to this as an audiobook, and the narrator was exceptional, evolving and devolving as the text demanded. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 24, 2024","Mar 18, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18373.Flowers_for_Algernon

This is an excellent primer, part memoir, part historical account. Unlike some in power who want to castigate those who leave as doing so to spiral into unhealthy practices, McCammon understands the nuance of leaving due to hypocritical leaders seeking power over character. She articulates aspects of my own journey and thought processes. I continue to be a person of faith, but I felt a little spiritually homeless for many of the reasons articulated here. This book also reads as a who's who in recent evangelical circles: Joshua Harris, Jeff Chu, Tyler Huckabee, Sarah Bessey, Rachel Held Evans, Beth Moore, Abraham Piper, Russell Moore, and others are referenced.The audiobook is narrated by the author; people are often drawn to authors reading their own work, and as McCammon also worked as a journalist for NPR, she is well qualified to narrate her book.

Rubin takes a more relaxed approach than Marie Kondo as she suggests our demeanor is influenced by our surroundings. She offers helpful tips without judgment, reinforcing how what works and what is important is what matters to the individual. It's not about minimalism, unless that is of value to you; outer order is about wanting what we have.The audiobook was a quick listen and I have no doubt I'd pick up a physical copy were I to spot one at a book sale, as it could be valuable to revisit and flip through. I realized I'd heard of her one-minute rule before and had employed it (but had mistakenly internalized it as the two-minute rule, not that it was detrimental in any way to do so). I jotted down her top ten tips for creating outer order; I don't know if I'm ready to incorporate them all (honestly, this is the intensely busy time of year at work, which might be another reason why I was drawn to reflecting on establishing more inner calm), but I see myself revisiting them at different times of the year....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 17, 2024","Mar 16, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39901314-outer-order-inner-calm

Then she alphabetizes it all to form a new creation.The outcome leads to both more privacy in some situations (Heti doesn't shy away from discussing sexual encounters, so pronouns out of context can remove identifying features). Additionally, we can gain more insight and understanding through this process: when sentences start with the same individual, we find a host of descriptors: perhaps a friend is brilliant, gifted, wonderful, but also ineffective and a poser. She loves a partner, adores them, then judges them and finds fault. We see the evolution of situations play out, but we can also find fragments sprinkled throughout and wonder if they tie together (""Is this related to that other scene?"").I couldn't help but reflect on my initial, obnoxious response when I first went to a modern art gallery. I walked away from multiple exhibits going, ""I could make that. Therefore, it's not art."" One of my artist sisters gently but pointedly put me in my place, informing me that sure, while I could do something like that, this person was the first; they saw the potential and the art in something, so they made it happen and invited us to consider something in a new light, to see it as art.Heti took a gamble on this exercise, and it is a successful, interesting venture. I'd be interested in hearing more from her about this project; did she do any editing of her entries? When did this idea occur to her? Was it while she was still writing in her diary? I can't help but wonder if she found herself trying to alter the words that began her sentences to get more range, and whether there were there any topics too sacred or private that were excluded.The audiobook is narrated by Kate Berlant; she does a notable job adding nuance and energy into the disparate parts. While Berlant is an adept reader and I have no complaints or criticisms on her performance, I might suggest those intrigued with this title to encounter it in its print or digital medium, simply so they can soak it in and more easily return to various sections of the book.(I received a digital ALC from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my honest .) ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2024","Jan 20, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127282792-alphabetical-diaries

This title is one my oldest daughter enjoyed, and I've also seen it on other recommended lists, so I encountered it as an audiobook (a favorite medium, as of late).Our protagonist Iris is deaf; she is grieving the recent death of her grandfather, which has led to her grandmother entering a nursing home and struggling with depression.Iris loves to fix radios and has the typical childhood struggles (getting in trouble at school, her frustration with her mom's expectation that she fit in and her dad's lack of effort in learning ASL). Iris finds a new focus when she learns of Blue 55, a whale that can't be understood by other whales due to its frequency falling outside of theirs. She is determined to helps this whale find a community, and that search ends up mirroring her own journey.I had no problems suspending my disbelief when we would get snippets from the whale's point of view, but I did struggle to wrap my mind around the journey she took with her grandmother, as that felt more unbelievable.

To close, the book contains longer liturgies which can be adapted for communal use, plus a framework for drafting your own liturgies.Riley follows a formula for each chapter: she opens with quotes from black artists and authors, pens a letter, then a poem and specific prayers for the chapter's theme follow, for it to close with breath prayers, a confession, forgiveness, a benediction, and questions for contemplation. This book helps illustrate intersectionality; this book is not meant specifically for me, but it still connects. As a woman, a people pleaser, a perfectionist, time and again this book offered a release from those pressures.

How do I not waste my time in dissatisfaction but instead savor the day before me? Danes are often described as the happiest people, and Meik Wiking wants to explore why that might be so, and how others can achieve equal footing. Wiking attempts to define features of the Danish idea of hygge, but it is complex. It's relaxed thoughtfulness. Equality. Comfort. Clothing that is comfortable and stylish (and, as a knitter, I was tickled to hear of their love of giant scarves -- YES!). Lighting (the annual candle consumption for Danes is astonishing). A healthy balance between work and home.A provided hygge manifesto elaborates on the key features. It is a well suited lifestyle for introverts, as hygge is most often found in smaller groups, but that can be a detraction, as well for some -- as an outsider, it can be lonely and hard to break in, as it's not conducive to expansion.There is humor throughout the slim book; in the chapter discussing how one might decorate a home to achieve this principle, we read, ""Basically you want to think, 'How would a Viking squirrel furnish a living room?'""I was drawn to this mentality, as it helps me define my current values. How do I create an environment, a schedule, a lifestyle that isn't rushed but prioritizes experiences and mental well being? My oldest caught a couple minutes of the audiobook in the chapter discussing the important of light. She's all about acquiring and lighting candles at the moment, and I've gotten some traction from her regarding tidiness (""This cluttered coffee table isn't hygge - can you clean it?""). It's also given her ammunition of sorts: ""Mom, we need a new lamp in the playroom. It's too glaring and NOT hygge! It hurts my spirit.""As an aside, while listening to this I spotted our cat on our new chair, squirreled between a pillow and my plush blanket, blissed out and napping, and I realized she just exudes hygge.
