i see right through me”, encapsulates this book perfectly.the lonethe bridge of the archer: “they see right through me, can you see right through me? i see right through me”, encapsulates this book perfectly.the loneliness; the bargaining with the universe; being loved and loving people; the fear of growing up; the fear of the possibility of never being happy; the perpetual struggle between living for yourself and the people you love; the terror of being an unhappy place to the people who love you; the fear of a job or something so permanent in your life being the wrong choice; everything around you changing; the nostalgia for moments you can never get back.harriet and i mirror each other in so many ways, and reading it in words across a book made me feel so seen and comforted. this book is for the girls who worry and worry, worry if they’re good enough, worry if they’ve achieved enough, worry if they’re enough. worry if they love people too much, worry if they love people too little. worry if they’re a catalyst for something bad that happens. worry if they’re too temporary or maybe too permanent. who have nostalgic happy moments on a loop in their heads. who feel the loneliness more with people around them than when they’re alone.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻this part contains spoilers“stupid, stupid, stupid heart. don’t you know he hasn't been yours to cry over for a long time?”“it’s this feeling like the universe is compacting around me while something in my rib cage is expanding. i’m the culmination of their lost dreams, their missed other lives, and at the same time, they’re proud of me.”“i sit on the edge of the bed, feeling the loneliness swell, not knowing whether it's pressing against me from the outside or growing from within. either way, it's inescapable, my oldest companion.”preface: i rated this book on a completely different scale from emily henry’s other books or romance books in general. the reason why i loved this book so much, was not the romance but harriet’s introspection and character. its tones were much more subtle and nuanced, much reminiscent of a lit fic in some parts.harriet and i are vastly different in personality. she is much more outgoing, warmer, and patient than i am. but our fears and anxieties clicked, which emily henry did such an excellent job of writing about. especially her description of loneliness—i think it might be my favorite part she's written.wyn was an interesting character to me because he seemed so unlike other male protagonists. he feels like alex in a way, but the way his emotions and thoughts are wired is different. weirdly, i still don’t believe that he and harriet fully understand the reason that they broke up or they didn’t work out. they talked about their feelings, but did they truly hear one another? or did their worst fears get in the way of truly unpacking it and instead just tried to bandage it up as quickly as possible to appease one another?wyn’s constant need to feel loved or feel like he matters, and harriet’s constant fear that she will make people around her unhappy—i feel like it will eventually crash and burn again. wyn’s dad dying was a sort of superficial wound because it was an external circumstance/dent in their relationship. harriet quitting her job (although she was unhappy) also feels like a bit of an over-correction and a bandaid to the true problem.but i disregarded almost all of that during my read because of how much they love each other. it’s the first romance book i read where i could palpably feel how much and how desperately they love each other—not in an angsty or sexual way, but just how overwhelmingly they care about each other. and how intrinsically they understand each other (up until the aforementioned part). and also how they try their best to show that love in the way they think the other wants. the way wyn, in flashbacks, always reassures harriet that he will always love her. the way harriet represses all of her immense guilt so she can be the strong one for wyn. small gestures throughout the book that they are always trying to read and understand the other.that made this a very magical read, in a way.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻this was literally AMAZING.i’ll be rereading again & writing a full  in a bit but all you have to know is that this has book lovers’ banter and beach read’s introspection. not so much a huge rom com like her other books but it’s much more mature and melancholy and UGH there are some passages i teared up at.5/5 for the moment <3thank you berkley for the arc!!⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻pre-readEMILY HENRY I WILL HIBERNATE UNTIL APRIL FOR YOU REALLY I SWEAR IT'S NO PROBLEM DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT...more",Notes are private!,10,2598,1,"Jan 14, 2023","Jan 14, 2023","Jul 25, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61718053-happy-place

GILBERT: DIE U FOOLday 8 [chapter 15 & 16]gilbert is the poster asshole for: ""if i can't be happy, everyone around me has to suffer"".but also: ""because, i imagine there must be only a very, very few men in the world, that i should like to marry; and of those few, it is ten to one i may never be acquainted with one; or if i should, it is twenty to one, he may not happen to be single, or to take a fancy to me.""day 9 [chapter 17 & 18]i am currently knee deep in a 20 page paper that is due in six hours, but i am soldiering on because this obviously takes precedent (i know, my priorities are absolutely in order).short update for helen graham and helen graham only: i'm sorry i called you sanctimonious you are actually amazing i love you.day 25 [chapter 45&46]long story short—i am sad to report that this feels like bad school required reading for me. it was a three star at one point but...it might be going down. guys, this is just so dull and pointless. i hate everyone in this book. i read this drunk yesterday which made it slightly better because some parts were funny (i don't think they were supposed to be funny). but alas, i am almost at the end. i must finish. stay tuned to see who wins at the end: me or anne bronte's brick of a book.——————————previous readsmarch: middlemarch...more",Notes are private!,1,76,1,"Mar 31, 2022","Apr 27, 2022","Feb 05, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14760529-the-tenant-of-wildfell-hall

(hide spoiler)]but all in all, i really can’t complain. i am stupidly picky about romance books, and this really did it for me. will definitely be rereading in 2022 again because who am i if not a chronic rereader?⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻mini i am so torn on what to rate this because past elliot+macy are a 100/100 but present elliot+macy are like a 2/5....more",Notes are private!,0,92,1,"Aug 22, 2021","Aug 22, 2021","Aug 24, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36206545-love-and-other-words

WHAT? how the fuck is this just glossed over? or him cutting her hair? how, HOW is this okay? misha is not a bad boy. he’s straight up abusive. who doesn’t know that ripping a condom open with your teeth may actually rip the condom. also, the plot twist with the principal being his mom + him being a senator’s grandson? just huh?
