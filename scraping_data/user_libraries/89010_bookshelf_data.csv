That's cool, but while Groff's facility with language kept me reading, something felt lacking in the study of Marie. Maybe dimensions other than her own drives and desires.

On the positive side, Ishiguro's handling of perspective was incredible. First, there are many narrative gaps that exist because they are gaps in understanding for our AI narrator Klara, who despite her remarkable powers of observation is starting from a point of just not knowing very much about, well, anything. This is a strength, in my opinion. Not necessarily because it explains something about AI vs. human (I don't think this book gives an accurate or realistic portrayal of AI, but my sense is that wasn't what it was going for), but because it illustrates the complexity of learning how to be human from the outside, which is something many actual humans experience themselves. Second, as frustrating as it sometimes was, it was fun being dropped into the bizarro version of our world and having to piece together what was going on without a dump of exposition. Other than that, though, the book left me cold. Klara's childish optimism, weird obsessions, and sappy sentimentality were annoying (maybe because of the voice actor, though, or because of my cold, dead heart). It's clearly not a plot-driven book, but neither did it feel character-driven. None of the characters other than Klara, especially Josie and Rick, were believable or compelling. This seemed to be less a product of Klara's limited perspective than because they were poorly drawn and the book tried to take on / bring in too many different characters and interactions without taking the time to show you who these people were, even from their outward behavior. There were details that just seemed out of place, like Rick and his mother being British (another big distraction in the audiobook), and basically everything about Josie's dad. Also, what plot there was felt very disjointed and certain parts (like the family's trip to the city, the meetup in front of the theater / diner) dragged on WAY too long without adding anything at all....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 13, 2021","Mar 18, 2021","Mar 12, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54250259-klara-and-the-sun

The third book wasn't quite as tight as the first, but still, an inventive story that is both squarely on-genre and modern in its themes and concerns: race, difference, the chosen family, the legacy of trauma, technology vs. art, exploitation of the environment.

Kossula / Cudjo endured pain, trauma, and dislocation beyond imagination, all of which he relates to Hurston with grace, emotion, and equanimity. Hurston's retelling feels real and direct. The *magnitude* of Kossula's story is chilling, though. There are so few direct accounts of first-generation slaves in America. Kossula was just one man. But multiply his story by the estimated 12.5 million Africans who were shipped to the New World during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Then trace that trauma down to everyone descended from slaves in America who has at his or her family root those who have survived in the face of the kind of terrifying past Kossula describes: war, horrific violence, torture, dislocation, loss of humanity, grinding poverty, discrimination. This book, especially read in conjunction with Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, may well change your perspective on race in America and the intergenerational trauma of the slave trade.I would have liked to hear more from Hurston about how Kossula affected her, but given her training as an anthropologist in the early 20th Century, it's not surprising that she largely removes herself from the narrative (except for all the descriptions of how she got him to talk over food)....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jul 03, 2018","Jul 19, 2018","Jul 03, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2590136-barracoon

If you’re expecting a linear story or anything more than dotted-line relationships among the narrative events you will be disappointed. But Smith captured the non-linear nature of time, and the way the feelings and events that make us are as present now as they were when they happened and how this can be as true of the art and cultural forces that shape us as it is of what we experience personally. Her more surreal scenes are incredible (e.g. the vivid orange in Daniel’s palm as they walk through the stark white world). The political and story-driven elements weren’t as strong for me, though she is forgiven as I can’t believe this was published four months after Brexit, whoa.

Lunches on a blue checked cloth on which salt has spilled. The smell of tobacco. Brie, yellow apples, wood-handled knives."" Light Years is the same: a flow of present impressions, small encounters, seasons. It’s the things you cannot recall specifically, but remember the idea of, because they were routine, that make up most of a life. These are punctuated by a few cataclysms that stay vivid: a parent’s death, a child’s wedding, the affair that broke your heart. What I loved about this novel was the way the structure and the writing echoed perfectly that pace and brevity—Nedra writing a story for her daughters at the kitchen table, a dinner party, a dull postcard, a visit with a regular lover, a death. At the end, you go, that’s it? Yes, that’s really it. That’s all there is. Of course, there are different ways of seeing it. Salter’s characters are beautiful but sad and disappointed, in the end. But Lorrie Moore writes almost the same thing of her main character in “Joy,” one of the stories in Like Life: “She knew there were only small joys in life--the big ones were too complicated to be joys when you got all through--and once you realized that, it took a lot of the pressure off.” One of the things many of Moore’s people share is that they all seem to have given up so completely on the idea of transcendence that they take happiness wherever they can get it, laugh and binge on cheese. The sad, quiet beauty of Light Years is something to admire, but I know who I’d rather hang out with. ________________PS: There were things I tried not to hold against Light Years. For instance, the ease with which the Berland family lives can be, frankly, irritating. Many themes related to marriage and family were dated and a bit sexist. Anyone who lived outside of a nuclear family—the childless / infertile couple, the unmarried 33 year old (gasp!), the divorcee—was introduced purely to be pitied and show the happiness the Berlands had when they were together. Likewise women who are not beautiful and anyone with visible pores. One gets the sense that Salter really believed in innate superiority, which was maybe why he struggled with his limited fame. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 29, 2015","Sep 11, 2015","Aug 29, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/174622.Light_Years

That's all. Just gone. I remember this word, that look, that small inflection, after all this time. I used to hold them, trust them, read them like a rune. Like a sign that there was a house, a billet, a civilization where we were. I look back and I think I was just there all alone.I read that when Renata Adler wrote Speedboat, she deliberately omitted important pieces of each story (like, for instance, the ending). This second novel is the same way. That's one of the things that makes Adler's writing so life-like: it's a scramble, a limited point of view, that you swim through collecting snippets and stories, turning your head, squinting at them as they happen or are remembered. Most things are not spoken or told. Although we may look for meaning, rarely, sometimes just with peripheral vision, do we see it. Turn your head and it's gone. Most of the time all you can do is observe these stories and appreciate them for what they are. Pitch Dark has a plot but it's not the point. It's about the main character Kate Ennis and her married lover, but in some ways he's beside the point too. (Muriel Spark's great afterword observed that it seemed ""excessive for a very bright woman"" to remain in love with the ""inconsiderate and selfish"" Jake). The book is the inside and outside of Kate, observant and scrambled and self-conscious and struggling Kate. It might be the best description of loneliness and longing I've ever encountered. The best story about a raccoon I've ever encountered too. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jun 17, 2015","Jun 23, 2015","Jun 20, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13643033-pitch-dark

I didn't feel the book was really about Cheryl Strayed, likable as she is. It was about her in the world, the restoration of the joy that comes from actually living in spite of suffering, loss, or disconnection. The pain that drove Strayed to the PCT—the death of her mother, her abandonment by her father, the dissipation of her family—isn't exceptional. But suffering is suffering; loss is loss. I loved Strayed's use of reading poetry as a metaphor for experience: poetry doesn't make sense, and you don't need to understand it to see its power and beauty. Her journey on the PCT was, for me, a radical reminder that sometimes, the attempt to think through loss or pain gets you nowhere. Sometimes you need to walk outside until your toenails fall off to pull yourself back from suffering, know its part in life, and move forward. Anyway. The book is beautifully written, finding the right balance between introspection and Strayed's experience of the PCT and its people. She's funny, sensitive, and honest, willing to admit that she was lucky on the trail and kind of an idiot for taking on the PCT with zero experience or preparation. An enjoyable and insightful read (especially for a new year!).____Wild must have been compared to Eat, Pray, Love a million times. I only read Eat, Pray, Love because it was literally the only English-language book I could find in Italy at the time, and had a strong negative reaction to it. I don't begrudge Elizabeth Gilbert her success and it's so difficult to criticize a memoir without feeling unfair to its author, but I didn't care for Gilbert's voice, the book's premise, or its message: that you can hit ""reset"" on your life by breaking away and immersing yourself in something completely new, just as long as you have a large book advance, a guaranteed way to support yourself when you resurface, and everybody you meet absolutely loves you! To me, EPL was about finding yourself, while Wild (despite its subtitle) was about getting out of yourself.

The anagram provides the story's structure, but it's also one of the Big (Heavy) Things at the heart of so much of Lorrie Moore's work: how impossible improbable it is for us to understand each other, to be really together and not alone, to be in the same place at the same time when change and movement are so constant. ""Life is sad. Here is someone."" Like a buoy in dark water. Moore, like any good artist (poets, in particular, appropriate because the last Benna, whom we know the best, teaches poetry), knows how to work within her idea. The structure is the point is the structure. That is impressive. I've gotten over believing that Lorrie Moore's work is sad. Is it any better to see it as just honest? Balanced? There's so much humor in it--you laugh out loud too many times for it to be sad. The humor is dark, true, but it is often silly and joyful. There is potential, even optimism. Like here: “But I believed in starting over. There was finally, I knew, only rupture and hurt and falling short between all persons, but, Shirley, the best revenge was to turn your life into a small gathering of miracles.If I could not be anchored and profound, I would try, at least, to be kind.”...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 07, 2014","Aug 10, 2014","Jul 22, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19635.Anagrams

It left me feeling for everyone. King does many things right, but what I noticed the most was how well she built and maintained tension. You can feel it from the first pages: Fen's aggression and frustration and Nell's gentleness and persistence, the precariousness of the scientists' place in the cultures they study, the powerful magnetism between Nell and Bankson. She pulls and pulls those threads so tightly and they snap at just the right time.Beyond that, it's hard not to nerd out here, HARD to silence my inner anthro / English double major (you guys I was SO smart in college, did you know that, omg).

The big themes it takes on are so perfectly woven into the epic story that at the end, when it turns (abruptly) philosophical, it hits you with a whomp and you're like YES YES, and the whole story comes together, even if that's normally not what you go in for. Maybe you get a little embarrassed that you're nodding, and it's bringing you back to all the Hermann Hesse you read in college (""Am I good? Am I bad? Does anyone know or care?""), and maybe it goes on a little too long. But you are nodding along.I'm still not altogether sure what to make of this book because it was a lot to absorb, but I think, think, that no other recent new novel has impressed me this much. The writing is beautiful: detail that is never superfluous, charming and believable dialogue (even by a couple of adolescent boys, how did she get into their tiny, weed-addled brains? A bit like Louise Erdich's The Round House), love letters to the places described, to New York, Amsterdam, even the bland, parched, tumbleweeded subdivisions of Las Vegas. It's a tome, for sure, but there's a reason. For one thing, the slow investment in character development in the beginning and middle pay off when, later, the story starts to move so fast as to be almost impressionistic. You are never left wondering why something happened, or why a character acted as he or she did. And also, I loved Boris. And Popchyk, the dog. Then there's the painting, which is at the center of the story even though it makes only rare appearances. It's a connector, a talisman, a symbol and a thing in itself. There's a lot to say about the painting, but I'm not sure I've thought it through enough. All I can say is that I will be standing in the line with the crowd at the Frick to view it as soon as I get a free afternoon....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Dec 27, 2013","Jan 29, 2014","Dec 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17333223-the-goldfinch

But there's something in them too that makes you think: the people who've made it all the way across, what have they done? Walked across a piece of wire? Good for them. I admit this is not a fully formed metaphor. How long is the wire? What is the end of it? But maybe it's just this: is anyone, in his or her heart, that person who walks straight across by putting one foot in front of the other? Would anyone really want to be? At the same time, we walk out knowing what will happen. Maybe the key is to try not to think about it too much. I don't know if that's exactly a , but it's my takeaway from this collection. Great characters; messy, sad, funny stories told with real tenderness. Diaz has a skill for that mix, and while for some reason it didn't grab me in Oscar Wao, it did here. One note: Diaz has a schtick I don't like. I can only describe this by quoting Jill's :He likes to throw in some offhanded highbrow references to remind you how smart and awesome he is - he teaches at Harvard, one of his many ladies ""Bartlesby's"" him by saying, ""I would prefer not."" OH GOD IT'S LIKE HE'S FROM THE STREETS BUT HE'S STILL SO AMAZINGLY SMART! HOW CAN THOSE TWO THINGS COEXIST? YOU'RE BLOWING MY MIND HERE!For me it's not a reason not to read, but it merited some thunderous eye rolls (from Jill too). I'm all for writing what you know, but there's a difference between that and having your otherwise great writing plagued by a personal hangup....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Aug 09, 2013","Aug 20, 2013","Aug 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13503109-this-is-how-you-lose-her

I don't understand the Lifelong Bond among Camp People. Any non-camper who's heard an adult friend reminisce about their Camp Days and maybe even met the odd Camp Friend of Your Friend knows what I mean. I've read some critiques of The Interestings on ""who cares?"" grounds: ""why would I care about a bunch of rich, artsy East Coast liberal Camp Friends navel-gazing their way into middle age?"" (*) and maybe it's valid. But for me, it didn't matter: what kept me involved in this novel was (a) the improbable likability of nearly every character; and (b) the points at which Jules, the protagonist and narrator said or thought something that made me think, lord, that is really so true. Also, Wolitzer writes so well about certain things: e.g., sex, walkup apartments, awkward dinner parties. It would be, well, interesting to read a close analysis of The Interestings with another coming-of-age novel I read this year, The Art of Fielding by Chad Harbach. Both depict a group of friends in a rarefied environment (this, arty kids at summer camp and then New York City, that a baseball team at a liberal arts college in the Midwest), both center in one way or another on talent (or its absence) and its importance (or lack of importance) in a full life, both deal at least obliquely with the question of privilege. Both make you feel drawn into the group's world, although The Art of Fielding is such a male world and The Interestings felt much more, I don't know, egalitarian. It's telling that the coming-of-age in The Interestings takes something like three decades. But that's still, essentially, what the book is (or maybe it says something about arty East Coast liberals and how long it takes them to grow up).There were some clunky plot devices here, and points at which I felt it was too long or repetitious. But otherwise an involving read.(*) oh, what, you're saying that's me too even if I never went to Camp?

The story is simple, with easy symbolism, and gets at Big Themes: corrupt materialism, the carelessness of the superrich (hello 1%!) the striver and the American dream.

With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.""Come on!!

The coming-of-age part: For a novel with such dark central narrative, this was enjoyable, mostly thanks to its painfully endearing 13-year old narrator Joe and his friends. Erdich did a great job depicting adolescent decision making (such as it is) and the curiosity and fixations of Joe and his little posse, with their breast-ogling and their amusing obsession with Star Trek: The Next Generation. The detective part: Erdich drops clues not just about who attacked Geraldine, but about why, at a nice pace throughout the book, with just the right amount of puzzle. And finally, the crime part: Geraldine's ordeal is fictional but based on many real-life occurrences in reservation communities. It has to be said--this one will appeal to law nerds, because the story of Geraldine and her assailant is, at heart, about the failure of systemic justice and how a community and family tries to overcome powerlessness in the face of that failure. I'm still not sure what I think of the resolution, and it didn't seem like most of the people in the story were, either, but I can say I will be thinking about it for a long time.A side note: the older characters here were a treat too, e.g., raunchy Grandma Ignatia and Joe's grandpa Mooshum and his combustible birthday cake....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 31, 2013","Feb 08, 2013","Jan 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13602426-the-round-house

The narrative is ""postmodern lite,"" alinear, atemporal, intersecting, but populated by easy characters: attractive men and women talking, falling in love, making choices, and messing up. Men and women with ""sea-blue eyes"" and ""whiskey-brown eyes"" and ""a pair of eyes framed by bursts of black lash, like two lines of oil smoke."" On Italy's gorgeous Ligurian Coast. So. There were some hilarious moments (I loved the ""Donner!"" pitch and the villagers of Porto Vergogna), but a couple of the storylines grabbed me less than others and it was maybe a little too romantic for me. The Richard Burton depiction here does a good job reviving the ""hilarious drunk / drunk driver"" character.

Why Have Kids? was one part ""Have you heard of the Mommy Wars?""; one part ""My nipples were bleeding!"", i.e., Valenti voicing personal surprise at how harrowing parenting can be, in part because of the pressure (some) parents now put on themselves; and one part genuinely interesting discussion of laws, policies, and attitudes that dehumanize parents--mothers in particular. Maybe I found the last piece most interesting because I am a lawyer, and ""child-free"" (which is what this book tells me I am called). But to me, it was the only topic I didn't feel rehashed ground that had been covered already, ad nauseum, both in the press and on every parenting forum. Some of the discussion of ""work"" was also engaging, in particular Valenti's revised stance on whether mothers should work outside the home and her treatment of the narrative we seem to love about parenthood / motherhood being ""the most important job"" anyone (or, a woman) can do.On the whole, I felt like this book wasn't too demanding of Valenti and was probably calculated to be an easy seller (though I bought it for $4 on Kindle, woot) rather than groundbreaking social criticism. Most of the quotes were just things people said on blogs or internet forums.
