Just utterly incredible world.Record of a Spaceborn Few begins with the explosion of Oxomoco, one of the 30 Exodan ships which carry part of the human race - and, along with it, the death of forty-three thousand people. But this novel isn't one focused on these deaths, per se. The bulk of the novel takes place just moments past the Toremi attack at Hedra Ke that ended Long Way to a Small Angry Planet, as the Exodan fleet continues to recover and rebuild in its way. The members of the Exodan Fleet – the 30-in-number set of ships to evacuate a destroyed Earth nine generations earlier, and the largest conglomerate of humans outside of the Solar System – live in a society based around sharing. Food portions are provided equally, and vocations are not paid but simply encouraged. Though it isn't a planet, in some ways the ships are utopian. Yet as the fleet ages, the ships are becoming wildly less stable, and even supplemental power from the Aeluons or from their adoptive sun Risheth can’t fix the issue. Humans have only been members of the GC for seventy years, and already new generations are learning galactic Klip before their home Ensk. Tessa Santoso, sister to Ashby, spends her days sorting the technical remnants of the exploded Oxomoco, as new GC technologies threaten her livelihood. Aged human archivist Isabel hosts Harmagian archivist Ghuh’loloàn to teach her of their ships. Eyas Parata works the compost system, which recycles human bodies, and builds a relationship with a sex worker named Sunny. Kip works as an apprentice while his friend Ras dreams of escaping the Exodan ship. And Sawyer has just come to town. I found this book to be utterly arresting. Becky Chambers takes on humanity, and non-humanity, with such an eye towards hope - she believes utterly both in our capacity for negligence and cruelty, and in our capacity for good. Though the Exodans are constantly changing, defined by their willingness to recycle bodies and repurpose old technology, Record of a Spaceborn Few still finds hope in archives, in the ways the Exodans have held on to what once made them Earthen. They find ways to preserve the old ways and the new. On a plot level, this is decidedly the most fast-paced of this series so far, and much faster than A Closed and Common Orbit. I adored this, and it may be my favorite of the series so far.

It’s very charming, but to be quite honest I found this just slightly unnecessary. I felt like Legends and Lattes was so utterly perfect that I didn’t really need more from Viv, and to some degree I just kept wishing I was rereading the former. Still, it’s not without its charms. I was completely delighted by Satchel – he’s a fabulous character. All of the literary interludes are great, and the epilogue is pitch-perfect. I almost wished this was just a sequel about a side character starting a bookstore, because I wanted more of that. Perhaps I’m just a prequel struggler and I haven’t known that until now. And I still can’t recommend Legends and Lattes enough!

A stick used to beat other women with. Why couldn't they be as considerate, as trustworthy, as all-suffer-ing as I had been?The Penelopeiad is a feminist Odyssey retelling told via both Penelope herself and a Greek chorus of the twelve Maids, who Odysseus slaughters for their crime of being assaulted by the Suitors who come to harass his wife. To be quite frank, I felt the first 80% of this book was not all that great. I struggled to totally get Penelope’s inner motivations — as they’re often left purposefully ambiguous — and without that justification for the text, I struggled. (Frankly, the writing did not feel particularly strong to me either.) I did enjoy Penelope’s narrative and her characterization, when it shined through, was quite interesting. She has much more agency as a character than in the original myth and it’s strong. The last 20%, by contrast to the first 80%, was much stronger. I particularly enjoyed getting more depth on the dynamic between Penelope and the Maids in the Underworld; Penelopeiad shined in its depiction of haunting. Another interesting section implies some complexity in Penelope's own narrative around herself, and I only wished to see this more. That is, the last 20% shined except for the academic essay reproduced into the text. It was an interesting academic essay, to be sure - arguing the maids and Penelope should be seen a thirteen-member feminist cult slaughtered by Odysseus. The presentation felt borderline preachy and extremely jarring. I also hated the decision to characterize Helen as a mean slut in the feminist Odyssey retelling. Don't actually know what to say to this one, except how odd to allow not a single other dynamic woman. Overall, very glad I read this – and a huge thank you to my friend Alice for the lovely birthday gift! – but not totally sure the entirety lands.

I was gifted this by a friend who knows I have an academic interest in cannibalism as a theme. Tender Is the Flesh depicts in horrifying detail the ways in which the human body can become an animal's. The body horror is intense and stomach-churningly brilliant, playing perfectly with the horror of dehumanization. I additionally struggled, in a good way, with the details of animal extermination – dogs slaughtered in backyards, cities eerily quiet without the chirping of birds. Much of the novel revolves around lead character Marcos's relationship with a so-called Perfect Specimen he's been awarded as part of his job running a processing plant. This relationship is difficult to explain without spoiling the novel. I will say I found their ending quite haunting. But I really struggled to believe in the worldbuilding. In the post-Covid era, it does not feel realistic that every world government could, or would, collaborate to eradicate all mammal life. Firstly and just as a note, logically – this would control the populace further, but would also eradicate high levels of trade and export, and it does not seem realistic that a majority of governments would make those choices. Perhaps significantly more relevantly – there is absolutely no way that (a) a majority of citizens of every country would believe a hoax virus when they can’t even believe a real one, and (b) that all world governments would collaborate on a conspiracy this large. Geopolitics just don’t work that smoothly. I simultaneously hold more, and less, hope for the world than this book does. I liked elements of this and I’m glad to keep reading more translated work, but I’m not sure this translates that well in a post-COVID world.

(This was my wonderful girlfriend’s thesis text and IThis is… an interesting novel in that I think I may be compelled by it than I actually enjoy it. (This was my wonderful girlfriend’s thesis text and I do think having her thesis as a supplemental text amplified the experience quite a bit.)Beautiful World Where Are You follows two best friends—Alice, a bisexual communist writer living in a house on the Irish coast, and Eileen, an editor in Dublin—and their lovers, Felix and Simon, as they try to resolve a set of complex relationships. My main observation about this book is that there are three key dynamics in this novel: Alice and Felix, Eileen and Simon, and Alice and Eileen. The two couples’ relationships, each beginning as complex and between-definition, resolve themselves into relationships with oddly gendered dynamics. [Eileen and Simon, particularly, are into roleplay bdsm.] This is framed, for each of them, as a return to love and connection in a world plagued by inequality and genocide. The friendship between Alice and Eileen, on the other hand, left me less convinced. In a book so deeply convinced of the need for love in a cruel world, I found myself really frustrated by how little I believed in Alice and Eileen’s deep friendship with one another. Even when the book addresses this complex relationship, I wanted more. Perhaps it didn’t help that Alice’s behavior quite frankly just reminded me of friends I’ve moved on from. One of Alice's main character conflicts is that she really struggles to see others as equals, even when she somewhat-tries with Eileen, and I just didn't find myself convinced that the Alice of the ending would truly start seeing her best friend as an equal. Even when I wanted her to. I read Sally Rooney for her complexity—her sharp characters who try to live one another, but just can’t do it right, and have to figure out how to truly see each other. As always, she delivers. I’m just not so sure I was convinced of these people.

Ditch the sweater.” Look, second-chance fake-marriage just seemed like something I’d eat up. And I did. Sue me. Violet and Xavier were the ambitious couple, one an aspiring basketball star and one an aspiring fashion designer. She made it, with a career supporting famous stars across the globe. He didn’t. His insecurity predicated their breakup. In this current world, Xavier is insecure about not being impressive enough for his superstar girlfriend; meanwhile, Violet is insecure about being too busy for someone she’s missed for years. It’s an incredibly well-built conflict. But what I really appreciated is that… the angst is so un-manufactured. Violet and Xavier work so hard to communicate with each other… but they have some serious reasons to be worried about the future. When they mess up, it feels real, true to their characters rather than contrived. Love is not always going to be enough to stop every bit of insecurity–but they value each other enough to fix it. (Also, I am such a Violet.) I have one or two quibbles. One super strange section in the back half where Violet’s POV contains a flashback of the prior day should not have made it through edits. (I’ve noticed this in a couple of fantastic romances I’ve read in the last couple years and will only say—romance editors, this is your job!) And I think the Dahlia and Violet conflict gets wrapped up waaaay too quickly. But overall? Just delicious. I loved this romance and these characters so much, and will be buying a copy for my own rereading purposes ASAP.

Lots of good here; I’m very partial to Amanda Jayatissa’s sharp characters, compelling twists, and strong social commentary. Amara’s voice particularly grabbed me. There’s a nuance given to different reactions to colonialism, most notably within Neha, that works great. And her reveals, as always, are pitch-perfect – deftly foreshadowed, still shocking, and utterly horrifying. (One particular ending reveal will haunt me for a long, long time.) I think this was somewhat underserved by the editor – also thought this was true of You’re Invited – and could have been paced significantly stronger. I also can’t quite decide how I feel about the ending. With that being said, I think Amanda Jayatissa is comically underrated and absolutely worth reading from.

Related, Clemensia’s scene in the hospital. —Coryo getting the guitar from Pluribus Bell, who also gives him—The song being a betrayal is so INTERESTING.

Which is fascinating because… her dialogue is exactly the same, almost down to the word. Lucy Gray’s movie dialogue is extremely close to her book dialogue but her character feels vivid in a way her book character does not – particularly “Ballad of Lucy Gray Baird,” “The Old Therebefore,” and in her final scene. And it’s here that I think comes both what is best about this story and worst about this book: Snow’s interpretations are almost universally unreliable. He reads Lucy Gray wrong, Sejanus wrong, the tributes wrong. He cannot see her courage in leaving him—only that she has left. I adore Lucy Gray as a character.

Something stronger.""3 1/2 stars for this strong mystery novel with a grounding in Native history in Oklahoma. As a Bureau of Indian Affairs archeologist, Syd Walker spends her time in Rhode Island with her spouse, Mal, trying to protect the land's indigenous past, even as she’s escaping her own. But when she receives a call from her hometown - where her sister, Emma Lou, has just gone missing - she's brought back to a fifteen-year-old tragedy she's tried hard to forget. There's a lot to enjoy about this book. The family content and dynamics are strong, and a cast of strong and complex side characters (particularly Emma Lou's boyfriend) keep the book engaging. Emma Lou is a wonderful character and the exploration of addiction's impact on a family is sympathetic and dimensional. Blood Sisters is extremely grounded in histories of indigenous oppression in Ohio and interweaves an array of strong characters who convey different parts of that history. There is a complex history and legacy even in the lead character's role in the BIA, an organization which saw fit to exploit Native land it claimed to protect. I found some of the plotting a bit confusing. Specifically, the logistics of a few of the earlier fight scenes felt incredibly confusing to the point of being incomprehensible. More notably, I really wished for a bit more of Mal specifically. The arc between Syd and Mal is fantastic, but felt incomplete in actual text.

Following a pair of estranged sisters whose third sister was kidnapped 1This is a complicated book about which I have extremely complicated thoughts. Following a pair of estranged sisters whose third sister was kidnapped 18 years previously, Pretty Girls is a brutal, spine-chilling ride into the politics and impact of domestic violence. Lydia and Claire could not be more opposite: Claire is a dressed-up wife to Atlanta millionaire Paul, while Lydia is a single mother to daughter Dee dating a fellow ex-con, Rick, and trying hard to make ends meet. They have not spoken for eighteen years. But when Claire's husband is murdered horribly before her eyes, they're brought to a surprise reunion. This is an absolutely wild ride of a novel, with some fantastic twists that really keep attention. Despite some slow sections, the general strength of the novel comes in the depth of the horror; the villains scare deeply.My one concern about this novel was a level of brutality that felt it dipped into torture porn. I think this is a matter of taste, but specifically, the use of rape is repeatedly and extensively horrifying. Additionally, Claire and Lydia each felt, at times, just slightly underdeveloped. I wished for more out of each of them. Overall, while this was a worthy read, I'm not sure I'll be reading more Karin Slaughter. But I do get why people loved this so much.

The Night She Disappeared follows the disappearance of teen parents TallulaAn extremely fast-paced and tense suspense novel which kept me spellbound. The Night She Disappeared follows the disappearance of teen parents Tallulah and Zach, raising their child together while living with Tallulah's mother Kim. Generally, I think this novel’s strength comes in crafting interesting character dynamics. Tallulah herself is very well-drawn, and her flashback point of view chapters never failed to hold my attention. Kim’s chapters are also great, with a palpable connection to her daughter that hooks in the reader. Scarlett, a girl with Tallulah on the night she disappeared, and Zach, the boyfriend, are each interesting characters. Arguably The Night We Disappeared's biggest fault comes in Sophie’s character. In comparison to essentially every other character, she is extremely boring—I feel like she’s meant to be a Tallulah narrative foil but fails to be so just because she’s not interesting enough. While I liked the lack of manufactured drama in her storyline in that she gets along with a coparent, I wished for more genuine tension in her side of the narrative. Much as an outsider made for a fun interlude, I almost didn't need her character. On the bright side? Great ending with a solid reveal, both well-foreshadowed but with enough details shifting that I didn't quite see things coming. The resolution to one of the conflicts resultant from the solution felt slightly too convenient but not ridiculous. The additional final-final twist is very well foreshadowed and I was extremely proud of myself for guessing several details of it; I do not think everyone will. Overall, I think this one is worth your time if you like suspense! I'll be trying Lisa Jewell further.

I felt deeply exhausted by this novel. When Meursault meets his fate, there is no joy or relief to be found. Even as he has consistently and constantly lacked true compassion for any characters, he has shown occasional moments of something approaching kindness. He simply isn’t a cruel enough force to root for death. But you also see so easily how he could be condemned to death. He is remorseless, after all. It exposes the mundanity of evil – the mundanity of death, and the simple mundanity of death as punishment for death.But I think it was a mistake even to consider the possibility. Because at the thought that one fine morning I would find myself a free man standing behind a cordon of police on the outside, as it were at the thought of being the spectator who comes to watch and then can go and throw up afterwards, a wave of poisoned joy rose in my throat.This kind of just messed me up.

If youJade Legacy is perhaps the single best series conclusion I have read in my entire life, to what is now my favorite fantasy series ever written. If you enjoy heists and schemes, family drama, and geopolitics in your fantasy, you absolutely need to be reading this immediately. I’ve already articulated what works best about this series in my s for Jade City and Jade War, but to highlight a few aspects that only work better here – Jade Legacy leans even further into geopolitical drama. The dynamic between Ayt Mada and Shae continues to be beyond compelling. I really respect that Fonda Lee saw the complexity of their dynamic; it would have been easy to make the conflicts into the far more wooden dynamic between Hilo and Ayt Mada, but we get something so much better. And the twenty-year scope of the novel is simply impressive. Particularly, I adored the characterization of the three children: Niko (only son of Lan), Ru (stone-eye first son of Hilo and Wen), and Jaya (their daughter). Ru in particular is just a fabulous character. And I loved how they parallel their parents – Niko is just like Shae with a bit of Lan and Hilo, Ru is a bit of the Lan of the three, very much like Wen but the favorite of Hilo; and Jaya is, to me, just like Hilo. Oh, and the ending. Satisfying, hopeful, devastating, pitch-perfect for this series. These characters are destroyed, and changed forever, but I know they'll stay in my head forever.

The story is a bit confusing, I have to admit, but the super pretty art makes up for that. Monstress takes place in an alternate steampunk-style Asia, focusing around multiple characters. There's Maika, our morally grey heroine. Plus her cat Master Ren, her younger friend Kippa, and her friend / maybe girlfriend Tuya. On the other side, we have the power couple Sophia and Atena. This comic is well-written, well-paced, and entertaining as all hell. Monstress also hits all my main points for great work - it's driven by women, many of them women of color and many of them lgbtq, full of antiheroes and corrupted power, and all wraps up with themes about discrimination. Antiheroines are my thing, and Maika is a great one. [image]Especially with her equally ambiguous cat companion and adorable fox-girl adopted daughter. [image]And in terms of gorgeous art, I'm really not sure you can do better. I could stare at the panels all day. Sana Takeda is so talented. I'll definitely be on the lookout for more by her - and eagerly anticipating the next volume. [image]There is one major flaw - the plot is so confusing.

If you're reading this graphic novel for this first time, I would suggest looking through my basic spoiler-free plot notes below.The plot is slightly convoluted, but I'll try to give a basic overview. On the left side of the continent, the human Cumaea forces are trying to take over major city of Zamora, led by the Inquisitrix and general Sophia's mother Yvette - the betrayer of protagonist Maika's mother. On the right live the Dusk court of the Arcanics, children of the Ancients and humans, ruled by an Ancient - the queen of wolves. There's some interesting mythology surrounding the gods here as well. We find out that Ubasti, the mother of cats, banished the old gods herself - but may have left one behind in our world.

It's a very purposefully removed narrative voice, cold and crisp, as Elliot goes through details of past experiences, cruelty and otherwise. Some of these stories are incredibly personally, and there's something simultaneously painful and cathartic about reading them. As the book came towards its conclusion, I craved more of an intense emotional connection. It's a very inconclusive memoir, and I think that's on purpose. I wished for a conclusion, but understood this as an artistic choice. Reviewers taking his experience as a guideline for all trans people should keep in mind that 'textbook' isn't what the 'memoir' genre is intended to be. There's no indication in the text that Elliot Page expects to be seen as a representation for every trans person, and those attempting to read the text as such are doing it a disservice. In other words, I think you should ignore any s of this text by cis people critiquing Elliot Page's lived experiences of transness. For example, the  down below on the page that informs us all that Normal trans people don't get top surgery before going on testosterone is misinformed; I've had multiple friends go either direction. There just really isn't a set timeline for transitioning. I always really struggle to rate and  memoir; I think this is fairly well written considering I think this is his voice, and I think it's worth reading if celebrity memoirs resonate with you.

I particularly enjoy her penchant for intriguing side characters; Thora Grey never failed to delight me, in particularly.

In reading feminist theory of this era, I am constantly struck by the degree to which porn becomes a focus, and I really enjoyed what Joanna Russ had to say. However, I do think there are degrees to which societal pressure on women to enjoy fantasies of submission, and societal pressure on men to enjoy dominance, influence our sexual desires. I think that in talking about porn as morally neutral, that's an important part of the puzzle - even in being morally neutral, our desires do not exist in a vacuum! They come from somewhere, because that's what desire is. On the bright side, really enjoyed the entire section just dedicated to Kirk/Spock fanfiction. Great vibes.QUOTES THAT RESONATED FOR ME➽“When I hear women denounced for deviant sexual behavior, when male lust is seriously advanced as a primary cause of women's oppression and the cultivation of certain kinds of sexuality, I begin to wonder where I am. Is this feminism or feminine-ism? The feminism I know began as politics, not rules for living. To call X a feminist issue did not then mean that there was a good way to do X and a bad way, and that we were trying to replace the bad way with the good way.”➽“What is demanded is that you ‘make something of yourself.’ Sometimes this means being artificially thin or girdled and sometimes it means being artificially fat and padded, but it always means being unnatural and uncomfortable.” ➽“...Two factors operating: who you want the other person to be and who you want to be yourself.” ➽“I was uneasy about wanting anybody else to ‘be the girl’ since I knew what a rotten deal that was; I couldn’t imagine anybody choosing it voluntarily.” ➽“A partner's hostility or boredom is ordinarily a real turn-off and yet this is exactly the situation under patriarchy, where so many women are not interested, not excited, not participants, and not happy. Yet men must penetrate and ejaculate if there are to be any babies - and so the problem for patriarchy (whether you think of this as a one-time invention or a constant process) is to construct a male sexuality which can function in the face of a woman's non-cooperation or outright fear and hostility. Of course such a sexuality is, in fact, common. It is also furtive, guilty, miserable, unspontaneous, forced, unfree, and minimally sensual.” ➽“If you’ve been forbidden the use of your own power for your own self, you can give up your power or you can give up your self. If you’re effective, you must be so for others but never for yourself.” Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About | ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Jun 29, 2023","Jun 29, 2023","Jun 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/694360.Magic_Mommas_Trembling_Sisters_Puritans_Perverts

Specifically, Dimaline plays wThe Marrow Thieves is what, to me, makes a perfect dystopian novel - it makes a horrific future out of a horrific past. Specifically, Dimaline plays with historical pasts of Native youth in Canada - specifically, the exploitative and genocidal Canadian Indian residential school program. With a death rate of between 3,000 and 30,000 children, the Canadian system of legally required boarding schools for First Nations Children aimed itself towards separation, alienation from culture, and forced enfranchisement. The last school closed in just 1997. Here, the world is based around a lack of dreams. The white members of Canada and the United States exploit Native children through theft of bone marrow, believing it will bring back dreams. Native children can dream, and the dominant culture seeks to steal culture - as well as destroy Native connection. It's smart and well-done. I think really my only issue here is just intended audience; this is gearing itself just slightly younger. (This would have been perfect for me at sixteen.) The characters are: lead character Frenchie, a sixteen-year-old Métis boy trying to figure himself out; Wab, eighteen and with perhaps the worst past of them all; Chi Boy, seventeen-year-old Cree; Tree and Zheegwon, a set of twelve-year-old twins; nine-year-old Slopper; RiRi, seven years old, Métis, and the sweetheart of the group. (Wab and RiRi are absolutely standout as characters.) While I found the romance a bit boring at times, there's a way Dimaline writes about love that I enjoyed - a love for connection, whether it come with words or not. Really good book.

Just This  is spoiler-free with a few tagged minor spoilers.You could jump so much higher when you had somewhere safe to fall.Honestly? Just read Big Little Lies instead. That book just has more: more feminist themes, more interesting characters, more actual suspense, and way more enjoyability. And the same fantastic audiobook. Let's get started.♔ THE TENSIONLet's get started with conflict. While the conflict itself is bad, it's not... actually that bad. It's a big issue between the parents, sure, but a lot of the conflict between parents here could've been solved through communication. Now, that's not inherently bad, but when a book is marketed all around suspense and that big dramatic thing that happened, it's hard not to feel disappointed by such a simple reveal. And oh my god, the buildup to the reveal is so. fucking. boring. This is maybe the only time I will ever say this, but I wanted more drama in between the beginning and the reveal. Or even better, like in Big Little Lies (SORRY, I KNOW I KEEP COMPARING THE TWO.) - this book needed way more theme buildup in the first half. Maybe Moriarity is trying to be subtle, but it doesn't work. ♚ THE CHARACTERSNow on to the thing that made Moriarity's earlier Big Little Lies such a quintessential me book: the character work. Now, I think Moriarity definitely has a talent for subtle character building. And I think she’s VERY in-tune with human nature. But even the best authors can have trouble balancing so many points of view, especially in a single book. Something I disliked about this book was the fact that the marriages are characters more than the characters themselves are. Partially as a result, I didn't find myself caring that much about anyone. Big Little Lies introduces three of my favorite female characters of all time - yes, three. Truly Madly Guilty introduces... three decent female characters and three decent male characters. ➽Clementine: A really developed, complex character who definitely could've gotten even more time. Her chief conflict is around marriage and being annoyed with a friendship, which is honestly just... not that compelling? ➽Sam: Hm. I empathize with his central conflicts around (view spoiler)[men crying and ptsd (hide spoiler)], but I also don't really like him. Honestly, he's probably my least favorite character; he’s developed far less than the rest of these leads. ➽Erika: I empathized with her, I liked her character arc, and I loved the scenes between her and her mother - so well-written and true to life. I initially thought she would be my favorite, but... no. ➽Oliver: Actually maybe my favorite character. The discussion around (view spoiler)[his parents' past (hide spoiler)] was so lovely and respectful. This was also the couple I was most invested in. ➽Tiffany: I like the representation and feminism involved in crafting her character - for those unworried about spoilers, (view spoiler)[she's a former sex worker (hide spoiler)] - and I loved that she's so sex-positive. She's actually one of my favorite characters. But like Oliver, she didn't really have a character arc. ➽Vid: Definitely the funniest character, and great comic relief, especially with the accent on the audiobook. And an all-around decent guy, sure. But do I love him? No. ➽Dakota: She's not even the lead, but she might be my favorite? Dakota's arc as a teenage girl is so lovely and well-developed. ♔ THE THEMES AND POINTSomething I do want to praise is the thematic work here. This book is so damn feminist. The themes about letting boys cry, mothers feeling more pressure than fathers to take care of business, and sex positivity are all so lovely. But all of them could also be more at the forefront. There's some awesome filler contentBasically, my thoughts are: lovely feminist themes, well-developed characters, terrible marketing, and too little drama. I have high hopes, though, that Moriarity will nail it with her next one.

Untethered Sky follows Ester, a girl half-orphaned by a deadly manticore who becomes a rukher, a hunter of her own killers. In the course of her relationship with Zahra, her massive, deadly roc, as well as her fellow rukhers Yasmine and Darius, she finds a pathway towards her own recovery. A thousand things could be said about Fonda Lee's fantastic writing, and brilliant, smart character writing. Untethered Sky engages itself with two beasts from Persian and Arabian folklore: manticores, man-eating beasts with human heads and lion bodies, and rocs, giant birds able to hunt them. Ester's narration is compelling strong. But what truly struck me about this novella is the building of relationships between the rocs and the rukhers. The rukhers grow to truly love their rocs, wishing for their presence. The rocs survive. When one bird dies, there is always another roc to train. Yet the rukhers mourn their birds. By the time we reach the wonderful, emotional ending, I was near tears and thinking about my cat. SPOILER: (view spoiler)[I just cannot get over how Zahra saves her without saving her.

They are Orpheus, she is Eurydice, and every time they turn back, she is ruined.”This is a gorgeous, gorgeous book, and it’s marketed as a romance between a girl and the devil, but it’s something a lot more: An exploration of trauma that made me fall in love. Addie LaRue is born in a small French town in 1691 and at just seventeen, sells her soul to escape, promising it only after she gets tired of living. The holder of her soul gives her an escape and something worse: He makes her immortal and unchanging, but cursed to be forgotten by all who see her.Addie’s tragedy is that she can care but cannot be remembered enough to be cared for. Sections of this novel are cut between by excerpts from artwork created about Addie. For a while, it's wonderful, an expression of love. But it is also her tragedy: She is an eternal muse, doomed to wander without permanence. There’s a profound love for people entwined through this book—in the loves Addie has made and lost, in her modern-day painter Sam, her past composer Remy, and in her modern-day love, Henry Strauss. While the romance between Henry and Addie is compelling, I think it's really a lot more about these two characters finding connection than the particular dynamic between the two; in a world where no one can really see Henry, and no one can really see Addie, each is seen for themselves. While they each started their arcs believing they wanted to be unseen, they need to be seen for who they are. I also really loved the ending. I think it will probably controversial but I found it very satisfying even in technical ambiguity; it resolves Addie’s character arc in a way I found extremely interesting. I like... genuinely loved this book. I thought it was so utterly gorgeous. I almost want to reread it now.

No matter how much you enjoy the way I taste.3 1/2 stars. This is a three-story collection, and yet the one I keep coming back to is the first and titular story, Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke, following Agnes and Zoe, two women meeting online and participating in over-the-internet BDSM. This one gets incredibly fucked up, and I found it genuinely fascinating. Thematically, there is so much to unpack here with regards to consumption. SPOILER: The entire premise of 'my lover can't impregnate me so I will impregnate myself with something that will literally eat me alive, because that is the best representation of my lover' is so, so interesting. What is a bad relationship but a consumption of what you are, until you can manage to reproduce whatever has been eaten out of you?I have one or two notes about this story. There are some sections where the voices of the writing just doesn't totally match - specifically, the IMs vs the incredibly poetic emails. Additionally, as Alexis Hall pointed out, Zoe's voice is really not very striking, which makes her much harder to believe. Also, as an extremely negative er on this page pointed out, what she wants out of Agnes is, to start with, quite literally just 24/7 BDSM. A lot? Yeah. Horror movie, ""you would be disgusted by me if you knew what I wanted"" a lot? This is just what Christian Grey was into. (Tragically, Christian Grey wasn't into tapeworm reproduction.)Second story The Enchantment follows James and Olive in the aftermath of the death of their son, and is essentially a slow descent into madness. It's solid horror and I really liked the ending, but found the pacing slightly off. Final story You'll Find Its Like That All Over is much shorter than the other two, and feels slightly out of place; I think this collection should have been shorter or longer to justify its inclusion. I was honestly somewhat underwhelmed by parts two and three, and think the first story - which is definitely a four on its own - could be edited more tightly. Still absolutely love the first story, still glad I read this.

I completely understand why perhaps the book about the daughter of a serial killer returning home to a haunted house and an even-more-haunted mother did not resonate with some. You have to love odd imagery, eerie dreams, a repulsive mother-daughter relationship and an equally terrifying father-daughter one – terrifying for its intimacy, even in the face of incredible violence. You have to accept that a Sarah Gailey protagonist will absolutely never ever be a good person. You have to accept that to love a monster, and to love your own monstrosity, will never be the path a reader perhaps wants. But if you can accept those things? You should read this book.

I will be abnormal about this for the next six months. Alyssa Wong’s “Hungry Daughters of StarvingUpdate: I am writing my thesis on this short story. I will be abnormal about this for the next six months. Alyssa Wong’s “Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers” follows a girl who uses Tinder to find dates and feeds off their gross thoughts about her body, until on one date, she feasts off a murderer and becomes addicted. From there, Jen becomes a creature of hunger, filled with desire for more evil thoughts, and controlling herself with a new lifestyle with a girl of even viler thoughts, Seo-yun. These alienate her from the girl she already has, Aiko, and her relationship with her. This is a really fantastic story. I am going to offer a take about the ending, so if you have not read this story, avoid this  and go do it. No, seriously, go read it, it's really short. Jen’s very being is a subversion of white heteropatriarchal power structures in which she is allowed to kill. She cements her overturning of this power structure when she consumes his thoughts and literally becomes him. But in this consumption of the white heteropatriarchy she is also becoming the white heteropatriarchy. This becoming brings her away from her mother and Aiko. It is this becoming of white heteropatriarchy that first alienates her from her mother. Her mother is offering her some sense of connection to home, and by extension identity, by telling her the way she lives her life. By eating Harvey, Jen has rejected that sense of community. It it relevant that the sense of community is not one that wholly welcomes her—throughout their time, her mother only ever calls her ‘Meimei’, a term meaning younger woman or younger sister. Jen’s entire identity is not seen. Jen is able to break free from her addiction to evil thoughts, connected with white heteropatriarchy, via her relationship with Seo-yun. To Seo-yun, her vampiric nature is something that should be built off desire, not off survival. When Seo-yun first feeds Jen the blend of malicious thoughts, she transforms again, this time into something more explicitly monstrous. It is not a pleasant image, and it is not Jen’s identity. And perhaps most interestingly, in the presence of Seo-yun, Jen forgets her love for Aiko. She tells us that “her hands smell like home, like rice flour and bad memories. How could I ever have found that appealing?” Aiko is both a queer figure and one connected with home and grounding identity. Neither are appealing to the monstrosity presented by Seo-yun. The text ends strangely and abruptly, with the narrator attempting to revive Aiko from amongst the crawling thoughts of Seo-yun, and wondering how she could ever forget her scent. When Seo-yun eats Aiko’s thoughts, and Jen reacts by eating Seo-yun, she finally recognizes her need for Aiko, telling us: “How could I ever forget her? How could I forget her taste, her scent, something as awful and beautiful as home?” And the story promptly ends. It is a cruel ending, and a confusing one. We recognize, however, that she is recognizing that she has loved Aiko all along. Aiko is defined not just by her queer relationship with Jen, but by her status as the scent of something as awful and beautiful as home. Jen’s mother stood for the home identity; Seo-yun stood for the queer future. It is only Aiko who stands for both a grounding in the self and the future.

Legends and Lattes is a love letter to Dungeons and Dragons players who really like writing post-canon aus where their characters settle down and run little coffee shops. [I am 100% the target audience for this book.] It's extremely cozy fantasy; fast-paced, easy to read, and hard to put down. The dialogue is some of the most realistic and fun I've read in recent fantasy. The stakes are typically about whether or not the coffee shop will make a profit, and yet I was never bored. There is another, trickier-to-solve conflict, the resolution of which is pitch-perfect. I sped through 99% of this book in one sitting because I simply found it so delightful. [Also, every time elf named Ferris is brought up, I did begin to think about Fenris from Dragon Age 2.

HERE ARE MY NONA THE NINTH PROS:Nona is absolutely one of the best of the three so far in terms of general content. I loved that this got to be a book which wasn’t really about Gideon and Harrow at all; Nona felt so much more ensemble cast than even book one, which I loved. Nona is special to me, with a voice that feels extremely well-developed and managed to charm. Pyrrha is well developed; side characters such as We Suffer were an enjoyable addition; the Hot Sauce plot was also really sweet. The Camilla and Palamedes content particularly made me absolutely crazy. I particularly enjoyed the fact that (view spoiler)[Cam and Palamedes can merge their bodies but it hurts them like crazy. Something about this made me super emotional. (hide spoiler)] Camilla’s “I don’t let go. It’s my one thing.” line truly killed me. On a spoilery level, there was some really wonderful content going on here: I was SO happy to get more of John and Alecto’s story and the planet colonization especially, and the John backstory is insanely well done. And Ianthe’s parts in here were absolutely incredible:“Prince Ianthe Naberius. Can you not fucking smoke in here?”“It’s a filthy habit. I didn’t think you cared though.”“I don’t, but there’s like a million smoke detectors.”In general, I felt like this novel created a more well-built full world, rather than just putting a focus on the lyctors. Generally, I had very few quibbles with the book as a whole, probably enjoying the reading experience the most of any book and definitely more than Harrow. Through the book, what’s going on made consistent sense, even when so much felt like a mystery — as my friend Bankston pointed out, the third act twists in Harrow and to some degree Gideon rely on G and H not realizing information that on some level they should be noticing (in her book, Harrow must be literally lobomitzed to not notice). I really enjoyed actually understanding most of what was going on, and that Nona has such a clear reason to not fully understand. “Classic Blood of Eden move. Fucking insane, surprisingly effective, relies on a lot of soldiers pissing in a lot of fucking bottles.”HERE ARE MY NONA THE NINTH CONS:I know Nona the Ninth was originally the first third of a book. But here is the thing. When Muir split the books, they didn’t really go “okay, time to put more of the finale plot points into here.” They just kind of split it in half and made that work. My question is… why? Why not pull forth a few of the ending complexities ready to come in Alecto, and give them space in Nona? Generally, I thought the ending was underwhelming. Here are three reasons why: (view spoiler)[I texted a friend while I was reading this simply the phrase “why does Ianthe have Gideon Nav’s body am I dumb?” I was not dumb. Muir just never explains this, or even comments on the fact that it’s never explained (thus building it as a mystery). I think doing neither is a straight-up bad writing decision. (hide spoiler)] I additionally really didn’t love what happened with (view spoiler)[Gideon and especially with Gideon and Ianthe. (hide spoiler)] If a character is going to change so much between books, I’m going to need one tiny iota of context.  I wanted the paul stuff to get a Bit more, it's so compelling and makes me crazy, but it kind of felt like 'read the next book for more' and I was like okay no I want just a tad more in this book actually. it wasn't a cliffhanger but also wasn't fully developed which sort of bothered me.  Also, I thought there should've been more Corona and Judith content. The only reason they made me so crazy was the short story and I really, really feel like we should've gotten more of that in the actual book. No, this is not just because I am invested in them, I am also right. The conflict of Nona is allegedly simple: Who is she? My disappointment with the ending was possibly added to by the fact that for some reason I was completely confident as to what the answer was. Here was my logic: Her identity was the right choice on Muir’s part. If she’d been one of the other options, it would’ve been borderline lazy and not nearly as interesting. This is the ending of the first third of a book. It’s not quite a cliffhanger, but it’s not quite satisfying either. I am bored. HERE ARE MY NOTES FOR THE NOVEL:(view spoiler)[The Cohort (with the white eyes), also known as the Nine Houses Army, is still fighting up against Blood of Eden. Surviving Characters: Camilla Hect and Palamedes Sextus, in the same body and now going by “Paul”; Coronabeth Tridentarius; Judith Dueteros; Pyrrha Dve (in the body of Gideon (?), deceased); Prince Ianthe Tridentarius (at time shares with Naberius); We Suffer; Our Lady of the Passion aka Pash; and Nona/Alecto in Harrowhark Nonagesimus’s body.

A quick-travel pod arrived, its hatch opening with a soft whir. She leaned toward the AI’s head before leaving. “I’m sorry,” she whispered. “This isn’t fair.”In A Closed and Common Orbit, Lovelace/Sidra, an AI in a human body, finds herself traveling with Pepper (formerly Jane), raised by an AI named Owl. With the help of Pepper’s painter partner Blue and an Aeluon history major named Tak, she’ll have to find her place in a world not made for someone like her.

And there’s the wealth of different aliens—silver, box-speaking Aeluons; many-legged Quelin; squishy Hermigeans; and feathered green Aandrisk. It’s just very solid worldbuilding. These books are built on a foundation of general hope and love for people [and non-people] that really resonates with me.

I never understood before this the degree to which Satan could be a heroic and compelling character. One of my favorite of Milton's takes is his depiction of Eve as the smarter of the Adam and Eve pair. Eve's submissiveness, though appealing to Adam, is on some level a deception. In reality, Eve does not wish to stay as his twin, as she fears becoming only his rib: “Was I to have never parted from thy side / As good have grown there still a lifeless rib” (Milton 9.1153-9.1154). Eve is chosen by the Serpent for her desire for power. Though Milton's text eventually wraps into a space that I think would be hard to characterize as anything but misogynistic, I think the character of this is deeply interesting; Adam and Eve’s punishment for the transgression of gender roles comes in a shift to gender roles. Eve is punished with first pain in childbirth and then submission: “To thy husband’s will / Thine shall submit, he over thee shall rule” (10.195-10.196). So though gender roles are the desired outcome, they're also used as a punishment. And specifically a punishment for the transgression of gender roles, too - the Son of God says to Adam: “Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey / Before his voice, or was she made thy guide / Superior, or but equal, that to her / Thou didst resign thy manhood” (Milton 10.145-10.148). Great poetry, fascinating gender politics.

What is actually is is a play about a Jewish merchant, Shylock, requesting a pound of Antonio’s “fair flesh” (1.3) and almost receiving it. Or, it is a play about a Jewish merchant, Shylock, who is never anywhere near winning. The play is not hyperreal or surreal, like Shakespeare's other comedies. Characters seem not to be acting over the top, but within a scope terrifyingly true to life. Comedy is absent through the text. The characters’ dislike and disdain for each other seems played far straighter than in plays such as Twelfth Night or Much Ado About Nothing. Portia is, frankly, miserly and dislikable. The problem with The Merchant of Venice is this: Ultimately the play collapses in on itself because it fails to fully convince the audience of the justice it has provided. When the happy ending comes, it is hardly easy to believe. The husbands break their vows, yet seem excused. Portia breaks the law, yet is excused. Jessica is not a part of even the feigned happy ending, fighting with Lorenzo, telling him only “I am never happy when I hear sweet music” (5.4). Her misery only nails the final whole in the coffin of what the readers already know: The happy ending the play so desperately wishes to provide is nowhere to be found. In its place, Shakespeare leaves only one final bit of bracing knowledge. The only system of justice a white body may value is that which protects only the white body. In the end, the only blood that matters is not red, but white.

It’s not hard.”“Keep talking, Jane,” he said softly.This was delightful. Courtney Milan really understands how to write romance. Heiress Jane Fairfield is the opposite of a wallflower—she is a girl of misplaced confidence who excels at being the most insensitive person in the room. Her secret: her awkwardness is an act, put on to avoid marriage proposals so she can stay at home and protect her sister from their controlling uncle. Meanwhile, ambitious duke’s bastard Oliver Marshall is asked to humiliate her in order to exchange for an important vote in parliament. But when he begins to look through her act, the two may each find someone who truly sees them. There’s a lot to love about The Heiress Effect—great writing, excellent chemistry, and genuinely compelling characters. Jane’s sister’s point of view, and her coming of age, are delightfully done, with a focus on both ableism in the period and racism in the period. The respect given to Emily Fairfield and Anjan Bhattacharya as characters warmed my heart. The characterization of Jane is particularly standout. While she puts on her insensitive act, she reveals to her new beau that her brave face initially rose from a true awkwardness, accidental. Her social ostracization led to her displayed; while her purposeful unpleasantness may be pretended, her awkwardness is a natural place. “Remember what I am contemplating. I don’t think I should be making you more vulnerable to me. Not at all.”“Too late for that.”My favorite aspect of this book is the work it does to pull together a romantic arc and a character arc. In order for either of these characters to work as a couple, one must decide how his ambition works with his life, and one must both find a way to protect her sister while loving a man, and find a way to accept herself. For their romance to survive, they each must grow. The payoff for their romance comes with the payoff to each of their arcs—the secret to a great romance. I always say I’m not a huge romance reader, but the standouts of this genre really do hit the spot. I trust both Courtney Milan (and my friend Linden, who recommended this) with my life now; I’ll definitely be returning Courtney Milan again.

Are you hungry?Maybe one of the most fucked up books I’ve ever read in my life (honorific, loving, appreciative). House of Hunger is a horror novel following Marion, who rips herself from her own life to become a bloodmaid for Countess Lisaveta, the alluring count of the powerful House of Hunger. Yet even as she and the other four bloodmaids—Irene, Elize, Evie, and favorite Cecilia—drain their blood for Lisaveta, she finds that being a bloodmaid is a more dangerous game than she’d been promised. Part of the horror of the vampire novel is not just that the vampiric subject fears being consumed: It’s that we fear we’ll like it. Since Dracula, fiction of blood consumption has grappled with the consumed subject’s desire to be eaten themselves. What do you do when you are being drained of your life, and all you want is more? Within the House, blood contains memories. The bloodmaids give themselves in giving their blood. Marion is crippled with guilt from killing her brother Raul, and there’s something really fascinating to read in Lisaveta’s viewpoint on her. Marion wishes to be understood. Whether she can be is a harder question. I loved this book and I deeply, deeply adored the ending. This book let me tear through in a day and I absolutely loved it.

Magical metaphors for abuse can be so fascinating when well done. Here, the use of Antsy's gaslighting via magic forgetting, and growing up too fast via magic, ties into her backstory as a survivor of abuse. I was extremely impressed, as I often am, by the kindness with which McGuire treats Antsy, and the kindness with which she treats narratives of abuse. Being gaslit is an experience in alienation from the self: It is an experience, in its own way, of losing access to yourself. Antsy is lost from the real world both literally and figuratively, a barrier placed between her and the rest of the world. Any truth she tells will not be believed, so what does the truth matter? What is the real world, or is it lost forever? One of my favorite novellas in this series. I desperately wish I'd had this book when I were younger.

I’d like to live and breathe the creativity of this universe. While this isn’t particularly cozy fantasy, I felt so deeply drawn in to these characters and this world that it read as such anyway – despite having some excellent horror elements. I particularly cannot emphasize enough the love put into Marra, Kania, Agnes, Lady Fox, and Fenris. These characters each feel so delightful; their dialogue is beyond charming. Fenris’s arc is pitch-perfect, and the sibling relationship between Marra and Kania is wonderfully complex. And the romance between Marra and Fenris is lovely, subtly yet perfectly built.

Along the way, she's decoding Linta's work on the zilphium weapon in a tiny bedroom. But when the ship runs aground in the far north of the Royal Continent, they're stuck in a fight for their lives across winter grounds.I will start with what I did not love about this book: I felt Seasparrow was too long, repeating storytelling and character beats. The first two sections - on the ship, and then across the continent - each drag in places, particularly in the first section, as character personas are established for a crew we hadn't previously known. It's a journey novel, but did not feel as solid for me as the original journey novel of the series, Graceling itself. In comparison, the incredibly strong final third feels almost too short, providing payoff far faster than the rest of the book has progressed. There are so many fantastic points here - for Hava's character arc, for her realization of trauma, and for the character's relationships with the world as a whole. I found myself yearning for these for the often-bleak first 75% of the novel. You knew what you were building too. But what am I building? And what am I building it out of? What am I made of? If I can blend into this bench and become a tree, how can I be anything, to anybody? Can a person be made of nothing? What shines about Seasparrow is in Hava. Oh, Hava. Hava, graced with shapeshifting, has been taught all her life to hide - first from her father, a tyrannical king; then, from anyone who might discover her existence; and then, as spy to her half-sister Bitterblue. To allow herself to be seen crying, or feeling at all, is beyond her by instinct. And yet then - spoilers! - comes Hope, a kidnapped blue fox found in the hold. When Hava takes her in and takes care of her, it is in part her deep care for the badly hurt fox that allows her to truly begin healing some of her own trauma. Her relationship with this badly injured mother is just like her relationship with her own badly injured mother. There's an impressive additional set of side characters in the crew - Annet, the captain, who calls Hava after the multicolored Habpva bird; Navi, the second mate and her partner; Linny, a ship's boy with a kindness about him; Jacky, with the opposite; and Ozul, a kindhearted ship's cook. There's also Keran, a character just as complicated as she is easy to dislike. She is a truly fantastically done character which I appreciated a lot. Is that what love is? Hope for other people?Overall, while I have my critiques of this, there is a lot about this book that I loved. Hava will stay stuck in my head for a long, long time.

There are several suggestions it makes for coping with narcissism or improving yourself—specifically, with regards to setting your own boundaries—that I think I really needed to hear two few years ago. It was slightly more of a basic handbook. I think it works very well as what it is. And some of it was soooo horrifically on the nose to people I’ve known. It was never the brutal parts that got me; I’d generally identified stuff like straight-up gaslighting already. But specific details like comparing you unfavorably to a bad ex, little jokes about how they knew you better than everyone else, flipping the “abuse” narrative onto you, ditching you and then accusing you of abandoning them… those got me. I’m really not sure I buy that some people are just biologically narcissistic, and everyone else is just biologically different. “You are biologically different; you have been blessed with the ability to feel shame and guilt” strikes me as a take meant to exempt the reader from having to critically think about our *own* behavior [I don’t meant to those with narcissistic traits, I mean to loved ones]. The overall point he builds to, though, is a good one—that in order to overcome a history of relationships with those with narcissistic traits, you have to believe more in your own grandeur. Overall a good book, and extremely entertaining to read with friends.

The cast of characters is as follows:▷Linnet and her new husband, Simon Doyle; ▷Jackie de Bellefort, the woman from whom she stole him; ▷Mrs Allerton and her son Tim; ▷Rosalie, “the sulky girl,” and her mother Mrs. Otterbourne, the sex scene writer; ▷Cornelia Robson, Marie Van Schuyler, and Schuyler’s nurse, Miss Bowers; ▷Andrew Pennington, the financer, Ferguson, the anti-capitalist, Fanthorp, the quiet lawyer, Richetti, a businessman, and Fleetwood, with a secret; ▷Dr Bessner, the doctor, and Louise Bourget, the maid. With a revenge plot seemingly active, Linnet’s potential enemies everywhere, a murderer on board under an assumed name, and a passenger list filled to the brim with secrets, it’s a complex crime to solve. But Hercule Poirot has every intention of doing so. I absolutely adored this novel. I think this is one of my favorite mystery novels I’ve ever read, and certainly my favorite Christie so far. It’s as usual a complex and compelling plot, but what stands out to me about this one — over any of her other novels perhaps maybe Murder on the Orient Express — is the degree of care shown to each and every character. Christie has such superb talent at getting you invested in even bit parts. These characters are just so damn entertaining; they felt so consciously distinct. There’s a side romance that I particularly enjoyed [my partner and I find the knowledge that they changed the ending of this in the movie extremely upsetting]. Anyway. I really like Christie. I think you should read this book if you also enjoy her.

Important stats: (A) These threats either are nonexistent or cannot be solved with intervention, and there is no actual fear that any great power will take the Gulf; (B) Oil prices covary with the price of all other primary commodities. Fear is a tool of imperialism. Yet this does not mean the US government is lying when they invoke fears of oil; they do genuinely fear it, they’re just wrong about it. This fear is backed up by the public sharing this exact fear. It's an interesting article that he does a good job both explaining in detail and explaining simply.

An intensely odd decision on my part, but one that's led to some important conclusions, and a page full of s of these stories. (Yes, I did write down my opinion on every one.) The conclusion I have come to in general from this collection is that I really only enjoy short fiction in the sci-fi-fantasy-genre. My four favorite stories of this collection - Charles Yu's Standard Loneliness Package, Maureen McHugh's Special Economics, Lucy Corin's Madmen, and Kelly Link's Valley of the Girls - reflect this, and are absolutely each worth a read if you get the chance. My fifth favorite of the collection, Yiyun Li's A Man Like Him, is an exception, but a fantastic one very worth reading for its compelling unreliable narrator. My observation from the authors whose bios I looked up is that a great deal of these stories, especially the ones that deal with racial politics in manners I found questionable, are written by white authors. This is something I find a bit odd.Said Sayrafiezadeh, Paranoia - ★★★☆☆Playing with imagery of the U.S. as greedy as the backdrop to this story about an undocumented teenager. Interesting, well-written, and depressing. Rebecca Li, Slatland - ★★☆☆☆Follows a narrator in love with a man from Romania who does not love her back. What is this. Jesse Ball, The Early Deaths of... - ★★★★☆Follows four men as they fight their guilt over a crime they have committed, as represented by a Judge. Interesting story, enjoyed this a lot. Deborah Eisenberg, Some Other Better Otto - ★★★★☆Follows Otto as he decides whether to go to thanksgiving with his siblings Corinne, Martin, and Sharon, bringing his partner William. Primarily a character study. I adored this story and loved the writing. Antony Doerr, The Deep - ★★★★☆A story of young love and Ruby and Tom and the Great Depression. Beautifully written and I absolutely loved the ending. Yiyun Li, A Man Like Him - ★★★★☆A story about false and true accusation. To Teacher Fei, the anger of women is not a consequence of the actions of men, but an irrational act. Whether or not Teacher Fei has done what he is accused of is immaterial to his view of the world; regardless, he sees any accusation made against him as existing “for the sake of those who feel the need to accuse.” Even as his head grows increasingly claustrophobic, Li's relatively clear-eyed look at Fei's backstory allows the audience to escape the oppressive feeling that they are being beaten into liking Fei. A very well-done story. George Saunders, Home - ★★★☆☆A story about coming home from the war. Very distinctive voice. NoViolet Bulawayo, Shhhh - ★★★☆☆A story about a father coming home from South Africa sick. Excellent writing, genuinely amazing. I felt this one didn't function extremely well as a short story, which I think in hindsight is because... it isn't. It's an excerpt from the author's novel. This did successfully interest me in the novel, so that's a win. Maureen McHugh, Special Economics - ★★★★★“What are you doing?” “I am divorced,” begins this story. And thus follows an instant favorite, about a company and pseudo-enslavement. This one is just really interesting and enjoyable to read, with twists and turns and a touch of existential dread. Sam Lipsyte, This Appointment Occurs in the Past - ★★☆☆☆A story about the years-long relationship between our narrator and his complicated friend, Davis. Fascinating writing, really interesting ending. Again just not sure I quite got it, and though I knew it was a function of the unreliable narrator and meant as critical, something about the attitude towards women quite turned me off. Lydia Davis, Men - ★★★★☆Very interesting one-page short story. The one-pagers are very hit or miss for me, but this worked somehow; I particularly enjoyed the first sentence. Donald Antrim, Another Manhattan - ★★★★☆An anxiety-inducing, panic-filled swap back and forth between phone calls of a husband and wife, Jim and Kate, each cheating on each other with separate halves of a couple, Elliot and Susan. Excellent characterization even when dislikable. The story’s energy collapses as the end nears; the manic exterior is gone, and we move out from the inner life. Really excellently done. Zadie Smith, Meet the President! - ★★★★☆So intrigued and compelled by this story, about narrator Bill Peek and his relationships with a capitalistic world tied to development. Instantly wanted to reread this and try to understand all the parts I’d missed. Denis Johnson, The Largesse of the Sea Maiden - ★★★☆☆A fascinating story in different movements about… boredom, or ennui, but that would be a reduction. I particularly loved “Silences” and “Widow”; the author has a great way of conveying the ways in which people talk to each other. Yet parts of this felt irrelevant or drawn out. [Also, the section about mentally handicapped people in “Adman” was really quite offensive.]Joy Williams, The Country - ★★★☆☆A story about a father son and an odd group called Come and See. I really don't know what to make of this, but the writing was decidedly compelling. Christine Schutt, A Happy Rural Seat... - ★★★★☆I couldn't quite explain to you why I found this story, about a couple named Nick and Pie and an event that changes them forever, so interesting, but I certainly did. Schutt has a fascinating writing style that I loved digging my teeth into. Don Dello, Hammer and Sickle - ★★☆☆☆A story about a man in prison and debts in Dubai. It was at this point that I began to realize many of these contemporary fiction short stories were getting a bit repetitive. Matthias Svalina, Play - ★★★★☆Reframing life as a game played by children. People are dehumanized and referred to as it in each game. Rather than having a plot, it serves as an itemized list. This one is very cool. Lucy Corin, Madmen - ★★★★★Really amazing story about a world wherein people adopt a mad person. I find both the premise and the writing of this fascinating. Mary Gaitskill, The Arms and Legs of the Lake - ★★☆☆☆Follows an array of narrators talking about their experiences with the Iraq war. A lot of interesting stuff in here. I found the racial politics of this questionable; the use of the N word was really deeply not needed and functioned almost entirely for shock value. Wells Tower, Raw Water - ★☆☆☆☆Hate that I'm one starring this because this man really can write. Wonderful descriptions, really generally well-written, fantastic concept, and I adore environmental horror. However, the comical degree to which the author of this story others women turned me off. From the beginning I was laughing a bit; “she was a pretty woman but close to sixty” was such a classic that it really made me chuckle. But the sexual assault by a grown man of a sixteen-year-old girl, complete with heavy sexualization of her, incestual subtext, and an array of imagery around her fertility as opposed to the 43-year-old oldster our protagonist calls his wife, was far too much. This was really upsetting, but not in the eerie way I'd hoped from earlier bits of the story; in a way that left me with an awful taste in my mouth that I don't see dispelling anytime soon. Oh, and I wonder if Wells Tower was aware when he wrote about Cora, who is 43, having just finished menopause, a detail he adds as a literary indicator of her infertility, that menopause is typically a several-year period that starts between the ages of 45 and 55. Not worth a star rating; just wondered if he knew about that part. Rachel B. Glaser, Pee on Water - ★★☆☆☆No explanation, no definition, you just have to accept it. My short fiction professor compared this story to an epic in that it uses empirical evidence, or an establishment that these things happened, and is not big on narrative tension; it tells you what it will be giving. Themes of cleanliness are prominent. Interesting story to analyze, but really not fun to read in my humble opinion. Tao Lin, Love Is a Thing On Sale... - ★★☆☆☆I found this story... frankly rather myopic in its cynicism. There's a degree to which many of the stories in this novel connect cynicism about society to a cynicism about human nature and love, and I think it's a connection I disagree with. Rebecca Curtis, The Toast - ★★★★☆Follows a woman writing a literal toast for her sister’s wedding. This was SO compelling on a sheer writing and character level. Robert Coover, Going for a Beer - ★★☆☆☆Interesting few-page-long story. I also love misogyny. Charles Yu, Standard Loneliness Package - ★★★★★Instantly one of my favorite short stories of all time, following an unnamed narrator who lives the grief of others for a living as he falls for a woman named Kirthi. A literalization of emotional labor and capitalist critique, but also a gorgeous single story. When dipping too close to his emotional state, the narrator steps back, returning to a place of narrating events and emotions he experiences with ""I am x"" and ""I am y"". Even though these experiences are high on emotion, the lack of elaboration distances us from them, seeing them as just brief exercises in the day, just as the narrator is distanced from them. The ending made me cry; it both sees each character grow and still preserves the tragedy inherent in the story. Deb Olin Unferth, Wait Till You See Me Dance - ★★★☆☆A fascinating story about a teacher, an office assistant, a student ready to pass or fail, and a dance. What's most noticeable about the story is the experiments in style. There’s a high level of disjunction, with drastic time jumps and omission. Sentences are long, but not flowery, instead blunt/concise/declarative, a compression technique. The blocks themselves do aspire most of the time to a unitary purpose on the paragraph level. Thus, even when paragraphs feel disjuncted, you understand they are connected. Really well-done, not sure I actually loved it but I respect it a lot on a craft level. Kyle Coma-Thompson, The Lucky Body - ★★★★☆A four-page story about death. Fascinating descriptions and brilliantly written. Rivka Galchen, The Lost Order - ★★★★☆A fantastically written story about unemployment. Though I didn’t have much to make of this I do know I adored it. Donald Ray Pollock, Fish Sticks - ★★☆☆☆Why did this get written. Kelly Link, Valley of the Girls - ★★★★★An out of sequence story following a world wherein the wealthy try to recreate pyramids, and double in faces. My favorite type of scifi-fantasy story is when the author goes “hey, here’s this really messed up premise. Wouldn’t this be messed up? Anyway, here’s something about identity.” I love this. I think this is the ideal story actually. Claire Vaye Watkins, The DiggingsFollows siblings going out to California, one of them with a vision for the future. This is very compulsively readable. I'm not quite sure what to make of its racial politics. Overall I don't quite know what to make of it in general, though I did not dislike it.

Gallathea bases itself on a conceit wherein Neptune asks for the sacrifice of the fairest virgin every five years. Shepherd Tyterus believes his daughter Gallathea will be chosen, and thus asks her to go into the woods dressed as a boy; Melebeus believes the same of his daughter, Phillida, and thus concocts... the exact same plan. Naturally, Gallathea and Phillida meet. And they immediately fall in love. Hijinks ensue. The play ends with Gallathea and Phillida finding out about their status as both girls, informing everyone that they're horrified, and then informing everyone that they're still in love with each other. Venus, who is also here (for the hijinks), decides to turn one of them into a man so they can live happily ever after. She does not specify which girl will be turned into a boy. As you do. A very fascinating and very, very queer play. Lyly's style is one defined by his earlier Euphues (1578), involving a highly conceited/patterned style: sentences with the same length, balanced elements, antithesis, correspondence, and alliteration. The better way to say this is that his monologues are at times incredibly confusing to read, and the plot of this play is ridiculous. It's a great read. Highly recommend.

At the heart of Book Lovers is Nora, a book editor allergic to finding her own happy enEmily Henry never fails to make me genuinely and actually cry. At the heart of Book Lovers is Nora, a book editor allergic to finding her own happy ending. She's not laid back, not the dream girl, not the one who gets the guy in the end; she can be cutthroat and cold to those who know her. She's the bitch in the romance novel you just read, the one who gets left for the small-town, midwestern heroine. The only person Nora is a heroine to is her younger sister, Libby. Raised by an unreliable mother, Nora was more of a mother than a sister. She's been working to fix things without anyone noticing for decade after decade and year after year. She's good at it. She's keeping her family together, keeping her life together, keeping things buttoned down. I bet you can't guess what happens next: When Libby convinces Nora to spend a month working in the allegedly-idyllic Sunshine Falls, North Carolina, she reunites with Charlie, a grumpy book editor whose company she's never enjoyed. But after time together, they find they have more in common than they thought. It's the how of this romance that drew me in and kept me reading. There's a realness, a depth, a love to the crafting of both of these characters that kept me enraptured. I believed in their pain because I saw their moments of light. Nora, especially, captured me in a grip that would not let go. I saw and felt so much of myself in her. I have been a girl who feels too cold to truly be loved, who will ultimately be left for someone easier to love. And I have kept my family and friends together by working in the background. It took me so long, too long, to realize what Nora realizes here—that she cannot save everyone just by having it together. Sometimes, her happiness requires letting those she loves choose.

This paper daisy is younger, bouncier, fewer cares. This paper daisy, like childhood, like an authentic self, does not survive. The Great Gatsby is a classic, and thus one doubly difficult to adapt - when you know a classic, how do you pivot? The shifts made here preserve character dynamics but add to them; Jordan is a queer Vietnamese woman, and perhaps more notably, the narrator. The story is not from Nick, a more innocent, but Jordan, cynical to the last. In considering recent Great Gatsby adaptations, I’m struck by a desire often to add queerness to the story with an aim of ‘if only they were gay, everything would be fine’. The Chosen and the Beautiful dodges this. Here, they are all in love, or might be, and everything is worse. The lack of love is not what kills them; it is the inability to love for what you and the other person already are. Nghi Vo's writing truly kills me. Also, this entire section is a CRAZY line to put in your Great Gatsby retelling:(view spoiler)[  “I’m not in love with you, you can’t treat me like this.”She looked at me stunned. “Of course you are,” she said, and the thread between us snapped.(hide spoiler)]Genuinely incredible.

There's a lot going on here, including some truly insane dynamics of consent—Silence is falsely accused of rape by Queen Eufeme, when in reality she essentially assaults Silence—and dialogue between personified love, nature, nurture, and most interestingly shame. The question begged by medieval romance is once the king, either good or bad, dies, who will inherit the kingdom. This question of inheritance generally becomes attached to morality; who ""deserves"" to inherit the kingdom? The trans body puts the issues on the table, but these issues tend to be abruptly resolved. Yet though I was originally tempted to call this text the Yde and Olive bad ending, I think its reality is far more complex. Though it features an AFAB character performing as a man, its lead character is propelled to select her nature as a woman over her nature as a man, after being raised as a man and taught to be a man. I think it's reasonable to read this text not simply as a transmasculine narrative, but as a transfeminine narrative.

What if you were about to get burned alive by a king for dressing up as a man and *almost* having lesbian sex with your girlboss wife, and then an angel came down, gave you sex reassignment surgery, assigned you he/she pronouns, and said you were going to have a kid with your wife and the kid should be named Croissant? This is what 1200s Old French poem Yde et Olive is about. do you think I kid? I could never laugh about something so serious. The plot of Yde and Olive is exactly as described above. Yde is a fascinating character from the beginning; in an echo of a not-uncommon trope from this period, she flees to avoid sexual assault by her father. She dresses as a man in order to serve in the army of King Oton, where Olive, the king’s daughter, falls for her. The only time Yde touches upon her past in her own narration, she ascribes an interesting motivation to her leaving: Shame. Speaking to her father in apostrophe, she says “I fled your land / to escape the shame of your mortal sin” (109). Possibly the most compelling element of this text is the intimate love between Yde and Olive. Their relationship’s genuine kindness and expressions of queer care stands in sharp contrast to any other relationship within the novel, most of which are defined by unequal power often abused. When the two avoid having sex, the narrator tells the reader, “no cries of battle were heard that night,” contrasting their intimacy to the masculinizing force of a cry of battle. When finally faced with the truth of Yde’s gender, Olive responds withan incredibly loving line that I can never get out of my head: “For you are safe in loyalty. / I will face my destiny together with you.” The change of gender is a fascinating one: All we know about the physical transformation is that Yde can and will conceive (Croissant) with Olive. Even after Yde’s so-called transformation into a man, the angel still describes her to Oton using the feminine version of her name in its final line about her; even after becoming a man incarnate in body, she still carries the feminine version of her name. This transformation is not an uncomplex transformation from man into woman; in describing him with both feminine and masculine terms, the angel makes him into a man and a woman. In case it wasn't clear, I love this text and find it incredibly compelling. It's worth reading and further analyzing if you get the shot. If I wrote an eight-page and about 30% of a fifteen-page paper about this text, no I didn't.

Cl“If you let me feed you now, I will go home with you to the mountains, and yours will be the only story I speak at night.”This is a love story. Cleric Chih, keeper of memories, finds themself in the northern Kihir Pass speaking to tiger Ho Sinh Loan, who claims herself as ruler of the Ogai region. There, Chih must tell the story of tiger Ho Thi Thao and the scholar she loved, and be corrected by the tiger and her younger sisters. It's a novella about stories, how we pass them down and which narratives we decide to believe. It is about who is believed, and what appeals in love, and what can be loved. But it is also a story about love and desire. There are two specific lines I can't stop feeling myself drawn to, can't stop remembering, about the nature of love: ➽“She was almost afraid to look up to see how the tiger took them. When you love a thing too much, it is a special kind of pain to show it to others and see that it is lacking.” ➽“It came to Ho Ti Thao that perhaps she wanted to learn how else the scholar was beautiful, and even in what ways the scholar might be ugly, which could also be fascinating and beloved.”It's a type of love built on seeing, built on showing of self, ugly and wonderful. As Ho Ti Thao sees the scholar clearly in the fox-house, as the scholar sees right past the tiger's defenses, as they each see the other caged, as they each tear at the bars. Always, in every version of the story, they must learn to see each other. Nghi Vo is a genius. Singing Hills Lore Note:Long ago, Ahnfi was the greatest city in the world—last remaining bastion of the Ku dynasty. Ahn was just one of sixteen warring states declaring itself heirs to the doomed Ku dynasty, maybe 200 years ago. Si-yu has had family in the corps since “Mei-an’s day”, which Chih points out is during the Xun dynasty, potentially “some two hundred years ago” before the Anh system. The southern defenses failed fifty to sixty years ago (both dates are given, so presumably it was a long invasion) when the northern mammoths stormed the mountain passes. After that, “Anh had forced the north into their reckoning.” It’s confusing to me whether Anh won or beat back someone else.

I read this as a required book for a summer funding program, but genuinely enjoyed it immensely. I particularly enjoyed the exercise in Defining Success; it genuinely helped me pinpoint some values that I think will impact what I end up choosing as a career. The “Levels of Confidence & Legacies” exercises also stuck out to me as helping me figure out further details of my background. I've kept my notes from this summer and returned to them a few times, which has been lovely. Interestingly enough, I also wrote down that I was concerned about some of my friendships in one of my responses to these exercises, approximately three weeks before the two friendships I was referring to broke down in an almost comically horrific way. So… self help really does work for realizing your deeper mindset! Next time I write about one of my friends in a self-help assessment, though, I think I’m going to run for the hills.

No one would ever accuse me of being deeply obsessed with this series to a ludicrous degree and thinking about it constantly. That would be crazy.Being alive was like a game, a race. She was going to win.Queen Bitterblue of Monsea, along with her trusted advisor Giddon and her half-sister Hava, journey to a new land called Winterkeep. In Winterkeep, with a debate waging between Scholar and Industrialist parties over the legalization of zilfium, a valuable metal with dangerous environmental consequences, political daughter Lovisa Cavenda embarks on her own journeys. This is the first book from the Graceling series with multiple primary narrators, making it a very different beast from the first three books. Winterkeep is a book with a lot of moving parts, and one that would - I think - have been easy to leave a mess. But she doesn't. As usual, I think Kristin Cashore's shining moments are with her characters. Lovisa is just my beloved; she's a deeply complicated narrator who the author never fails to draw well. Her ending felt just right. Giddon as a point of view is unexpectedly fun; he's compelling in his grief and hard not to root for. Hava and Giddon’s friendship was one of my favorite dynamics of this book, hands down. And the fox as a narrator is fantastic, one of the highlights of the book. I was surprised by how little I hated the new romance plot. I think that's all I really have to say. It’s not a perfect book in terms of editing; at one point it’s just backfilled that Bitterblue was trying to establish a democracy if power were to transition, which is structurally unsound storytelling and should be changed.

Alex and Poppy are vacationers together—Poppy, a vacation blogger by profession and a lover of travel over almost anything else, and Alex, a mostly-anxious small town boy with a surprising love for traveling. They're an odd duo, and that's how they've liked it. That is, until the vacation two years ago that ruined it all. Now, Poppy wants one final trip to see if they can get back to normal. It's just... everything keeps going wrong. People We Meet On Vacation is primarily two things: A romantic comedy of errors, and an observation on the beauty of people met in the most random of situations. Poppy and Alex may get into a wide variety of inconvenient vacation-related situations, but they're always able to find a friend to pull them out of it. This part is sweet and charming. Poppy, as a heroine, did not strike me nearly as hard as the last two Emily Henry heroines I've gotten the chance to spend time with. She feels like a trope in a way that Nora absolutely does not, and that January feels like she expands beyond. While her ending felt satisfying, I wanted more out of Poppy, to believe in her as more than wild child. Alex, on the other hand? Easily in one of my top slots as a hero. He feels grounded and real. As per usual, People We Meet On Vacation is charming, well-written, and laugh-out-loud funny at its best moments. I read this in a day and had a great time. What more can you really ask for?

But it is not strictly a horror story, either. Butler said of this story: “It amazes me that some people have seen ‘Bloodchild’ as a story of slavery.

God I wish that when a book started out good it would stay good.The Kiss Quotient is a contemporary romance following Stella, an autistic tech coder looking for training in relationships, and Michael, the escort she hires to do that… training. Unfortunately, though the beginning could not have been better, this gender-swapped Pretty Woman (complete with the same name of the romantic rival) ended up letting me down a bit. I genuinely adored the first 20% of this romance. The writing is so charming, and I immediately loved these two characters. Michael’s family dynamic is excellent, and I immediately got invested in his mother, who is such a sweet and well-rounded character. I liked that both families were generally fairly positive influences, even when Stella’s mother didn’t quite get her experiences. Stella, as a heroine, is absolutely the best part of this romance. Her inner monologue is so matter-of-fact about her experiences and feels so real—I could invest in her and sympathize with her so easily. The narrative has such care for her and empathy for her when she doesn’t understand, or makes a mistake. This is Stella, it seems to say. You will take her as she is. I’m struck by the couple of s on this book mentioning its role in helping them realize they’re also autistic. And then… things devolved. This can be traced back to two main things:(A) Repetitive MonologuesToo much telling over showing has popped up in a lot of the romances I’ve read and I think may just be a difference in genre conventions, but I found it really overbearing here. Michael can’t be with Stella because he’s an escort and she’s just practicing. Stella can’t be with Michael because she’s autistic and he could never love her. This is heartbreaking for about a hundred pages. For the next hundred, it’s tiring and I didn’t ask.To be fair, Stella’s monologues were usually alright—her insecurities are built on strong characterization. Michael’s monologues, though, drove me crazy. I particularly got tired of the “he needed to stay professional” monologue being repeated so often. Number one, at some point, I got it. Number two, he absolutely isn’t professional. He’s acting macho and possessive over her while they’re not dating. Give it up. Two separate moments, to me, read like love confessions essentially until the chapter ended and we were thrown back into these characters not believing in love. They’re always so close to saying they want each other that I stopped feeling the tension and started feeling tired. (B) Possession Is Really Not That HotAround 50% of the way through the book, Michael, who I’d previously really liked, started getting mildly, and then extremely, possessive over Stella, someone he’s not even dating. I think maybe I’m too gay for this but I really think it’s an incredible turnoff when men are possessive. It made me vaguely dislike Michael, whom I’d previously really enjoyed. Yes, Philip is an asshole, but it’s still not normal to threaten to beat someone up just because they kissed your girlfriend. The lack of consent in Philip's interactions with Stella is disturbing, yes, but most of the time... that was not exactly Michael's focus. Additionally, there is one scene where Michael and Stella are having sex which plays with the “she said no but her body said yes” in a way I did not like. We’re in Stella’s head, so we know that she actually does want to have sex with Michael, but she verbally says no and he doesn't go further, but he doesn't stop either, because he just knows she actually does want to. I hated this. In a romance so generally concerned with consent, this is a violation that should not have made it through edits, and really messed with my enjoyment of any further sex scenes. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. I think for me, the thing with romance is that when I'm enjoying myself, I don't at all notice there's no plot; I'm watching people fall in love, hello, it's sweet. When I start getting annoyed by the characters, though, I just start finding books in this genre so boring so quickly. I think that may be what happened here. Overall: This was alright, but not my favorite. I'm definitely sad that this didn't end up making a mark, but oh well.

Main characters Kayleen and Doug, each in love with self-destruction, bond through his physical injuries and her mental ones. With Doug, we receive less context, beyond him being generally reckless; for Kayleen, the dirt and mud she tracks in is a way of making physical the way she feels about her life, from her neglectful father to her boyfriend’s assault of her. Pain is an addiction to them both, albeit different kinds of pain, and it is this that allows them to understand each other. Yet their addictions are not exclusively surrounding pain itself: Hurting himself, to Doug, is a way of receiving healing. He believes—until the play’s odd, quiet final scene—that Kayleen can heal him, make the pain go away. Indeed, he tells the audience he wishes to do the same to her. But her wounds are not outside, they’re inside. And perhaps his are too, simply the outer demonstrations of recklessness meant to fill something inside of him. There is an odd sort of doubling between the two, with Doug at one point telling Kayleen, “I'm not someone else. I'm you.” The timeline of the show jumps back and forth, as if recounting a memory. Honestly, while I really enjoyed the first half of this play, it eventually began to devolve for me into something masochistic and overly fatalistic. We reach a point where I ceased to feel like these characters had internal motivation beyond where the play was guiding them. But there is no healing to be offered, no reason, and no deep point about life. It is an intriguing exoskeleton on very little. When looking for a performance of the play, I came across a New York Times article that had this to say about the odd, tragic framing of the play, in which characters flow in and out of scenes through simple dressing and undressing: “These visible transformations underline the play’s most intriguing aspect, its implications that its characters are compelled to act out their bruising fates by forces they never question or understand… The play is also steeped in a wondering fatalism regarding the basic human urge to hurt.”To me, this speaks to something deeper about the play, some amount of inevitability built into the way these two characters inflict pain on each other. But people hurting themselves and each other is not inevitable; it is a product of life circumstances, trauma, mental illness. To offer these characters little growth and change felt to me somewhat static. Kayleen may finally admit she needs Doug as much as he needs her, but has she changed her behavior towards herself, or changed her codependency with Doug? My reading of the text is that she hasn’t, and that is the point. We get less internal journey with these characters than we get watching them spiral. Something about Kayleen's arc, in particular, rubbed me the wrong way. MILD SPOILERS: Kayleen is a victim of both sexual assault and domestic emotional abuse from her father, and clearly dealing with intense trauma as a result. Kayleen spends most of the play being forced to assert boundaries against Doug, ones neither of them particularly want. Thus, I assumed a satisfying character arc for her would be to realize her boundaries, assert them, and find love anyway. The ending of the show, though, sees her dropping all boundaries for Doug and being rejected. Something about it felt almost misogynistic and a lot like trauma porn. I’m sure that good actors could make something interesting and watchable of this play, and I enjoyed individual scenes—especially scene five, which I ended up performing for an acting final—quite a bit, but on paper, this just did not do it for me.

With 9 lead characters and two separate time occurrences, it requires attention to read, but it's worth every minute. The show explores both the results of the 2000 NAFTA agreement moving jobs down to Mexico, and the political context of 2008's recession, all under the eyes of one big corporation that does not care: Olstead’s does not care. It's an underdeveloped area; the single high school in the town, Reading High, is not good. Juxtapositions with news reports add to a foreboding sense that this little town drama is simply a microcosm of so much worse outside. As the characters fight and work with each other, we get invested in all of them, rooting for and against. I was consistently rooting for Chris, Cynthia, and Jessie, in particular, to find happiness. But throughout, there's also the constant sense that on some level, what is about to happen is inevitable. Freddy Brunner burning down his house repeats, recurring as a motif. The only true way to save the characters of Sweat would not be to stop their fight—it would be to fix the system that brought them here.I really wish I had gotten the chance to see this on a stage. The reveals and character dynamics would have been amazing to see live. Most folks think it’s the guilt or rage that destroys us in the end, but I know from experience that it’s shame that eats us away until we disappear.Sweat is a complex play with a large cast.

I really think I would hate watcthose crazy mfs sure did wait for GadotOkay, I should probably actually  this, but God, I really don't want to. I really think I would hate watching this. I also feel very strongly that if I ever met Samuel Beckett in real life, I would probably want to punch him in the face. Just vibeswise. I will also mention that I don't care for nihilism. It's not really that I didn't *get* it, per se, leaving out that Beckett did not care whether or not you got it, famously not even telling his actors what the hell he was on about. I have interpretations of this play. They don't make me like it that much more, but I have them.From the beginning of this I thought Godot was a stand-in for God. The comparison of Estragon to Adam, the first man, and Pozzo to both Cain and Abel, violent descendants of the first, only added to my feeling of this. There is other Christ-like commentary contained in the play worth considering: Vladimir and Estragon’s interrogation of Lucky felt almost like they were assigning him the role of a sinner. Estragon saying “All my life I've compared myself to him” about Christ feels right. But as the play carried on, I became more convinced that actually, Godot could be anyone, or anything. The point is that we are waiting for something that is not coming and will not come. We might kill ourselves tomorrow. We certainly want to. We must occupy ourselves as we wait. A deeper meaning is coming, we believe. It will not arrive. Sort of tying into that, I was considering the commentary on whether or not the theatrical stage is real, or parallels real life, in terms of existentialism. Pozzo can’t depart from the stage midway through Act one, which struck me as commentary on the role of an actor: The actor can only leave the stage when it is convenient to the narrative, or sensical to the story. By the end of Act I, no one can leave, which adds to that commentary. A sense of at first interpollation (the role of all humanity) and then interchangeability occurs within the development of Vladimir and Estragon as characters. I mean, that's all I really have to say. It's interesting to analyze. I guess. I would prefer to analyze something that I actually enjoy, and whose author wasn't so strangely pretentious, but that's just me.

Jonah and the Whale is phrased by Elder Thomas as “a story of redemption… Jonah refuses the call of God, and just when you think he's going to die, God sends a whale to swallow him for three days until Jonah prays for salvation, and God commands the whale to spit him out onto shore.” He compares this to Charlie, the eponymous Whale, and Alan, his perished lover: Your boyfriend, he turned his back on the church. He chose his lifestyle with you over God. And when his dad made him come back to church, made him really listen this story, to God's word-he knew. He knew God wasn't in his life anymore. And without God, he couldn't do anything, he couldn't go on living. But it's not too late for you. You can still know God. You can still ask God to make the whale spit you out.A story about God is rephrased as a story about redemption. Charlie’s boyfriend, Alan, died before the play begins by starving, so now Charlie is dying by eating. Elder Thomas wants to argue that Alan starved to death because he knew he was right. This has implications for Charlie’s character as well: A sense that he felt on some level that he was also responsible.The second metaphor is about Captain Ahab, and pertains to something different: the relationship between Charlie and Ellie, his daughter. This metaphor begins with an establishing “In the course of the book, the pirate Ahab encounters many hardships. His whole life is set around trying to kill a certain whale. I think this is sad because this whale doesn’t have any emotions, and doesn't know how bad Ahab wants to kill him.” When this metaphor is first introduced, you know who the whale is: Charlie. Towards the end, we receive an added, secondary portion to this essay: “And I feel bad for Ahab as well, because he thinks that his life will be better if he can kill this whale, but in reality it won't help him at all.” When it's revealed Ellie wrote this essay, we know, at last, who Ahab is: Ellie. Ellie believes so strongly that she wants Charlie to die, when that is the last thing she wants. (This moment made me genuinely emotional.) Ellie in general is one of the most interesting characters in the show. Because of her mother’s alcoholism and her father’s abandonment, she has felt like she has no way of being loved, regardless of her behavior. She feels she has no chance at being judged off her own merits, and she feels as though inevitably, everyone will leave. And her mother views her as evil. When you are viewed as evil by a parent, as she was by her mother, your kindness to them is manipulative; you can never fix it, no matter how hard you try. Ellie has stopped trying because no one has ever tried to see her as good. So it really resonates when Charlie believes in her, and begins to view her as good. I do want to point out a phenomena that appears in this play: It is defined by its reliance on derogation towards a fat body. In literary fiction, this has been done time and again. The body politic employed by this piece is one of fear, both of the smallest body and the largest. From my first reading of this novel, I was instinctually a bit hesitant as to how this would play out on stage, as I described in my first . Reviews of the movie have only exacerbated some of my concerns: On the page, the play transported me into Charlie’s mind, where I could share his yearning for connection; his voice, not his bulk, was what tugged at the imagination. Onscreen, his body is a special effect, and the camera can’t help but take pride in the craftsmanship.I worry that this is a play which is essentially unplayable: In order to depict the show as a physical one and Charlie as a physical body, the camera must decide he is less worthy of humanity. However, on page, I really enjoyed this show, and particularly its ending. It utilizes its metaphors as a way of revealing how characters feel about each other, which is both extremely clever and absolutely heartbreaking.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Apr 09, 2021","Apr 09, 2021","Apr 09, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22638463-the-whale

Often blurring gender and reusing themes of spiritual possession, Vernon Lee never fails to fascinate. In leiu of ing the whole collection, which is certainly worth reading, I want to discuss my two favorite stories in the novel. Amour Dure is a brilliantly creepy story of spiritual possession by an untouchable femme fatale. Medea, as a character, is discussed through the prism of a historian, but shines through clearly. Born in 1556, her relayed history indicates that she caused five men to kill for her. Even before her death, her power is spectral: There is never proof for any of her crimes, to the frustration of the Duke. Indeed, the narrator apologizes for her, relaying her actions as instances in which someone “was stabbed” (47), preserving the ambiguity of her nature to the outside world. She is brimming with power and ambition. Sometimes, as Vernon Lee points out speaking through the narrator, Medea is hardly even at fault: “This imperious woman is soon treated like a chattel” (56). In essence, Lee seems to suggest that Medea is on some level the victim of a false narrative and an unempathetic world. Author Catherine Maxwell describes Medea’s tactics as “a survival strategy which secures her independence at the same time as it is an act of revenge.” Yet her identity as a femme fatale is fundemantally limiting; as Maxwell also points out, Medea is able “only to influence men through her erotic power.” And she carries a weakness in that she lacks power over other women: When Duke Robert finally resolves to kill her, the two women he hires are able to resist her power. She is thus limited. But she is not limited in her power to influence the narrator, and it is here that her terrifying power is unlocked. This half of the story is so creepy and so wonderful that it is worth simply reading on your own. Oke of Okehurst is an eerie tale about a couple exactly like a couple beforehand. Nicholas and Alice Oke of 1626 killed the guy trying to hit on her, Lovelock, together, with her “dressed as a groom” (121). Wife Alice Oke is not hot, and we should feel for her poor husband (107). Except also, yes she is hot, she’s enthralling (113-114). Like Nicholas and Alice beforehand, their greatest moment of interaction and intimacy is when she’s dressed in drag. And their dynamic boils over through violence. Alice echoes her, repeating the old Alice into the future: “I didn’t know then that I was like the original Alice Oke; I found it out only after our marriage. You really think that I am?” (123) And the husband slowly starts seeing Lovelock, but it seems Alice has always been seeing him. ___As I have spent some time ing this text that I love very much, an introduction to the legitimate academic discourse on a very important topic: Did Vernon Lee Fuck? This may seem at first glance like an easy question to answer. Contemporaries, historians, and literature majors alike agree that Vernon Lee was gay. During her lifetime, Lee was a purveyor of intensely homoerotic friendships, first and foresmost with writer Mary F. Robinson, whom she referred to as “her other self” and upon who’s wedding she reportedly broke down. But was she having gay sex? Contemporaries disagree. Bisexual opera singer Dame Ethel Smyth, for example, very publicly decided to say that Lee, being “the stateliest and chastest of beings,” did not have gay sex. The executor of her will, Irene Cooper Willis, said upon her dying: “Vernon was homosexual, but she never faced up to sexuality. She was perfectly pure.” Modern-day American literary critic Kathy Psomiades, however, pointed out that she may just have been biased because Vernon Lee wasn’t having gay sex with her specifically (as my English professor put it). Annamaria Jagose also pointed out the modern tendency to say Vernon Lee was or was not having sex reflects the “homophobic imperative” to “mark the lesbian as visible and undeniable.” However, this is Goodreads and I’m not mature, so I’m ignoring this excellent point in favor of how funny this discourse is. Wild times. I hope you’ve all enjoyed this introduction to academic discourse about Vernon Lee. I love being an English major. ___Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Apr 03, 2021","Jun 09, 2021","Apr 03, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/728787.Hauntings_and_Other_Fantastic_Tales

It’s a sort of mashup between a romance and a heist novel. I think Olivia Waite has such a clever way of drawing characters with realistic insecurities who still never feel pathetic. When her characters fail to freely love each other, you feel the reasons why. Never falling onto miscommunication tropes, she truly builds these people as complex. However, I really do concur with most of the other s on this page that this is decidedly the weakest character development and arc work from this series. Additionally, there's less going on with the heist. I absolutely agreed with Lex’s point about the presence of a prologue being a potential way to counteract this.Overall, even though this one wasn't a spectacular read, I'm a big fan of this author and would highly recommend especially the first novel of this series.

I really, really loved this. The relationship between Constanta, Alexi and Magdalena is incredibly compelling; the depiction of vampirism perfectly balances the erotic with the horror. The characterization of Magdalena and Alexi occasionally feels a bit flat, but Constanta somehow always stuck my fancy. And the writing is simply stunning. I adore cannibalism/vampirism as a metaphor for both romance and abuse, and I thought this balanced both of those themes. I'll be thinking about A Dowry of Blood a lot.

Neat! 2020 was... a year. It's the first year since 2015 that I haven't read at least 100 books, and generally, reading has been way less of a priority for me. Because strangely enough, I have been so busy this year? Every day I have been both locked in my house unable to hug my friends, AND I have been doing more things than any other year. Strangely enough... the last few months have been some of the best of my life. (Granted, the bar is a bit messed up.) As this year ends, I'm looking to the future and feeling hopeful. Here are my top ten books of 2020: 10. Maurice by E.M. ForsterThere are two love stories here, one between Maurice and his school partner, and one between him and a garden worker. In one of these, his class colleague asks for their relationship to never go beyond kissing; he is always at arms’ length, until he is discarded altogether. In one of these, he is free to love as he is, freed from the bounds of false intellectualism and performance. When this book was written, in 1913 and 1914, this seemed almost ridiculous, that two men could fall in love, and not marry, and be happy. Forster wrote this novel almost to challenge that idea. This book could not even published until after his death, in 1971, and was then incredibly controversial. 9. The Greek Plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, & EuripidesBernard Knox said that in a Greek tragedy, a hero makes a decision rooted in personal nature, and follows it to personal destruction. (This is especially relevant to Sophoclean drama.) The Greeks did not admire every hero; rather, they thought of heroes as a way to explore both the benefits & the drawbacks of certain traits. At the heart of every Greek tragedy comes a moment of 'recognition' and 'reversal'. In the best, according to him, these are the same: this is where catharsis comes. Catharsis, by his definition, is a type of cleaning: ""we experience, then expurgate these emotions"". Tragedy can attempt to make the worst experiences consumable. It is not the ending, but the process. My favorite plays in this collection are Medea by Euripides; Libation Bearers by Aeschylus; Hippolytus by Euripides; Agamemnon by Aeschylus; and Antigone by Sophocles. 8. Come Tumbling Down (#5) by Seanan McGuireAs I've read through more of this series, I find that I keep getting more invested in the arc of this home and the characters. Usually, these novellas thrive of off themes, and this is no exception: here, we focus on bodily autonomy, redemption, identity, and when death is the right choice. I enjoyed seeing the culmination to the conflict between the siblings: Down Among the Sticks and Bones never felt like the end of this story, and seeing more is intensely interesting. I love this series so very much.7. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan DoyleThe appeal in these stories comes in their brief nature. They’re easy to read before bedtime, each night, if you want to be incredibly cheesy (I did). Each one sets up and interesting premise, and builds to an ending that you hardly ever see coming, but always find satisfying. I really loved these stories. My favorites were A Scandal in Bohemia, The Speckled Band, and The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. 6. Crier's War (#1) by Nina VarelaI am deeply obsessed with this book. Could it be that it plays with every single trope I love, but plays around with said tropes? Could it be the commentary on power dynamics? Could it be the rounded, compelling characters? Could it be the incredibly tense romance? Could it be the plot twists that I genuinely did not see coming? Personally, I think it is all of the above. Worth reading for characters who are unhuman in some way falling in love with character who are more human, and stories where one character is a weapon of some kind and thinks they're flawed because they have feelings. 5. The Likeness (#2) by Tana FrenchIt’s been such a long time since I read a detective novel that had me so thoroughly engaged from the beginning and so invested. This book was claustrophobic, and got inside my skin —it made me feel as though I were as trapped as Cassie. What works so well about The Likeness is that it gets you to invest in characters you must also suspect—gets you invested in the idea that the perpetrator was not a certain character, or group of characters. You sympathize with those you suspect. You sense the true stakes of this death having occurred. I loved this book, as well as the other Tana French I read this year, and am so excited for more.4. Jade City (#1) by Fonda LeeThis book… messed me up. Genuinely. It’s been a long time since I’ve read a fantasy book that had me so engrossed, and I am extremely excited to pick up the sequel. An excellent book to read for fantasy city politics, power plays, sibling dynamics, and characters who are pushed to their limits and must consider which codes they are willing to break. 3. Court of Lions (#2) by Somaiya Dauddynamic and complex female characters? yes. arc around colonialism? yes. focus on a friendship between two women? yes. the concept of love under colonialism played out with two romances, one in which they’re both girls? yes. villain-to-hero arc for secondary female protagonist? yes. ending that made me start crying for no reason? yes. best ya series I’ve read in at least two years? absolutely2. This Is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max GladstoneA novel about time that does not try to ground itself or stick to a place and a setting, this was the first and one of the best of the year for me. I have not stopped thinking about this gorgeous book. What does it actually mean to hunger as a crafted, manufactured creature? What does it mean to love as such? What does it mean when to desire is painful, and has consequences for both you and the other person? Maybe it's on two time travelers, both women, from opposite sides of a cosmic war, to figure it out. 1. In the Dream House by Carmen Maria MachadoThis is, genuinely, my favorite book I read in the entirety of 2020, and maybe one of my favorite books ever. Carmen Maria Machado’s memoir about a queer abusive relationship blends reality with media and its mirrors. As this wonderful New Yorker article tells it, “In the Dream House is primarily about the quandary of constructing In the Dream House.” It’s a story about the telling of stories that are not told, a going-through of every possible medium with which you can articulate abuse. It flurries between grandeur and media and the simple, the human, varies between detailed tales and hypothetical quandaries to tell the story of a relationship.

And... there they will stay, until the last hundred pages of the book. This series hardly needs a new promo that hasn’t already been given with The Midnight Lie—I think Nirrim is a genuinely brilliant character and I adore her deeply. Sid’s point of view is excellent, with her as a character impossible not to root for. Their relationship serves as a compelling one in part because it plays well at both of their character conflicts, requiring them each to change for their relationship to work. As a book, however, I think this sequel suffers from structural issues. One brilliant aspect of this novel is that the main character arcs necessary for Nirrim and Sid both involve their connection with each other—Sid needs to let her guard down enough to love without lying, and Nirrim needs to see that not everyone will leave. So it’s frustrating that the two don’t see each other until the last fifty pages, I.e. the last sixth, of the book. To use a YA metaphor—it’s a bit as if when Inej was separated from the Crows at the end of Six or Crows, she stayed separate for 5/6 of the book rather than 1/6. The development of the ending thus ends up feeling just a little flat to me. I feel like a more compelling, to me, way of dealing with Nirrim’s missing heart would veer less from what Nirrim actually wants. Instead of Nirrim being essentially possessed and not in control of herself when committing atrocities, it would be compelling for her to start off doing the type of dark things that Nirrim herself would deep-down want to do—for example, killing Raven and taking over the city—and slowly descend further into atrocities, either potentially with the tithe or I would lean closer to stuff with her sisters. Then her and Sid need to interact in the second half—instead of the longstanding Sid and her parents miscommunication, Sid could get it established with her parents quickly that they don’t want her to get married, but not quite believe it. Then, as she realizes she loves and returns to try and save Nirrim, she can begin trying to reconcile with her own view of herself. I also had a weird quibble with the dynamics of oppression. While the violence of Herrath is clearly intended to be a dynamic primarily of class, it’s at times played in part as racial oppression—the High Kith look different than the Half Kith. I think that lends a somewhat uncomfortable implication to evil Nirrim’s tithing of a tenth of the High Kith population. (Which, yes, is always meant to be bad.) Were this duology to be rewritten as class oppression and with all elements of racial oppression removed I think I would find the implications much more “French revolution” and less “genocide”.

You said it yourself years ago: We have each other, and maybe that’s the one thing we have that our enemies don’t.”I remembered adoring Jade City, with its incredible writing, sharp twists, and strong characters. But to me, this will go down as the book that made me see the Green Bone Saga as what it is — a devastating family drama within a political drama, where the moments where the political overpowers the personal devastate most of all. As Jade War begins, the No Peak clan of Kekon is at a crossroads. Neither of the two surviving grandchildren of the Kauls were expected to become leaders, especially not in the aftermath of a devastating feud. Anden, the cousin who helped them win their war, refuses to wear jade. Yun Dorupon, the traitorous former Weather Man to No Peak, and Bero and Mudt, the murderers who benefitted, remain at large. The Mountain has begun to rebuild, with Ayt Mada consolidating power with Ree Turahon, the Weather Man, and Nau Suenzen, successor to Gont Asch as Horn of the Mountain. And across the sea, tensions rise between rival nations Shotar and Ygutan over the small province of Oortoko, but in an international scene, larger powers are quick to jostle their way: including Espenia, Kekon's historic ally, now allied to Shotar in their attempt to keep Oortoko to themselves. With No Peak selling jade to Espenia and the Mountain selling jade to Ygutan, the war between the clans has never been stronger — or more dangerous. Jade War turns this novel into not just an intense family drama, but an extensive political drama told through the viewpoints of a family. What struck me throughout this novel was just how full the world feels. Every side characters feels like a real person, with genuine intentions of their own. Each nation would fit right in at a UN policy summit. But these lead characters, perhaps above all else, breathe rays of light into the novel. ▶“If you want to lead, you can’t wait for everyone to line up behind you.”Hilo, current Pillar and former Horn to No Peak, is charismatic, loving to his family, and the most ruthless member all at once. Yet his cunning is never without reason, and this book seems him work to develop his skills as a Pillar... even though he never expected to be one. This character is just so consistently dynamic, so well-written. ▶“She could never be a Green Bone herself, as much as she felt she was one at heart, but she could think like a Green Bone. She was an enabler, an aide, a hidden weapon, and that was worth something. Perhaps a great deal.”Wen, the enigmatic wife to Hilo, is a stone-eye, a taboo word for someone who does not react to jade. Through Jade War, she begins finding her identity as not just a creator of stigma, but as a tool, an arc which is beyond satisfying. Oh, Wen. A scene with her made me cry. ▶“Refusing to wear jade. You’re like a goose that won’t go near water.”Anden, cousin and adopted son to the Kauls, is sent abroad to Espenia, where he discovers the Crews of Blaise Kromner are perhaps even less caring than the clans. Anden's storyline here is a brilliant exploration of diasporic relationships with a so-called homeland, leading to him building relationships with a new family of his own, even as he waits for another home. And his romantic storyline... oh, god. (Also, I just finished Succession and Anden could absolutely do Cousin Greg but Cousin Greg could not pull off Anden.) ▶“Perhaps she and Ayt Mada had something else in common, Shae thought—the arrogance to rationalize their own worst ideas, to commit to a course of action out of pride without truly understanding the possibility of disaster.”Shae, Weather Man to the No Peak Clan, has rapidly become one of my favorite fictional characters, ever. The sister who left Kekon for study has become a politically sharp pragmatist, willing to consider perspectives besides her own in a way Hilo will not and cannot. Shae is marked for death from page one. She knows this story will end with either her or Ayt Mada, bleeding on the pavement. The reader knows it, too, and fears it. Shae's machinations to befriend Ayt's successor are a delight to read. Her relationship and conversations with Ayt are just as beyond. And oh, her romantic storyline. The catharsis of a tragedy comes not just in the horror, but in the knowledge that there is love. There is love between all of these characters, the side characters and the leads, and it cannot stop the sadness awaiting them. It will not stop them from lying to each other. And when the protection of the clan comes first, the love they feel for one another can never stop them betraying each other. A heart-pounding, incredible novel. I will think about this for years.

Court of Miracles is a Les-Miserables retelling following Nina (Eponine), a thief known as the Black Cat at a court in 1850s France. Under the gaze of Tomasis of the Guild of Thieves, she fights to protect first her sister Amelda and later her adopted sister Ettie (Cosette) from Thenardier, her father, and the Tiger, an evil lord. Overall, I think this book is really pulling out the epic highs and lows of YA fantasy. There’s a lot going on here that I really liked. The vibes perhaps surpass almost anything else; when leaning into atmosphere, Court of Miracles gets it right. At its finer moments, I was reminded of The Gilded Wolves. The bond between Nina and Ettie is sweet and easy to get invested in. I enjoyed the writing of Tomasis, who’s often hard to pin down in a compelling way. Primarily, though, the appeal of this book is in Nina. Nina’s schemes are often really strong and well thought out, and her inner monologue is compelling enough that it’s hard not to root for her. She is genuinely so much fun, the ideal girlboss, and I loved watching her schemes come together. SPOILER: (view spoiler)[Some of my highlights are: (A) when she controls when Lamarque dies, makes it trigger for a revolt, and kills during it; (B) when she calls in favor with Le Maire (Jean Valjean) who she saved to hide Ettie for 2 years ugh iconic; and (C) pretending the tiger is Jean Valjean to trick the Inspector, this one is also sort of cool adaptationally. But I mostly just ADORED the ending of this novel. When Nina picks her sister over the closest figure she has to a father, Tomasis, and tricks Thenardier into shooting Tomasis… I almost four starred right there. Excellent ending, no complaints, 10/10. (hide spoiler)]However, some elements left a lot to be desired. The politics of this novel are fairly overcomplicated as compared to what matters and some of them end up being super irrelevant. Here is what I remember from this book which I read a year ago and also my fairly confused notes: SPOILER: (view spoiler)[There are nine guilds and lords; the sisters guild was betrayed at some point by The Tiger. The main court is the Miracle Court. Tomasis leads The Cats (thieves); Orso or the Dead Lord leads the Ghosts (asssassins), of whom Gavroche is a member; the Tiger leads the Flesh guild. There are also the Bats (poisoners), of whom Montparnasse is a member; the Rats (smugglers); and the courts of Dreamers and Letters. (hide spoiler)]…I’m not even going to lie, I was just not invested enough in any of this to really understand it. That’s because the first half of this book is all buildup, with the actual focus of the novel—the main plot goal—coming into play only during part four, at around 45%. While these first three sections are not awful, they completely lack aim, while the fourth and final section has a clear and fulfilling goal. Had this entire book been the same quality as the last fourth, I think I would be genuinely obsessed with this series. I wondered almost whether the last 1-3 parts could be better purposed as an extended flashback, woven in throughout the book. I also wondered if they might be better cut down. Oh, and The Dauphine and St Juste, aka Enjorlas, both love Nina. And for what? They don’t even know about her girlbossery. I'm not even that much of a love triangle hater, but what is the point of this? It's not interesting and it does nothing for Nina's development. Let’s discuss the adaptational bent of this novel. I have not actually read Les Mis, first of all, but as a problematic theater kid, I do know the plot. The adaptational take of this novel is a reimagining of Les Mis (A) from Eponine’s perspective and (B) in which Eponine is a girlboss who hates her father and it's also a fantasy world. On a fundamental level, I do think this is a fun take. Other characters also appear, of course; St Juste is sort of a weird combination of Marius and Enjorlas, except it sort of seems like he got the Enjorlas personality and then Marius just got cut which is hilarious. Grantaire is also there. The long and short of it is this is not an exact retelling and you should not read it expecting such. Adaptationally, however, there is one element of this book that haunts me. And not in a good way. First of all, I want to know who asked for Jean Valjean and Javert genderswap m/f. Who has ever looked at Les Miserables and said you know what I wish? I wish Javert were a woman so that she could kiss Jean Valjean. Who’s asking for them to kiss at all? And if the author is brave and bold enough to raise her hand and admit she, yes, she was asking for them to kiss, why not just leave them as men? I don’t mean this in a why are we putting women in this book way—why are we adding straight people to this book? Weren’t there enough? Didn’t we hit the quota? I don’t know how to explain how little I could take this seriously. I can’t believe I'm expected to take this seriously. So… overall. Court of Miracles is certainly a book of all time. I will remember it primarily for Nina’s compelling, interesting schemes, and for the sheer secondhand embarrassment I experienced while reading a Jean Valjean/Javert m/f genderswap au. If this sounds like something you’ll find compelling… go for it. If it does not... do not.

Because I’m not done beingI just think that sapphic fantasy is the best genre right now and you can't change my mind“Because you surprise me. Because I’m not done being surprised by you.”Iron Heart is the sequel and conclusion to Crier’s War, an opener of a duology that changed me deeply. With Ayla on the run and Scyre Kinok gaining increasing power, Crier is left needing to decide where her loyalties lie. Ayla’s journey in this sequel is primarily about power: her new desire to gain, and her newfound agency in making decisions about which types of power to wield. She's a character who has been through a lot, and always survived, which makes her compelling. But she is also a character who is terrified to let her guard down. Falling in love with Crier challenges her and forces her to push herself. Seeing her take up a new role in politics of the land was immensely satisfying, and I was consistently invested. Throughout this series I have been increasingly invested in Crier as a character, and her arc here is especially relevant. Crier yearns to be human; so much so, in fact, that she pretends to be one. In book one, this dynamic built to her falling in love, believing all along this made her flawed. In this sequel, Varela addresses a deeper question: How is she truly different from any other human? Her defiance of her father, her falling for Ayla, and her meeting human friends all serve as key parts of her character arc. “You can’t read me once and know everything.”“Then I will read you again and again.” The dynamic between Crier and Ayla is, as always, incredibly tender. While their dynamic in book one caught me, I definitely stayed hooked; I found several lines of dialogue between them genuinely heartbreaking (this one above took my breath away). Generally, though, this did not quite live up to book one for me. I noticed a distinct amount of tell not show around the beginning. There’s also a specific issue with point of view that bugged me a lot: sometimes, point of view stays stable in each chapter, and sometimes it switches. I did not remember this happening in book one, so I do not know if this was not intentional, and I did not like it. And this series has always relied a bit on plot happening to the characters, but I felt that repeated a lot here. “Because you deserve to be known, in whatever capacity you wish. I am trying to become a person who deserves to know you. I want that more than anything.”In a lot of ways, I think it was my enjoyment of book one that led to my enjoyment of this book, rather than anything specific about this sequel. Yet a few other dynamics of this book stood out to me. Junn is an excellent side character, and her development stood out as a highlight here. She serves as an excellent narrative foil to both Crier and Ayla and is by far the most fleshed-out character within the book. While I wanted more from (view spoiler)[Storme, Ayla's brother, (hide spoiler)] I definitely enjoyed his dynamic with Ayla. This duology was an excellent read and I am so excited for more by Nina Varela. If you haven't picked up Crier's War yet... well.

But. The execution? Was not amazing. This was not the worst book I have read. This book is an excellent warning to remember the human aspect of any type of revolution; to remember that, when fighting for freedom, human life still matters. People still bleed. Carmen is forced to choose between herself and her cause, which serves for an interesting arc. The scene in which Carmen is forced to cross a border is particularly excellent, rivaling the best of book one. I genuinely liked Carmen and found her decently compelling as a lead. On paper, this book is good. But in practice… I feel like I wasted my time. The problem is that We Set the Dark on Fire bases its appeal off the tension between Carmen and Dani. In this book, they do not reunite until 50% of the way through the book, and it is frankly boring. Which shocks me to type, by the way. In book one, the tension between Carmen and Dani was genuinely never boring to me. It makes more sense, however, when I remember just how repetitive this book was. We get it, Ari is evil. We get it, Carmen feels guilty over her betrayal. We get it, she has feelings for Dani, but maybe there’s angst about it. We get it, she’s not sure whether Alex trusts her. Mejia also tends to rely on tell, not show, for her characters, and here, with no actual interaction between Dani and Carmen, the telling gnawed at me. I don’t want to be told that Carmen misses Dani for 200 pages, regardless of how invested I am in how much she misses Dani. Show me.Maybe as a result of this, I actually found myself struggling to invest in Carmen here. Her character is on the precipice of a decision, and is desperate to get Dani back, and cares for Alex and Sota too. There is no reason she should not drive the plot with ease. But… it feels like the plot happens to her. And yes, this was true of book one at times, but there was a reason for that; Dani and Carmen’s situation was helpless, trapped. Carmen is doing things in this book. There is no reason for her to be boring, and it is frankly a crime that she is. Oh. And the plot twist is really painfully obvious, and not satisfying enough to make up for it. You could guess the twist in book one, too, but you cared so much that it didn’t matter. This… why on earth do we care about the characters involved? All in all, while book one felt dynamic, this feels, frankly, stagnant. I honestly think this just needed another round of editing. It really wasn’t awful. It was just. Deeply mediocre. I’m going to pretend this doesn’t exist and reread the Dani/Carmen scenes from We Set the Dark on Fire now.

How’d she get this way? Well, that’s for her to know and you to find out. The book excels in terms of quality of the writing, in terms of suspense, and in terms of character work, but the latter two each thrive off the backbone of a much more key dynamic: the pacing of information. Tess Sharpe excels at holding back just enough and giving just enough that we gasp at every page, but still need more. “Dual timelines in a suspense YA book done well” is a phrase I was not expecting to be using in any s anytime soon, but here we are: These are some of the best backstory chapters I’ve had the pleasure of reading recently. Every backstory chapter adds to the story, develops the characters, or plays up intrigue. By a hundred pages in, you can’t get enough. It’s been a while since a suspense novel has messed with my head like this, has kept me up at night, just wanting to read one more chapter. When I finally got near the end, I at one point squeaked so loudly I almost woke up my roommate. Ridiculous? Yes. But you’ll understand.

This is extremely exciting given one of my New Year’s resolFor the first time in a multitude of months, I have finished a book not for work or class! This is extremely exciting given one of my New Year’s resolutions is to start reading again! “I swear to God, if a ghost kills me, I’ll haunt the shower. You guys will never have hot water again.”One Last Stop is an excellent romance between August, a bi former amateur detective recently moved to New York in search of a home, and Jane, a Chinese lesbian displaced in time from the 1970s. I think the strongest element of this book is probably the found family. There’s a charming roommates Wes, Nico, and Myla; her neighbor, Annie/Isaiah, the object of Wes’s affection; Winfield, Jerry, and Lucy of her pancake shop. But there’s a lot to love about the romantic and character elements of this as well. August’s cool narration, unwilling to let on deep feeling, is ultimately rooted in her past with her mother, but its writing is slow-building. The slow unveiling of the mysteries of Jane’s character is so excellent, with a perfect balance between interesting twists and her growing humanity. And the sex scenes... are good. Good sex is hard to write. That's all I'm going to say. “Two different generations of messy, loud, brave and scared and brave again people stomping their feet and waving hands with bitten nails, all the things they share and all the things they don’t. the things she has that people like Jane smashed windows and spat blood for.”McQuiston refers to One Last Stop in their epilogue as an ""Unbury Your Gays"" book, and I think that's an apt description for what this book does so well: It takes a character long thought dead, and gives her new life. Whether in August's life or not, August has allowed for Jane to have new life. Through her queerness, she is reborn. And that's what is, I think, so resonant about this book: When queerness has so often led us to death, it here allows for new life.

If these people said her destiny was to see the queen, she would prove them wrong. She wasn’t their chosen one. She was just Regan, and as Regan, she ran.This is the first book I have finished all semester not for class, and while it was certainly very readable, I feel as if this tread some of the same ground earlier novellas trod (and better). This was missing both a sense of originality, and the characters I loved so much from earlier novellas. This is definitely the most disappointed I’ve felt by any book in this series. Across the Green Grass is not a bad book. Seanan McGuire’s writing style really does work for me most of the time, and it's 160 pages, so I had fun anyway. The ending twist is interesting. I loved Gristle, the Kelpie, and Chickory & Pansy, the centaurs. As this series has done stories of girls who don’t quite fit, I think this is... just fine. McGuire is clearly infatuated with girls who are just a bit wrong for what is expected by their gender, and those kinds of stories tend to resonate with me as well. This one is satisfying enough. In general, though, this felt a bit… well, lacking? I think where this series has ended up succeeding for me is in the dynamics between recurring characters, and the fact that several characters get to grow in various ways in one short novella. Often each subsequent narrator is someone we already know, but wanted more from. Here, we have an all-new character to start rooting for, and no characters we know from earlier books. I really missed the presence and character development of other narrators. I guess I feel like I just don’t care very much about this book either way. I don’t think this particular book made an argument for why it should exist. Verdict? If you’re reading this series for fun little stories about people who don’t quite fit, you’ll probably like this. If you’re reading this series for the characters who already exist, you’ll probably be a bit bored. I’m hoping the next book goes back to our old characters.

The Project follows a slow seduction into a charity group called the Unity Project from the perspective of two sisters, older sister Bea several years prior and in third person and aspiring journalist Lo current and in first person. My thoughts on this are complicated, but essentially, I think this is a slow build to an excellent payoff, completely worth every second. The middle of this book is exceptionally slow, mostly taken up by a compelling round of development for co-leader Casey, former doctor Foster, and finally the Unity Project's leader, Lev. While Bea's narrative is often more distant, Lo's is a close first, and she proves an often-frustrating main character, one who due to her own previous issues struggles intensely with a need to belong. This is very purposeful and well-done, but difficult to read. I do think Courtney Summers is a great writer, but I wondered a bit if further editing on Lo's character arc could work out some of the pacing issues. The last 15% of The Project is easily the highlight of the book, absolutely wild but so satisfying as a narrative conclusion. It plays well off everything we know about Lo, everything we know about Bea, and so many hints we've received earlier in the book.

The witches cannot simply leave their asylum perfectly fine. Those hurts will linger. I love a lot that this book is all about political machinations—and the ways in which compromise is often not enough. In particular, Grace’s arc is an absolute joy. C.J. Polk’s writing has a clear-eyed understanding of the politics of oppression that constantly stuck in my mind. Robin’s skill at planning and organizing is such a fun trait for a main character; she feels incredibly distinct. She is independent to the point of self-distress, trying at all times to holdAnd then there’s the romance between Robin and Zelind. OH, this romance. Robin and Zelind were married twenty years prior before Zelind’s removal to an asylum. When the two reunite, it cannot be a simple fall back into love — even when neither has ever loved another. Where Robin has made herself into someone who need rely on no one, Zelind has relied on people—but in the context of a deeply traumatic experience. To rely on Robin, khe needs to feel trusted. To rely on Zelind, Robin needs to trust. There's a lot more to love about this book - side character Jacob Clarke, and his (view spoiler)[spouses Winnie and Duke (hide spoiler)], are wonderful. I enjoyed the nuance given to both Zelind's brother Jarom and Zelind's complex feelings towards him. Crook Jamille is a treat. And of course, there are Robin's ghosts, Aunt Joy and Mahalia. This series was incredible and I will never get over it ever. She has made her way to a prime spot on my favorite-ever-fantasy shelf.

Because if isn’t a love story, then what is it?This is the worst book I’ve ever read. It was painful, upsetting, and often made me so uncomfortable I wanted to put it down. I also read it in a day. My Dark Vanessa follows narrator Vanessa as, after another woman comes out with a story of abuse by their high school English teacher, she reflects back on a relationship with him beginning when she was fifteen years old. This book is a fantastically written and incredibly difficult character study of a specific abuse survivor. Though there were moments when the pacing stymied, I found this book genuinely impossible to put down. Towards the latter half of the novel, Vanessa becomes an increasingly unreliable narrator of her own life. She’s desperate to romanticize what happened to her because if she cannot romanticize it, her life becomes a manipulation. It is beyond that she doesn’t want to be seen as a victim; she does not want to acknowledge herself as a victim, because to admit she was a victim would send her life collapsing around her. Vanessa invalidates another survivor of Strane’s abuse and repeatedly invalidates herself, all in the interest of avoiding facing the awful truth of what happened.There’s a Goodreads  about My Dark Vanessa [which I originally found on Tumblr, thank you Katie for your help!] that I really feel the need to quote: “If she was the victim that whole time what meaning did her life between 15 and 32 have? Who was she or what was their left of the real her? If it was all a mind game, a manipulation, if her reality was fabricated, then who is she truly?”And this is the real tragedy of the novel—she cannot admit what is happening to her, what has happened to others, because to do so would be to lose her narrative of her life. She loses by denying and by admitting. I really need to emphasize that this book is incredibly upsetting. I don’t have any interest in debating the ethics of it existing; Kate Russel wrote this partially as a reaction to her own experiences, and I think she is saying something really profound about romanticization of trauma here. (As for the Ortiz controversy I think Vox said it best; her points about the publishing industry are excellent, her implications about Russell decidedly less so.) I also do not think that everyone should read this book. But I think if this description appeals to you… it’s really, really worth the read.

I generally liked this and thought it was enjoyable. My favorite characters were Matthias/Max, Elena/Lady Lover’s grandson whom they accidentally adopt, and Quinn, Addam’s prophet younger sibling. The banter between Rune and Brand is great, and generally the dialogue is really strong. Rune is an interesting and dimensional character, especially towards the later books, and his narrative for future books is really compelling. However, a few things didn’t quite work for me. Addam is… very fine, and I wanted him to be more complex. The wordbuilding is fairly overcomplex but also often made very little sense to me. Also, a few of the battles contain approximately three coherent words each—most of the battles have clear sense of speciality and active dialogue, but some contain so much worldbuilding that they’re not entirely readable. This is all stuff that would be fine if not for the fact that battle is a decent amount of the novel. At times, I just wasn’t rooting for these people in the same way that I think I should on paper. There are also a few general content things that I did not love. The running joke where Brand wants Rune to lose weight is tired and I really didn’t like it; there’s a bit about a past experience with “the Amazons” that slightly rubbed me the wrong way; and though I generally really like and am compelled by Rune’s narrative as [SPOILER] (view spoiler)[a sexual assault survivor (hide spoiler)], I felt the on-page description of this was just on the side voyeuristic. Overall I did still enjoy this and I think I will probably read the sequel because my good pal did get me into this and Rune’s character arc is potentially compelling. TW: sexual assault.

I loved this, and I'll be thinking about it for a while.

I see what the author was trying to do with this book: the 80s-Stranger-Things vibe, the concept of vigilante justice, the storyline about abuse. I only wish these aspects translated. This book follows Mayhem, a high school junior who has recently escaped an abusive situation with her mother, Roxy. The two are forced to go to Roxy’s hometown, where they meet her sister, Elle, and her adopted cousins, Jason, Kidd, and Neve. But the hometown has its secrets, including... magic.To compliment a few things here: Mayhem’s storyline around abuse is a good concept. I appreciated Mayhem’s determination to “become someone who hits”. That was cool! It’s solid and interesting character motivation, if done right. Two problems here: one, that motivation doesn’t actually explicitly appear until halfway through the book, which is a problem, as it makes the first half feel meandering. And two, her arc never connects to the plot, though it’s clearly intended to. The character beats and the plot beats feel as if they’re meant for two separate books, and Mayhem’s internal monologue is barely there. On a pure story level, and I think partially as a result of lacking character motivation, the story structure is really really off—the book feels like 70% buildup, a plot conclusion, and then an awkward 20% that has to conclude character beats. More importantly, the book just never really gives you a reason to care about these characters. Possibly I am just bad with first person POV (we’ve established that), but I just... I feel like this story could’ve taken place with entirely different characters, and nothing would’ve changed. The book doesn’t develop relationships enough for their stress points to actually change anything. When Mayhem tells us that Neve is her best friend, it rings false; when she tells us she loves Jason, I felt nothing. The storyline with Roxy is similarly frustrating. Roxy is an alcoholic who has made her daughter into her pseudo-parent. That is acknowledged in the book... at about 50%, and I felt the buildup to the moment where Mayhem calls her on it really failed. The book establishes that Mayhem is being treated badly, but not that she knows she’s being treated badly, so her argument with her mother feels oddly out of left field. It also... Roxy is really fucking up a lot here, and I kept expecting the story to really challenge her into changing, and it doesn’t, she just kind of... decides to change. It’s not bad, per se, it’s just vaguely unsatisfying. The book in summary. Oh, I also wished this book leaned into the setting and the vibe a bit more. What’s there is good and I wanted more. I was waffling between giving this two and three stars, because I do see the potential here. I don’t think this is a bad book: it’s well-written, and I liked some of the ideas and concepts. But frankly, I was just... not invested in this book as a whole.

I only wantThis book feels good on paper: an emotional premise, eerie writing, representation, and an excellent ending that ties into thematic ideas. I only wanted more ensemble cast, and maybe a bit less of whatever was going on with the romance. We Were Restless Things follows the mysterious death of Link Miller by drowning… in the middle of the woods. In various ways, they all hurt from this: Noemi as she grieves for the boy she had feelings for, Amberlyn as she grieves her brother, Gaetan as he grieves his best friend, Lyle her friend, and new kid Jonah as he tries to find a place in their group. The indisputable best part of this book is the amazing imagery. This book was eerie and the more fantastical chapters are wonderfully written. They remind me of the best of Maggie Stiefvater. Noemi is asexual. This arc was by far my favorite in the book; she processes her sexuality in both healthy and unhealthy ways, depending on the time. The way her feelings about herself and more specifically, how people would perceive her, impacted her relationships hit me hard. When this came up between her and Jonah, it originally struck me as a romantic arc, but it’s really not; the focus remains on her development. I wanted a bit more out of her ending, if anything. Some very solid positives over here. Unfortunately, this was not a perfect reading experience for me. First of all, it’s a book that in structure does not pick up until around 50%. Until then, these characters are essentially just getting to know each other. This isn’t technically a problem. On its own. But besides Noemi, none of these characters feel as if they have a significant or resonant character arc. Who are these characters? I don’t feel as if I quite know. But We Were Restless Things left me craving… more from its ensemble cast. As we’re talking about the characters, I want to bring up romance. The dynamic between side characters Amberlyn and Lyle (yes, this is sapphic content) is solid and sweet. The other romantic dynamics… were another area. Noemi is, over the course of this book, technically lusted after by three different guys, one dead. Both of her romantic arcs are… frustrating. Jonah and Noemi are a well-written couple, except when the premise of their relationship is so fundamentally unromantic. Yes, I understand that two stepsiblings who know each other from childhood are very different from two people who meet for the first time at seventeen. I get that. But as someone who has a stepbrother, one, this entire trope is just nasty, and two, this book uncomfortably leans into that element of siblinghood. (view spoiler)[At one point, essentially, Noemi feels guilty about not wanting to sleep with Jonah, and when he traces the words I love you into her hand, she replies “stepbrother”. This… felt so incredibly uncomfortable. Just. I don’t know. If you’re going to do a romance between step siblings, which I would generally encourage against it has been done so many times you are not doing something new, there is no need to point it out like this. (hide spoiler)]On a more positive note, it’s interesting that this book that was comped to The Raven Cycle also contains two main characters whose relationship is not based on kissing, though for very different reasons. It’s one of those accidents that would still make a wonderful essay about parallels.To be completely fair to this book in criticizing it, I think I partially have shifted in what genres I prefer over the past couple of years. Had I read this at seventeen, high off my Raven Cycle phase, I’m fairly sure I would have enjoyed my experience far more. So if that’s you… this might very well be worth a try. It’s well-written, and though I wanted more from four of the five leads, they’re all likable. This had some good parts. I just do not think I was the target audience.

[There were nine and the emperor has killed five; he says three still exist. This discrepancy in numbers will, I’m sure, not be relevant later ever.] And meanwhile, the BOE (Blood of Eden) cult, who hate the nine houses, is also in hot pursuit.

And the Body has begun to speak again as a hallucination. What’s a girl to do?

You were so afraid anyone might touch you. You would always been afraid of anyone touching you, and had not known your longing flinch was so obvious to those who tried it.”▷Mercymorn and Augustine are the worst (honorific) (loving) (full of mourning) ▷First of all I think having a threesome with God (page 281 in my hardcover) is funny bitch behavior▶“I will let you know now that the plan for my funeral is in my top drawer, and I’ve got it down to a minute by minute framework, and it’s only 24 minutes, and it’s just lovely.” ▷Mercymorn was funny for that and I’m obsessed with her▷I have a friend who's like, deeply obsessed with Augustine and he's not in the right for it but he IS funny for it▷Gideon and Ianthe interacting is funny as hell I love it▶“Get a grip. Don’t look at her blood, or lick her bones, or do any of the shit necromancers lie and say they don’t do the moment two of them get nasty.” “What can I say. I love a little gall on gall.” “Reverse everything I just told you. Let’s get married.”▷Harrow being Ho calling in (page 332 in my hardcover) is also funny as hell▷Ianthe’s arc with her arm was so fantastic▷She is fucking crazy but she is free <3 ▷The Matthias Nonius v the sleeper battle where they both speak entirely in tongues was funny also▷I miss Camilla. I think it is funny of her to be with Blood of Eden. ▷Y’all read As Yet Unsent?

Please show me how to do a press up. Also, I’m very obviously attracted to y- no, damn it, this is just sad. This is garbage.”▶“His calm agreement made her all the more furious. She did not examine why.”▷I genuinely am going crazy over this line.

Ianthe sacrificed Augustine to save God. Pyrhha was inside Gideon the First the whole time, and now that bitch is dead but she’s fine. Also, Harrow is now asleep in her silly little coffin. [Nona] whose identity we do not know is somewhere. ▷This meme actually made me remember how this worked better not gonna lie▷The BOE (Blood of Eden) cult who hate the nine houses, used to be run by Cytherea, who has been a revenant for twenty years??▷Gideon (Ortus) and Cytherea planned to kill their Lyctor’s baby, Gideon, to start a thanergy cascade in order to open the Locked Tomb. But the baby wasn’t actually Gideon’s, it was God’s. ▷The Locked Tomb Body is maybe the one to have resurrected Gideon in Harrow’s body (??)▷Also, just because I had to google this, necromancers turn thalergy (life magic) into thanergy (death magic)Things To Speculate On▷I have a long running theory that one of the characters is going to be the last revenant beast, because there's that one line in Harrow where they mention there are nine, five killed, and three left, which is obviously some Faulty math. I think John. I think this would compel me so I want it to be true. it could also be like, Cytherea, as there’s a note at one point that she was a revenant for twenty years which just made me go ????▷Anastasia, the one who almost got Perfect Lyctorhood, will probably also be relevant▷Here is some cool and sexy little speculation but anyway basically with no evidence I think Nona is Anastasia and Anastasia is also the body. ▷Also I think Alecto will be AlectoGideonbod [as the post would put it]. Again no evidence just vibes and I don't remember why I so firmly believed this four months ago there was probably evidence at the time▷idk my brain is soup [not the evil kind] so I will just leave this for now but go speculate about women possessing each other in the gay way in the comments I really want to know what people think. your thoughts on the crazy people? tell me about themBlog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,206,1,"Nov 26, 2021","Jan 11, 2022","Apr 16, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39325105-harrow-the-ninth

The Care and Feeding of Waspish Widows is a sweet romance between Agatha, a London book publisher, widower, and mother to a radical, and Penelope, a country beekeeper married to a gay man off at sea. Olivia Waite has a style of writing romance that must just really work for me. She builds the relationships between these characters slowly but surely, making the audience hard-pressed not to root for them at every turn. Even when the banter is slow-building, I just never fail to invest in her characters. Additionally, Waspish Widows touches pretty heavily on themes of class. I liked that Sydney and Eliza, Agatha’s son and apprentice respectively, got their own storyline building into themes of the novel. I also adore how she interacts with actual historical events and topics; the public trial Queen Caroline (of Brunswick) of Great Britain places the date at 1806. I didn’t love this quite as much as I adored Celestial Mechanics, as I just didn’t feel quite as strongly about the characters, but overall this was a worthy sequel, and I’m excited to read book three. If you like Waite's novels you should give this a try, and if you've never read anything by her, you should try A Lady's Guide to Celestial Mechanics. (And then this one, if you like it!)

The empress erased memories of her own life, leaving Rabbit as the only memory. It is thus in her telling that the Empress’s cruelty comes, but also in that her humanity is extracted. The humanity of those around her does not go unmarked, either. Servant Kazu and fortuneteller Sukai (Lucky) are each unimportant, but remembered by Almost Brilliant nonetheless.

Two weeks after the breakup of a nine-month-long relationship. A fascinating choice of literature on my part, but this genuinely could not have blown me further away. January is a writer of fun, amazing romance novels. Gus is a writer of morose literary fiction. When they last met at an MFA, she hated his arrogance towards her genre. Now, they’re living next door to each other and both in a writing slump. What to do? Well, make each other a bet: She’ll write literary fiction, and he’ll write romance. Gus and January might be my new favorite couple. There’s just so much love in the way Emily Henry writes these characters. These characters are just so real. The discussion of past love via January’s ex, Jacques, especially resonated with me a great deal — when you want someone to fit into your love story, it can take away from who you are alone. There’s such fantastic character arc writing going on here as well; as they write, one is becoming more pessimistic as the other becomes more optimistic.

Reality? I’m obsessed.The appeal in these stories comes in their brief nature. They’re easy to read before bedtime, each night, if you want to be incredibly cheesy (I did). Each one sets up and interesting premise, and builds to an ending that you hardly ever see coming, but always find satisfying. In his epic video Sherlock Is Garbage and Here’s Why (a masterpiece), hbomberguy pointed out that Irene Adler is, in this story, a protofeminist figure, and I’m inclined to agree. Having a woman outsmart Sherlock in one of the first stories, upon which he learns and grows, was both unexpected and deeply satisfying. It’s fun in general that Holmes, occasionally, fails. There is very little I can say about Sherlock Holmes that has not been said before. I do think, however, that the dynamic of John and Watson is particularly brilliant. As is pointed out in the introduction to the Complete Sherlock Holmes (which I just started as of the writing of this ), the idea of having an everyman to Sherlock Holmes’ incredible detective is honestly inspired.

What 'it' is, is a different question.Within this play, love and intellectualism work in opposition. It is in essence a play about how we may know everything there is to know but we cannot only know this: we must also know what it is to love. We can predict the future, Stoppard believes; except, of course, for irregularities, like sex. The play focuses a lot on sex in this regard, to the point where questionable choices are made. (Pairing a 17-year-old with her 25-year-old-tutor who has known her since she was 13 is simply... not a choice I would have made.) I also didn't fully believe the 'love' between either of the couples: I believed they were attracted to each other, but not that they loved each other. The final waltz is a wonderful scene, but some of the buildup felt like not enough. Discovery of work after a time... that, I had more emotions about.

Medea is perhaps one of the most ferocious female characters in all Greek tragedy, andMedea begins with a displacement, and ends with a displacement. Medea is perhaps one of the most ferocious female characters in all Greek tragedy, and I’m fascinated by her. Medea is a masterful manipulator, conniver, convincer: her stychomythia with Creon and later Aegeus each remind me of Clytemnestra’s with Agamemnon in Aeschylus’ Oresteia. She makes herself a suppliant to Aegeus, falling at his feet in honor. She kills her children out of revenge. Well, actually, her killing of her children functions here as somewhat of an attempt to cut her final ties. I think it’s interesting that the original myth does not actually even make her kill her children. Euripides has a tendency towards putting his female characters (most notably with Electra, who actually kills Clytemnestra rather than sympathizing with Orestes) into roles with less moral goodness, but more agency. Yet she is also sympathetic. Medea’s role as the ‘other’ is downplayed, and her identity as a murderer sympathized with. Medea’s only ask for an oath to King Aegeus is that she never seeks expulsion: she desires a safe harbor, after one expulsion after another. Jason is desperate for power, but throughout, it is Medea who has saved him, who has helped him, who has become a murderer to save him. When he betrays her, she has nothing to go back to, and an identity forever corrupted by her past deeds. Medea and Jason accuse each other of selfishness, a lack of love for their children, and a desire for power; both exhibit all of these traits themselves, but it is Jason, the familiar, whom we criticize most. The gods, towards the end, are on her side. (Interestingly, this ending, too, would’ve been a plot twist to Euripides’ original audience. Plot twists in this era of tragedy are rare.)This play allegedly took third place in 431 BCE drama competition into which Euripides entered it, but by the end of the century, Aristophanes was cheerfully mocking it, and it made the ‘select’ plays of Euripides, the ones passed along.

Sophocles is by all definitions one of the greatest playwrites of all time. He focuses on the psyContinuing the tradition of greek tragedy ing. Sophocles is by all definitions one of the greatest playwrites of all time. He focuses on the psyche, and often on characters who fall by doing the right thing: who define themselves by honorable traits until it kills them. These plays may be less known on the whole, but still pack a punch. I did notice that these plays had little affect on me in comparison to certain others by Sophocles, but I believe this may partially be a result of translation; these translations feel less biting, less sharp, more direct meaning than emotion.Reviewed Plays from this Collection→Ajax ★★★☆☆ Sophocles← (c.445 BCE) (from a diff. volume) Ajax is a man with a name that shrieks: the Greeks would have called him Aias. The vocative, when speaking to him, would've sounded like aiai, the Greek exclamation. In this play, following Ajax's final day after a prophesy comes he will kill himself, he certainly lives up to that. After this one day, the time for his fate to come will expire, and he may live. Ajax dies upon a Trojan sword, on Trojan ground, but he has placed it himself. Tecmessa, Ajax's wife and war-bride, plays a much wider role in this than expected: she garners respect, in contrast to the expectations for war brides. Yet she still has a fragile role. The consequences for her if Ajax dies are not just losing him, but losing everything. His son, Eurysaces, would be considered illegitimate; indeed, this is the fate of his half-brother, Teucer. The contrast between him and Teucer is also interesting: while Teucer is an archer, associated with cowards (Paris) and tricksters (Odysseus), Ajax is a straight-shooting fighter. But the 'deception' speech to Tecmessa complicates this, using arrow imagery around his upcoming death. The breaks in convention are notable: the play breaks typical narrative structure, the location shifts, the chorus leaves and comes back, and Ajax dies on stage, rather than off. Notable Lines (John Moore translation):CHORUS: Strangely the long & countless drift of time brings all things forth from darkness into light. (646)AJAX: My speech is womanish for this woman's sake. (652) →Electra ★★★★★ Sophocles← (unk)Reviewed here.→Women of Trachis ★★★★★ Sophocles← (unk) The saddest of these plays... to me, anyway. Following Deianira, wife of Heracles, as she is tricked by the dead into killing her husband, this play pulls its audience in. Deianira is hopeless, but never pathetic—she uses what agency she has to great renown. This play made me feel genuinely claustrophobic. We, as the audience, know from the beginning that Deianira is killing her husband through her actions: as she battles with whether to stand still or act, we know she should stand still. But it is impossible to fully want that for her. It is her willingness to act that makes her so compelling; it gives her the chance to fix her life, and eventually destroys her life. →Philoctetes ★★★☆☆ Sophocles← (409 BCE)This play revolves around the consequences of an evil trick played by the Greeks (as per usual). Ten years ago, the Greek army abandoned war hero Philoctetes on an abandoned island. Now, as per a prophecy, trickster Odysseus and young Neoptolemus must retrieve him. The character of Neoptolemus here must grapple with the bones he's standing on, but also keep the peace with both parties. This play is interesting in that, like Ajax, it's a story about war that occurs removed from war. This is a recurring theme of Greek tragedy: the battles are not actually the topic of drama. It is the psychological trauma of war and the dynamics of heroism that are up for debate.

Sappho was a complicated woman. Believed to have written 8 or 9 books, her lover Megara, daughter Kleis, and enemy Andromeda all appear within these texts. Through this translation, Anne Carson attempts to convey the best of her work, through both presentation—sometimes the spacing makes the poem, as with verse 26—and wording, as she discusses in her final notes of the book. For me, half the appeal of this edition was the work put into translation notes by Carson. Her insights on poem 137’s use of the extremely loaded term aidos (shame), and poem 142’s use of the term hetairai (friend) to connote an intimate relationship with a woman, each deepen the meaning of the poem. I also appreciated Carson’s commentary on 16, 55, 94, and 98. I particularly loved her choice to end on the brief verses, page after page of lines with no context beyond. Each line may be brief, but together they are infinite. Carson points out that Sappho associates desire with death, an idea that—interestingly enough—is also a function of queer theory in later times. Lee Edelman would, in his iconic 2004 book No Future, argue that because queerness cannot produce the patriarchal ideal of a Child, it is fundamentally defined by a drive towards death. Though I think this can easily become an oversimplification when applied to the ancient world, I couldn’t help but think of this when reading her poetry. If desire is death, what does it mean that through her poetry, her desire has kept her alive? There is something particularly powerful about a note in Anne Carson’s introduction, where she discusses the fact that much of our remaining knowledge of Sappho comes from references—other ancient artists quoting Sappho, discussing her works, creating poetry inspired by her. I wondered, reading this, what our future histories will look like: Which lines will survive? Which will not?A few of my highlights are listed below. ____(16) Some men say an army of horse and some say an army on foot and some men say an army of ships is the most beautiful thing on the black earth.

Not if it’s you.Making the Anne Carson Oresteia an edition of the same book as the Aeschylus Oresteia is a mistake. This is not the Aeschylus Oresteia: it is a mashup of three chapters of the Oresteia by the three extant Greek tragic authors. There is Agamemnon, by Aeschylus, on Clytemnestra's killing of Agamemnon; Electra, by Sophocles, one of three takes on Electra and Orestes' killing of Clytemnestra; and Orestes, by Euripides, a tale meant to take place before the Eumenides of Aeschylus: not a conclusion, but the buildup to one (and which I somewhat prefer to that tale). This composed story has a different effect and a different moral to give than any individual play. In the composition, we receive different takes on the same characters. These three plays are all focused on a character study in a way the second two of the Aeschylus Oresteia are perhaps not: Clytemnestra gets her due, Electra gets her chance to speak, and finally Orestes gets his chance at fighting for redemption. Characters shift: the Orestes of Electra is sharp, turned in one direction, while the Orestes of his play is sick with grief. It is also a story that shifts: the Agamemnon's turn from joy to violence, the Electra's deep sorrow, and the Orestes' shift again to redemption. This play begins with a house stained by blood: the legacies of death within the house of Atreus hang deep over the play, whether any is willing to acknowledge them or not. As Tyndareas asks Orestes: where should it end? Where does justice end, and redemption begin? The idea of assembling an Oresteia based on plays by the three great tragedians, in chronological order, is brilliant, and a translation project I fully loved. But the selections must also be ed. Or, I’m going to  them, anyway. Quotes are at the bottom of the . Play by Play Reviews[image]→Agamemnon ★★★★★ Aeschylus← “Every character in the Agamemnon sets fire to language in a different way,” as Anne Carson once so wisely said in her introduction to this play. And indeed they do. The play begins with a messenger speech that blends past and present, and then quickly switches to action. The translation of Cassandra’s lines as lowercase and out of poetic meter; one section allows Cassandra to shout repeatedly, before coming back to articulate lines. A motif runs through the play of violence against women as the taking away of voice. Notably, the chorus explicitly references the rape and cutting of the tongue of Philomela, who was turned into a nightingale, a creature with voice. The play is, in a way, about the silencing of women: Iphigenia, who had a ‘bit’ forced into her mouth, and Cassandra, deprived of belief by a god. Clytemnestra, by killing Agamemnon, takes these back. The brilliance of this play is that it may be read with sympathy to so many. Agamemnon is often brash, hard to grasp, yet sometimes sympathetic: what is my duty, he asks, towards daughter or country? (Although this is also hypocritical, as I just tweeted ‘I'm on the side of everyone in the Oresteia except for Agamemnon’ last week. And I stand by it.)Clytemnestra is by no means a morally good character, but it is hard not to sympathize with her, hard not to root for her. She is a power player of the highest magnitude; the scene of stychomythia with regards to the red cloak feels deeply visceral, despite the fact that the consequences are simply the trampling of a symbol. Subtext takes the highest power here: she drags him into hubris, walking the path of a god, dooming him in the eyes of the gods as well as in hers. Clytemnestra, in her two murders, believes she ends the cycle Agamemnon started; she is the only one left alone to tell the story. Is Clytemnestra in the right? Perhaps not. May we blame her? Not that, either. Cassandra is the most aware character of the play: in fact, aware of not just her fate, but Orestes & Electra’s as well. Her language is scattered, wild, compared to the others; but with that, she is no fool. When Cassandra enters the court, Clytemnestra tells her the court is kinder than a rich one (Carson has cut this). But what life is there, truly, in living as a slave to the murderer of those you love? Cassandra’s death is, in its own way, a mercy killing. Well. Depending on your translation. A note on translation: Carson’s translation simplifies much of Agamemnon, cutting the chorus’ monologues, specifically, down a significant amount. While I am no fan of the elaborate nature of certain choral monologues, reading the Carson translation second, I almost felt it lacked some of the viciousness I got from the first play. I think the slow build lends nuance to Clytemnestra’s plan, more time for our minds to percolate around it. Clytemnestra has bite, yes, but not patience. In Ruden’s translation, her words are less sharp, but her machinations more powerful. From the Sarah Ruden translation, my first, I came away most sympathetic to Clytemnestra. With Anne Carson, my second, I came away far more sympathetic to Kassandra. Take that as you will. Agamemnon is my favorite of all Aeschylus’ plays and one of my favorite tragedies period. This is not my favorite of the translations. [image]→Electra ★★★★★ Sophocles← Aeschylus’ Oresteia was already a classic by the time of Sophocles and Euripides, so they each picked things to focus on. In the Electra of Sophocles, she is decidedly more defiant, decidedly more confrontational, a creature of voice as Anne Carson describes her. Sophocles, always obsessed with the psychology of his heroes, deproblematizes the murder, making Electra and Orestes easier to sympathize with. The killing is brutal, harsh, but less sympathetic to Clytemnestra, in comparison to Libation Bearers. Orestes is specifically brutal to Aegisthus, leaving out Clytemnestra’s body ot haunt him. Yet he also gives Electra a more active role: indeed, it is she who confronts Clytemnestra face-to-face, not Orestes. While Orestes does the doing, Electra does the speaking. Electra, too, is developed in motivation here. We are introduced to her not in laying libations, but in fighting with her sister. Like Antigone, she loves the dead above the living; she is past childbearing, and without a husband, and resents that. She feels that her childlessness is a sign of a frozen life. She also feels she cannot unfreeze. “By dread things I am compelled… I know what I am” (295); “I must not violate Electra” (495), she tells the chorus. Joy would violate her. Why would it not? She has saved her brother and her sister and is thus hated by her mother. The most important dynamics of the show, however, are between Electra and her siblings. Chrysothemis, Electra’s sister, enters the play, working to contrast the headstrong Electra. Their relationship works in the same way Ismene and Antigone’s does. Chrysothemis does not love her mother, but does not sacrifice for her justice. Her relationship with Orestes hit me even harder. As Electra begins the play, she believes that Orestes is dead: this relationship is stronger, more necessary. The recognition scene, by the way, made me tear up. [image]→Orestes ★★★★★ Euripides← In her intro to this play, Anne Carson calls Euripides a “clown, but a dark clown”. On Twitter, I said he did the Ancient Greek equivalent of smoking crack. I stand by all of these statements. Euripides is at once obsessed with death, with punishment, and with brutality, but also willing to offer redemption at the wildest of times. This is a play defined by chaos: by ups and downs that seem almost random at first. We discuss Helen; we beg Menelaus for help; we see other opinions on incoming deaths; we see Menelaus will help; we see that he will not offer help after all. The final decision to murder Helen and either force Menelaus to acquiesce or go out in a blaze of glory is random, brought up with no buildup. It is a purposeful kind of chaos to offset the real madness of the play. For indeed, this is a play defined by human madness: directly in front of a home, Orestes goes mad while Electra and Pylades are forced to watch, forced to pick their sides and their battles. Here, the Eumenides are not real spirits who come onstage, but spirits of the mind, Orestes’ guilt found manifest in spirits. This is the human: the relationships between them, and the madness that is hard to cure. Watching Electra attempt to care for her little brother once more is the most emotional part of the play. This is the only play of any of the extant Orestes-focused works in which the relationship between Orestes and Pylades is at all relevant to our canon. One of the notes in the margin of my notebook when we read the Aeschylus Oresteia was, and I cannot stress this enough, the phrase “oh to be a paradigm of friendship with my same gender best friend in Ancient Greece.” Anne Carson calls this ending clownlike, almost a ridiculous sense of the deus ex machina. But I almost feel this works. In the house of Atreus, “death begets death” : as opposed to Antigone’s family, where they consume each other. It takes an act of a god to fix it.

The Secret Place follows case investigators Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway as they attempt to unravel the unsolved murder of a boy the year previous. At the center of it all lie two groups of girls: the odd girls, Selena, Becca, Julia, and Holly, and the other four, Joanne, Orla, Gemma, and Alison. I love beautiful; always have. I never saw why I should hate what I wish I had. Love it harder. Work your way closer. Clasp your hands around it tighter. Till you find a way to make it yours.The strength of this novel comes in the same as the strength of The Likeness—in its ability to get the narrator invested in every character to the point of both not wanting them to be the killer, and almost hoping that if they are, they get away with it. Characters are given sympathetic potential motivations. The interview montage with the four girls is a particularly brilliant piece of writing—I left with a perfect grasp on who each character could be, one that left me suspecting almost every one. There are two mysteries here: who did the card, and who did the murder, and the way the two play off each other is as brilliant as it is devastating. I also just deeply and genuinely adore the development of the dynamic between Moran and Conway, an unlikely duo with a lot to learn about each other. The build of trust between the two of them is so smooth, so sharp, and so delicate. I love this book. I wish I could read this series over and over again. (Also, I need to brag—I guessed it, both card and murder, and was not far off who knew what either. Not to flex or anything.)

Now sing your reckless mouth to sleep.Greek tragedy is a genre I did not expect to find so utterly enthralling before now. Yet the complexity, emotion, and gravitas presented within these plays has me enraptured. Here is a very long .[image]On the Use of TragedyThe Greek concept of tragedy is a fascinating one and one easy to misunderstand. I have actually been in a Greek Tragedy class now and read fifteen greek plays (a long  can be found here), so I feel more qualified to talk about this now. As given by Aristotle, the definition of a tragedy is not actually in its sad ending: it is in experiencing human suffering. (Most of the extant plays, not by coincidence but by generations of selection, end negatively.) Catharsis, by his definition, is a type of cleaning: ""we experience, then expurgate these emotions"". Tragedy can attempt to make the worst experiences consumable. It is not the ending, but the process. Aristotle said a tragedy should focus on a great man and his fall—not a good or wicked man, but one in between. His wording was 'hamartia', interpreted as flaw. This may have been oversymplified. A separate theorist, Bernard Knox, said something I prefer: that a hero makes a decision rooted in personal nature, and follows it to personal destruction. (This is especially relevant to Sophoclean drama.) Heroes can be everything: admirable in their steadfast natures, flawed in pride and violence. The Greeks did not admire every hero; rather, they thought of heroes as a way to explore both the benefits & the drawbacks of certain traits. At the heart of every Greek tragedy comes a moment of 'recognition' and 'reversal'. In the best, according to him, these are the same: this is catharsis. In case you were curious, my favorite plays of the sixteen I've read would be, ranked:5. Medea, Euripides 4. Libation Bearers, Aeschylus3. Hippolytus, Euripides2. Agamemnon, Aeschylus1. Antigone, SophoclesThese are all contained within this collection. Reviews of PlaysNotes: As this was my central textbook for a Greek Tragedy course, I’ve mentioned essentially three plays by the Big Three that I actually read via separate volumes. [image]→Persians ★★★★☆ Aeschylus← (472 BCE)A play of a great amount of grief. Review to come, TBD. →Agamemnon ★★★★★ Aeschylus← (458 BCE)Reviewed here. This is my favorite Aeschylus and one of my favorite Greek plays. →Libation Bearers ★★★★★ Aeschylus← (458 BCE)The brilliance of this play is that no character goes to their grave unsympathetic. When we see Clytemnestra speak of the death of her daughter at the hands of her own father, of the relationship with her daughter she has tried to mend, we are entirely on her side. When we hear Electra speak of the murder of her father by a woman who has become a tyrant in her land, we are entirely on her side. When we see Orestes' love for his sister, his doubt at whether he should commit this ultimate crime, we are entirely on his side. The death of Clytemnestra is heartbreaking because we cannot decide whose side we are on; we mourn for her while sympathizing with her killer. On a side note, Electra's allegiances are fascinating - she has sided with her father, the murderer of her sister, as have the women slaves (the so-called Libation Bearers) who make up the chorus. The women disagree rather than uniting, and their conflict, though partially given to Orestes, makes up the central conflict of the play. (This was a paper topic I had written down and did not write.)Interestingly, Clissa, Electra's nurse, serves as more of a motherly figure than Clytemnestra. Without her, the plot could hardly function; it is she who tells Aegisthus to come to Orestes, who forms such a central piece. Just as in Oedipus, a barely-named character decides the solution to the tragedy, but here, it is even more significant; a mother kills a mother. Notable Lines (Sarah Ruden translation):ORESTES: The male's female inside, or if he's not, he'll prove it soon. (305)ELECTRA: We are suppliants and refugees alive at your tomb; it must take us in. (337-338)ELECTRA: A raw-minded wolf is the soul our mother gave him. (421-422)CHORUS: The house must keep its wounds open. (472)ELECTRA: Persephone, give me triumph in its beauty. (490)CHORUS: Nobody honors what the gods revile. Which of these stories am I wrong to bring together? (638-639)CLYTEMNESTRA: We'll die the way we killed, by trickery. (889)→Eumenides ★★★★☆ Aeschylus← (458 BCE)Eumenides means 'The Kindly Ones', and refers to the fates that prey upon Orestes for the entirety of this play, until he receives an Athena-run trial. Though the trial is for Orestes, murderer of his mother and breaker of laws of the earth, the one truly on trial here may be Apollo. This is a play of the old gods vs. the new; one that begins with horror, and ends with unexpected forgiveness. Notable Lines (Sarah Ruden translation):CHORUS: There is a fitting place for terror: the overseer of the mind must sit there constantly. (517-519)CHORUS: The gods, who win every match, have wrenched me away from my vulnerable post. (838)ATHENA: Are the goddesses shrewd enough to find the path of merciful words for the people? (989)→Prometheus Bound ★★★★☆ Aeschylus (?)← (unk)This is a play of dubious authorship due to its oddness: the language, the lack of choral ode, and the technical elements all seem to place it in a later century. Still, it is not without its merits. Zeus, depicted here as a tyrant, chains Prometheus to a rock until he gives up a prophecy. Indeed, Prometheus holds the secret of Zeus' downfall, if he can only keep it. There is a strong contrast between Io, doomed into constant movement, and Prometheus, doomed to constant stillness. Prometheus stands on the edge of the world, on the vista of time; he talks only to Io and to the daughters of Oceanus, the oceans circling the world. This is a strange little play of seeming stagnancy, but in reality, it is dynamic. Notable Lines (James Romm translation):PROMETHEUS: All art is weaker than necessity. (514)IO: One wretch to another. (595)IO: I'm off the track, beyond what's sane. (884)PROMETHEUS: You young gods, new in rule—you think you dwell in towers that never topple. Have I not seen tyrants twice already hurled from them? (955)PROMETHEUS: Perhaps, but I choose punishment like mine over servitude like yours. (968)PROMETHEUS: Majesty of my mother Earth, bright sky that lets the common light whirl round,you see me here, and see my lot: injustice. (1092)[image]→Antigone ★★★★★ Sophocles← (442 BCE)Reviewed here. I think this is still my favorite ever Greek Tragedy. Loved this translation; feel like I can say this now as it’s the fourth I’ve read. →Oedipus the King ★★★★★ Sophocles← (c.430 BCE)Reviewed here. →Oedipus at Colonus ★★★★☆ Sophocles← (406 BCE) Reviewed here. I did not do a detailed reread of this one as it was not on our syllabus. →Electra ★★★★★ Sophocles← (unk)Reviewed here.[image]→Medea ★★★★★ Euripides← (431 BCE)Technically, this was my first-ever greek tragedy, in eighth grade. Reviewed here.→Electra ★★★☆☆ Euripides← (420-410 BCE)Aeschylus' Oresteia was already a classic by the time of both Sophocles and Euripides, so each shifted their focuses. In Libation Bearers, Aeschylus had focused on motherhood; in Sophocles, focus had shifted further to Electra, making Clytemnestra more villainous than anything else. Euripides, a constant bringer of further darkness, leans the opposite direction. In his adaptation, Clytemnestra is sympathetic. In Aeschylus' adaptation, the audience has no problem sympathizing with Electra and Orestes, even with their sympathies sticking by Clytemnestra. In this adaptation, it is harder. Clytemnestra's visceral grief over Orestes, her clear love for even Electra, outweighs even her earlier crime. When Electra herself is vicious and hateful to Clytemnestra, and she joins in on the killing, our sympathy becomes more difficult to place. I actually honestly struggled to sympathize with her at times, which is not a problem I've had with either previous Electra. The focus here is not on criminal fates, but on the status of outsider. The poor man who treats Electra well is the hero of this play, not royalty. Interestingly, this play also contains a lot more misogyny? There is a huge negative focus on Clytemnestra and Aegisthus for failing to play into gender roles; Aegisthus is essentially called bad for being too feminine, allowing a woman to dominate him, and Clytemnestra for being the dominant. This is the most prominent theme of the play and I really didn't vibe with this; it's actually somewhat strange given how interesting I generally find Euripides' view of gender. I can't tell to what degree this is Electra's character and to what degree this is Euripides' view, and I'd be interested to know.Notable Lines (Emily Wilson translation):ELECTRA: My hands, my tongue, my heavy-hearted mind. (335)ORESTES: He's now your slave, the man whom once you had to call your master. (898)ELECTRA: You thought your wealth and power made you someone. For me, I'd rather a man for husband—you looked like a girl. (939)CHORUS: You've spoken fairly, with an ugly fairness. (1051)→Trojan Women Euripides← (415 BCE) *TBRReview to come, TBD. →Hippolytus ★★★★★ Euripides← (428 BCE)Reviewed here. This is one of my favorites. →Alcestis ★★★★☆ Euripides← (438 BCE)Reviewed here.→Helen ★★★★☆ Euripides← (412 BCE)This is an interesting play, written as an exoneration of Helen from the hated version of her in the Trojan war myths (though I always enjoy her). It’s an interesting play in terms of plot, and a bit protofeminist: Helen has more agency within the narrative than any other character, and very literally takes back her agency. A way-less-evil Medea. Though not quite as vicious and memorable. Notable Lines (Emily Wilson translation): HELEN: Among barbarians, all are slaves but one. (285)CHORUS: What mortal can think it all through and explain what is god, what is not god, and what’s in between? (1140)→The Bacchae ★★★☆☆ Euripides← (406 BCE)A tragicomedy of sorts, about disrespect for the gods and the fluid nature of gender. Very harsh and at times, almost cold: it feels torturous, voyeuristic of pain. Definitely interesting to analyze on the topic of Euripides in general.

The ensuing cataclysm, framed by documentaOne morning, women all over the world begin developing a power: electricity, running through their fingers. The ensuing cataclysm, framed by documentation from the future, comes from four characters. There’s Roxy, 15-year-old white British daughter of a gangster; Tunde, a Nigerian journalist and the only man who narrates; Margot, an American mayor who develops the power despite her age; and Allie, a mixed-race abuse survivor who is stronger than normal in her power. As nations are conquered by women, things fall further and further apart. This book primarily works as a subtle reverse of gendered power dynamics. Tunde’s first scene, and some further, are really strong. Tunde’s role in the book, specifically, feels like a specific reversal of the roles we're used to seeing women and men play in literature. His experience in the introduction to the book is an excellent metaphor for subtler forms of sexual violence and turns your expectations for the situation on their head very quickly. This at first was really interesting to me. Over time, I realized it was all this book had to offer. Around 85%, I was seriously considering giving this book one star. The characters here generally left me colder. Tunde was the only narrator in this book I actually consistently liked, though Roxy grew on me a lot by the end. What bugged me about the characterization in general, though, was how much the characterization seemed to serve as a vehicle for the plot. Margot’s motivations and personality fall off the track on about her second chapter and never return. Roxy is a solid narrator, but I never felt like I understood her. Tunde’s only stated motivation remains his newfound ambition to know, and we don’t get any sense of where that comes from, making it difficult to invest in. Allie’s motivations, criminally, remain fairly murky, indeed coming about primarily as a voice in her head. (view spoiler)[We don’t see her challenge this voice, at all, even in the barest sense, until her last chapter; the audience, meanwhile, knows the voice is badly intentioned very quickly. A lot of buildup would’ve been needed to justify her never questioning the voice, and the book does not give that. (hide spoiler)]As the characters are clearly not meant to be the focus here, the main interest should come in the storylines. Unfortunately that was not working for me, either. Past the halfway point, I struggled to stay invested in the narrative. Some of this may also be the writing’s at-times overdramatic quality; however, I really don’t think that’s the main concern here. Something about the storytelling here feels far more focused on the brutality of the moment, the violence inflicted, then on the human element behind it. This specifically began to bother me in terms of sexual violence. There are at least four graphic rape or attempted rape scenes in this novel (excluding the many instances of sexual harassment or threatened assault). The first one made me wince, but reminded me of the flipping of the targets of sexual violence; I especially appreciated the fact that the perpetrator invoked ‘he was asking for it’ as justification. The second one made me wince a bit more. The third struck me as genuinely gratuitous. By the fourth, which is also simultaneously a murder scene, I was really really struggling to not put the book away. We’ve all read novels by men who immediately jump to graphic sexual violence when they have no idea what to use as plot. I would like to think, on a meta level, that the author is commenting on this tendency. However, my feelings on the actual plot device—profoundly negative—do not change when the victims are men. The author also seems to have not taken into account essentially any of the nuances of gender discrimination based on culture, or based on intersections with race, sexuality, or gender identity. The fact that the societies we see break down are almost entirely non-European, while America and Britain both stay intact, began needling at me a lot as the brutality increased. I would enjoy seeing the takes of Middle Eastern or African ers on this. It’s also interesting that the author seems to not have taken into account variations on gender identity beyond ‘cis man’ and ‘cis woman’ (one intersex character appears, but no mention of trans people) in a novel about gender as a construct. The thing that worked for me the most about this book was actually, weirdly enough, the framing device. The idea that this book is actually a male author’s book about a far-back time in history, framed by his deferential letters with a female colleague, spoke volumes. (view spoiler)[The line “This can’t have happened to women in the time before the cataclysm” is genuinely brilliant, and the line about “the canon of men’s fiction” really really really struck me. (hide spoiler)] It may not have been enough to make this book a favorite, but it certainly left me with less of a bitter taste in my mouth. I only wish the rest of the book had worked so well.

She was right about both. I read this book in the range from 1:00am to 4:00am, first of all. I don’t even remember the last time I needed to finish a book so bad. I needed to find out what happened!! How was it all going to go down? I had guesses, sure, but I didn’t know! I needed to see them escape. That is because there is so much excellent foreshadowing in this book.LONG SPOILER RANT ABOUT SAID FORESHADOWING: (view spoiler)[thinking about the fear foreshadowing and the fact that Maddie’s person was actually the mercy killer all along like HELLO??? hello??? very very proud of myself for figuring out the underlines at Lima, page 100, that was kinda hot. kinda wasnt expecting Anna Engel to be sympathetic even though I did have the genuine thought to myself that she was going to need to be for the underlining plan to work. the RADIO HOST like oh I think I registered that conversation as a lil weird but I totally did not register WHY and I loved that. dropping Verity in the conversation? i NOTICED that but i didn’t really get it… so much to think about. I fucking knew that Maddie wasn’t dead. I’m about to sound like a nerd so bear with me but it’s because of the placement of her death reveal—were she actually dead that would’ve been a huge reveal to drop at a key moment, in an interrogation, but we more see Julie’s grief, and it’s not A Moment™️ in the same way. I guessed that the codes were fake but the how SLAPS. I liked that I couldn’t at first tell who was who. For a while I was expecting Maddie to actually be the lead because I noticed the preoccupation with names and pseudonyms, but that ends up just being paid off with Julie’s identity as a torturer. and a liar in general. the fact that Julie is telling a fictionalized account the whole time… incredible. (hide spoiler)]Anyway. It is not just the setup and payoff that I loved about this book. I had so many feelings about this character. I love that Queenie’s narrative voice is so distinct; that she’s so lighthearted at times, and it takes longer to see her further sides. She's a really dynamic character. Maddie is also really interesting, and I loved getting invested in her. More importantly, the relationship between the two of them is really wonderful and hit me hard. Physically I’m here but emotionally I’m typing a long essay about how much they love each other.LONG ESSAY HERE: “finding your best friend is a bit like falling in love” really got dropped as an actual line in this book. sure! yeah absolutely! or maybe you just like girls (as Julie apparently does! canonically!) o for it to be the 1950s and i have a best friend who makes me feel like im falling in love. (view spoiler)[THINKING ABOUT KISS ME HARDY. thinking a LOT about kiss me hardy. also thinking about Julie just writing the name 'Maddie' because she can't even process anything else, and then Maddie doing the same later....... sigh. on a side note Maddie ending up with Jamie is genuinely Hilarious. she says that Jamie reminds her of Julie Multiple Times. this is not Brideshead Revisited. (hide spoiler)]The final note: I was so so upset by the ending of this book I kept expecting a miracle to have happened. I loved it. It made me cry. It will probably make you cry too. I don't know.

Follows Dublin Murder Squad Detective Frank as he tracks the disappearance of his first love, Rosie. Though Frank is a character who’s hard to love from the start, frustrating to follow and manipulative. Yet his definition is so clear, his motives so easy to sympathize with, that you can’t help but root for him, weep for him, tunnel inside his head. The writing of this series is so addictive, but this one more than any made me emotional—caring not just for whodunit and whydunit, but for the consequences it would hold. Though I guessed the solution, it was a fantastic read nonetheless. And I’ll be thinking about the very end for a long, long time. Overall, this was so good. I’m scratching at the walls.

The Likeness follows Cassie Maddox, an Irish detective. She's assigned to solve the murder of a woman using her old undercover identity… and goes undercover as the woman herself. It’s been such a long time since I read a detective novel that had me so thoroughly engaged from the beginning and so invested. This book was claustrophobic, and got inside my skin —it made me feel as though I were as trapped as Cassie. Tana French is an expert at placing clues and making even red herrings feel like a part of the story—even the red herrings always, always always play a part in the eventual reveal. Indeed, these novels never succeed off one big twist, it’s more the details. SPOILER: (view spoiler)[I was pretty sure I knew my suspect pool but little twists like the how and why...the Rafe and Justin thing... RAFE BEING THE ******... Abby being in love with Daniel... holy shit bro I’m screaming. also the ending is all very Murder on the Orient Express and that slaps. (hide spoiler)] What works so well about The Likeness is that it gets you to invest in characters you must also suspect—gets you invested in the idea that the perpetrator was not a certain character, or group of characters. You sympathize with those you suspect. You sense the true stakes of this death having occurred. SPOILER: (view spoiler)[What messed me up the most about this novel is how invested I, too, was in this little family. I longed to be a part of this sort of makeshift home. I wanted them to succeed so bad, and it is this that makes the reveal of the motive so strong; you almost understand, that shock and betrayal that they felt. When the reveal finally came as to who did the final murder, and then in the same line the baby, I was absolutely losing it on my audiobook. (hide spoiler)] This ending is unsatisfying too, in its own ways, but it works because 1. you get the clear answers you want, and are only left with new questions rather than old ones 2. (view spoiler)[there isn’t a clear villain in the same way as in In the Woods, so the lack of justice is an open question rather than just upsetting (hide spoiler)] and 3. it offers such a strong sense of growth in Cassie, whom I love so much. It is so deeply satisfying to see Cassie learn to put trust in other people as the novel progresses. It's been two years since I read this novel, and I can honestly say it's stuck with me like few I've read. I think this is one of my favorite suspense novels ever written.Dublin Murder Squad: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 [TK] | 6Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,116,1,"Mar 09, 2020","Mar 19, 2020","Mar 19, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5941114-the-likeness

When her life at home falls apart, she escapes to the magical world of Kerana, where she is still, regardless of appearances, wrong.Manu lives at first with her mother and family friend Perla. In Garber’s Argentinian mythology, seventh sons become werewolves, lobizones, while seventh daughters become witches, brujas. Here, women are brujas, while men are lobizones. Manu, however, just as she has found a place where her eyes do not define her, discovers that as a hybrid, her existence is a crime: that even here, in the first place where she is not an immigrant, she is still considered illegal.This book feels deeply vivid. From the harsh opening on, danger constantly feels real, present. Manu is at first hiding, and next a fish out of water, but at all times a fascinating narrator. When she escapes ICE to a new world, we root for her wellbeing, hoping for magical solutions. When it is revealed that even here, her entire existence is illegal to the powers that be, it is genuinely crushing. Seeing her come into her own, though, is deeply satisfying. It helps that her relationships with other characters all hold different weights in the narrative: Saysa, Catalina, and Tiago have a wonderful squad dynamic with Manu, but still all feel like distinct characters. Saysa was my favorite. Catalina, though, is probably the one I find most interesting: in any other book, she could be a popular girl trope, but here she’s nuanced, developed, and fun to root for. She also has a full character arc, something missing for side characters in a lot of YA fantasy. The unfolding mystery of the fate of Manu’s father, Fierro, is excellent. The dynamic between Manu, Perla, and her mother is also resonant. There's a particular scene where Manu almost goes home to Perla, and Perla tells her that she may make her own choices, just as her mother did. I appreciated that the narrative is both deeply sympathetic to Manu's mother and allows Manu to make her own choices. (And the scene made me tear up a bit.)I try to avoid reading other s before writing my own, but I really liked what Adri said about this book in their : … she comes to represent everyone who's ever wrongfully been limited or boxed into labels that don't fit simply because it's more convenient for everyone else. I feel the story is about how if we let ideas, traditions, and laws matter more than actual people, we are creating a world that confines us—we are drawing a border between what is and what could be. Language and societal norms don't exist in a vacuum. They are not stagnant; they're things we engage with, create, and shape for ourselves.It’s not a perfect novel; at times, the first half is fairly slow. Some metaphors didn't totally work. The romance felt a bit by-the-book at first: there's a romantic competition plot line that, though resolved in a creative way (I really liked it), definitely takes over the dynamic between Tiago and Manu. But this book went so hard, and I am so excited for more. This is an excellent blend of magical realism and contemporary fantasy focusing on binaries and the space between them. I’m excited for more. This comes out on August 4th. I hope you'll love it as much as I did.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,137,1,"Jul 22, 2020","Aug 02, 2020","Mar 18, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51179882-lobizona

There's Irina Drosdova, a Russian-American government worker turned spy. There's Sally Forrester, the Swallow and established spy. And in Russia, Olga Ivinskaya, the long-term lover of Boris Pasternak and inspiration for his hero, Lara. They are connected by Pasternak's book, Doctor Zhivago – and by the forbidden love at its center. In framing itself as a response to Doctor Zhivago, I think The Secrets We Kept has a lot to say about the parallels between Soviet-era censorship of love and the 1950s American Lavender Scare, where it is estimated between 5,000 to 10,000 Americans lost jobs in the federal service due to fears that their status as gay men or lesbians could make them susceptible to blackmail. Overall, a well-written and enjoyable historical thriller/love story.

In her world, the Half-Kith, or lower-class, have to pay tithes for any crimes—tithes of body, meant to go to the upper-class High Kith. When she’s arrested for catching & returning a red bird, Nirrim meets Sid, a jailed thief, and gets dragged into a conflict that will involve the whole world. The Midnight Lie takes place in Herrath, a land separate from the Winner’s trilogy worlds of Valoria and Herrani—a world that exists on no maps. There’s magic here, where there is none anywhere else. This world is intoxicating, terrifying, and beautiful. The plot, while slow, winds you tightly around its finger. But those aspects are not what makes this book so good: it survives off character. Nirrim begins the book essentially stagnated: she knows what is expected of her, to fall for the right boy and kiss him the right way, and so she does it. She is, in these chapters, almost half-asleep. The most alive we see her is in a vivid nightmare about waking up next to the dead body of Helin, her best friend. The dynamic between Nirrim and Raven, her adopted mother, is one of the most interesting in the book. Raven is emotionally and physically abusive. You, the audience, know, or suspect, from early on. But the way this arc evolves is genuinely excellent. It feels as if you see through Nirrim's perspective, are as torn by Raven's manipulation as she is. Those of you who have interacted in lesbian/bi/sapphic circles will probably recognize the term compulsory heterosexuality. This is admittedly a pretty broad social phenomenon, but recent discussion has focused a lot on how it can cause lesbians to force themselves into relationships with men, sans attraction: women aren’t taught to consider their own desires above those of men. For Nirrim, this interplays perfectly into her identity as an abuse survivor. When has she ever been asked for her feelings? So with little conscious effort, she has forced herself into a relationship with a man she hardly cares for, not knowing relationships should make her feel something. It is this that makes seeing her shift into a relationship with a woman so incredibly satisfying. Nirrim and Sid have… so much chemistry. The relationship that builds between them is slow, but easy to invest in. Basically, OH to meet a super butch tourist locked in jail and have her attempt to seduce me. Though The Midnight Lie was at times as slow as I remember Winner’s Curse being, this story had me so invested. I’m really excited for the sequel.

When a group of astronauts find their transmissions from earth delayed by troubles at home, they must make the ultimate decisions about how to proceed—whether to return, or choose a different path. I don’t quite know how to encapsulate the sheer amount of love, and respect, for humanity that I always feel after reading a Becky Chambers novel. While her people are never perfect, they are caring and loving towards the world. Even when her characters hurt each other, you can’t help but love them regardless. To Be Taught If Fortunate engages with the space opera genre by loving the landscapes it takes you to. Even in the brutality of some of the worlds, there is always beauty and hope and even rugged strength to be found. I adore Chanber’s writing, and I can’t wait to read more.

The world might indeed be a cursed circle; the snake swallowed its tail and there could be no end, only an eternal ruination and endless devouring.Noemí Taboada is a party girl in Mexico City, enjoying jumping between potential careers. But when her cousin Catalina sends an eerie message from her new home at High Place, Noemí journeys her way to her cousin. There, she meets the Doyle family: Virgil, her cousin’s new husband; Florence, the stern mother; Howard, the eerie grandfather; and Francis, a cousin and the kindest of the lot. But things at High Place are not right, and as Noemí gets closer, she finds that the house has secrets that will fight to stay in the dark. I always enjoy a good gothic horror novel — the claustrophobic house, eerie graveyards, uncanny decorations, and odd behavior of those within the house reflect, and often reference, famous texts in the genre. But as always, the horror is not so simple as a creepy old house. The horror of Mexican Gothic is the profound horror of the hidden bodies produced by colonialism. It is the horror of what we do not want to talk about within our families. It is the horror of being taken from the family you have and brainwashed into believing this family is all you want, of losing who you are under the weight of what your family is. And it is the horror of cyclicism, of the generational cycle repeating. She wanted to be liked. Perhaps this explained the parties, the crystalline laughter, the well-coiffed hair, the rehearsed smile. She thought that men such as her father could be stern and men could be cold like Virgil, but women needed to be liked or they’d be in trouble. A woman who is not liked is a bitch, and a bitch can hardly do anything: all avenues are closed to her.If you’re interested by an atmospheric gothic horror with a compelling lead and plenty of creepy twists, you should enjoy this one.

Over time, the audience is asked to question what’s real and what’s not in a con, and maybe, over time, who is conning who. This show… is a lot to think about. Actually, it took me a reread to really get certain aspects. The broad story is easy to understand; it’s the details that make the show so interesting.

I really like the differing reactions of Ouisa and her husband. The contrast between disdain and that continued degree of caring is interesting, but I also genuinely enjoy the question of why Ouisa still cares: because she misses the idea of this person, or because she really saw something underneath the lie? I read this for the same class as M Butterfly and that was a very good choice on the part of our professor. I still have not managed to see the entirety of the movie adaptation of this, but the scenes I’ve viewed feature some very good acting, especially on the part of the lead. Will Smith is not casting I would have pictured for this role literally ever, but then again, I think that’s because I left this play having almost no picture of him. I didn’t notice how much he fit no boxes in my head until I saw the movie, and it’s this I love so much about the character: You cannot have a coherent picture of him, because he fills so many roles.

Carmen Maria Machado’s memoir about a quee“I thought you died, but right now, I’m not sure you did.”This is my favorite book of all time. Carmen Maria Machado’s memoir about a queer abusive relationship blends reality with media and its mirrors. It flurries between grandeur and media and the simple, the human, varies between detailed tales and hypothetical quandaries to tell the story of a relationship. Everything is a metaphor and not. Homes are a metaphor, the freudian idea of a basement threatening everything. The dream house is not necessary for domestic abuse, but hell, it helps. A house is never apolitical. As this wonderful New Yorker article tells it, “In the Dream House is primarily about the quandary of constructing In the Dream House.” It’s a story about the telling of stories that are not told, a going-through of every possible medium with which you can articulate abuse. There’s a specific chapter from this novel I think about a lot, Dream House as I Love Lucy, in which Machado allegorizes her relationship to I Love Lucy, a comedy wherein the protagonist can never learn. In simple detail, she explains the plot as a narrator never able to escape her narrative but always the butt of the joke. And then she ends the chapter:Isn’t this funny? This is funny. It’s so funny. It could be funny. One day it will be funny. Won’t it?And isn’t this truly what you become—the butt of the joke, everyone laughing, the details so obviously absurd, the ex so demonic in characterization, but the joke’s not funny, and it can’t be, and you can’t laugh. I’ve explained this chapter end to a shocking number of friends and it never fails to incite a little bit of shell shock. I promise, it is even more when you read it. I had several favorite chapters of this book, listed here with key quotes: →Dream House as Lesbian Pulp NovelThe cover tells you what you need to know: depraved inversion, seduction, lascivious butches and big-breasted seductresses, love that dare not speak its name. There are censors to get past, so tragedy is a foregone conclusion. It was written to the dna of the dream house, maybe back when it was just a house, maybe even back when it was just Bloomington, Indiana, or before humans even existed there at all.→Dream House as Lesson LearnedIt was a power struggle, which is weird because you had no power at all. →Dream House as I Love LucyIsn’t this funny? This is funny. It’s so funny. It could be funny. One day it will be funny. Won’t it?→Dream House as Sniffs from the Ink of WomenYears later, if I could say anything to her, I would say for fuck’s sake, stop making us look bad.→Dream House as Comedy of ErrorsAlso, you’re afraid you’re going to miss your flight, because your girlfriend spent her time this morning putting on her face, an expression you’ve always found sort of funny and vaguely sexist but that now just strikes you as horrifyingly ominous, because it suggests that she has one face and has to put on another. And you saw underneath it last night. And you wish she was a man, because then at least it could reinforce ideas people had about men. →Dream House as Demonic PossessionBut isn’t the best part of a possession story that the inflicted can do and say horrific things, for which they will receive a carte blanche forgiveness the next day? →Dream House as AmbiguityThe abused needed to be a feminine figure: meek, straight, white, and the abuser a masculine one. The queer woman’s gender identity is tenuous and can be stripped away from her at any moment should it suit some straight party or another.→Dream House as Five LightsThe final word, lights, is practically oatmeal in his mouth. (This chapter was one of my favorites in the book.) →Dream House as Choose Your Own AdventureYou watch the darkness until the darkness leaves you, or you leave it. You dream about the future. It’s going to be alright. One day your wife will gently adjust your arm if it touches her face at night, soothingly straightening it while kissing you. →Dream House as Hotel Room In Iowa CityYou only speak the language of giving yourself up. →Dream House as The Queen and The SquidNot that I want to eat you; I just want you nestled in my stomach for all eternity. →Dream House as A Death WishYou’ll wish she hit you. You have this fantasy, this fucked up fantasy, of opening up a photo on your phone where you look glazed, and disinterested, and half your face is covered in a pulsing star. You want something black and white more than you want anything in this world. →Dream House as Public RelationsPen poised over paper, wondering if they would let the world know if they were unmade by someone with just as little power as they. →Dream House as ClicheThe stoning. This image has stayed with me for so long. What both has been and is a punishment for homosexuality, inflicted by the woman she loved. Stone. Stone butch, stonewall, queer history studded with stones like jewelry. I adored this book, a lot. Quite a lot. I'm really hoping for more from this author, and know I will think about this book for a long, long time.

Following Ada, who has multiple gods contained within her, this brilliantly-written little novel goes into the point of view of first her younger gods, and then one specific god within her, Asugara. So. I loved this book, from its engaging writing to its incredible character building. But I think to explain why it resonates so strongly, you need to unpack the themes.Asugara’s purpose is as a living embodiment of Ada’s trauma: she is the strength, or so she thinks, to Ada’s complicated outside. “We’re the barrier between you and madness”, Asugara tells Ada, and on some level this is real: when she pops forth, she finds an Ada broken, an Ada who she must save. Ada crafts Asugara to protect her from trauma. Asugara, in turn, turns to hypersexuality and destructive behavior as a means of escaping trauma. For Ada, it is much easier for her to hide behind a persona, who guards her from trauma, than to relearn intimacy. Asugara serves as another manifestation of her hate for herself. Ada, too, clearly understands the role Asugara has played in helping her trauma: “You had to exist. I wasn’t ready”. After all, was I not the hunger in Ada? I was made out of desire.Yet Ada’s dependence on Asugara also has elements of codependency. “I don’t think anyone else will want me without you… I’m the damaged and broken one; you’re the bright and shiny one. Who are they going to love more?” And as multiple selves, she cannot fully give of herself. When Ewan finally lets go of his love for control, ready to craft an actually committed relationship with Ada, Asugara responds “you’re not yours to give.” This time, it is not a joy to say the cutting thing: the knowledge that “all those parts she wanted to give, the parts that would complete the love they had—all those parts were gone”. It takes Asugara years to know the truth, that “keeping her walled off from Ewan killed any chance they had at making it out together”. Keeping one side of Ada, it is clear, is not the solution. Yet Ada’s darker self is not herself without feeling, without need to be loved. Yshwa’s big moment to Asugara is a proclamation that “I’m not ashamed of you… you know I love you”. Asugara flinches in response. She is Ada’s invulnerable side: she is not ready to be loved. But her vulnerability exists, too. When Ada begins to break free from her influence and suggests therapy, telling Asugara that she cannot continue to punish others, Asugara’s response is a tearful scream: “Were we not innocent enough to be spared?”. Indeed, as the novel continues, it becomes clear that she has been hurting others because she, herself, has been hurt. I didn’t have anyone to hold me and now I don’t have anyone to kill me. You’d think he’d come through on at least one of these points.As Emezi mentions in her interview, the concept of Ogbanje was oppressed under colonialism; black people, under colonialism, were forced to change identity, to commute self. Women and nonbinary people, likewise, have had their bodies commodified. To heal, we must come to terms with the multiplicity of identity we have developed through trauma, and move into the future as our whole selves: good, bad, and everything in between. In an interview with The Rumpus, Emezi described their gender transition not as transitioning gender identity but “perhaps transitioning to an ogbanje, and what that looks like when you mix realities.” In the end, Ada’s freedom does not come of letting go of her divine parts: her freedom comes in recognizing them, and working with them. Ada’s way to saving is to piece herself back together, her godhood and all. In the final pages of the novel, she tells us: “I am my others; we are one and we are many”. She is infinity, a python. TW: sexual assault, domestic abuse, disordered eating, attempted suicide.

Do you want to go down to the pits of yourself all alone? Not much. What if an actor could do it for you? Isn’t that why they are called actors? They act for you. You sacrifice them to action. And this sacrifice is a mode of deepest intimacy of you with your own life.The Greek concept of catharsis is a fascinating one and one easy to misunderstand. ORIGINAL COMMENTARY: I often struggle with tragedy, in its inevitable sad ending: to me, sadness with happiness at the end are often more cathartic. But the idea that seeing sadness at the end is the true point: that, to me, is fascinating. UPDATED COMMENTARY: I have actually been in a Greek Tragedy class now and read fifteen greek plays (a long  can be found here), so I feel more qualified to talk about this now. As given by Aristotle, the definition of a tragedy is not actually in its sad ending: it is in experiencing human suffering. (Most of the extant plays, not by coincidence but by generations of selection, end negatively.) Catharsis, by his definition, is a type of cleaning: ""we experience, then expurgate these emotions"". Tragedy can attempt to make the worst experiences consumable. It is not the ending, but the process. On Colloquial TranslationAnne Carson’s style of translation often focuses on colloquialism: making a text often translated in direct wording into something palatable for readers. This translation of this text feels… raw. Carson does not waste words: the sense of a line is conveyed, not perhaps the exact wording. (This  gives a good example of how, as does this post on the Oresteia.) Having spent the last eight years in Latin class (I know), I have learned that to make a text as readable to modern eyes as it would have been to ancient ones is a very different skill than direct translation. To convey word for word and to convey the spirit are two different aims; to do both is difficult, nigh-impossible for some texts. Debates over the merit of certain translated works are rife in scholarly circles. For those of you more interested in the politics of translation, here are some cool things I found while going down a rabbit hole on this topic last month:→Cecily Fasham, on the politics of translating sappho→a tumblr post on the politics of translation→Emily Wilson, interview notes on The OdysseyThe Play Reviews→Heracles ★★★★☆ Euripides← (421-416 BCE)This was my personal least favorite of the plays I read for this collection, possibly because of how thoughtless it is: no decision is made by any character that caused this ill, simply a trickery of the gods. It feels deeply wrong and deeply unsatisfying. I believe is the point. Sometimes, the world is too evil to show mercy. Notable Lines (Anne Carson translation):HERAKLES: Come back! Even as a shadow, even as a dream.→Hekabe ★★★★★ Euripides← (424 BCE)There is a sense of inevitable death that pervades this play: taking place during a mythical war, it serves on some level as a reflection of the destruction of society that Euripides himself would have feared during the Peloponnesian Wars. The ending of this play is deeply strange and off-putting: after a play full of tragedy in her life, Hekabe is told she will be turned into a dog. This fate is horrifying, but what I found most horrifying about it was its ambiguity: she has received a prophecy about her fate, but we shall never really see the truth of it. In her new life as a Greek slave, she will perhaps become a dog anyway. Notable Lines (Anne Carson translation):AGAMEMNON: O poor woman. There is no measure to your evils.HEKABE: I do not exist. There is nothing else. Not even evils.CHORUS: Don’t sweep the whole female species together for condemnation because of your own catastrophe. We are many—some blameless,some not.→Hippolytus ★★★★★ Euripides← (428 BCE)In her introduction to this text, Carson says two things that stuck out to me:→[Hippolytos] seems to want to place Artemis, and himself, in a special third gender—the translucent gender—unpolluted by flesh or change.→If you asked to Hippolytos to name his system he would say “shame”. Oddly, if you asked Phaedra to name her system she would also say “shame”. They do not mean the same thing by this word. Or perhaps they do. Too bad they never talk. The politics of shame lie at the heart of this text. What is it to love, what is it to be ashamed of that love? It's really interesting that the male character, Hippolytos, is the one taking on this role of being in love with chastity. It's also interesting that he, like Phaedra and like Theseus, is taking on the role of his Amazon mother. Phaedra, daughter to Pasiphae, is in love with the impossible and impossibly ashamed; Theseus, son of Aegeus, takes on his stubbornness. (The family tree helps.) A fun tidbit from my Greek Tragedy teacher, who is in love with Greek double meanings: Hippolytus derives from 'horses' and the verb λυω or 'luo', which can mean either 'to release' or 'to destroy'; it is also ambiguous whether 'hippos' is the subject or the object. Hippolyta's name would have been 'he who sets horses free'; Hippolytos' name, though, means something more like 'he who the horses destroy'. As they do.This was my favorite of these four plays. Notable Lines (Anne Carson translation):NURSE: Not much profit in desire then,If everyone touched by it has to die.→Alcestis ★★★★☆ Euripides← (438 BCE)This is a strange and comedic tragedy. Admetos loves his wife and yet is okay to watch her die for him: either way, however, he gets her back. It's a splitting of fate unexpected in this genre (Oedipus wishes).Notable Lines (Anne Carson translation):CHORUS: We all owe a debt to death, you know.ADMETOS: if I found another savior, if I look upon this daylight, it’s her I owe.

In contrast to Grief Lessons and Carson’s Oresteia translation, this one is far less literal, pulling in contemporary language and references to contemporary authors who have commented on Antigone. As a result, this feels far less like a translation and far more like a commentary. There are some cool elements here. One of the oddest and most interesting elements of this was the use of the 'Nick' character, who measures things out: this functions as a commentary on the measured amounts of time we have for mortality. The portrayal of Kreon specifically comments on the ways in which men speak privilege. I enjoyed my reading experience, but honestly found parts of the translation took away from the language I liked in previous translations I have read of Antigone.

This little play was based off a true incident in which a French diplomat fell in love with a Chinese woman… only to discover that his love was a man spying on him all along, something the diplomat insisted he did not know. The public, of course, reacted in disbelief. But when David Henry Hwang heard this story in the 1980s, his reaction was not of disbelief, but of belief; if the spy were playing the submissive Asian woman, how could she not fool him? Song performs the version of submissive Asian womanhood Gallimard finds most appealing. Song tells us that “The West thinks of itself as masculine… so the East is feminine… her mouth says no, but her eyes say yes. The West believes the East, deep down, wants to be dominated”. This is the lens by which she caters performance: at times outspoken, but always loving the white Western man. But the burden of this performance does not fall primarily on Song. Gallimard has grown up in a society where he has been taught to view Butterfly through a prism; thus, he does not think to question whether or not she genuinely fits the image she projects. Gallimard, in every moment, sees himself as Pinkerton and Song as Butterfly. This is the lens with which he loves her. This is also, incidentally, the reason I heavily disliked the movie adaptation of this play. To make Song a person in love with Gallimard fails the text. Song could be in love with Gallimard, but that is not the point, and not the tragedy. To make Gallimard so easily believe the reveal that Song is not who she says she is fails the text, as well. Gallimard has never loved Song: only ever the idea of Song. Most of the changes in narrative come from removing the fourth wall breaks and making the entire play diegetic—taking place in real life rather than fantasy. These are each misguided and bad choices. I have a lot more to say about this—my final paper in a class this semester was about this play—but I am going to end this  with a compilation of quotes from this show that made me go absolutely buckwild:Rene: While we men may all want to kick Pinkerton, very few of us would pass up the opportunity to be Pinkerton. Rene: Yes actually, I’ve forgotten everything. My mind, you see—there wasn’t enough room in this hard head—not for the world and for you. Song: Rene, I’ve never done what you’ve said. Why should it be any different in your mind?Song: Your mouth says no, but your eyes say yes. Rene: You showed me your true self. When all I loved was the lie. Rene: I’m a man who loved a woman created by a man. Everything else—simply falls short. EDIT: I’m watching Watchmen right now and every time I see Jeremy Iron’s face I am reminded of how much i dislike the movie version of this. this is not a tragic love story. it’s a commentary on imperialism and gendered racism. don’t watch the movie. it’s fine, but you will not understand why this play is so good.

There is one story in this that is a garbage fire and a half. ""George Orwell was a Friend of Mine"" is by far my favorite from this book: it’s a story about the moral problems of bystanding, and the ways in which collective memory can fail us. I know some found ""Fortune Smiles"" less powerful, but I appreciated its direct commentary on the problems of assimilation. Both of these stories successfully convey the mundanity of living in an oppressive society and the cultural shock, afterwards, of realizing its global perception. I appreciated that ""George Orwell"" fit multiple perspectives; ""Fortune Smiles"" does not question its narrative’s disdain for “the tv defectors,” those who have experienced trauma, and I enjoyed that the former story explored this contrast. I unfortunately found the stories of both ""Nirvana"" and ""Hurricanes Anonymous"" to be on the lower end of enticing. I read this book out of order, with these two coming second and third after }Fortune Smiles"", and found them each to be oddly lacking in contrast to what came before. Nirvana explores romanticization of the past and technology’s impact on our grief; Hurricanes Anonymous focuses on a single father after Katrina and the repetition of old mistakes. Johnson clearly does not enjoy emotionality in his narrators, which works for stories like ""George Orwell""; I felt this held the stories back here. Perhaps as a result, I came away feeling both of these stories were saying very little. Each was more interesting, maybe even entertaining, than impactful. ""Hurricanes Anonymous"", specifically, follows a specific trend of this collection: the tendency to focus on the lives of those doing wrong, with very little redemption or questioning towards this. Perhaps this is why I found the story that best subverted this trend and asked questions of personal responsibility — ""George Orwell Was a Friend of Mine"" — to be my favorite. Reviewer Emilypoints out, I think correctly, that the two stories in unfamiliar settings are ironically the more human of the collection. In contrast, stories in more familiar settings begin using wild gimmicks to distinguish themselves. Strip the several fascinating premises of ""Nirvana"" away, and you have very little. Some of these stories, to me, feel cynical to a point where they cease to say anything. A generational gap, perhaps. I have a very complicated array of thoughts towards ""Dark Meadow"", a story that deals with a reformed-maybe pedophile, who does not act on his feelings. I was really expecting to hate it. I instead have complex feelings on it. It certainly asks complex questions. I think in general, almost all of these stories step outside the realm of personal experience. I don’t think this is inherently a bad thing but it’s worth commenting upon. Were these stories the only stories of the collection, I would probably have felt that though this collection was a mixed bag for me personally, it was a good expression of talent. However, the story ""Interesting Facts"" genuinely disgusts me.Imagine that you are diagnosed with breast cancer and have a double mastectomy. Your husband reacts to this by writing a story in which you — and it’s very clearly you, his wife, not a hypothetical wife; the story’s husband even has a Pulitzer for writing about North Korea — envy other women with larger breasts, before dying and coming back as a ghost to continue watching the women he may or may not be dating. He adds in a subtext about himself having a fetish for Asian women — which is honestly quite disturbing, considering he writes about North Korea — and for big breasts, which is downright insulting as, again, you have just had a double mastectomy. You’ve just undergone the trauma of breast cancer, and this is how your husband was thinking about you: as an already-ghost, stripped of agency, desperate to get your breasts back. Now, imagine that instead of looking at this story as a misogynistic and hateful expression of trauma and putting it aside, he publishes this story without removing any identification, leaving in many humiliating details of the ordeal of breast cancer. I think this as a situation is genuinely disturbing. It made me very strongly wish this man had not received any of my money. I was shocked that when he came to my school to discuss his stories, he commented to a friend that his wife had been upset by this story. Of course she was. Why wouldn't she be? I think Adam Johnson is wonderfully good at writing. I don’t think that, as a society, we should appreciate that he does so.

I was assigned several of these for a class and thus have not finished reading this collection. Here are some s of the stories in this collection that I have, in fact, read. The Sale by Tendai Huchu → ★★★☆☆A story of a world overtaken by bureaucracy. Genuinely liked and appreciated the commentary of this story. Really think that when writing a story about a population being brutally repressed, you should think twice about it being via estrogen that gives your character breasts. The Gift of Touch by Chinelo Onwualu → ★★★★★A brief space opera with good characters and great dialogue. This one feels like some very conscious commentary on Firefly, the television show, and I had a lot of fun writing a very brief essay about it. Heresy by Mandisi Nkomo → ★★★★☆This one is some very good satire on South African politics and also communism-turned-fascism. Very cold, very dark, very interesting. I'd like to read more about this. To Gaze at the Sun by Clifton Gachagua → ★★★☆☆Absolutely fascinated by this story's seeming implication that Africa’s Great Rift Valley cuts along the middle of the continent through both Egypt and Sudan (it does not). Somewhat sad at this worldbuilding because overall I really liked the ideas explored here of parenthood and identity. Proposition 23 by Efe Okogu → ★★★★☆A corporation cannot be killed thus no matter how heinous the crimes it commits. The worst it can face is a fine.The longest story, a three-point-of-view scifi-dystopia. The premise is essentially the Matrix, but without giant bugs manipulating us -- just AI. As a result, this one feels more prescient. Very smart and I liked this one.

To really explain you why you should read this, spoilers will need to be used. It takes the book until almost halfway through for the actual point of attack to appear. The problem is that it is impossible to talk in detail about this novel’s second half without talking about its themes, which are… a lot. So before recommending this book, I want to warn as a spoiler: (view spoiler)[This is a book about incestuous child rape. Tan-Tan is repeatedly raped by her father, Antonio, and becomes pregnant as a result. The second half of the book goes into her rebuilding her identity after killing him. (hide spoiler)]Tan-Tan, as a protagonist, is fantastically resilient, well-written, and compelling. But as the book starts, she is deeply torn apart by what has happened to her. To deal with what she has experienced, Tan-Tan crafts two separate identities: the good Tan-Tan and the bad Tan-Tan, one that is good and one to escape to in traumatic situations. The Tan-Tan we meet at age sixteen is not happy. She has been taught from age nine that she is bad, evil, (view spoiler)[by both Janisette, her stepmother, and Antonio, her father. (hide spoiler)] This compartmentalization and splitting of identity is what allows Tan-Tan to survive. She even crafts yet another identity, Robber Queen. The Robber Queen’s words speak against mistreatment. When stories begin to spread about the Robber Queen, Tan-Tan barely can believe them. She has been so broken down; how can she be anything like the Robber Queen of myth and legend?Tan-Tan learns, over time, to allow her Good Tan-Tan self, her Robber Queen self, to become not a persona but a part of her. This comes first and foremost from acceptance. In her many months alone, as she becomes close friends with Abitefa, the Douen woman she meets. She saves a Rolling Calf pup, one whose mother she has accidentally hurt: this helps her to remember that she is able to love and to care, that she is not evil. And she reunites with Melonhead, her childhood best friend. To Melonhead, she initially feels the need to perform something uncorrupted, and is ashamed of having been raped—“shit” (302), she says when it slips out—yet when he figures out, in what she has purposefully not said, he simply reaches for her hand. It is through these connections of love and kindness that she has learned that what has happened is not her fault, not something she must punish herself for. Bad Tan-Tan is not bad; she has done nothing. (view spoiler)[“Is love that get the Robber Queen born,” the crowd says (320). Perhaps they are right. It is this love that gives her the courage, finally, to unite herself. (hide spoiler)]There is a lot more to say about this book because I really liked this book. The ending made me cry, in a very good way. I really like the setting of the novel and the Douen culture: this feels like a single story in a very wide world, which is a type of sff I really love. I also liked how Midnight Robber uses a science fiction and fantastical (this feels like a blend of both) setting to explore themes that echo real life. The sci-fi tech of the world is removed, but not an evil force: instead, a benevolent one. In the same 2002 interview, Hopkinson said this:“As a young reader, mimetic fiction (fiction that mimics reality) left me feeling unsatisfied. The general message that I got from it was ""life sucks, sometimes it's not too bad, but mostly people are mean to each other, then they die."" But, rightly or wrongly, I felt as though I'd already figured that out. I felt that I didn't need to read fiction in order to experience it. But folktales and fables and the old epic tales (Homer's Iliad, for instance) felt as though they lived in a different dimension.”Midnight Robber is written in Caribbean vernacular, which some ers seem to have taken issue with. Within a few pages, this language becomes easy to read—the prose, though complex, is incredibly well written. Hopkinson writes primarily in Trinidadian; for Midnight Robber, she purposefully blended this with Jamaican and Guyanese. Worldbuilding terms, meanwhile, have origins in various cultures: the word ‘Douen’ comes from a term for Caribbean children who die before their naming ceremonies. It's easy to discount the level of thought that goes into this writing style. Don't. Metaphorically, in Midnight Robber, this blend of dialects functions as the language of a people. In a 2002 interview, Hopkinson noted that she believes Midnight Robber could work in Yiddish, because: “Yiddish, near as I can tell, carries the historical sense of being the language of a people whose diasporic spread has at times been forced upon them, and it also, I think, has the sense of being a language ‘of the people.’” It is this that matters about Hopkinson’s language. I think it is very easy to read literature by Caribbean authors, written in dialogues some may consider 'other' or 'exotic', and view it through that prism and lens. But though the language of this book is certainly noteworthy, and an extremely important part of its message, to afford mention only to such qualities is beyond the pale. It is an excellent story and an incredible discussion of trauma, and Tan-Tan's character development is very good. And the ending made me cry. TW: (view spoiler)[rape, pedophilia, incestuous rape.

So I bought something to make our skins feel more, and it’s still not enough.I also want to mention before starting these s, that I essentially enjoyed every story here: a lot of my four-stars probably could’ve been five stars in any other collection; I just felt weird rating almost every story a five, so I was pickier than I usually would’ve been.

Those are the emotions that he knows so little about and that he needs to get in touch with.”He reframes abuse as something not done because of bad feelings, but because of a lack of empathy for the feelings of others. He reframes the problem of abuse as not one of anger, but of the actual conscious choice to abuse partners. “The sad reality is that plenty of gentle, sensitive men are viciously abusive to their female partners.”Abusive partners, in the experience of this author as an abuse counselor, do not usually “lose control”; they make justifications for their actions. He explains it thus: “Their value system is unhealthy, not their psychology.” Any connection between emotional abuse and mental illness has gone unproven.He reframes often-repeated ideas about low self-esteem and childhood abuse as the causes for further abuse, and points out that for every abuser who was abused as a child, there is another victim of abuse who does not themselves abuse. Okay so, to be real, I dislike some of the assertions about men and women in this book — the author’s experience in abuse counseling has been that many men who are abusers themselves accuse their ex-girlfriends of being crazy, and this is really important to point out, but also, the straight-faced assertion that straight women (straight women, because this author does believe lesbians can abuse. I don’t think he’s aware of bi people yet no one tell him about them) are literally never abusive to their partners is... it’s interesting, and it also is going to require a lot more citation. I do like the lens that abuse is caused, in the vast majority of cases, by patriarchy — but like, never? never? literally never has a wife abused a husband? This breaks down immediately when the author asserts that gay women can abuse (I don’t even think this is homophobic, it’s framed as a pro-lesbian-victims statement and that was good). So like, women can abuse, but only some of them? Citation needed. While I was annoyed by both this, and the lack of citations on statistics (in nonfiction you need to cite any statistics that you trot out as fact.) I do think this is a wonderful guide for abused women to recognize their situations. That is its ultimate value. On a more personal level, the descriptions of the family dynamic in custody battles is........ so disturbingly and disruptively close to home. There’s one description of psychological testing that genuinely made me rethink a good deal of my life.

This book begins when Jack mysteriously appears back at the home and asks for the help of the wayward children to help her take back her land. Jack has been my favorite character of this series basically since the beginning, and the development she got here was so wonderful. At this point, we've seen all of her backstory out of order; it's nice to see where she progresses from the point she was at at the end of the first book, when I first got invested in her. Every book, I feel like I learn more about her and become more invested in her, and I love seeing the continuation. Also, (view spoiler)[Alexis being unkilled (hide spoiler)] is really fun. Usually, these novellas thrive of off themes, and this is no exception: here, we focus on bodily autonomy, redemption, identity, and when death is the right choice. I enjoyed seeing the culmination to the conflict between the siblings: Down Among the Sticks and Bones never felt like the end of this story, and seeing more is intensely interesting. These worlds are so eerie, and yet so enticing. Though your rational brain tells you you don’t want to interact, you’re engrossed at the same time, caught up in the politics and the expanse of this world. Between the vampire castle, and the sea kingdom, and the mad scientist dwelling, you see the danger… but you see the desire, too. You see where each character fits in their world, and long for that sense of belonging, too. As I've read through more of these books, I find that I keep getting more invested in the arc of this home and the characters. There are so many side characters in this novella series now that have appeared in several of the novels, as pov characters or not, and it's just fun seeing how they all grow and change. They're all so distinct, and I'm rooting for all of them in different ways. If you read the first book of this and thought it was good but not great, I would highly recommend continuing on, because that's how I felt as well. This series as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Basically: friendship ended with Down Among the Sticks and Bones this is my favorite Wayward Children book nowBlog | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Apr 20, 2020","Apr 20, 2020","Sep 02, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44804083-come-tumbling-down

Dao understands tenderness and was ready to give it to us. This was excellent.She looked up and saw the love in Bao’s eyes—the love that had never left him, not even in his anger—and she couldn’t help feeling that it might all be worth it. It wasn’t just the right thing to do; she knew now that even without a spell, it was what she wanted to do.As Song of the Crimson Flower begins, upper-class Lan is in love with Tam, a wealthy nobleman, who, though he keeps delaying the wedding, also sends her letters and (she thinks) plays his flute every evening for her. When she first finds out that it was never real, that she was never loved by Tam, she is angry and upset and takes it out on Bao, the boy who truly loves her. When she goes to apologize, she finds that Bao has been cursed, and they must journey much further to attempt to break his curse. Julie C. Dao avoids the trap of simply berating Lan for this (of course nasty) action. Instead, she is given room to understand the true nature of the world: the fact that there are men (and people in general) far nobler and kinder than her ex-fiancé. And along the way, she discovers that she may truly want different things than she has allowed herself to hope for. Lan’s character arc is subtle but very wonderful, revolving around her journey learning to separate herself from selfish men, and the grounding force of this whole book. I really really appreciate that this romance does not depend on Lan having to figure out that she was wrong to ever not want Bao; instead, it depends on her falling for him, independent of guilt. Bao is a well-written character in his own right, one I found instantly easy to sympathize with. He is in a bad situation but still manages to be kind and caring and considerate towards others, and it is this that endears him both to Lan and other characters. A wide cast of side characters were easy to root for, as well; one is a character who I did not particularly like in Forest of a Thousand Lanterns, but found easy to empathize with here. While the major conflict involving side characters is perhaps not particularly narratively relevant, I enjoyed both of the characters enough to get invested anyway. I absolutely loved how concisely and cleanly the beginning set the tone and mood of the book — I was instantly hooked. Bao’s character introduction in particular immediately made me love him, establishing him as kind and generous and already finding ways to solve his desperate need for a family. Bao and Lan’s scenes together are equally perfectly paced and well-timed, gaining your sympathy for them both and growing your appreciation for Bao’s kindness. The opening also establishes the world through conversations that feel like genuine explanations; we learn about this world’s problems as Lan does, in a way that is satisfying to the audience.I say this all because Forest of a Thousand Lanterns had me struggling slightly with pacing of plot and character development. With this book, however, Dao was right-off-the-bat fixing that issue. “I’ve never stopped caring for you,” he said shakily. “I don’t know if I ever could.”“Well, then,” she said, “stop taking your affection out on me.”This romance was just… so tender. Bao is kind and undemanding in his love for Lan on a level that I think really resonated with me. And I really really loved seeing their relationship build over time. spoilers on a romance I stan: (view spoiler)[I loved the bit where Bao is checking Lan’s legs for injuries and she’s like “god I wish your hands were higher”. Also, the bit where Lan is like “are you afraid you’ll see my ankles and be seduced” and Bao says “I already have… WAIT, I MEANT SEEN YOUR ANKLES” is so so cute. (hide spoiler)] The thing is, as a reader, I really really love love. Romance and tenderness are such important forces. The romance genre, however, and the ya romance genre, often play with depictions of relationships that feel really alienating to me. Putting aside the many books about men who treat everyone around them badly and are quickly forgiven for it when they decide to treat their love interests well: I do not personally resonate with characters who fall in love while hardly knowing each other. Song of the Crimson Flower is based on a story about a boy who falls in love with a girl while not quite knowing her, but its arc is based around a realization of similarity deep down. This book was an excellent reading experience for me and after Forest of a Thousand Lanterns didn’t quite click for me (though I loved the writing), I’m really glad this book worked so well for me. @ Julie C.

And also, perhaps more notably, a book which uses all of these to talk about abuse and escape. Evelyn Caldwell is a cold cloning geneticist used to working and getting what she wants. She gets what she wants, that is, until her husband clones his perfect version of her, Martine, ready to fulfill her every need. I should just say off the bat—this book is compulsively readable. Every moment was just so messed up that I could not look away. And I did not want to! I was having a grand old time in this fucked up little place. Sarah Gailey's writing is seemingly not for everyone, but she hits just right for me. There are two clones and each clone must be defined both by their old selves’ actions, and the new. Martine is programmed to be different from Evelyn, so where is her growth closer to Evelyn agency, and where is her growth away agency? Where should a copy be punished for the acts of that which came before? Where does your selfhood begin if you live as a copy? I think you could read parts of Martine’s arc somewhat as a political critique of choice feminism—feminism that tells women and afab people that choosing children, makeup, etc are nonpolitical choices. They may be choices, but they are never nonpolitical; at the same time, they may be political, but they’re still choices. Martine’s desires, even those programmed into her, are what she has; she wants a child, and whether programmed into her or not, that desire is part of her to her. Quotes Sticking Out To Me: ➽I think we would have been dead either way. Even if we were still breathing, even if we were still aboveground, we would have been dead.➽ That didn’t mean I was the same as Nathan has been. He’d created Martine to be this way; I was merely taking advantage of a thing that was already there. I didn’t forge the tool. I just wanted to use it effectively. ➽ He was never going to be good enough; the original Nathan was born to be a disappointment to me at every turn, all the way down to his marrow. I couldn’t extract that from him. Not without making him someone entirely new. Someone I could never have fallen in love with in the first place.➽ Everything I felt toward Martine, I felt toward myself, too. Of course, then, I wanted to find some way to protect her.

I think my take on this is that it did not work for me, personally. Much of it is simply a scree of evil countered by an apology for that evil. Reading the narrator’s abhorrent thoughts about his daughter, in particular, was almost too much. My realization, to be quite honest, was that for this, a sorry could never have been enough. Nor should it be. I believe reading this at age 18 is perhaps very different than writing this after a full career. I am glad the author could receive catharsis through this.

This is a ridiculou“Mother must be dying.”“Stop trying to cheer me up.”Now that, my friends, is what we in the business call a wild ride. This is a ridiculous 1970s soap opera that I could not help but enjoy, but I think above all else, it made me hunger on a deep level for a San Francisco I’ve never experienced. Well. We’ll talk about that in a little while. For now, let’s just say this: Tales of the City is a wild ride from start to finish. On both the level of “this is fucking hilarious” and “holy shit, that was a plot twist”. It’s like someone combined Revenge, the 2012 television show, with The Office. It made me feel like I was on crack. I loved it. “Finally, she looks at him intently and says, in a voice fraught with meaning, ‘which do you think you’d prefer, Rich? S or M?’”“And?”“He thought it was something to put on the hamburger.”The tone of these is so delightfully absurdist — you have to lean into the humor a bit and suspend your disbelief to get to the good bits. Actually, it took me a while to get that the chapters were being absurd on purpose (okay, so I received these without context).Some highlights of the admittedly ridiculous character cast include: →Mary Ann, a San Francisco newbie trying to make it but making bad romantic decisions along the way. Often dumb but occasionally iconic. →Mona, Mary Ann’s first friend when she comes to town. Best friend to Michael. Excellent person with some drug issues.→Michael, a gay icon, Mona’s best friend and second roommate. Constantly looking for long-term love but hasn’t found it yet. →Anna Madrigal, landlord to Mona and later Mary Ann and Michael. Mentor type. Some secrets of her own.→Beachamp, rich and seemingly happy husband to DeDe. Secretly dissatisfied. Sort of a dirtbag.→DeDe, rich daughter of a richer man. Not always the smartest.→Edgar, dissatisfied dying man trying to come to terms with a wasted life via his new friendship with a certain landlord. Father to Dede and husband to Frannie. →Brian, disaster and a half. Token heterosexual. One-time lover to Mary Ann. →Jon, possible lover to Michael. Gynecologist. →Dorothea, black lesbian back in town to get back her old lover. →Vincent, depressed crisis hotline operator whose wife has left him to join the Israeli army. →Norman, older man living on the top floor. Maybe a few secrets.I think in basically any other book, this character cast would’ve been absurd, but in this book, they feel perfectly believable. I love how all of the characters are written as both flawed and at times selfish but still generally endearing. And the comics are not without their moments of genuine heart: the relationship between Anna and Edgar is honestly really wonderful and tender, and the friendship between Mona and Michael is — honest to god — peak mlm/wlw solidarity. (You will not be surprised to know they were my favorites.)Due to the serial format, these issues often feel very distinct, at times dealing with very different characters and themes. But I definitely had some favorite scenes and plotlines. ➽Here are some of my book highlights (light spoilers only):→Anna giving Mary Ann a joint as a welcome to San Francisco gift→Michael’s meet-cute with Jon, which takes place at a skating rink after he breaks his nose trying to subtly skate up next to him→when a feminist talking about rape shows up at Dede’s country club and a minor character says delightedly “this is better than when they brought the bulldyke in!” →the scene in which Brian is trying to sleep with a woman who thinks he’s gay and trying to sleep with women to repress it, and who then, when he says he’s not gay, says clinically “You must not be in touch with your body” and walks out. an ally→when Michael answers a call from Mary Ann’s mom and her mom is scandalized about the strange man at her apartment and she then has to tell her mother about the existence of gay people→Mary Ann getting hired at a crisis hotline, accidentally making a pun about playing it by ear, and then contemplating biting her own tongue off→the scene in which Frannie is unloading all her problems but cutting it with “no, but I wouldn’t want to burden you, darling” and you think it’s like, to a friend, and it’s to her fucking dog→WHEN MICHAEL’S PARENTS FIND LUBE IN HIS FUCKING REFRIGERATOR→when Brian asks Michael to go cruising with him and Michael is like… why are straight people like this but then does it anyway. relatable content from 1978→the guy who photocopied his dick and used the enlargerAnd before I get serious, a brief spoiler section:about a bicon: (view spoiler)[Listen, from the very first page, Mona had bi energy. More importantly her and Michael were at PEAK mlm/wlw solidarity and I literally typed in my  notes “I know she’s straight but this is mlm/wlw solidarity at its finest” and then it WAS. actually I think the book isn’t really taking a position on her sexuality (she actually says she’d prefer a long term friendship to having a lover at one point and i was like okay!! !! ! ! ! ! legend ! ! ! !!). it’s just as long as we acknowledge that Mona is in no way a heterosexual we’re good (hide spoiler)] it’s Michael Sad hours, really no spoilers just a rant: (view spoiler)[I actually absolutely love the way Michael is written. because this portrayal of the gay scene is clearly a reflection of promiscuity being really mainstream at that time, a hard-earned freedom. but the narrative still makes it so clear that he just… genuinely wants love? (Michael’s energy in this is the same as my energy when I tweet about wanting a gf every day.) but in all reality, it’s a wonderfully subtle arc and the scene with his parents made me die inside just a little bit. (hide spoiler)]some incredible plot twists: (view spoiler)[okay holy SHIT the minor reveals of characters being involved with each other? INCREDIBLE. I LOVED the way the book did the Mona/Dor reveal, that’s a built reveal babes. the revelation about BEAUCHAMP? when he’s in the bathhouse and Jon sees him? absurd. the fucking Norman investigating Anna reveal left me shook as hell because it immediately made so much sense especially given Edgar’s earlier talk about the Madrigal’s being ridiculous!! Jon being Dede’s FUCKING gynecologist?? ? ?? ?? The thing with Lexy and Norman was awful :(( I loved connecting the dots. the point is I was left shook by so much of this (hide spoiler)]some less incredible plot twists: (view spoiler)[The only thing is that I did not like the twist about Dor, at all. I think it has some really awful connotations to have the only black character in your novel actually be white. I know it’s a soap opera from 1970 but this made me super mad and is honestly the only reason I'm even tempted to not give this a five. (hide spoiler)]The thing is, I said I was going to get serious, and there’s something I need to say. Conservatives have long loathed it as the axis of liberal politics and political correctness, but now progressives are carping, too. They mourn it for what has been lost, a city that long welcomed everyone and has been altered by an earthquake of wealth. -from Washington Post's How San Francisco Broke America’s HeartI grew up 10 miles south of San Francisco — at the time of writing this, I'm leaving for college in almost exactly a week — with a mother who works as an opera singer up in the city. When I was eight, I knew without a doubt that as soon as I left for college, my mother would be selling our house in favor of a nice apartment near SF opera, as most of her friends had. Ten years later, the idea itself is ludicrous. The money we would receive for selling our (fairly nice) house wouldn't pay rent on anything but a studio. Many of my mother's friends have moved to Oakland, taking long commutes simply to arrive. One of my best friends lives with her family in Brentwood, an area past Oakland and two hours from San Francisco — her mom works a job in Woodside so she can attend a private school in the Bay Area. I grew up knowing San Francisco as a place of gay culture and a thriving arts scene — a place with a large homeless population and some crime, but also a place where people came to be themselves. Now, I know it as a city where the culture of old residents is rapidly disappearing, replaced with the more homogenous Silicon Valley scene.In reading this book where San Francisco is known as a weird and quirky city with a thriving gay scene, I found myself mourning for a San Francisco (and a Bay Area) I am barely old enough to have experienced, let alone to remember. I've known for years that I wanted to leave for college, but I wonder sometimes whether, thirty years earlier, I would've wanted to come back.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Jul 28, 2019","Aug 02, 2019","Jul 28, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16255.Tales_of_the_City

I think this book works because in real life we would probably like these characters; respect their talent, find them interesting if at times flawed or condescending, look up to them on a level at which we would at times resent them and at times want to be them. It’s just that none of us would ever know these characters, because these characters do not want to be known.“You underestimate your own power so you don't have to blame yourself for treating other people badly.”Conversations with Friends is a book about four people: two ex-girlfriends and best friends, Frances and Bobbi, and a married couple, Nick and Melissa. Frances and Nick end up falling, over time, into a strange romance. But… it’s not about the cheating. The book refuses to make it that simple. Bobbi and Melissa have their own strange connection, as do Frances and Bobbi, as do Nick and Melissa, of course; the six connections within this circle are all given both pagetime and weight within the narrative. On some level, we’re not rooting for any one of these characters over the others; we see the complex levels on which any ending for these four would be painful. At times, I disliked all four of these characters; at times, I loved all four. But at all times, they felt real.(view spoiler)[There is a scene in this book in which Frances goes home to her father and plays nice and awkward for an afternoon, and looking into a dishwasher, feels “a sudden impulse to harm herself.” It is small and brief and a throwaway line and yet it felt so vivid, so real, that I was unable to pull out of my head the feeling of standing there waiting for the storm to come, desperately, and suddenly feeling as though the world will come apart if you do not hurt yourself physically, a sign of how your insides are being torn apart. (hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[There’s a line where Frances says she enjoys talking to Nick because he gives her unconditional empathy, while Bobbi “applies her standards” about the world to conversations about Frances. I don’t know why that hit so hard I just know that it did? (hide spoiler)]There’s this quote from a New York Times oped that I think about a lot:[image]Frances’ central conflict, as we learn over the course of this book, is that she is unable to allow others to see her vulnerability, to see that she cares for them or is hurt by them or even that she simply enjoys their company. She wishes to be cool and distant and yet still utterly lovable. “The acclaim also felt like part of the performance itself, the best part, and the most pure expression of what I was trying to do, which was to make myself into this kind of person: someone worthy of praise, worthy of love.”The problem is that we need to allow ourselves to be known to be truly loved. It is this refusal to submit to intimacy that becomes the primary conflict of the book; in her relationship with Bobbi, with Nick, and even with Melissa, she constantly attempts (with increasing desperation) to refuse any breaking of her walls. It is only as the book continues that she begins to understand others do love her, and want to know her. SOME OF MY FURTHER FAVORITE MOMENTS:(view spoiler)[▷“Maybe he just likes to act passive so he doesn’t have to take the blame for anything.”▶“It was more that Nick’s sympathy seemed unconditional, whereas Bobbi had strong principles that she applied to everyone, me included.” ▷“I feel like I should thank you for making me a tolerable person to live with.”▶“I wonder if we gravitate toward Nick because he gives us a sense of control that was lacking in childhood.”▷“To him, my arm was not important. He was only concerned with making his child feel bad, making her feel ashamed.”▶“I’m a bad mother, she said, that’s what you’re saying. If that’s the conclusion you draw from the facts, that’s your business, I said. She told me I had never loved my father anyway. According to you the only way to love someone is to let them treat you like shit, I said.”▷“When you broke up with me I felt you beat me at a game we were playing together, and I wanted to come back and beat you. Now I think I just want to sleep with you, without metaphors.”▶“Is it possible we could develop an alternative model of loving each other? I’m not drunk. Please write back. I love you.” ▷“But it’s harder to work out who has the power, so instead we rely on ‘niceness’ as a kind of stand-in.”▶“But at some level I still see you as the person who broke my heart and left me unfit for normal relationships.” “You underestimate your own power so you don’t have to blame yourself for treating other people badly. You tell yourself stories about it.” (hide spoiler)]“I had the sense that something in my life had ended, my image of myself as a whole or normal person maybe.”This is a book made up of tiny moments of humanity, of vulnerability and tenderness. We see these characters hold up their walls at almost every moment to the point that any moment of tenderness or kindness between them feels like a revelation. I cried several times, barely knowing why; I just knew I hurt for these characters. This one will stay with me for a long, long time.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,2,1075,1,"Jun 22, 2019","Jun 30, 2019","Jun 22, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32187419-conversations-with-friends

Indeed, this is a book written primarily with the intent of shocking the audience, challenging the audience. This is good. It is good to shock and challenge your audience. But this cannot hold up a book on its own. Narratives must offer catharsis, growth, and change to feel dynamic and interesting, rather than to feel like a simple fetishization of pain. The book starts off following a 13-year-old girl’s repeated sexual and physical abuse by her stepfather. At first, my assumption was that this was to offer a point about abuse, catharsis for the lead, development for the lead, or some combination. It does none of the above. It does offer, however, both physical and verbal abuse from her mother, a lot more sex, an abusive relationship with another girl, a lot of drug use, and several pedophilic sexual assaults on both Minnie and Minnie’s friends. It is this, primarily, that I had a problem with. I don’t think the narrative of this book is interested in unpacking the trauma Minnie has experienced, or unpacking the logistics of a society desperate to take all agency and bodily control from young women. It is not interested in unpacking the effects on Minnie, simply on thrusting the next torment on her. The blurb of this book describes it as such: This is the story of a young woman troubled by the discontinuity between what she thinks and feels and what she observes in those around her.And it is that, I suppose. She is troubled by the contrast between her budding mind and the long list of men waiting to take advantage of her. But throughout this book, through every scene, I never felt as though the book actually cared. I discovered while perusing Goodreads that a lot of this book is essentially excerpts from the author’s diary. And I think writing about trauma of this nature can be incredibly cathartic on its own, a simple letting out. But… I don’t particularly see the value in reading it, in the sense that it is a fictional narrative. Diary of a Teenage Girl does not offer growth or change. It offers one long strain of misery. And I’m just not sure I see very much value in that.TW: many many graphic sexual assault scenes, a very large amount of pedophilia, drug use, forced drug use.

Ocean Vuong’s writing is beyond beautiful, filling each line in perfect synchrony, spilling across the pages like water. On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is about desire and the hunger that comes with it, about new beginnings that replicate the old, about body and its being inside an America that wishes to encircle it in gilded cage. It's a fantastically written book, but sometimes I did feel more like I was reading a poetic exercise than a novel. Still, it's worth reading if that's what you'd like. Some lines that really stuck out to me:➽That’s what I wanted—not merely the body, desirable as it was, but its will to grow into the very world that rejects its hunger.➽“Swallow. Your bruises are inside it now. Swallow and it won’t hurt anymore.” And so he eats. He is eating still. ➽Submission, I soon learned, was also a kind of power… You cannot rise without having something to rise over. Submission does not require elevation in order to control.➽Sometimes, when I’m careless, I believe the wound is also the place where the skin reencounters itself, asking of each end, where have you been? Where have we been, Ma?➽Maybe we look into mirrors not merely to seek beauty, regardless of how illusive, but to make sure, despite the facts, that we are still here. That the hunted body we move in has not yet been annihilated, scraped out. To see yourself still yourself is a refuge men who have not been denied cannot know. ➽I know. It’s not fair that the word laughter is trapped inside slaughter. We’ll have to cut it open, you and I, like a newborn lifted, red and trembling, from the just-shot doe. ➽I miss you more than I remember you.➽I am thinking of freedom again, how the calf is most free when the cage opens and it's led to the truck for slaughter. All freedom is relative-you know too well--and sometimes it's no freedom at all, but simply the cage widening far away from you, the bars abstracted with distance but still there, as when they ""free"" wild animals into nature preserves only to contain them yet again by larger borders. But I took it anyway, that widening. Because sometimes not seeing the bars is enough.➽I remember studying my father's letter and seeing a scatter of tiny black dots: the periods left untouched. A vernacular of silence. I remember thinking everyone I ever loved was a single black dot on a bright page. I remember drawing a line from one dot to another with a name on each one until I ended with a family tree that looked more like a barbed-wire fence. I remember tearing it to shreds.➽The drag queens are, for as long as the dead lie in the open, an othered performance. Their presumed, reliable fraudulence is what makes their presence, to the mourners, necessary. Because grief, at its worst, is unreal. And it calls for a surreal response.

And still the men they worked with scorned them.A Lady’s Guide to Celestial Mechanics is a historical romance novel about two girls who fall in unlikely love. Lucy is an aspiring astronomer whose father has recently died and whose lover has gotten married to a man she does not love. Catherine is a widower of a famous scientist whose anger at her often outweighed his kindness. The thing is that as well as living in a society that enforces strict homophobia, Catherine and Lucy live in a society that devalues relationships that do not end in marriage. So though the two have a loving, mutually trusting relationship by around 50% of the way through the book, each is quite convinced that the other will, at any moment, leave them.I was deeply impressed by how the author pulled this off: there’s no dramatic miscommunication, per se, but instead an expression of anxiety from both sides that leads them both to understand the relationship as meaning less to the other person than it does to them. Celestial Mechanics manages to pull this off in such a matter-of-fact, honest manner that it’s impossible to read as a trope. It’s simply an expression of the honest insecurities of these two characters, and esolutions come when character growth comes, rather than when the plot calls for it.There’s something Silvia said in her  that I really wanted to quote:“...I realized I needed to stop bracing myself for the stuff I mentioned above, because, amazingly, it kept not coming. And there's a lesson for histfic authors: you don't have to pretend that historical times weren't a cesspool of misogyny, homophobia and racism, but it's entirely possible to write a book for the people who have historically been hurt and marginalized that focuses on the good stuff instead of on the awful. This book is proof of that.”Because that is one of the things that amazes me the most about this book: it focuses on and deals with homophobia in a culture and how it is internalized by the lead characters, but it focuses that energy towards development and crafting tenderness and love between these two characters. I think there is a lot of value in lit that talks about and deconstructs historical homophobia, but it should be noted, in saying that, that much of this type of literature is written by and for the heterosexual lens. This book is absolutely not that. Side queer characters are involved and given their own non-tragic stories; Catherine’s aunt is notable in that. And the pain and trauma of homophobia is only used to explain the character’s internalized homophobia and build their characters, and only subtly. That is not to say stories involving homophobia on-page cannot be worthwhile — past homophobia can and should be explored in a way that puts queer people front and center — but I loved that this one avoided it entirely. Celestial Mechanics also impressively targets not only the devaluation of the work women do in their selected fields, but also how “women’s fields” which actually require great amounts of talent are systematically devalued. Catherine’s work as an embroiderer is simply not respected, while Lucy’s work is given to men to receive credit; each of them, however, suffer from a devaluation of craft. This becomes a major element of their relationship and of each’s character development and I thought it was wonderful. Also, I am a total nerd about translated work, and the fact thatthe politics of translation became such a major narrative in this book was so entertaining. Something I genuinely loved about this story was the way in which Catherine’s characterization was crafted. Catherine’s husband, we learn fairly quickly on, was prone to rage. So Catherine, within the first half of the book, is constantly on edge around others, expecting that they’re about to snap at any second. It is only after spending a great deal of time with Lucy in which Lucy does not snap that she begins to regain trust. I thought the narrative dealt with this with a degree of respect for both Catherine and Lucy that is frankly and tragically unprecedented. Oh god, um, I know I’ve said a lot about this book being excellent, but it’s also just… a really good romance? I frankly don’t read a ton of romance as it’s not my gig and also there are no sapphics in romance ever, but this! romance! was so tender and full of so much kindness and care between these two characters. It’s just angsty enough to get you immediately invested but not so angsty as to be upsetting; each character is so well-crafted and well-respected by the narrative. Also, it’s just really fucking well written. I think I might end up going back to my kindle notes after I post this  because I think I highlighted half of the book (it’s actually a little embarrassing). In case you didn’t notice. I really loved this book. I didn’t want this book to end. I delayed reading the last 5% simply because I didn’t want it to end and I never do that. This is a very very special romance and I would highly, highly recommend it. *Thank you so, SO much to Macmillan for the arc.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,355,1,"Jun 24, 2019","Jun 27, 2019","Jun 08, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/42117380-the-lady-s-guide-to-celestial-mechanics

I want to strive against and for. I want to live in contact. I want to be a context for you, and you for me.I love you, and I love you, and I want to find out what that means together.This Is How You Lose the Time War is about two women, Red and Blue, on opposite sides of a time war, as they fall in love with each other via love letters. It… was a lot to process. This is more poetry than book, and I think maybe in another timeline, another time in my life, that would have annoyed me. In this case, I adored it. This is a novel about time that does not try to ground itself or stick to a place and a setting. Gladstone and El-Mohtar stick to flurid details of this world: Red’s technology-centric future, and Blue’s natural paradise. The chaotic details surround the reader from the start: the rise and fall of multiple Atlantises, the sheer amount of the timestream, and—the biggest threat—the sheer unwinnability of the war. Rather, it sticks to a love story, to the simpleness of caring. What does it actually mean to hunger as a crafted, manufactured creature? What does it mean to love as such? What does it mean when to desire is painful, and has consequences for both you and the other person? The letters are the standout, the flying colors of the novel. There is something very profound about this Romeo-Juliet esque love story, one neither of them have a chance at surviving from the start. Communicating is an act of bravery and it is through these acts of bravery that they fall in love. I went trawling through Wikipedia and found out this about the letters:...""Red's letters were written entirely by Gladstone, and Blue's by El-Mohtar; although they wrote a general outline beforehand, ""the reactions of each character were developed with a genuine element of surprise on receiving each letter, and the scenes accompanying [the letters] were written using that emotional response"".""Don’t let all the doom fool you, though; this is by no means a sad book. The story of Red and Blue falling in love through time is one that I spent more time smiling at than crying at. I loved getting to know these characters. I hungered to know them more.

The Russian peninsula of Kamchatka is, above all else, isolated. The region was isolated by military law from 1945 to 1990, and is surrounded on most sides by water, featuring only a slim border with Russia. With a population of 322,000, both ethnic Russian and Koryak, this region is a hotbed of social tensions. Each chapter of this mystery is a self-contained short story that adds something to the whole.

The story of Olya’s alienation from her schoolfriend over class conflict. The story of Kyusha, a student from Esso, as she navigates a relationship with her past and a relationship with her present. The chapter of Lada, as her old best friend, and maybe-lover, Masha comes back from St. Petersburg. Natasha, whose sister Lilia disappeared years past, as she associates with her conspiracy theorist brother and her sad mother. Revmira, as she reflects back on the tragic accident of her first husband.It’s hard to explain exactly what I loved so much about this book. Maybe it was the intoxicating writing. Maybe the excellent character development. Maybe the growing feeling that no matter how this story ended, it would never be perfect for everyone. And through each of these stories, the clues build bit by bit as to who did it. By the end, I was just figuring it out, but it's truly not about the solution: it is about the destination.

Like The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, this book essentially plays with the idea of performance: the performances we give to an audience, and the performances we put on for ourselves. By using different points of view to narrate the same events, Reid points to the ways in which we all misinterpret events on a smaller level. What’s interesting about the way Taylor Jenkins Reid tells this story is that for the most part, we receive a fairly clear picture of the events – there are ambiguities, yes, but large discrepancies in the reported story are chosen with purpose. Some readers seem to have found this problematic, believing that narrators are, by human nature, MORE unreliable. I felt, however, that by virtue of sticking to a fairly conventional story told with only different viewpoints, this narrative gains clarity. Though these characters disagree on what was said, or remember the angry things said by others, they do not willfully misrepresent: when ambiguities present themselves, they convey something further about the characters. Billy’s denial of his bossiness in lyrical sessions helps us understand that this isn’t something he’s comfortable about; Daisy’s frank acknowledgment of her past drug problem tells us that she is comfortable in recovery. And in moments where these two characters break from their established narratives about their behavior, we as the audience take notice.Everybody wants somebody to hold up the right mirror.I’m fascinated by the idea of how art can both reflect and refract the times we live in and the lives we lead, and the idea of album songwriting is an excellent example of this. I loved reading the song lyrics, and I absolutely cannot wait to see them brought to life.Probably my biggest complaint about this was that the narrative felt crafted around only a few members of the band. I found myself invested in Camilla, Simone, Karen, Daisy, and Billy, but essentially no one else; besides Graham, who I just didn’t really like, other characters are harder to truly read yourself into or become invested in. In a full-cast story about a band, these characters instead serve as distractions from a core narrative. Were I to rewrite this I would either change storylines to offer other character more development, or simply remove those characters who do not contribute to the narrative.On the plus side, however, I absolutely loved how this book tackled addiction. Billy is a recovering alcoholic, while Daisy is a current drug addict. Their relationship is affected deeply by the tension this causes between them, and their recoveries and non-recoveries are a huge aspect of their contentious relationship. On a final plus, however, full cast audiobook rendition of this is absolutely incredible (January LaVoy’s audiobook narration I would risk it all for you). If you’re planning to read this, I would highly recommend using this medium to do so. TW: abortion, addiction, drug and alcohol use, cheating, spousal toxicity, divorce, unplanned pregnancy.

I saw this book primarily as a story about the willful forgetting often encouraged by systems of oppression. If those not in power can never remember anything beyond threat, it is easy to keep them under control, keep them from talking or moving out from under. Lexi in this novel is a niece to one of the town's leaders, a figure whose control of her mother, her sister Wren, and Lexi herself is defined by his control over knowledge - or what he thinks is control. While I think this is a fairly well crafted fairy tale and gets its points about patriarchal control of memory across, I don't believe this ever quite grabbed me. Perhaps notably, I think Lexi's characterization feels weak. She has the complexes of every V.E. Schwab protagonist - specifically see: Lila and Kate - but I felt she lacked the strong motivation or strong dialogue. Cole resonated slightly more, though he is absolutely the same archetype as all of her men as well. (#fuckeduptwinks #gayrights). Regardless, glad to be continuing my Schwab completionist attempt.

Like you read this poem and you’re like “cute” and then you find out sparrow could also mean vagina and you’re like holy fuck this is so dirty. Iconic.Let us live, my Lesbia, and let us love,and let us value all the rumors ofmore severe old men at only a penny!→Poem #5:← This one is just really tender and I’m such a fan. The idea of persisting in loving someone despite the whispers of others, in crafting love and tenderness away from prying eyes, is something I still find deeply romantic, and I submit this as an example of tenderness media. (The fact that this is about Lesbia is very tragic.)Miserable Catullus, stop being a fool,and may you consider what you see has perished, perished.Bright suns once shone for youwhen you would always come where the girl led,a girl beloved by us as no girl will be loved.→Poem #8:← This is the first of the lost-love poems, and it’s wonderful. Poem 8 is a warning to self about being a fool over a girl who has treated you badly rather than loved you. She's wonderful and we stan her. I will butt-fuck and face-fuck you, bottom Aurelius and sex-slave Furius,→Poem #16:← Ladies imagine this: you show up to your Latin class, half-dead from second semester senior year exhaustion. Your teacher shows you a poem containing four words in the first two sentences you do not know, something that is surprising, given you are on your seventh year of Latin. She then tells you to look these words up and you discover that they are, in order: a threat of anal rape, a threat of oral rape, a word literally meaning “someone who takes it up the ass,” and a word that means prostitute or sex slave. You now have to read this out to your one other fellow Latin scholar and your teacher, who is in her 60s but laughing her ass off. Fun times. ...for as soon as I lookat you, Lesbia, nothing of a voice remainsin my mouth.→Poem #51:← This poem is also really wonderfully tender, using sapphic meter, but carries with it a tinge of sadness and desperation. The ending is haunting. It is lonely and lovely and I absolutely would die for it. For what lioness which gave birth to you under a lone crag,What sea spit you having been conceived from foaming waves,what Syrtis, what predator Scylla, what vast Carybdis bore you,you who return such reward for sweet life?→Poem #64:← This is a very long poem but I’m going to be honest: I’m here for the Ariadne section. Greek and Latin mythos tends to give Ariadne a passive role in which things happen to her, but this poem is essentially Ariadne roasting Theseus within one inch of his life and it’s incredible. I hate and I love. Why I do this, perhaps you are asking.I do not know, but I feel that it is happening and I am tormented.→Poem #85:← This is a two line poem and it’s honest to god. My favorite poem of this entire collection. Odi et amo; so simple, and so real.Essentially, the point is that I love one (1) man and he lived in 50 BC. This collection is my favorite Latin lit and deserves to be read.

So yes, I read this in the original Latin! With the help of a lot of vocabulary lists because I don’t speak Latin as fluently as I would like to. (Shouldn’t passing an AP exam make you fluent? Anyway.) Ovid’s language is... so good. Some story s follow:Deucalion & Pyrrha, 1.348-415This is the story of an apocalypse, or in this case, a failed apocalypse. This is the story of a world empty “inanem” and of two lovers at its fall, attempting to bring it back. The language of this is so sweepingly gorgeous; the image of Deucalion and Pyrrha in front of the Themis’ watered-down altar is deeply satisfying. Very Adam-and-Eve and very satisfying. Daphne & Apollo, 1.452-657Daphne and Apollo is a story that would be cool to see done by like, Catullus. (Poem 64 the only bitch in this house I respect!!) In general conceit, it is about a woman who does not want to get married being chased down by a man who just really wants to have sex with her until she turns herself into a tree. And there’s definitely an air of blaming her for beauty here: the line “but that beauty forbids you to be that which you wish, and your form [beauty] opposes your desire” is fucked up and sad, as well as the ending “destroy by changing my beauty by which I please too much”. The best thing that can be said about this is that the line “let your bow strike everything, oh Phoebus, but let my bow strike you” is so satisfying. Jupiter & Io, 1.583-746I absolutely hate this story. This is the one where I decided that he needs to avoid the women-being-chased and-maybe-raped but-I-will-mention-this-with-exactly-one-word thing (“rapuit”). In a situation even more egregious than that of Daphne and Apollo, she is given no character development whatsoever and the general story just angers me, up until around line 630, where she attempts to talk to her father Inachus: “She came to the riverbanks, where she was accustomed to play often, and when she saw in the water, her new horns, she grew frightened and fled having been terrified of herself” — the repetition of the riverbanks here is especially arresting. I did find this line sort of satisfying:“...It is cruel to surrender his love, but suspicious not to give; it is shame, what would urge him from that, Amor dissuades this. Shame would would have been conquered by Love, but if this trivial gift were refused to the companion of his race and bed as a heifer, it would be able to appear to be no heifer.” (617-621)The Ride of Phaethon, 2.150-339This one is wonderful. I really enjoyed the figurative language and dramatic, ironic setup of this story: the horses hit the doors with their feet (155) and then snatch the path (158). The chariot being shaken on high (166) is a great detail, and the journey into the rapidly-heating constellations is just incredible (and not just incredibly hard to translate). Lots of apostrophe and several rhetorical questions build this into a gorgeous story. I absolutely adored this set of lines: “I am bemoaning the lesser things: great cities destruct with their walls, / and with their peoples the fires [whole nations] / turn into ashes; and the forests along with the mountains burn” (214-216)This section was so good that I forgave it for meaning I had to learn almost 200 lines of translation in a month for a test. Me & my 96 on the test say hi!!Pyramus & Thisbe, 4.55-166“Pyramus and Thisbe, the one the most handsome of youths, the other outstanding… that which they were not able to deny, equally they both burned with their minds captured.”Ah, Pyramus and Thisbe, the original tragic lovers. The only context I have seen this story appear in previously is Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, a version that is deeply comedic. But this story is, despite some stupidity in plot, so well written. “This flaw had been noted by no one through the long years… but what does love not detect?” Ovid asks; this love affair seems almost inevitable, deeply wrapped around fate and tragedy. “How difficult would it be, that you could allow us to be joined with whole bodies, or, if this is too-much, that you should open this wall for kisses to be given?” Of course, this story ends badly. And it is Pyramus’ fault. Thisbe is a bitch with common sense and did nothing wrong. The Fall of Icarus, 8.152-235“The shame of the family had grown, and was exposing / the disgusting adultery of his mother by the novelty of the two-formed monster...”THE FALL OF ICARUS!! Okay this has always been one of my favorite stories of all time, and reading it in Ovid’s original Latin was such a cool experience. This story is framed by a description and depiction of the tragedy of the minotaur and the abandonment of poor Ariadne (#Catulluspoem64). I loved Daedalus' intro for his plan: “it is permitted that he block the land and sea / but certainly the sky lies open; we will go that way...” And the fall of Icarus is equally emotional, beautifully conveyed through the image of a herder and fisherman watching him, up to its ending: “and his lips, shouting out the name of his father / are taken up by the blue water, water which has taken up its name from him.”Anyway, I hope y’all appreciated my original Latin translation skills pouring into this .

And yet.For those of you wondering if I’m joking about the premise of this book, I am completely not. It’s escapism to a world where American politics are at their normal level of messed up, but. You know. The election went in a different direction. (The popular vote direction, just like, by the way.) It’s a book about the importance of loving in a world very very desperate to tear down love. The use of historical love letters… OOF. Radclyffe Hall to Evguenia Souline, Alexander Hamilton to John Laurens, Eleanor Roosevelt to Lorena Hickock, Michelangelo to Tommaso Cavalieri, Wilfred Owen to Siegfried Sassoon, Jean Cocteaua to Jean Marais. I will say it: the Vita-Sackville-West-to-Virginia-Woolf letter is absolutely one of my favorite pieces of writing of all time and makes me cry daily. And the line “history, huh?” got me. And it’s a book about love as a choice. The line “On purpose. I love him on purpose.” has reached an almost memetic level on Tumblr and Twitter, but I get it. There are so many narratives, especially in queer lit, about love as something choiceless. But the thing is love is always a choice. And when you find the right person, it’s a good one. It helps that the cast of characters is just really excellent. Alex and Henry are both really well-written characters, but Alex’s narration is genuinely incredibly hilarious. I laugh easily, but I’ve found that writing good humor can be kind of hard, and this worked for me. Nora and June are each good side characters. I also really appreciated characters like Bea, Pez, and Zahra, who show up briefly but make an impact anyway. But. that is why this is objectively ridiculous romance novel resonated with me harder than 90% of the books I’ve read this year, as a lesbian who is almost definitely going to major in history or polisci (or both, I have another year). It’s about the tenderness and also about the weight of expressing love and also about how both our global context and our community history unite and bind us as queer people. I’m done.

But this show is compelling for some deeper reasons. Here, I will insert several bits of my eight-page essay on gender and sexuality in Twelfth Night, an essay that got embarrassingly long. Throughout Twelfth Night, Shakespeare plays with the idea of both gender and romance as roles we perform, and with love as something beyond gender or sexuality. Beginning with lead character Viola transforming herself into Cesario, the show delves into issues of gender as a performed role and romance as another performed role, a tool for status gain. Characters desire each other for outside appearance or for status, rather than for love. Viola’s transformation of gender allows her to take on a freer ‘role’ in the world, a role which at once suits her and forces her to hide. Yet Orsino wants her as both a maid and a man — in other words, he loves her for who she is. By consciously breaking gender roles, Shakespeare concludes that gender and love are primarily performance, yet gives his characters some intimacy anyway.Throughout Twelfth Night, characters break their gendered ‘roles’ in society, with women coming off as powerful and men coming off as incompetent. Despite Orsino’s claims about the “weak nature” (3.4.30) of women, it is not women who are weak within the play: Maria is bold and conniving, and Olivia consistently resists the romantic role she is placed into by Orsino. Orsino is perhaps one of the most passionate characters in the play in his love for Olivia — “O, then unfold the passion of my love / Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith” (1.4.26-27) — and he changes his mind quickly — “If music be the food of love, play on... Enough; no more” (1.1.1-6). Meanwhile, Viola/Cesario is the more logical and rational: “She bore a mind that envy could not but call fair” (2.1.28-29), Sebastian says of her. This contrast between the romantic, changeable Orsino, and the strong, confident-in-her-choices Viola is a direct inversion of societal sexism, a humanizing of women that is revolutionary in merit. Yet despite their personal breaks in role, each character is still playing a part, dictated by gender. Women in the play cannot always express their freedom; Olivia, for example, is looked at as a romantic object by Orsino, and Maria by Toby. Only one female character manages to fully escape this, and she takes somewhat extreme measures.Like a role in a drama, Viola's gender identity is simply a matter of outer appearance. Yet over time, we notice that Cesario’s character is convincing enough to others that she is hardly criticized. Sebastian says of her, “it was said she much resembled me” (2.1.24-25), something Viola confirms with “my brother know / Yet living in my glass” (3.4.399-400); meanwhile, Maria describes her as “a fair young man, and / well attended” (1.5.101-102). It is here that the play’s tension appears: where does the character start, and Viola begin? Viola, as Cesario, is often described via metaphors and similes; no one can quite pin her down. Indeed, as the play continues, Viola seems to take on the role of both a maid and a man. In early stages of the show, she refers to herself thusly — “As I am man, / My state is desperate for my master’s love. / As I am woman (now, alas the day!)...” (2.2.36-38). But even upon the unveiling of her womanhood, the duality of her nature is clearly stated — “Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived: / You are betrothed both to a maid and man” (5.1.228-230). Within these lines, Shakespeare puts Viola in the liminal space between gender, allowing her a role in the world in which her personality supersedes her gender. Viola performs the role of a man, and thus she is a man. When Sebastian and Viola are finally reunited, the situation calls for Sebastian to refer to his sister in the past tense. Yet metaphorically, there is perhaps some truth to this past-tense gendering. “I had a sister / Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured” (5.1.239-240), Sebastian tells the audience. Maybe, indeed, Viola and Cesario have become one and the same. Yet through her disguise, Viola is also put into a position where she cannot be loved for her true personhood, a position many other characters share. Within Twelfth Night, disguise and failed honesty both ruin and form relationships. Malvolio’s disguise, taken on to make Olivia fall in love with him, backfires entirely, leading him to be interred in the dungeons. Meanwhile, Sir Toby and Maria’s relationship is based around their role in humiliating another, with very little human connection; Maria, like Malvolio, simply desires her chosen lover to boost her status. Indeed, perhaps the biggest tragedy of the play, then, is that Olivia does, in fact, end up with someone she knows only from the outside. She has fallen for Cesario’s ‘outside,’ yes, but she has also fallen for her clever lines and flirtatiousness. And yet by chance, she has married the wrong person, someone of whom she knows nothing but outer character. Sebastian, in a similar fashion, has married someone he barely knows, and in so doing rejected another who clearly cares for him. In the face of Antonio’s sacrifices — “His life I gave him and did thereto add / My love, without retention or restraint, / All his in dedication. For his sake / Did I expose myself, pure for his love” (5.1.78-82) — the love of someone Sebastian has met only lines earlier pales. Honest love has not come about for Olivia, Sebastian, Malvolio, Antonio, or Maria: their disguises have stayed intact.It is only in the relationship between Orsino and Viola that love occurs on a true basis of personal knowledge, transversing heteronormative romantic boundaries (note: this line inspired one of my teachers to ask how I learned the word heteronormative, which is deeply hilarious). Orsino begins the play in a role, that of a lovesick teenger for an unnatainable girl; it is only through the love of someone he actually knows that he breaks out of his role. The relationship between Orsino and Viola relationship is clearly romantic before Viola is shown to be a woman. The first scene we see of Cesario and Orsino begins with a brief speech from Valentine, in which he establishes their relationship has already become quite close: “He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger” (1.4.1-4). It is Orsino’s words themselves, however, that best indicate romantic tension towards Viola: “...Cesario, / Thou know’st no less but all. I have unclasped / To thee the book even of my secret soul” (1.4.13-15). Perhaps more importantly, it is clearly established he is attracted to her even in believing her to be a man — “Diana’s lip / Is not more smooth and rubious, thy small pipe / Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound, / And all is semblative a womans part” (1.4.50-54), he says to her. (note: it also establishes that Viola definitely looks like a twink. you're welcome.)In strong contrast to Olivia’s love for Viola and Orsino’s love for Olivia, Orsino is someone Viola knows. The challenge here thus is not a lack of connection, but a lack of ability to be together as two men. “I, poor monster, / fond as much on him” (2.2.33-34), Viola says of herself, self-deprecating on her state of desire for Orsino; she knows her desire cannot be while she plays the role of a man. Their relationship does not lose sexual tension throughout the show, either. Orsino’s direction to Viola to “If ever thou shalt love, / In the sweet pangs of it remember me” (2.4.17-18) is easy to read into, and Viola’s subsequent discussion of her sister’s feelings for a man are hard to stage as anything but a sexually tense scene. A clever bit of wordplay a scene later uses servanthood as something sexually driven, sexualizing Viola’s relationship with Orsino: “You’re servant to the Count Orsino, youth.” “And he is yours, and his must needs be yours / Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam” (3.1.102-104). Here, Viola uses ‘servant’ to denote both her own servitude and Orsino’s love for Olivia, establishing the term as something of a romantic innuendo (as it was commonly used). Even when confronted by accusations about Cesario, Orsino calls him his own: “my gentleman Cesario?” (5.1.193). There is a moment of change in the play, where Orsino discovers that Cesario is also Viola, and we, as the audience, have an expectation of how this will play out — in the 2005 reimagination She’s the Man, for example, Orsino is horrified by Viola’s identity as a woman and romantic tension with him, and must take a week to process her true self. In contrast, the play’s Orsino proposes to Cesario only minutes after discovering her identity. Their relationship is now, quite suddenly to Orsino, permitted, no longer taboo; thus, the play implies that the only obstacle to their romance has been societal judgement around Cesario’s outer presentation, rather than Orsino’s feelings towards her. Notably, Orsino, in proposing, does not attempt to put Viola into the box of womanhood. He calls Viola boy even in asking her to marry him — “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me” (5.1.279-280), his declaration begins, also implying that their conversations have gotten… intimate, shall we say, previous to this revelation. He then proposes thusly: “And since you called me “master” for so long, / Here is my hand. You shall from this time be / Your master’s mistress” (5.1.339-340)... “—Cesario, come, / For so you shall be while you are a man. / But when in other habits you are seen, / Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen” (5.1.408-411). Even with Viola’s role exposed, he still sees her as inhabiting the liminal space between gender; he has not changed his recognition of her personhood. In other words, he loves her for who she is, beyond the performed roles of manhood or womanhood — it is simply that her new role as a woman allows their relationship to progress in public.Shakespeare is not a playwright averse to situations of gender confusion — his plays As You Like It, The Merchant of Venice, and Two Gentlemen of Verona all play with crossdressing in some way. Yet this play specifically establishes love as something beyond gender, done for personality and not fitting into heteronormative ideals. In ending his show with Orsino and Viola marrying, Shakespeare comes the closest possible to allowing two men to form a relationship on stage. While few truly romantic couples actually end up together within the show, the subtext of the play is clear: good love is love that sees beyond the outside to the heart. Hope you enjoyed this sappy essay.

Rule of Wolves, the sequel to King of Scars and the latest in the Grishaverse, is… all over the place. Containing both some boring elements and some fantastically compelling ones, I honestly didn’t love the first half. But after spending about half of this complaining, the last hundred pages had me on the FLOOR and also fixed at least 60% of my problems with it. The plot is a bit scattered between different arenas. As the book begins: ▷Queen Makhi of Shu Han attempts to protect neice Akini, while her sister princess Ehri is alive and missing. Last book, Makhi had her assassin, Mayu, try to assassinate Nikolai, in revenge for Fjerda’s killing of her sister. Meanwhile, Nikolai and Zoya must also deal with Shu Han’s KerGud program, which fuses things to the bones of Grisha and corrupts their humanity. ▷The Darkling, resurrected last year by Elizaveta, is still trapped by Nikolai and Zoya. They hope he can stop the Blight, the real enemy of the novel. ▷Nina is trying to make fake miracles at the ice court under Brum’s eyes while spending time with his heir, Hanne. Meanwhile, she’s going full Rasputin in trying to manipulate Prince Rasmus of Fjerda and his mother, the two of whom are currently protecting Demidov, pretender to the throne of Ravka. Several plot threads exist here, and I find two of three of them hugely compelling. The King of Scars duology focuses on the general beginnings of people believing in saints, falling into some interesting cultural trend storywriting. The focus on international politics is really compelling to me. In Shadow and Bone, there’s a tendency to focus on implication rather than genuine politic. The highlights of the novel tend to fall in its political machinations and power plays — [Spoiler] (view spoiler)[Nikolai’s little girlboss move of manipulating Makhi into coming to David and Genya’s wedding while Ehri returns to Shu Han is fantastic. (hide spoiler)]While some wonderful work is done with the side characters especially towards the second half — [spoiler] (view spoiler)[I particularly adored Mayu, the assassin, and her dynamic with her brother, and enjoyed her teamup with Tamar and Ehri (hide spoiler)] — something was often missing to me. Half these characters are just… interior monologues, and not as much interaction as I’ve come to crave from Bardugo’s writing. The main enemy of much of the novel is an existential threat, a blight, rather than an actual character. This left me craving more with side characters such as Adric and Leoni and less with the Darkling. I couldn’t shake the feeling through much of this book, actually, that I was reading the coattails of a past book. What worked so well about King of Scars was that, though of course we’re working with characters from past books, the development of Nikolai and Zoya felt new. They’d never had points of view, and thus could continue to grow and change. Yet some of this book felt like doubling back to the first series in a bad way. While I genuinely like what’s done with The Darkling here — [spoiler] (view spoiler)[that he redeems some of his mistakes, yet characters such as Genya never receive apologies or forgive him, is nuanced in a way I enjoy (hide spoiler)] — I still think the Darkling being back is a lazy storyline. A new plot was needed. And [spoiler](view spoiler)[killing off a major secondary character from the first series felt, to me, borderline emotionally manipulative. (hide spoiler)] Like much of the book, it’s riding the coattails of how beloved a character already was, rather than building something new.But even with all of that, several points redeemed the novel for me. Zoya and Nikolai as characters are deeply compelling. Zoya and Nikolai each suffer from a syndrome I would like to refer to as “the irredeemable monster complex” — when a character is utterly convinced they are an irredeemable monster, and they are ready to keep that locked inside them for the rest of their lives. Zoya’s arc is a particular standout; her [spoilers] (view spoiler)[I can love you and let you go moment around pg.490s (hide spoiler)] is one of the highlights of the novel. And Zoya and Nina’s relationship, which appears as a throughline, is so important to me. Perhaps more importantly, the ending is absolutely pitch-perfect. The ties between the Nina arc and the Zoya/Nikolai arc is unexpected, but perfect. The conclusion to Zoya and Nikolai’s arcs together is utterly perfect to me, something I would not have considered but absolutely love as an ending. And I enjoy the ending to Nina and Hanne’s arc quite a bit as well; it’s bittersweet, but deeply compelling. Also, [spoiler] (view spoiler)[Matthias having been killed by Joran made me utterly crazy (hide spoiler)]. Overall, while this novel wasn't perfect, it left me with a good taste in my mouth that I don't think I see clearing anytime soon. I'm so glad to have gotten to spend more time with this world.

There’s only one problem: this involves faking a relationship with her enemy Ethan, Dane’s brother. This biggest problem with the narrative of this novel is that Olive’s character arc feels weak. Olive losing her job because of the lying honestly sucked to read. It really does feel like 1. an overreaction and 2. something that results directly from a stupid decision. And it goes very against the fake dating trope, to me, for someone to get fired because of their fake dating. Because her lack of love for her job is not established very seriously until late in the book, the “payoff” of her career decision doesn’t feel earned. Due to the structure, we also don’t get a lot of insight into who Olive is outside of Ami and Ethan, so a line where Ami says she’s made a lot of changes falls a bit flat. It’s not that I don’t see where the authors are going with this arc — Olive is unsatisfied in life but doesn’t fully register it yet. It’s just that it doesn’t translate. I also feel the narrative doesn’t know how to handle her being plus size, or maybe doesn’t know whether she is plus size; a bunch of this book is built on a misunderstanding Olive had about Ethan’s perceptions of her body, and I wanted the narrative to delve into that just a bit more The biggest complaint I have here, however, is some of the handling of the Dane storyline. SPOILERS AHEAD: First of all, Dane’s characterization bugged me just a tiny bit; the book sort of treats him like a subplot until the end and then makes it the main plot. The fact that Ethan doesn’t immediately fucking panic upon the realization that Ami actually didn’t know Dane was cheating for two years feels… honestly, out of character? Ethan is not an asshole, and he is not an idiot, and I can understand being in denial, but his on-page reaction is mostly dismissive, which is just not in character. Were Ethan’s reaction to the Dane situation shifted more towards anger and denial, his character would feel both more consistent and more forgivable. But that’s not to say that there aren’t enough pros to make this feel like a worthwhile romance. It takes a lot to write really good banter and this book did it, consistently, without ever feeling cringey. I think this is honestly Christina Lauren’s main talent as a writing duo and I’m here for it; Ethan and Olive have such a good and fun dynamic right off the bat with just a few one-liners. The banter isn’t necessarily hilarious, just really entertaining and really sweet, and I ended up pretty damn invested in these two characters getting together. Fake dating is so so entertaining and I think I’ve mostly only read it in fanfiction before? (Yes, I read fanfiction, you couldn’t tell that from the everything about me?) Like, honestly, it’s a romance, I’m living for that cheesy tense goodness. You know what I’m about, son. Olive and Ami are also both biracial (Mexican and white) and the relationship between them felt really well-written and well-drawn to me. I deeply appreciated the emphasis on solidarity between women, and that though there is conflict between the sisters, they remain close, and their relationship is given deep narrative weight. Oh, um. This book has exactly one explicit sex scene, in which Ethan eats Olive out. I actually don’t read a lot of m/f romance novels because I had never read a romance novel in my life till last year and also, I’m gay, but cis women actually getting to orgasm and have sexual pleasure is still not very normalized and this book breaks that. Feminism! I can appreciate my body in a bikini and still want to set fire to the patriarchy.Anyway, I guess my point is that despite a few problems, I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good romance novel.

In Ironside, the conclusion to the Modern Faerie Tales series, Roiben sends Kaye on an impossible quest, and Kaye must come to terms with her identity between faerie and human worlds. Ironside’s biggest success is in its newfound development of characters who didn’t feel as if they had internal lives earlier. Specifically, Corny, who came off like a gay best friend trope in the first book, has a far more interesting arc here. In the first book, he’s used as a prop until the ending, and feels lacking in internal life. Here, he’s dynamic, with an arc around trauma and revenge that is genuinely resonant. He and Liam from book two also start a romantic relationship that feels… surprisingly well-built? There’s this one scene between the two—(view spoiler)[running water, salt (hide spoiler)]—that I genuinely can’t stop thinking about. The development of Ellen, Kaye’s mother, was likewise really interesting. Kaye’s first book characterization could have done with better focus on this relationship, which was flawed from the beginning. Here, the relationship between the two is put towards Kaye’s growth, her acceptance of herself as both faerie and somehow human. The plot here feels simultaneously just as brutal and more twisty than previous books, which I enjoyed. (view spoiler)[And the solution to the plot of this is a PUN, which… excellent.

This... was interesting, first of all. It is certainly an interesting premise, and I think the focus on perceived normalcy—how we adapt to the daily grind as if it’s always been—is interesting. This book focuses not just on the race to save the world, the race to find a new home, but also on the gender and racial politics of the time, and the barriers that Elma and others must break down. That’s all interesting. The problem is I didn’t feel like much happened in this book. There are long swaths where things are happening, but little that has long-lasting consequences within the narrative. Actually, very little has long-lasting consequences, period.

I also think I could’ve gotten more into this were I more invested in the characters. Elma is cool but I just wasn’t that invested in her as a specific character.

In real lifeI Kissed Alice follows two girls, Iliana and Rhodes, who are best friends—and maybe something more—online, designing a webcomic together. In real life, however, the two despise each other, despite their mutual best friend Sarah’s wishes. It will take an art school competition and a whole lot of drama to get them together. Okay, honestly, ever since I saw this blurb, I was hooked:Two girls at a southern school for the arts find themselves in a bitter rivalry over the final spot in the scholarship program, even as they anonymously fall in love on a fanfic site.Like. Come on. Incredible.This book had some really positive qualities. I Kissed Alice puts a lot of effort into making its three lead characters, but especially its main two, feel vivid. I enjoyed Rhodes as a character; I liked her character development and desire to repent. Both Rhodes and Iliana felt like real people with flaws, which I really appreciated. The general premise of this novel is solid, offering for some good classic sapphic hate-to-love moments; some of the online conversations are sweet. Ultimately, however, this book left me wanting more. We’re not really given a clear picture of the pre-book relationship between the two online: I really didn’t get the sense of their relationship I wanted. The novel is attempting to make all of the characters somewhat complex, and not 100% likable, but I just didn’t really find myself genuinely invested in any of them. I understand the intention; I know the broad outline of these characters. But I just didn’t feel like the book gave me reasons to genuinely believe in Iliana, the relationship between Iliana and Sarah, the relationship between Rhodes and Sarah, or the relationship between Iliana and Rhodes (Cheshire & Alice). I enjoy hate to love a lot but I feel like I’ve struggled recently with a few examples I’ve found on it because I just do not believe that these characters would in fact make a functional couple. The best part of hate to love, to me, is seeing people discover the connections between them. And by the time I was seeing that for Rhodes and Iliana, I just kind of wanted this to be over. Honestly. On a much more personal level. I really did not like the main characters of this book. Iliana specifically felt like she had very little self-awareness, which is something I really struggled with just on a personal level. A lot of her other flaws feel like very strong and solid potential for character growth, and I could not tell to what degree this specific flaw was intentional. I honestly struggled even more with Sarah, who does not have a pov but is, as Iliana describes her, is “the kind of person who absorbs the worst qualities of the people around her.” For a character who feels fairly well-drawn, I just could not get a sense of her as a real person, and felt I knew where her characterization was going the whole time (I was not wrong). I think possibly they’re both just… people whom I have known and had bad experiences with in real life? Listen, I recognize this isn’t an objectively great take on this book, but in the interest of honesty, I suppose I just spent more time disliking these characters than being invested in their dynamics. So. Yes. I think this is a solid book with some good aspects. But it didn’t exactly hit the mark for me. ...more",Notes are private!,0,92,1,Nov 2020,Jan 2021,"Feb 07, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43300915-i-kissed-alice

On one hand, The Virgin Suicides is an introspective exploration of some of the problems of 1950s suburbia, and of our society’s tendency to look at suicide and the trauma of young girls as something dangerous, rather than real. This narrative is told through the point of view of the boys around the girls. It purposefully fetishizes the pain and trauma of the five, attempting to critique this same fetishization. We barely know the tragedy of Cecilia, but she herself is almost erased by the male narrators, who make her death into a case they can solve via the exhibits. They treat her death as true crime, not a true tragedy, and thus fail to solve any mystery at all. They must learn to see the girls as actual human beings.This critique works, to some extent; it is the sisters themselves where the book falls apart. The five suicidal virgin sisters are, despite incidental moments of characterization, a monolith; they are used as representations of some deeper societal problem, rather than people. They are at once sexualized and devoid of sexuality; their deaths are fetishized to such a degree by the lead group of boys that they cease to exist at all. In other words, the five sisters are at once given agency, and then have their agency taken away by a narrative that refuses them any room to tell their own stories. I believe the authorial intent here may have been the former; the result, to me, is the latter.I also struggle with the weird fascination with destruction of gender roles in the home brought on by a close text reading of this; the girl’s father, Mr. Lisbon is more feminine, with a “girlish voice” (6); his daughters “forgot he was a male and discussed their menstruation openly in front of him” (21). This is not an uncommon problem in media; I actually read this for a class on concepts of adolescence in which we also watched Rebel Without a Cause, and yep, the father in that is overly feminine, too. I still dislike it, as well as the narrative’s focus on Mrs. Lisbon as the source of the girl’s trauma. Eugenides’ writing is gorgeous in places, but feels so cold and removed towards its characters that I found myself put off. There is some good here; a discussion on the ways teachers attempt to deal with the suicide is well-done, and a scene in which the Reverend equates suicide with not winning title game (101) is both hilarious and deeply sad. Adults try to put Celia’s suicide on her crooked nature, not on her actual life; this precludes the suicides of the other three. The imagery around the decay of the house is compelling. I also want to acknowledge that this was a good deal more revolutionary when it was written in 1993. This book is not terrible and I’m glad I’ve read it for myself; it’s just that when it comes down to the wire, I gained very little from this reading experiences.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,184,1,"Feb 06, 2019","Mar 06, 2019","Feb 06, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/38651886-the-virgin-suicides

Prickling and sharp and oh so honest.This is one of the weirdest books I’ve read this year… and also one of the most cathartic.Fundamentally, You Must Not Miss is a story about the struggle for kindness in a world that wishes to crush the outsiders. While Magpie’s personal journey is of course the focus, a great deal of the book focuses on her struggle to be open and honest in her relationships with her closest friends. Ben, for example, a cute guy at school who sees her for who she really is because he’s also been the one on the outside due to being trans. Clare, her classmate who is dealing with grief of her own after her father’s widely-publicized suicide. The importance of Magpie’s friendship with these two, and with two others, Brianna & Luke, is emphatically the closest to goodness the story gets. Magpie’s character arc, however, is excellent. I think there’s a certain way of portraying and handling trauma that this book plays into, where you give the audience the portrait of a character, and hint at why they are the way they are but do not explicitly say it. In a book of this structure, we’ve generally figured out the past trauma before any character explicitly states it. In the past three months, she has caught her father sleeping with another woman, seen her mother turn to alcohol, and lost her best friend, all at once. But there are details to this story that the narrative slowly allows us to discover.And discover, we do. Slowly but surely.There’s a sentence in this book that keeps staying with me, in which Magpie’s mother promises to stop drinking: “Magpie? You do know how sorry I am, right? I’m going to do so much better. I’m going to get some help. Finally, I’m going to get some help.”And Magpie had heard it before. The daughter or sister or brother or husband or mom or dad or cousin or friend of every alcoholic in the world has heard that before.And every time you heard it… you believed it.This… landed. I think this book does such a ridiculously good job discussing and unpacking Magpie’s trauma while still not making her into a character she is not, a character who explodes or cries in front of friends. The narrative allows her, and by extension us, catharsis in atypical ways. In a lot of ways, You Must Not Miss is one of the angriest books I’ve read in recent memory. It is, in all essentials, a story of revenge against those who hurt. But it is also a book about learning that even valid anger is not the best thing to be driven by. Sometimes, the world fails people, and much as we may wish it to be, anger and violence are not the best options for us. You Must Not Miss both allows hate, and counters it with love and kindness.There were other reasons for her choice: she did not like her house, she did not like other people's houses. She liked neutral ground, neutral territory, a fair and fighting chance for everyone.TW: (view spoiler)[rape, murder.

My favorites among this story were the following: the haunting The Miracle of the Lily (1928) by Clare Winger, the mournful space opera of Space Episode (1941) by Leslie Perri, the eerie Contagion (1950) by Katherine MacLean, the charming All Cats are Gray (1953) by Andrew North, and the utterly horrifying The Last Flight of Dr. Ain (1969) by James Tiptree, Jr.. Of all of these, I think everyone should read the first and last – they’re each brilliant. Overall, a lot of these stories ended up being threes for me. I found this almost more useful as an academic text than as introducing me to truly fantastic scifi. But I still enjoyed the reading experience and am glad I perused. All story s below: The Miracle of the Lily (1928) Clare Winger Harris ★★★★★Insects attempt to overtake the earth, and are defeated; but at what cost? Intensely disturbing, absolutely loved it. The Conquest of Gola (1931) Leslie F Stone ★★★★☆A matriarchal tenth planet, Gola, is invaded by Detaxel, the third planet from the sun. It is Detaxel’s mistake to underestimate their powers. Definitely a 1930s brand of feminist sci-fi, with each race committing a genocide; wonderful worldbuilding. The Black God’s Kiss (1934) C.L. Moore ★★★★☆Jirel of Joiry ventures somewhere almost like hell to find a weapon to destroy her captor. Unsettling to a core level and excellent at playing on the uncanny. Jirel’s narration is wonderful. Space Episode (1941) Leslie Perri ★★★★★Lida is faced with a life-changing decision in space. Only eight pages but utterly gorgeous. That Only A Mother (1948) Judith Merrill ★★★★☆In the aftermath of the nuclear explosions, babies begin to be born with mutations – but not Margaret. Incredibly clever; like with many 50s nuclear war takes, however, the ‘horrifying twist’ is ultimately a disability. Still, super well done. In Hiding (1948) Wilmer H Shiras ★★★☆☆Dr. Peter Welles analyzes the potential problems of a boy named Tim. Interesting and definitely see why this was here; bit long. Contagion (1950) Katherine MacLean ★★★★★Oh my god. One of the crazier and more haunting pandemic stories I’ve ever read; I’m not sure how I’ll get this out of my head.The Inhabited Men (1951) Margaret St Clair ★★★☆☆Three men are colonized by spores on another planet. Kind of interesting and well-written, but just wanted a lot more from this. Ararat (1952) Zenna Henderson ★★☆☆☆Beings from elsewhere attend school in the desert under a new teacher. Honestly didn’t really like this at all and found the twist to be incredibly predictable. All Cats are Gray (1953) Andrew North ★★★★★The story of Steena the grey woman, Bat the gray cat, Cliff Moran, and their reeling in of the pleasure ship Empress of Mars. Super short but super good. Created He Them (1955) Alice Eleanor Jones ★★★★☆Miserable but fantastic story about a day in the life of a woman as she cares for her husband and her children. Mr. Sakrison’s Halt (1956) Mildred Clingerman ★★★☆☆A woman rides the train with Miss Mattie Compton every day. Short but well-written. Incorporation of the Jim Crow South into this is quite brilliant.All the Colors of the Rainbow (1957) Leigh Brackett ★★★☆☆Two off-earth aliens visit a segregated town. This was quite interesting. Noting use of N word. Pelt (1958) Carol Emshwiller ★★★★☆A dog hunts with his master. Car Pool (1959) Rosel George Brown ★★★☆☆A mother raises her children as the galactic Hisereans come join their class. Interesting, not life-changing. For Sale, Reasonable (1959) Elizabeth Mann Borgese ★★★★☆A primary source text of a man turned machine. Really solid cultural criticism. Birth of a Gardener (1961) Doris Pitkin Buck ★★☆☆☆Rosalie studies her husband Payne’s physics theories, and confronts him on their quality. Meh. The Tunnel Ahead (1961) Alice Glaser ★★★★☆A quiet horror story about overpopulation, following a couple and their four kids as they drive back from a crowded day at the beach. The New You (1962) Kit Reed ★★★☆☆Martha discards her frumpy old body for a new one, only for her old to stay around. Another Rib (1963) John Jay Wells and Marion Zimmer Bradley ★★★☆☆[Noting that Marion Zimmer Bradley has been accused by her daughter of childhood sexual abuse, and was married to a sexual predator whom she protected over their entire marriage.] A group of explorers who have just found an earthlike planet discover their home devoured by a supernova in their wake. Cue: oh my god, some of us need to get uteruses so we can have babies. Quite literally just the narrator panicking about gay and trans people – the narrative clearly finds this to be ridiculous, which I enjoy. While this just doesn’t feel quite as transgressive sixty years later, it’s cool to know this was being written at the time. When I Was Miss Dow (1966) Sonya Dorman ★★★☆☆Did not care, and the gender politics are boring.Baby, You Were Great (1967) Kate Wilhelm ★★★☆☆A woman is used as a movie star against her will. I found the worldbuilding of this somewhat ill-explained, and the narrator is an almost totally irrelevant man – a recurrent theme in this collection, which says something very interesting about the history of women writing scifi. The thematic premise is interesting and well-executed. The Barbarian (1968) Joanna Russ ★★★☆☆Alyx becomes a hired monkey in the city of Ourdh. Plays with the politics of subservience to a god or higher power. A moment of racial politics here that haven’t aged great. Overall interesting. The Last Flight of Dr. Ain (1969) James Tiptree, Jr. ★★★★★An entirely terrifying five pages, told in documentary style, so subtle with its horror I barely noticed I felt unsettled until it was too late. Brilliant and horrifying. Nine Lives (1969) Ursula K. Le Guin ★★★★☆“The neighbor was the self; the love was perfect.” A set of ten clones who think alike come to operate as a machine together away from earth. Really fascinating; I think Ursula K. Le Guin just doesn’t miss.

Where love existed, death would follow, a wolf trailing after a wounded deer.In the world of Zulla, about 80 years after a war between humans and automae, automae rule the earth, triumphing over human beings. Crier, the sovereign’s daughter, is slated to take over. Ayla, a human rebel, has a plan to kill her for revenge. But when Ayla becomes her lady-in-waiting, the two grow closer, and maybe even too close. Meanwhile, Crier discovers she’s maybe not quite the weapon she thought she was. GOD. Okay. So, I’m deeply obsessed with this book. Why? Could it be that it plays with every single trope I love, but plays around with said tropes? Could it be the commentary on power dynamics? Could it be the rounded, compelling characters? Could it be the incredibly tense romance? Could it be the plot twists that I genuinely did not see coming? Or maybe… all of the above? Tropes To Love Here: ☆A character who is unhuman in some way falling in love with a character who's more human. ☆When they’re both plotting at the same time but can’t tell each other. ☆One character is a weapon of some kind and think they're flawed because they have feelings: not necessarily romantic feelings, just feelings in general.Crier is an example of my favorite trope ever: the character raised to be a weapon who decides not to be one. (This is actually my favorite trope ever. I literally have a playlist for it.) I like this trope because I think it provides an interesting dynamic between a perceived role, and can lead to some really fantastic character arcs. This is one of the best examples of it I have ever seen. As a protagonist, Crier is compelling because she takes actions, and enjoyable because at every moment, we are rooting for her to develop. The romance, in general, is… incredible. A truly compelling romance serves as a natural conclusion to both characters’ arcs. Crier is fascinated by Ayla’s humanity, while Ayla is fascinated by her humanity—her awkwardness, and the quiet tenderness she shows to her. Crier looks at Ayla with tenderness and curiosity; in turn, Ayla is curious about her. Scenes like (view spoiler)[when Crier asks Ayla why humans get married (hide spoiler)] are filled with such excellent tension. I think the way this novel handles power dynamics between Crier and Ayla is really really good and really really interesting. Obviously, Ayla is in a lower position of power than Crier, and there are a lot of moments in this book in which Ayla is disturbed by that, or feels bad about it, when Crier attempts to help her or help other humans in the palace in some way. It's just interesting seeing Crier really discover and acknowledge her privilege. My only real complaint is this: Don’t read the timeline until about halfway through as it spoils one or two minor plot points I really think would’ve been more interesting discovering on my own. However, spoiler-tagged, here are several things in the last hundred pages of this book that made me gasp: (view spoiler)[→two necklaces… crier never gave kinok the necklace… hellooooo→THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO FIFTH PILLAR. LIKE THAT THREW ME FOR THE BIGGEST LOOP. i LOVE that twist. it adds even more nuance to the idea of automae not having feelings.→the locket being the fucking tourmaline ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !→JUNN KILLING REYKA… when i say this made me SHRIEK. i was not expecting this one at all and it has huge implications.  (hide spoiler)]This book has excellent plot twists. These twists are built up well, always feeling as if they make total sense in hindsight but not in the present. And the world has some really cool details built in — there’s one about the flag that made me pause to go like ‘hello’. Anyway. I devoured this book, and Crier and Ayla have been living in my mind rent free ever since. Highly recommended. Please read this. And then come yell at me.

I think these books are fun. I think Cassandra Clare is a much better writer than she was in 2005 in terms of like… not making the most annoying people you’ve ever seen in your life. Are they high quality fantasy literature? No. Do I care? No<3 They’re fantasy romance I'm just vibing<3 Also I think it’s funny that Cassandra Clare has decided the way to put gay people in the 1800s is Lavender Marriage Drama<3 Also, unfortunately I contracted The Infernal Devices brainrot four years ago and it is both chronic and incurable, so I’m going to continue making that everyone else’s problem for the time being. As such, here is my brief summary of my thoughts on this book: It’s fine. It has too many characters and sometimes the side characters are more compelling than the protagonists. There's also one love triangle I think is stupid and ridiculous; most of the love triangles are actually just Lavender Marriage Drama and thus are in my opinion funny. The genuine worst thing about Cassandra Clare’s writing right now might be that she writes in characters with compelling backstory, but does not give you the backstory in the actual series—only in spinoff books. That is ridiculous and should not be happening. But I had a lot of fun, and I will keep reading this series. The cast is kind of um… huge. The second generation is as follows (with their parents in parentheses: ➽James and Lucie Herondale (Will and Tessa)➽Cordelia and Alastair Carstairs (some people named Elias and Sana, I don’t understand or care how related to Jem these people are)➽Charles and Matthew Fairchild (Charlotte and Henry)➽Barbara, Eugenia, and Thomas Lightwood (Gideon and Sophie), of whom only Thomas is relevant➽Anna, Alexander, and Christopher Lightwood (Gabriel and Cecily)➽Grace and Jesse Blackthorn (some woman named Tatiana)➽Ariadne Bridgestock (the inquisitor I fucking guess)Here is the drama that is going on, or what you missed on Glee so to speak, containing spoilers because this is for the appeal only of me and anyone who thinks I’m funny: THE MAIN CHARACTERS➽the premise of this book is that it’s 1903 and when people see problems the most normal response is to say ‘clearly fake marriage is the solution’➽James and Matthew are parabatai and Cordelia and Lucie are future parabatai. Both of these dynamics are really sweet and lovely. The four of them are like, a squad with Thomas and Christopher, of whom so far only Thomas is particularly relevant, and also occasionally gatecrash Anna’s place when the author remembers things need to be interesting➽James keeps getting dragged into the shadow realm which is just like, a place where demons are. Also, demons keep telling him his grandfather is a demon because of Tessa’s whole hellspawn thing, which can really get a guy down➽James is also in love with Grace, except he cannot remember when or why this happened and knows nothing about her personally. I wonder if this could have any kind of cause? Probably not a problem<3➽Cordelia is in love with James, who is also definitely in love with her, but mostly is just trying to get her father safe from Magic Jail and also make new friends, which is actually very sweet➽Cordelia and James are boring for most of this book and then their book ending made me start eating glass whole➽Cordelia is Persian and I think this is actually inoffensive➽Lucie, who likes writing, is trying to bring back Grace’s dead sibling, Jesse, who is a ghost. she can also control ghosts, good for her➽Matthew is an alcoholic and hates himself because he accidentally killed a man, which I only know from that other spinoff book you apparently had to read before this➽which I did in fact read, because there’s something wrong with me➽Matthew also having feelings for Cordelia is stupid and I hate it. who benefits from this love triangle. who is compelled by it. who is asking for it. I honestly can’t even begin to tell you how little I care about thisTHE LAVENDER MARRIAGES➽Anna and Ariadne are in love but Ariadne is “dating” Charles which sucks for both of them. both of these facts I also only know from that spinoff book, which is actually deeply annoying because without that knowledge this plotline would be a lot less compelling➽Alastair is gay and getting kicked to the curb so Charles can lavender-marry Ariadne, except then Grace homewrecks their lavender marriage➽homewrecking Ariadne and Charles's lavender marriage was funny of Grace and if you think about it is lesbian allyship➽Charles like, sucks➽again, a genuinely surprising amount of this book revolves around lavender marriage drama➽Thomas and Alastair also maybe have feelings for each other, I think this is potentially compelling as a dynamic I’ll be honest but I’ll let you know more soon➽Anna, who is gnc af, is on-page implied to have fucked Virginia Wolff, a detail I’m unironically obsessed with➽if I see a single piece of legitimate discourse about whether Anna from the Cassandra Clare books is good representation I will hit my limit right here and now➽Cassandra Clare I don’t know if you read these what else do you have to do but I will pay you at least $45 to make Anna the main character of this bookEVERYTHING ELSE➽while all these people are being insane Will is busy being a malewife, a fate I personally love for him. also the audiobook like actually did his Welsh accent which is so sweet.➽they fucking like. fridge one of Gideon and Sophie’s kids like she just straight up dies and everyone forgets about it➽I am a Grace apologist. I think she did nothing wrong. Manipulating James into being in love with her with a magical bracelet and then manipulating Matthew also was a little over the top no it wasn’t<3 ➽okay no but to be serious Grace is a tool in this and has very little choice. she is a victim too. and I could fix her<3THE ENDING OR WHATEVER➽Cordelia’s silly little girlbossery moment where she just lies and says that James could not have committed a crime because they were in bed together all night is genuinely a cultural reset. like the drama of it all.➽even more obsessed with the fact that his reaction to this is just being like ‘well I guess we have to get married’. these people are fucking insane➽by ‘these people are fucking insane’, what I mean is I’m SO compelled, this beginning of a fake dating au made me absolutely crazy, and James and Cordelia will I think make me chew glass a bit next book. ➽UPDATE: just found out that in the next book [there are spoilers here] they “practice kissing”, with James tied up and Cordelia on top of him, and I genuinely can’t explain how compelled I am rn ➽Alistair’s anti Charles girlboss moment my beloved<3THE IMPORTANT THINGS➽I am fundamentally not the same as all of you still having ship wars about the characters of the infernal devices in the comments and/or saying that series sucks because of the love triangle or complaining that it's ""weird"" that Tessa and Will spend extensive time on their wedding night thinking about how much they miss Jem. you don’t get it. you don’t understand it like I do. you haven’t read the 200k bed sharing fic where all three of them get together. we’re simply not the same. you’re probably normal and you know what? good for youOkay that’s it sorry to both those of you who love Cassandra Clare and those of you who hate Cassandra Clare, my stance is that my reading these is camp<3Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,132,1,"Jun 18, 2021","Feb 13, 2022","Dec 13, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17699853-chain-of-gold

On a good note: this was certainly an entertaining and interesting book. Vaugn’s writing voice is excellent and easy to read. The time skips sometimes took me out of the narrative just a bit, but generally are solid and non-confusing. Courtroom dramas are always something I find riveting. However. Firstly, I think I generally need a lot of character focus to get super into a thriller and I think this wanted to be a stronger character novel than it was. Kate, as a lead, is strong and a worthy protagonist. But I felt that she didn’t learn and grow as much as I wanted her to. Sophie has a bit more of a character arc, but I still craved more. SPOILER:(view spoiler)[It’s wild that Kate’s real identity is not identified on the stand. I was really dreading her Inevitable Downfall™️ because I was rooting for her and I sort of love that she never got one? That would’ve been so easy to use as a truth bomb and we didn’t go that route. excellent. (hide spoiler)]Also, though the courtroom drama was good, I do think I might’ve been more into this if it left more to be revealed in the actual court—aside from a few details, you know 90% of the actual case before anyone gets on the stand. Very little that happens on the stand comes as a shock, and I craved more of that. What I liked most about this was how it handled the subject of rape and sexual assault. The idea of men hearing ‘no’ and hearing it as ‘yes’ is challenged with strength, but subtly. Vaugn feels no need to hit the audience over the head: instead, we come to our own conclusions about the characters, slowly. I also definitely enjoyed seeing certain characters get their just desserts.TL;DR: As a narrative about rape, I think it’s very strong. As a thriller/courtroom drama, I think it’s fine. I think this is a good book but it did not change my life beyond distracting me from my 5th day of lockdown. which is always a good thing!Blog | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Mar 16, 2020","Mar 20, 2020","Nov 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34466492-anatomy-of-a-scandal

Which CW tv show, and the quality of said CW tv Whoever on one of these pages compared this very very long series to a CW tv show is exactly correct. Which CW tv show, and the quality of said CW tv show, varies widely based on the book. The Mortal Instruments is the late-seasons the 100 of books. The Infernal Devices, however, is unironically well-done, and I really enjoyed it, and it made me cry a little bit which we don’t have to address. I was curious as to whether this spinoff would be good. The answer is… sometimes. This spinoff vaguely follows Jem's quest to track down the lost Herondale from the beginning of her life to the ending, from introducing the second Infernal DevicesDark Artifices characters. If you don't know anything about Cassandra Clare, essentially there's the Mortal Instruments, the original series which I personally think is bad and not worth reading, the Infernal Devices, a prequel series with entirely different characters which gave me permanent brainworms and which I am obsessed with, and the Dark Artifices, a sequel series with cameos from TMI characters which I think is somewhat variant in quality. This collection is one of many spinoffs and follows characters from all three series, and my opinions on the stories in the collection tended to correlate with my feelings on the characters. But this particular spinoff is also primarily from the points of view of Jem and Tessa, two of the three Infernal Devices characters. It’s just like. Jem yearns to be with Tessa. Jem yearns to be with Will. Will and Tessa, happily married, yearn to be with Jem. And the later chapters are just like. Jem and Tessa, happily married, are happy and also yearn to have Will with them. Overall, I feel crazy, but I am definitely having fun. ▶ #1 Cast Long Shadows ⋆ ★★★★½Stars Matthew Fairchild, with major presence of his parabatai, James, and cameos from Christopher, Thomas, Lucie, and Alastair. Christopher and James have just gotten expelled for blowing up a wing. This one is… sad, but it definitely got me invested in Matthew and James. SPOILER:(view spoiler)[Matthew thinks he’s illegitimate because of a downworlder at the shadow market, and accidentally feeds his mom (Charlotte) poison because of it, stopping her unborn child from being born. (hide spoiler)]Also Jem is in this and the thing is that for personal reasons I love him. It contains several moments that made me go crazy, including: ✔“All the silent brothers hushed when Brother Zachariah was with Tessa” ✔“Brother Enoch had made it clear he was tired of two names echoing in their minds” ✔He also calls Will “the finest man ever made” in this. ▶ #2 Every Exquisite Thing ⋆ ★★★★½Stars Anna Lightwood, a gendernoncomforing lesbian in the 1800s, and her love interest, Ariadne Bridgestock. For personal reasons, which are that I am gay, I’m obsessed with Anna. I enjoyed the writing of Gabriel and Cecily as deeply supportive. ▶ #3 Learn About Loss ⋆ ★★★★☆Introduces Sister Emilia, as she and Jem go to investigate a demon attack by Beleal and have to make a difficult choice. Jem looks for Annabelle Blackthorn, who became an iron sister, and Malcolm Fade. Something about this plotline is just really really hitting me, and the ending moment between Will and Jem made me really sad :/▶ #4 A Deeper Love ⋆ ★★★★½Tessa hanging out with Catarina Loss in the 1940s. Some insane yearning longing between Tessa and Jem and it made me feel so crazy god bless. ▶ #5 The Wicked Ones ⋆ ★★★★★Backstory on Celine, who I think is Jace’s mom, and an introduction to Rosemarie and Jack Crow. It is SO sad and you know what? This was good. This was really really good. I cannot remember what happens to Celine so I guess I have to Google it, but this functions primarily as a character piece, and I think in its role as this it is stupendous. ▶ #6 Son of the Dawn ⋆ ★★★★☆Jem goes to a shadow market in 2000 and meets Raphael Santiago and Lily Chen, a duo who are among the long list of mortal instruments characters that are more interesting than the protagonists. Raphael is so entertaining, adore whatever he has going on, would gladly read a Magnus Raphael Lily New-Girl-type spinoff where they just have to be each other’s awful roomies. This is also the one where Jem is like “wow I should visit Emma more often. her and Julian are so close, they remind me of me and Will :)” and then we just. don’t unpack that at all. ▶ #7 The Land I Lost ⋆ ★★★★☆Alec goes to the Buenos Aires institute with Lily Chen to help Tessa and Jem with their lost-Herondale search, and ends up accidentally adopting a kid. The NYC clan has at this point lost Raphael, who… when did Raphael die, and so Elliot has to take over. Great, really charming, works as a stand-alone story better than anything else in the book. The complaint would be that it dragged on a bit, and I feel somehow like the selection of a Buenos Aires location for a specifically corrupt institute that a white person is going to save is… in poor taste. ▶ #8 Through Blood, Through Fire ⋆ ★★☆☆☆Tessa and Jem find Rosemarie again and shit goes WRONG! This is a backstory episode for the lost Herondales with some interesting elements. The issue is just that it drags a lot. Two stars for Tessa and Jem, whose presence is of course a blessing. ▶ #9 The Lost World ⋆ ★★★☆☆The Ty and Livvy moment. I like these characters and liked seeing more of Livvy as a ghost, but as a story this did not stick out to me. I think Queen of Air and Darkness was just such an exhaustingly long book that reading more about any of these characters just feels weird. Why couldn’t some of these arcs have been wrapped up in a more coherent way in 800 pages? It’s not that I’m not excited for more Kit and Ty, but having this ghost storyline as such a seeming loose end feels wrong. I’ll get over it. ▶ #10 Forever Fallen ⋆ ★★☆☆☆I just don’t like, care about the Thule Jace storyline, and I kind of think it’s dumb. I didn’t like og Jace and I don’t care for new Jace. I think that Cassandra Clare needs to stop playing out Jace and Clary angst, I’ve seriously had enough of it, and the only remotely interesting thing about Jace But Evil is his relationship with Ash. Too bad I don’t really care about Ash either. Every single line of this just made me think “calm down edgelord”. I’m so tired. The two stars are primarily for Kit, who I just really really enjoy as a character, and Jem’s ending being really really good. I also really like that Lily Chen ends up having an actual role in the future plot, especially one having to do with Rafael. It’s a well-built motivation that pays off the setup of earlier stories, and I have successfully become invested in their lifetime best friendship. This was also the story where they compared Jem’s feelings for Will to Kit’s feelings for Ty, the second time they’ve been compared to a romantic couple in this single book, and then Jem is like wow. I know My Will would be proud of me :). On an unrelated note, I’ve had enough of this plane of existence. IN CONCLUSION: The stories in this may have been a bit variant in quality towards the second half, but I adored the first half of this collection and would recommend giving it a read if you, like me, have chronic brainworms and want to see Jem on a page again.

Generally, this just felt very thrown together in comparison to the fairly well-balanced nature of earlier books. Let’s talk some details.First of all, the concept of Thule… is good. [And Melanie’s description of it as a Mad Max version of the Shadowhunters world is honestly real.] BUT it takes up about a quarter of this 900 (nine hundred) page book, and it. has. no. bearing. on the plot. until the epilogue. in which it is used to set up another whole ass trilogy.Also, what the fuck happened with Annabelle? Annabelle honestly has one of the better villain setups Cassie has ever pulled off, and the fact that she does nothing except die, and dies halfway through the book is just. It’s just a mess. I hate it. Just as in… every one of CC’s conclusions I’ve read, I think the first five chapters or so should have been incorporated into the last book. She has a tendency to set up The Final Showdown conflicts at the beginning of the third book rather than at the end of the second, which messes with her flow, leaving us with abrupt book two endings (Lord of Shadows. i loved that book but admit it, this is a problem) and lacking buildup for events in book three.Here is a simple way this couldve been done to this particular book: end it not on the note of (view spoiler)[Livia’s death (hide spoiler)], but on the note of Julian’s trip to see Magnus. This both makes the ending of book two less abrupt and, more importantly, given how weirdly disconnected some of this conflict feels, sets up an approximate book three conflict. Oh, and speaking of villains, remember how Zara was going to die and I was going to be all[image](view spoiler)[Yeah. I don’t either. (hide spoiler)]➽F A N S E R V I C E I N P SRemember back in my  of book one, when Jace and Clary’s heavyhanded but brief cameo was the most I’ve liked them in the entire canon of the universe, and yes it was fanservice but it was fun? Oh man. Good old days. This could have been The Mortal Instruments book #7, City of I Don’t Give A Shit for all the TMI presence. I don’t even know if I’m referring to stuff with earlier characters, because I actually don’t mind that too much. Magnus and Alec, two of the only characters in TMI I actually like, have stopped being done dirty finally; Jem and Tessa are two of my favorite fictional characters and I can’t even pretend to complain about their cameo; even though I never got to their minor presence in TMI part two, Helen and Aline are amazing. So maybe it’s not even about the fanservice; it’s just that the. scope. is. so. so. wide. By this, I am of course referring to: Thule, and the return of Sebastian Morgenstern and his secret?? son?? a character I will not even pretend to give a shit about. And also Emo Jace. And okay, listen, I know Cassandra Clare isn’t exactly trying to get all of her work done completely sans-fanservice: the investment in the characters and relationships is the backbone of her work, what makes it so easy to enjoy. But unlike some of her other books, this just… fell flat? It feels like the heart, the enthusiasm, the genuine love that she poured into The Infernal Devices and earlier books in this series was just... missing.➽T H E A C T U A L E N D I N GUh, so first of all, I will say that I didn’t totally 100% hate the actual ending. I just didn't really feel it was built up enough. And to me, it demonstrated just how little progress was made within this book.Here's the thing: of the three main character dynamics used for conflict within this series — Christina & Kieran & Mark, Kit & Ty, and Julian & Emma — only one is genuinely resolved. And the thing is, this lack of resolution sort of works; one dynamic is about half-resolved and just dealing with problems, and one is not even close to being resolved but they're getting a whole series written about them, so fine. But I think my overwhelming feeling upon first finishing this book was... wow, is that all we're resolving? Is that all the progress we've made? Really, in 900 pages? In that case... couldn't it have just been 500 pages?Moving on. The final battle is... sort of cool, but it is awkwardly written, and feels fairly contrived. We know something magic is going to happen at the end, and we hope it'll lead to a somewhat decent ending, but the buildup falls apart just a little on the way. On that topic: (view spoiler)[no one dying. See, I actually hate major character death, so I can’t really pretend to be upset about this, but no one really gets changed permanently by the battle, either. (hide spoiler)] To me, it just feels like this series has been pretending the ending is going to make us all sooooo sad, and it doesn't. It's a series about hope and coming together, which is great — it just shouldn't be talked about as a tragic romance, that's all. ➽I S W E A R, I D I D N’ T H A T E I TUm… I thought the first 20% or so of this book was really pretty solid? This section was also a lot funnier! Examples of this phenomenon include: ➽“and- julian is like sebastian morgenstern!” *cue Diego laughing really hard*Julian putting his boots on Horace’s desk like a legend➽“you two have really fucked up.” ➽“ever wanted to move objects with your mind?” “sure, sounds great!” ➽“who hates you? I’ll kill them!” which is just a deeply Aline thing to sayI’ve sort of alluded to this already, but the most coherent main theme of this book is the idea of grieving for the lost being a necessary process, and when that theme stands out amongst the generally muddled plot, it’s handled well. Julian’s arc around grief is nuanced and fairly well-handled; Emma’s arc has sort of always been about grief, it’s just that this book realizes it better than earlier books. Ty’s arc around grief is honestly just kind of heartbreaking. Kieran’s arc focuses more around finding forgiveness, but it feels coherent with the rest of the arcs. Alec’s arc (I know) is around worrying about eventual grief and is… honestly better than any character arc he got in TMI? SORRY. For those of you in the comments saying I’m rating generously… I mean, I guess I am. But I can’t actually give this book two stars because, as I deepdived into in previous s (#shamelessselfpromo), I like these characters way too much. OH AND. You all know I’ve been talking about this nonstop, but Mark and Christina and Kieran!! Being a canon dynamic!! I really really wanted more out of their buildup, to be honest, because it’s been utterly fantastic up to this book and felt sort of meh here, but I’m just. So so happy. That the polyamorous trio is canon. I’ve been waiting six months but the rest of you have all been waiting years so round of applause for that!!I also think, removing all critique, that juggling ten to fifteen lead characters with any degree of success is incredibly difficult, and the fact that this is even somewhat pulled off is really impressive. I mean, even putting important-in-the-future characters like Dru (who deserved more airtime), Tavvy, Dark Livvy, Gwyn (the only man i trust), Cameron, Jaime (who i dislike. just facts), Diego (who i now love!!), and Ash (??) to the side, and even eliminating villains like Zara, Manuel, Horace, the Seelie Queen, the Unseelie King, Annabel, Sebastian, and Dark Jace, and even not counting the massive presence of TMI characters like Helen, Aline, Jace, Clary, Magnus, Alec, and Ragnor Fel — several of whom have actual character arcs in this book — we still have Julian and Emma, Mark and Christina and Kieran, Kit and Ty, and Diana starring as genuine leading characters. That’s a total of thirty-one names including eight leads. Impressive as fuck. ➽E N D I N G T H O U G H T SNo one has ever accused me of being coherent. →this series could also be called Julian Makes A Bad Decision: News at 11→Everything Diana And Gwyn Have Ever Done. It’s Flawless And Good→There was a line in this book in which Aline’s posture is described as “straight,” which is something no self-respecting gay would write without making a joke. That’s not a flaw. I just think I’m funnier than I actually am.Anyway. Yes, as we’ve discussed, the entire existence of this whole world is kind of ridiculous, but I’m not going to pretend I don’t kind of love it. I just wish this conclusion had come through a bit more.looking out for:The Red Scrolls of Magic | 2 April 2019Chain of Gold | 19 November 2019The Wicked Powers | sometime, 2022dark artifices s: book one | ★★★★★book two | ★★★★★book three | ★★★☆☆Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,534,1,"Dec 05, 2018","Jan 02, 2019","Oct 27, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/13541056-queen-of-air-and-darkness

So I went through the s, and I realized what I wanted to say: it honestly amazes me that anyone is able to read this as a romance. It's quite clear that this is not meant to be a romance. even ignoring that it's quite literally about a twelve year old and a thirty-seven year old, it is made SO clear that he knows he's taking advantage of her situation and simply doesn't care? And it is for this reason I enjoyed Lolita. I think the reason I enjoyed - or maybe appreciated - this so much was I never thought the narrative was romanticizing what was going on; it was more like an acknowledgement, a book of horror meant to draw its eye. It’s a masterful use of unreliable narrator, and here - unlike in a lot of other books that recieve praise for unreliable narrator - Nabokov makes his use of this device textual. Lola’s behavior is, at its peak, the behavior of a rebellious twelve-year-old, not the behavior of the seductive, uncaring Lolita Humbert wants us to believe her to be. He has this strange pride in himself and this strange analysis of his idea, and of his pathologic ability to justify his illness; he’s replaying this episode of his childhood, in which he had consexual sex with a girl his age, as if it justifies his later preying upon Lola. He claims that she seduced him when she has not, when her behavior, though inappropriate, is essentially the behavior of an unaware twelve-year-old wanting someone in the world. And in places, his deeper mind peaks through: in the quote at the top of this page, elsewhere, when he criticizes Caroline for her hatred for her daughter, her jealousy of her daughter, her resentment. When he acknowledges Lola is only going along with his actions, to prove how grown-up she is, to prove that she wasn't lying about her sexual experience.Perhaps the only thing I sort of didn't was the ending, which I found kind of... ridiculous. I would love to read a retelling of this in which in the end, Lola kills Humbert.

Here, I just felt like the arc of their dynamic from book one was simply being repeated.I’m really into three-act structure, so here’s my recommendation: some kind of release of tension for them at the end of the first act (in the actual book, this would be when they’re in faerie); they actually get together for the first time at the end of the second act (this does occur in the actual book, but their motivations up until then feel, idk, muddied?)

This has the impact, of course, that it’s not a very plot-driven book. But for a story this character-driven, it is a brilliant choice.Sometimes, focusing on what you can control is the only way to lessen the pang in your chest when you think about the things you can't.Emoni Santiago is a senior in high school, considering the rest of her future with limited options: after all, she is the single mother to a child she had three years previous with her ex-boyfriend. But with the help of her grandmother, her best friend, a new boy at school, and a new cooking class, she might have further places to go. Emoni, as a heroine, is instantly compelling: strong, brave, but also at times vulnerable. She is unsure of her readiness to participate in either her dreams or in emotional openness, but also full of ambition. Some of the arc of this book comes in her learning to lean into her vulnerabilities, and risk things for her future happiness. Emoni’s passion for cooking is so incredibly well-written and I genuinely think it should be used as an example of how to write passion. We are so in deep with her love for cooking that we immediately root for her to live her dream; we see her talent and see her potential and see how much she wants it, but we also see the obstacles in her way, and it just makes us want it more for her. I genuinely rooted for Emoni to become a chef on a level I barely feel for like, will-they-won’t-they romantic couples. (Emoni x happiness otp.)I really liked Malachi, Emoni’s endearing bad-boy-exterior-good-boy-interior love interest. I love that Emoni doesn’t take his shit and keeps her role in the narrative; this romance is not her character arc, but one part of her development into someone more willing to participate in emotional vulnerability. It is so about her. That is not as common as it should be for female characters, even leads. Emoni’s grandmother, father, and best friend each felt like very fully-realized characters as well, and I loved seeing their interactions. Maybe it’s more than just a tale of two cities; it’s a tale of two neighborhoods. On the one hand, people are scared to come over here because they say this part of town is dangerous, “undeveloped”, and a part of me thinks, good, keep out, then. But everyone knows that the good things like farmers’ markets, and updated grocery stores, and consistent trash pickup only happen when outsiders move in.What I loved most about this book is the deep and enduring respect it gives Emoni’s dreams. It’s a book that explores cultural identity, and Afro-Latina identity, responsibility, and motherhood, and the social alienation that comes with teen parenthood. And within all that, it still allows itself to dream. Every day it seems ‘Buela is stepping back, not just giving me full rein in Babygirl’s life, but also in my own. And I know I should love the freedom, but I don’t think I’m ready for all the safety nets to be cut loose. Doesn’t she know I still need her? That I still wish someone would look at the pieces of my life and tell me how to make sure they all fit back together?The thing is, I wrote this whole  and I don't think I'm saying this right. I don't think I can properly articulate what makes this book so good. Except for this: It is a book that is enduringly real but still hopeful, and for that, it will stay with me for a long, long time.

Witchmark ended ofIt’s hard to write about the aftermath of oppression: when a system has begun to break, but hasn’t been fully slaughtered just yet. Witchmark ended off on a strong note, with the grand conflict of the world solved and a society ready to move on. Stormsong deals with what comes next. And… well, this was actually incredible. I think this was better than book one for me, honestly. Grace Hensley, sister to Witchmark’s main character Miles, is a politician to her core. She knows how to play the game, and up until recently, it’s been easy for her. In contrast to her fairly morally-upstanding brother and journalist Avia Jessup, she’s focused on her career, not doing what’s right. But… well, her world has been complicated, and her ambition no longer serves as a straightforward motive. In general, this book is endlessly interesting. After a series opener that set up a complex world with multiple conflicts, this book had a lot of dynamics to play with, and did it perfectly. C.L. Polk is genuinely excellent at writing political intrigue, something that wasn’t quite as clear in book one. It’s difficult to write a good arc for a character who has previously been a part of the oppressive system. So many of these in literature or film just feel half-assed, ignoring consequences or characterization for the sake of a quick turnaround (this especially goes for those featuring attractive white men who become love interests). But when done right, they’re wonderful—think Zuko from Avatar. The trick to arcs such as these is allowing these characters to come to terms with their role as a pawn in the system slowly, and allowing their character motivations to be redirected to a good cause. I think this arc is done exactly right, allowing her to slowly realize problems in her world in a way that feels both natural and complete. Her romance with Avia echoes that tension; Avia is a narrative foil to her, equally ambitious but pushing for justice. In this role, she pushes her to think critically. Their dynamic features some absolutely killer tension, but is also genuinely sweet. (The international implications of both the dance scene and the bed sharing scene… excellent.)When Grace is given a choice point between her own ambition and her love for other people, we believe it when she chooses. She tells Avia that she loves who she is around her; she must choose to become that.

What ensues is perFrankenstein follows Victor, a scientist on a mission to create new life from old carcasses – until his plan, of course, backfires. What ensues is perhaps fairly well-known in popular culture: the killing of his brother, the framing of his tutor, Justine, and the murder of his wife Elizabeth. With the help of his wife, Elizabeth, and his loving family, he must find a way to save not only his family, but his soul. It is amazing that such a basic plot, written in literally 1818, can be so compelling and so subversive. I DIDN'T WRITE A TWELVE-PAGE PAPER ON THIS FOR NOTHINGI analyzed this book, in my twelve-page (yes, I know) term paper, as both an anti-Romantic and pro-Romantic work, so if I can just summarize my opinion on that for you: 1) The sublime, an aesthetic category of the Romantic era that I happen to adore, is a especially key element of Shelley’s work, especially in its use of imagery. 2) The romantic reemphasis on the irrational is of course a major element of Frankenstein, yet even the creature’s being has come to pass through Enlightenment ideals – Frankenstein forms his creation through rational, scientific thought. 3) This book believes that science gets us some answers, but not all the answers – even when science gaves us the rational result of an experiment, it may still go horribly wrong. As the voice of Victor’s professor backs up: “The ancient teachers of this science… promised impossibilities, and performed nothing” (30). 4) However, one of my favorite sources instead read Frankenstein as “a critical questioning of both anti-Enlightenment Romanticism and anti-enlightenment science.” (Thanks, Kim Hammond.) In this reading, the book would be in favor of a balance between the irrational and the scientific.5) The book is very pro-getting help from other people!! Elizabeth and Henry, the ""good"" characters, both help others, while Victor, who is a dick, does nothing. This is surprising and not entirely in line with the Romantic-individualist spirit. Universalism stays winning.6) For what is arguably the first-ever science fiction book, this book has nothing to do with any romantic-era science. 7) The fact that people debate about this is perhaps a good indication of a wider truth: that the novel does not necesarily take a strong stance on how we are meant to interpret the creature. WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT DISCOURSEWriting about Frankenstein is perhaps more challenging because women of her time had very little voice. According to Jill Lepore’s piece for the New Yorker, Shelley was even forced to change her own voice for the 1831 edition: in answer to the question, as she phrases it, “how I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea,” she made up a story in which she virtually erased herself as an author, insisting that the story had come to her in a dream (“I saw—with shut eyes, but acute mental vision,—I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together”) and that writing it consisted of “making only a transcript” of that dream. When Boris Karloff played the creature in a 1931 adaptation, the formerly eloquent, sympathetic monster was not only nameless but all but speechless, too, as if Shelley’s ideas were too radical to be heard – an “agony unutterable.” To quote Jill Lepore's incredible The Strange and Twisted Life of Frankenstein:Shelley herself had no name of her own. Like the creature pieced together from cadavers collected by Victor Frankenstein, her name was an assemblage of parts: the name of her mother, the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, stitched to that of her father, the philosopher William Godwin, grafted onto that of her husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, as if Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley were the sum of her relations, bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh, if not the milk of her mother’s milk, since her mother had died eleven days after giving birth to her, mainly too sick to give suck—Awoke and found no mother.1988 biographer Muriel Spark reached the conclusion using information from Shelley’s diaries that Frankenstein was partially inspired by Shelley's own experience with losing her children. Lepore’s New Yorker article points out how close the loss of her baby was to Shelley’s first published work: pregnant again only weeks after the death of her first baby, she was most likely nursing her second child when she began writing her first novel; she would lose this second child as well only a year after publishing the book. In this reading, the monster could perhaps be viewed as her lost child, a creation born off the fantasy of bringing back the lost. Whether this was intentional subtext or not, the novel is certainly fasinated with the idea of child death: the creature’s first victim is Victor’s little brother, and his caretaker – who poses somewhat of a motherly role – is framed for her alleged role in the death and killed as a result. Justine’s ‘false confession’ of guilt over William’s death could almost be read as a representation of Shelley’s feelings of guilt over her dead baby; Elizabeth’s transitition to a “grave” (71) personality upon losing her child, her transition to no longer being “that happy creature” (71), could be seen as similar to Mary’s feelings upon losing her child. WHY DOES THIS BOOK WORK SO WELL?Frankenstein is surprisingly still horrifying in today’s world, but not in the slasher-and-gore horror movie way we are perhaps accustomed to: it is a deeply psychological read. There is a unique horror in thinking you’re safe, in thinking the storm has ended, and then seeing it rise again, in a slow descent into madness as your family dies around you, in realizing that just when you thought you were safe, everything can change. Some of the more hair-raising aspects come in small detail – that the crew of the original ship sees the creature and unknowingly let it pass is bone-chilling; that Justine is not only prosecuted and killed for the crimes of the monster, but hated by her whole family, is absolutely horrific.All of these elements to the novel are interesting. But what makes the horror of Frankenstein so compelling is this: we are not combating a mindless horror, but a tragic figure, unnamed but still deeply human.A less imaginative writer would have reduced Frankenstein to a one-note character, yet Shelley refuses this route with her characters. The creature does not lack in the fundamental humanity of us; he uses long words and is shockingly articulate; he acts on both instinctual thought and logical thought. In fact, his one desire is a mate, companionship of his own, to not remain unloved and alone and to find human connection of his own. He attempts to help the first strangers he encounters, bringing home logs “sufficient for the consumption of several days” (88) with no expectation of credit, only of making a family’s life easier. He is by nature highly empathetic, telling Victor that “when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys” (89). It is Victor alone who refuses to humanize the child; when he first comes in contact with the creature, he emphasizes his “unearthly ugliness” (83) above his humanity. This forms the character of the monster into a sympathetic character, despite his flaws; it turns the story into one of the failure of human compassion, rather than one of an evil monster.I am so sorry this was so long winded but I absolutely refuse not to use at least some of my prowess and writing from this very heavily researched term paper. The point is, whatever her intent, whatever she would say had she a further voice, it is undeniable that Shelley’s work has kept significant staying power through every medium from film to original fiction. Yet perhaps more importantly, she has created a long-discussed work in every genre from horror to sci-fi and on every theme from feminism to Romanticism. And just as it has remained a prime subject of criticism, it has remained a fantastically enjoyable book for reading.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,184,1,"Nov 05, 2018","Jan 07, 2019","Sep 29, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/543102.Frankenstein

I disliked this book because I have fundamental ideological disagreements with this book.I'm sure we all know this quote:You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You are the same decaying, organic matter as everyone else, and we are all part of the same compost pile....I think this is just a really dumb way of looking at the world. The complaints about consumerism are one thing, even though they all sound like this SNL skit. But here’s the thing: this book is woefully and irredeemably nihilistic and I am emphatically not a nihilist.I’m aware this sounds like an obvious statement, but the narrator of this book needs to get a fucking hobby. No, really. Fight Club is that one weird nihilistic asshole who thinks the apocalypse is coming because consumerism, or political correctness, or something, he’s not quite sure what, and also he makes fun of everyone for having joy in their life. Here's why this bothers me: I’m sure you’re all aware that’s a terrible way of looking at life, but I think we do, genuinely, as a society, romanticize an idea of giving up and no longer caring. I don’t hold with that. Yes, we all have dumb corporate jobs and no meaning in our lives. If you don’t have meaning in your life, go out and fucking find some. Love, or family, or a damn puppy, as the narrator so sarcastically intones: My tiny life. My little shit job. My Swedish furniture. I never, no, never told anyone this, but before I met Tyler, I was planning to buy a dog and name it “Entourage.”This is how bad your life can get.Like… he’s getting a dog and naming it a dumb name, like you do with a dog because it’s a goddamn dog and it makes you happy. Why is that so stupid?I think the reason this bothers me is I know why buying a dog to be happy is stupid, and I choose to ignore it. Looking at the world through a nihilistic eye will never make the world better.There’s another dynamic at play here - the new commonality of this language. nihilist language is the only rhetoric we hear about millenials right now? I mean, I’m sure this was a revolutionary idea twenty years ago, that none of us are special and consumerism is killing America so therefore, posessions are bad, and our current generation is awful for blah blah blah reasons. That is currently the belief of about 80% of older Americans about our generation. This book made widespread the use of term “special snowflakes” as a derogatory term (look it up - it’s true.) The idea that it is weak to care about things, weak to care about other people, or even weak to love your dog - it’s widespread. It’s not a weird deviation from social norms. Constant nihilism is a social norm; this book is thus not particularly transgressive. I liked what user Ruzmari said here:The 1990s finds us again at a crossroads where literature is concerned, with the rise of Oprah's book club and the whole genre of ""chick lit"" on the one hand (in many cases just ""silly novels by lady novelists"" revivified), and a sort of phallic-anxiety heavy-on-the-masculine literature on the other. This second group, I like to call ""guy crap.""The thesis being “life is meaningless” does not make this any deeper or any less cliche and done-before. (Oh, and since I’ve brought up the whole snowflake thing - weirdly enough, this book has absolutely nothing to do with political correctness, but it does talk about how the generation before my own was raised to believe they’d be everything. It’s so funny to me that this led to the entire criticism of “millenial snowflake” culture. People who were adults in ‘96? Isn’t that ten years off?)And listen, to the inevitable person who is going to say I just didn't get it: I really love unreliable and biased narrators. I am also not convinced this narrator, though certainly unreliable, is meant to be disagreed with. I mean, seriously, after all of that people-are-trash, our-generation-is-terrible bs for 200 pages, this is the payoff we get:“We are not special. We are not crap or trash, either. We just are. We just are, and what happens just happens.”...this is still nihilistic? Actually, on that topic, here is a compilation of fake-deep, not-that-funny, ideologically-shitty quotes from this book:“Our culture has made us all the same. No one is truly white or black or rich, anymore. We all want the same. Individually, we are nothing.”“Only after disaster can we be resurrected. It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything. Nothing is static, everything is evolving, everything is falling apart.”Yeah, whatever. I mean, I think the best things I got out of this book was a greater appreciation for the possibility of movie superiority over books and for how fucking annoying 2000s nihilism was. And from the movie, I got 1) new pop culture references that I actually understand now, 2) an interesting critique of toxic masculinity, rather than whatever this was, and 3) good acting performances. I'll just end with this quote:I have been told that I do not ""get"" you. That I do not understand the basics of a male love story, a male writer who understands the male psyche and who can convey what it really feels like to be, a male. Perhaps this is the core of my issue, being a hapless female who fails at trends. Either way, I have friends that adore you and for that reason only I will not completely denounce you on the internets. Keep appealing to your trendy fan base and keep raking in the dough. Maybe someday I will swallow my pride and appeal to the masses just like you. And James Patterson.-SourceBye, Chuck.

The wajinru - water-breathing merfolk - are the children of pregnant enslaved women who threw themselves overboard when kidnapped. Their memories, too painful to hold all at once, are held by Yetu, a deeply pained Historian finding herself repeatedly retraumatized not just by the memory, but by holding it on her own.

Wolfe made a point I thought was prescient in talking about this:The horrors of the Middle Passage, like the Holocaust or indigenous genocides, seem to both demand and resist fantasy: on the one hand, the imagination needed to even approximate it in fiction requires resources beyond those of realistic or historical fiction, while on the other, invoking the tools of SF or fantasy risks turning historical outrage into comforting myth.I genuinely really enjoyed the way Solomon uses fantasy in The Deep. It serves not as a way to erase the past, or even allegorize it, but to explore the aftermath of genocide and breathe in new life to the forgotten murdered along the Middle Passage. The Deep is a product of succeeding projects: First, a concept by Detroit electro-pop duo called Drexciya; then, a song by rap group clipping. featuring Daveed Diggs, William Hutson, and Jonathan Snipes, for NPR’s This American Life; and finally, this book. This is a great legacy of Afrofuturism, the blend of story to story to story. This is a slow one, but completely worth it.

Containing some of the best lady protagonists of recent fantasy literature, a fantastic narrative around cultural Jewishness, and such diverse fairy tales inspirations as Rumplestiltskin, Hansel & Gretel, A Thousand And One Arabian Nights, and Hades & Persephone, this book was an absolute masterpiece and one of my faves of the year. This book takes in place via an impressive six points of view: →Miryem Mandelstam – a moneylender’s daughter who takes over the job from her father. Determined, somewhat ambitious, fiercely loving towards her family, and honestly one of the most iconic characters ever. →Wanda Vitkus – the eldest sister of her family, fiercely protective of her brothers Sergey and Stepon. Her friendship with Miryem made me so emo. →Irina – the daughter of a minor lord, occasionally manipulative, trying to save herself and find freedom from her father all in one. →Stepon Vitkus – the youngest Vitkus, naive but loving. →Margreta – Irina’s caretaker, deeply caring and quietly strong. →The Starek King – definition of an ambiguous character. →Prince Mirnatius – possibly possessed, definitely ambiguous. Oh, god, so what do I say about this novel. This is a hard one to talk about because every story is so tightly and cleverly woven. The initial slow buildup of characters first struck me as a bit overlong, but over the course of the novel I came to appreciate how well built it all is. Every payoff of this novel feels so excellently payed off. Foreshadowing comes to perfect fruition; plot twists make you gasp at how obvious they seem in hindsight. It’s a tightly wound 450 pages that kept me on the edge of my seat, even when the plot itself slowed down. The other aspect, of course, is the meta-narrative around identity. But it was all the same choice, every time. The choice between the one death and all the little ones.Judaism, historically, was often seen as something devilish, a religion of moneylenders who cheat others of their money. Historically, Jewish people were really only moneylenders because 1) many Christian sects felt it went against their religion and because 2) they often quite literally were not allowed into other trades: you can read more about this here.This book uses Jewish identity as a positive identity, an identity belonging to the outsider and yet a positive one nonetheless. It is through identity, both within the context of society and as people, that these characters must find strength.And the thing is, women in this book do fall in love and care for male characters. But the narrative always puts their agency, growth and development first. Miryem, Wanda, and Irina all exist on their own, independent of men, even in points where men attempt to steal their story. Spinning Silver is, in itself, a meta-narrative about storytelling, about the distances we go to change the stories of others. Rumpelstiltskin is a bastardized tale meant to villainize Jewish people; some fairy tales we hear at night don't get it right.It is here that I will go into a brief spoiler section and discuss three elements of this book that I want to talk about but don't want to spoil y'all for.on jewish identity as a positive gift: (view spoiler)[There’s this moment from this book that I can’t stop thinking about, in which Shofer, Flek, and Tsop, Miryem’s maidservants help her in her quest to turn the three storerooms to gold, knowing that if they fail they will themselves die. One of these three has a daughter, a daughter with no name. As a sign of their love for Miryem, she asks her to name her daughter. Miryem gives her the name Rebekah, a Jewish name, specifically as a sign of her respect for the three and for the child’s honor. Jewish cultural identity as a positive gift. I honestly don’t know why this made me cry but it made me cry really hard. (hide spoiler)]on a really well-planted twist: (view spoiler)[I should have seen Mirnatius not having sold his soul coming!! I should have!! And I only figured it out... about twenty pages before it was revealed? I absolutely love this kind of plot reveal, the kind that adds another layer to an existing narrative and is so wonderfully set up for the audience to go ""oh shit, I should have guessed that"". It's possible to figure out but not obvious, and keeps its weight whether guessed or not. God bless. (hide spoiler)]on the two romances-sort-of: (view spoiler)[I love that both of the romances in this book are necessary for satisfying-conclusion reasons but are still treated with a deft hand. I also love that both romances in this book are built off men deciding they respect women who are far more powerful and good at everything than they are. Wanda is a lesbian. Also I actually liked Irina and Mirnatius... so much? That scene where they were faking marital sex... honestly one of the funniest things I've read this year. (hide spoiler)]on my shrine to the final line: (view spoiler)[“And on the wedding contract, before me and my parents and the rabbi, and Wanda and Sergey for our witnesses, in silver ink he signed his name.But I won't ever tell you what it is.”The last line of this book is the single most delightful line of storytelling text I've ever read. It's such an obvious line but when I read it I seriously wanted to drop the book from pure appreciation of how clever that was. (hide spoiler)]I also want to take a second to comment on the audiobook performance being excellent. I read the last 100 pages of this in physical copy because my loan was due back. But the way the audiobook narrator dropped her voice for Wanda and raised it for Stepon... academy award, literally. You could tell the difference in narrators so fucking fast.I don’t want to say a lot more about this book besides that I think you should read it if you like character development, strong women, calling out antisemitism within narrative, subversive retellings of old narratives, and several really excellent plot reveals. I closed this book feeling a sense of satisfaction I doubt will be matched by any other book I read this year.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,199,1,"Mar 28, 2019","Jun 09, 2019","Sep 13, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36896898-spinning-silver

So yes, Sympathizer is a spy story, but not anywhere close to a tone you’ve read before: this is a slow-paced story of black humor mixed with deep-running generational sadness, all wrapping into a story about identity. Trauma of memory, collective memory, erasure of memory, appropriation of memory, and a strange undercurrent of dark humor, featuring an anonymous and possibly-unreliable narrator who is just so compelling. This is one of the most interesting books I’ve read this year and I am honestly so happy I got to read it. Here we go.In his time in California, he is viewed as a half-breed of the “Oriental and Occidental”; in his time in the-newly communist Vietnam, parts of his confession are edited out with a blue pencil, not good enough for his new commandant. Parts of any story, be it Vietnamese or American, are edited out. He must remove the human parts, the flaws, stick to a narrative that appeals to one group — the happy but quiet immigrant or the repenter for all his American ways. So how can he find an identity that does not push him out? He is a man caught between two identities and two competing ideologies that both seem increasingly flawed: everyone wants to find a side to blame for this war. The identity of war is what dictates its representation. Vietnam, the bad war, is a tragedy for America, but only for America; in Vietnam, the Term ‘American War’ invites Vietnamese to think of themselves “as victims of foreign aggression,” rather than an oftentime perpetrator and invador of Cambodia and Laos. As a reaction, Nguyen wishes to work towards a more inclusive memory of war; this is a part of the struggle for a collective memory, where our competing views can be brought towards the ‘reassuring style of American pluralism.’ He wishes to remember the forgotten of war, the marginalized, the minor, the women, the environment. And just as essential to this is art: art endures, and art requests that we remember. “After the official memos and speeches are forgotten, the history books ignored, and the powerful are dust, art remains.” -Just MemoryWe create resignation to the horrors of the world via our art, resignation to the fact that our side is, indeed, right. Instead of a thing we come to terms with via art, memory becomes an industry “ready to capitalize on history by selling memory to consumers hooked on nostalgia.” Just memory and just representation is only possible when the demonized and marginalized can “seize industries of memory.” Without that representation of our identities, without a just memory of a war, how can we find our identities? Nguyen sums it up perfectly: “our ambivalence about war’s identity simply expresses ambivalence about our own identities.” The ethics of memory are such that without just memory, without a just view on war and a just representation of war, our own identities — especially the identities of the marginalized — will be forfeit. And it is this dynamic of identity that Nguyen criticizes throughout The Sympathizer. And this is the ultimate power of his work — to put a cynical lens onto a land of war, an industry of memories meant for no one but white men, and come out with some grain of hope, that in the face of nothing, we can find something. So overall, The Sympathizer is a question about representation. When dominant cultures so often corrupt representation to fit their preferred narrative, when the Sympathizer finds himself viewed through lenses rather than for himself, how can he find an identity of his own?

It's an excellent final conclusion to this series, but with a fantastic plot of its own. The political machinations of this are always fascinating to follow, and the portrayal of a post-war society is consistently clever. I feel the politics of this world are always stronger when Donnelly focuses more on Gedda, as the international world here has never felt entirely clear; not even including a map of your international locations is never the right move. On the character end, Lillian is more interesting than ever here, and I loved seeing her character develop more and more. Cyril and Ari's dynamic after such a long time challenges each of their character faults and is super compelling.

Because if you’re trying to do that, you’re basically trying to run away from yourself. And you can’t. You’re stuck with you, forever. Wherever you go.”Honestly… wow.Goodbye Perfect is a slice-of-life style book about a girl whose best friend runs away with their music teacher. This is a story that so easily could have been simple conflict, point A to point B, but instead, Sara Barnard makes this into a clever, enthralling story about the horror of motivation. This is not a story about solving the problem; in fact, it’s more slice-of-life. But within that context is a story about the complexities of betraying a friend, and the way in which children are taught to shrink themselves into something small. See, Bonnie is living under the watch of a mother with a very strong personality, and the academic pressure of being “the perfect one”. As a white, middle-class, abled teen, everyone is surprised by her disappearance, something Eden suspects would not be true of here. Yet she is not popular; in fact, she has very few friends. She is, despite all appearances, miserable. And as her friend, Eden struggles to know what to do about that. I liked learning this story through Eden’s eyes. This story choice works because we are not the ones seeing the romanticized views of Mr. Cohn - instead, we are the ones seeing how much Eden cares about Bonnie. Eden’s narration also works because though she makes mistakes, many of them, she learns from her mistakes and improves how she’s functioning. Eden’s trauma from her relationship with her mom is also depicted well. She has grown into a combination of a wild child and a mature human being; she is to this day not much of a crier. This is a deeply human story, and the characters just add to that factor. Connor, her amazing boyfriend. Valerie, her too-perfect adopted sister who just wants a relationship with her; her other sister, who has always been her closest confidante. Valerie’s friend Emma, who tells Eden about the tiny dick of someone she slept with. Honestly, perhaps my least favorite element of the book is that Bonnie’s mother’s characterization makes her seem like a not-great mother, but the narrative really does not do much to acknowledge this; actually, several elements of the book feel less developed due to the lack of resolution. I think what stayed with me the most about this book is this: It would be so hard not to be tempted, as a sixteen-year-old, to run off from a life that you never seemed good enough for. Bonnie is a girl who has been given an out and who takes it. And as someone who has had friends put in this situation, groomed by older men, I think the choice to focus so much on how easily that can be accepted is quite brilliant. So despite the somewhat unsatisfactory ending, I absolutely adored most of this book. A lot of characters and themes hit really close to home for me and I mean, I read it in a day.✨Arc received from the publisher via my local bookstore for an honest .

But under the fabric of late Victorian society lay wide ranges of change; the increased marriage rate and idea of the domestic sphere for women giving way to the New Woman, the upper class vs. lower class divide giving way to a new middle class. With the growth of the economy came new ideas of English excellence; with the growth of scientific thought, scientific racism. Literature, as is usual, struggles to react. With a growing counterculture in literature came the reaction to such; at the trial of author Oscar Wilde, passages from his only novel were read to prove that he liked men. Soon after, Bram Stoker, formerly his acquaintance, began writing Dracula. The result is a book drenched in fear of the unknown: In xenophobia of the time, in homophobia, and in the anxieties that come when that who embodies both appears.

Through his set of Renaissance-era conversations in Book of the Courtier, Castiglione suggests an ideal - the one way to be a man, the one way to be a woman, imitation of man after man after man. It is perhaps important to view Courtier as a work of its time; while Castiglione may likely share ideals with the participants, this is not only about the qualities of a perfect court, but about the priorities of men & women in the world they live within. One of the Courtiers sums up the level of expectation for an ideal perfectly with this list:“Therefore, let the man we are seeking be exceedingly fierce, harsh, and always among the first, wherever the enemy is; and in every other place, humane, modest, reserved, avoiding ostentation above all things…” (25)A perfect Duke must exhibit perfect duality of strength and humanity, and demonstrate it perfectly in both situations, in other words, the balance of sprezzatura. This expresses the Renaissance ideal of perfect duality: it is not good to be talented at one thing, and rather, we must all be talented in many areas. This stands as a contrast to Western culture today. While some level, we in Western culture are expected to exhibit perfection in many areas at once - for example, people are generally expected to be fairly beautiful and charismatic to be well-liked - many among our culture recieve popularity and success via only one talent. In the Renaissance, it was considered important to be all things, and flaws were not forgiven; in the US, we regularly elect politicians who are widely known to be somewhat rude. Another, perhaps more relevant, aspect of the Courtier’s discussion on Renaissance values is demonstrated here:“And just as among women the name of purity, once stained, is never restored, so the reputation of a gentleman whose profession is arms, if ever in the least way he sullies himself through cowardice or other disgrace, always remains defiled before the world and covered with ignominy.” (22)In this world, mistakes are not an accepted part of life; they are life-destroyers, leaving your name defiled forever. This, in contrast to the first point, does parallel Western culture. Recent political discourse in our culture especially has often focused on the growth of “callout culture;” the idea of calling out “problematic” - racist, sexist, homophobic, or just plain awful - things that celebrities do. This culture definitely has good results: when used correctly, it can take away from the normalization of homophobic and racist comments in our culture. But it can lead to a culture, especially on social media, of publicly shaming people for minor actions; expressing political viewpoints that may be liberal, but are not liberal enough. This can lead to people, especially minors, being afraid of behaving “badly” not because they care about the feelings of other people, but because they are afraid of public shaming - definite parallel. Another similarity comes in the idea that women may be stained more easily than men; the idea of calling out celebrities often seems to apply to women far more than it does to men, and callouts often follow them for longer. But that's another topic. So while Renaissance society is not always the same as ours, it is often similar. And while I found this book itself rather boring, I find it interesting that the past is so like the present.

This is a very sad book in verse about a girl dragged into a relationship with a much, much older man. Main strength: I found myself unable to look away. Lily’s story is so horrifying and feels strangely real, starting as if it could be an innocent unrequited crush by a 14-year-old and becoming more and more serious as Logan makes his interest clear. It perfectly mirrors the quick progression of events, and though Lily is very naive, her character consistency makes the entire book so much more horrifying. Main con: I felt the ending was a little unsatisfying. We don’t see much of her journey to deciding to tell; I think that sometimes realizations and impulsess can come quickly, so this could have been totally fine, but the book ends… immediately upon Lily’s decision. I don't know if this was the best thing I've ever read, but it was certainly an incredibly tense experience and an enrapturing way to spend my night. I think this will be marketed towards a younger audience - an audience just discovering the dangers in the world - and I'm down for it.

Villain-to-hero arc for secondary female protagonist? Yes. Ending that made me start crying? Yes. Best ya series I’ve read in at least two years? Absolutely. Court of Lions begins with Amani having recently attempted a failed action with the rebellion, and the relationship between her and Maram, the princess she has become the body trouble to, newly strained. It will take a rekindling of their connection, and their connections with the wider world, to begin rebuilding what they have. After the incredibleness that was Mirage, I was hopeful for a good book two. Amani resonated with me so very much; her relationships with both Maram and Idris were fascinating. I was especially intrigued by Maram, the delightful antivillain we only got a brief glimpse at; though her ending was more negative, the glimpses we get of her reveal a complex, dynamic character. So when this novel added Maram as a new narrator, it’s exciting. It becomes even more exciting when she quickly becomes so fascinating. Maram is a character who is terrified of vulnerability, scared that her love for other people makes her weak. When she loves, she is not what the Vathek want. She tamps the sides of her that are more like her mother into smaller stubs: redesigning a palace in her mother’s style, for example. Her arc, thus, revolves around two things. First, there is her attempt to assert her own agency. Daud does something particularly good here in making this such a wide scope. There are her attempts to break free from the control of both her father and a guardian to assert her own power, of course, which are cathartic and consistently interesting. But there is also her journey towards learning to engage with others, to befriend others as a future queen. To have power and use it fairly, she must build connections. Maram has another arc, however, which is both a fundamental part of her journey towards building connections and something altogether distinct: she must learn to let her guard down. This, of course, occurs through a sapphic romance. The romantic plot between Maram and a new falconer at her palace, Aghraas, is a highlight of the book, written in a way I found deeply gut-wrenching despite the relatively small amount of pagetime. This romance is so very well-written and incredibly well-paced; though I knew what direction it was going fairly quickly, it did not stop me from waiting with bated breath for them to touch again, think of each other again.Amani’s arc in this book is to me less about her growing and changing and more about her asserting some of the growth that she made in book one. She is still scared to help the rebellion, yes; she knows the danger to herself and others. But she also knows what she is capable of. Watching her through these conflicts is so compelling. Amani begins her journey within this book with the first time Maram needs her again: for her marriage to Idris. This scene killed me and then it revived me. Idris and Amani had me invested in book one, but this scene was such a heartfelt and awful introduction to their dynamic as a couple: their kindness towards each other, their knowledge of each other. Honestly, I just think that Somaiya Daud understands yearning, and knows that it is about the tenderness, and I am so very obsessed with the way these two romance plots were written. Though Amani and Maram are in a position throughout much of this book where they could easily be forced into fighting, they almost never do. Daud within the context of this book makes a very clear choice to focus on the love between them and grow their relationship; while there are natural setbacks, the narrative never forces any conflict between them. This makes it only more compelling to see the two of them interact with an increasingly complex political scene, bringing two different sets of talent to the table. There is an element of slow expansion to this world, with Maram’s perspective alone expanding things; the setting of her palace is textured and fantastic. Daud also, in a move that in many ways defines the book, introduces a multitude of side characters whom I quickly grew to adore. These characters are often introduced in just a few chapters, but all feel distinct and compelling, and though they each are only a part of this story, they all add: not just to the breadth of this world, but to the humanity of it. Fadwa @ Word Wonders made a point here that I want to mention: “From the outside looking in, Amazighi tribes probably look the same, similar attire, similar languages and dialects, etc… but everything is so different when you’re in the thick of it living it, our customs are so varied, our dialects so numerous and different, and I could see that in every detail of the book.”And I suppose for one other thing: the tone of this series never fails. This duology never babysits, never sugarcoats, yet it feels like a ray of light. And though the conflicts are often tense, the two novels are still each slow-burning. They feel welcoming, to you and to the characters; they feel loving. As a matter of fact, their love is what is so defining about them, as novels. “We were both hostages, you and I. And we grew up understanding that loving anyone was a luxury neither of us could afford.”This is, I think, a thesis of the book: this idea of how love under a colonial rule is too dangerous. Yet it is also the only thing that can destroy that regime. It is the friendship between Amani and Maram that truly hit me so hard about this book: it is their bond, the relationship between Amani and Idris, and the relationship between Maram and Aghraas that end up defining the novel. And when I say the ending made me cry, I’m not joking. I was holding it together just vibing and then for some reason the epilogue made me absolutely lose it. Court of Lions is, genuinely and honestly, one of my favorite novels I read in 2020. I loved the first book of this duology, but it is this book that truly solidified this as one of my favorite fantasy series of all time. I will be rereading this. I will not be shutting up about it ever. I don’t say lightly that this has instantly become one of my favorite YA fantasy series of all time.

This… hit me hard in all three categories. I have not emotionally connected to a book this much in… so long, and I kind of can't decide if I hate this and love this. So before I get into why I loved this so much, I’ll just mention objective quality and all that? Imagine Us Happy is told out of chronological level, a choice that worked quite well for the story being told; we know from the beginning that this will not end well, but we see the good parts along with the bad. It also works fantastically for conveying Stella as a character; she is so difficult not to connect with and relate to. I will readily admit that a good portion of my enjoyment of this book was that I connected to Stella, as a character, a lot. Stella is dealing with depression and a lack of support system via her parents, which has led her to seek valiation in someone who is dealing with issues but in a very, very unhealthy way. She, meanwhile, is not in a place where she realizes what is going on with her or her partner.Okay, bear with me, as this is really rather personal and something I haven’t talked about, but I don’t know how to  this book without talking about this. I was recently in a relationship with someone whom I absolutely believe cared about me, and who had very, very good intentions in pursuing a relationship. The relationship was also, though I didn’t realize it at the time, not good for either of us. And I did not realize it at all because I had not come to terms with my own fear of rejection or perhaps more accurately, as I’ve recently realized, my deep-set fear that I would become a manipulative or needy partner.So the relationship stopped being a good place for me to be, and I said nothing about it because I was desperately afraid of hurting them. I became increasingly convinced that any problems with the relationship were not compatibility issues, or their ongoing mental health issues, or anything that impacts a relationship, but my fault. There were times where they contributed to this, but I doubt it would have impacted me at all if not for my own deep-held feeling that I was destined to be a selfish and manipulative person and partner. I tried to push down my own feelings. I isolated myself from both my therapist and my friends because I was unwilling to “talk behind their back,” which began to mean no one in my life - and I do mean no one - knew what was happening in any way. My friends would have told you I seemed perfectly happy, and I got very good at pretending I was, but inside I was not at all. So I think reading this book, in which someone goes through the same thing and they're not villainized for it, meant a lot to me. I really liked that Stella eventually got through the period of the relationship via her best friends, as the support of one of my friends, and later several more, was essentially what got me through that, too. Oh, and I loved her friends - Katie of the dead frog kink and Lin the John Steinbeck fangirl were so fun. Really though, I love that these two characters feel so un-stereotyped; Katie especially immediately read as the hot partier friend, and I completely assumed I knew how she would be characterized. I did not. Katie does not abandon her friends for greener pastures, not even when Stella pushes her away completely. And Lin, despite being the more academic-oriented of the two, does not read like the nerd archetype — she reads as more of the offbeat-english-major type, which does not show up a lot, and she’s not the unpopular member of their friend group. I liked this a lot - especially as she’s Asian, this is a great way of defying that particular stereotype. Yeah, it reeks of weed, and the song “Don’t Stop Believin” has been played four times by 10:30 p.m., but chilling in her kitchen getting buzzed off beer while talking with Lin is not actually that far from my ideal Saturday night.In general, I felt that this book got high school on a level that not a lot of books do? The details of Katie and Lin’s characterization certainly add to this, but it’s the little things, too. Like, there’s a line mentioning the party transitioning to “Iris” by the Goo Goo Dolls, and I laughed so hard because wow, been there.Also, this quote so easily could have been cringey, but I laughed my ass off because t r u e:“I think it would be great if everyone understood feminism. But let’s be realistic for a minute here. How many dudes were in your class?”“Four,” I say. “Out of?”“Twenty-five,” I admit.“And how many of them were gay?” he asks.I pause. “I plead the fifth.”It’s funny - I sat on this  for so long, and now I think I should probably mention that while writing this part of my  - which took me a month of sitting on, by the way - I was thinking about how much better I am feeling, three months later, and how much that relationship taught me about my own insecurities and my flaws. And I also thought about the other person in that relationship and why we broke up, and I think... we’re both doing better now. And I don’t know if I really wish that for the love interest in this book, but I do wish that for them. And I think I felt better now, about myself, writing this , than I have in seventeen years. It’s a work in progress. But a good one. And this book understood it on a level I don’t think I’ve ever seen. ✨Arc received from the publisher via my local bookstore for an honest .

Well trained, I would have smiled so at my executioner.[image]These books are so so so much fun. [Source ]I always struggle to  books that I knew I would love and then did love, but I think I liked this even more than I expected. In a lot of ways, Thick as Thieves is far more of a typical journey novel; it’s simply a successful one because of the characters.➽Costis – disaster attempting to carry off a mission with a really annoying guy he just kidnapped. also holy fuck I am crying about this post➽Kamet – disaster trying to lowkey deceive a royal family to save his own life. selfish and he knows it. actually very compelling. Really though, Kamet’ character development is amazing. As this is a journey novel, his arc takes up a good portion of the buildup in the novel — I loved seeing him realize that his treatment was fucked up, that his enslavement was not right, and also allow himself to have feelings. I love how realistically fucked up his worldview is - his expectation that Costis will be murdered is complete bullshit but fits his character - and I really loved seeing how conscious Megan Whalen Turner was of his flawed point of view.Speaking of allowing himself to have feelings - the other main arc of this story is the relationship between Costis & Kamet, which is honestly the best. Kamet essentially stalls on escaping until he’s too attached to leave, and it is lovely, and their dynamic is so great. I will also state that it really does read in the same tenor as several romances in this series, and though it’s not exactly canonical, it’s… well, it’s very undisputed by canon. And so, along with the entire very large tumblr fandom for this series, I will acknowledge it as such. Costis and Kamet were in love. [Honestly, I think my bookstagram story said it all. Or maybe this far more articulate post.] I’ve read five books of this now, and I’ve been thinking a lot recently about why I’ve loved this series’ progression so much. I’ve landed on this quote by Megan Whalen Turner:I am such a softy. I write these incredibly violent books, and I just, I do not like to know that there’s a train wreck coming. I hate watching train wrecks. I much prefer that we just have our horrible thing, and the whole rest of the book is recovery. And although it starts in a very dark place, the whole rest of the book, things get better and better and better. That’s the kind of story arc I like. -Megan Whalen Turner I really love the sense of hope in this series, the sense I have that Turner really wants recovery, rather than torture porn. There was so much I adored about this book: the standalone-ish nature, the entire Immakuk and Ennikar thing, the constant allusions to book two, Eugenides showing up to be an asshole, the subtext getting lowkey confirmed, everything Attolia has ever done… everything, basically.

Same.This book was not bad. I like the commentary on capitalism vs. tradition. The ending of this was genuinely really good, with a great twist I didn’t see coming. However, I honestly think a lot of this story felt fairly rushed. Instead of making a new story, it rides off the energy of book one, which I found disappointing. Rather than explicitly dealing with the fallout of book one’s events, the book does very little, staying low on action until the very end. Grey’s storyline has more drama to it, primarily dealing with capitalist society. I still think Grey just isn’t nearly as interesting a character as Nedra, and their relationship storyline essentially playing out in repeat in the first half of this book did not help. Nedra, by the way, feels really stagnant in comparison to book one. We know she wants to keep her sister alive, we know she feels alone, but what kind of growth will she undergo? I felt I wanted more from her. I also think a lot of this book — and here I’m trying to be vague — depends on the reader feeling invested in Nedra’s hometown in the North. It is not at all that I don’t feel for her in this respect; on an objective level, what is happening to Nedra’s home is awful, and the parallels to real-world colonialism are clear and vital to the story. But in a story so dependent on us believing in her home existing, I craved a few developed side characters from Nedra’s home, and maybe more details on its operation and history. Bid My Soul Farewell offers an excellent ending and a good story on the whole, but the way it is conveyed feels rushed and unimpactful. I think with another editing round this could’ve been one of my favorite duologies of all time.Blog | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,106,1,"Oct 02, 2019","Oct 09, 2019","Aug 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38475566-bid-my-soul-farewell

This is a very cute novella romance between two best friends who get hitched to receive an inheritance, but end up getting roped into pretending to be married for real. Openly gay Loren is in a bit of a tough spot: she has rent due, and her only monetary resource is the inheritance of her old-fashioned grandmother (locked away until she gets married). So when her best friend Cara tells her she can’t go to grad school due to a lack of funds, Loren has the perfect idea: why not propose? The entire premise of this book is inherently ridiculous and inherently perfect for creating situations full of Gay Yearningᵀᴹ and pining between best friends, which is something I, a simple gay, want out of my romance novels. (How I feel about the friends to lovers trope is this post.) This book perfectly understands the line to be walked between cuteness and angst, the balance of tenderness.All of the issues basically boil back to lacking editing. This author’s writing is solid enough, but there were a few consistency issues throughout the book (they’re basically all pointed out here) that really do detract from the believability of the story.

Brave and stupid.” Ravus smiled, but then his smile sagged. “But nothing can stop you from being terrible once you've learned how.”Holly Black has, apparently, been crafting marvelous worlds and characters for quite a long time now. I adored this story even more than her earlier Tithe. Valiant is a Beauty and the Beast retelling following Val, who, upon running away from home, falls in with some pals on the subway. Upon running into a troll named Ravus, she finds herself falling deeper and deeper into the faerie world – and maybe in love. Everyone is completely awful, everyone makes really big mistakes, and you cannot look away.Woo! Okay. So this book was just an absolutely wild ride. Holly Black’s writing is so, so engrossing – she is just absolutely magical. The plot is twisty and creepy; you can almost feel the book getting darker by the moment, as Val falls increasingly into drug addiction and into the faerie world. The characters are not exactly likable but remain compelling; no one feels good and no one feels bad. The romance is equally compelling, with the love interest’s backstory standing out is absolutely incredible. And the book deals well with the idea of becoming haunted by a friend’s death; despite the fantastical outer layer of the story, the emotional core is quite solid. And since Holly’s faerie world is overlapping over itself, let’s talk about how well she’s crafted this universe, shall we? The idea of the seelie court vs. the unseelie court is a common one, and the concept of morally grey fairies is not new. But it’s been said before and will be said again: no one writes fairies like Holly Black. The delicious evil, mixed with bits and pieces of humanity, is somehow equal bits enthralling and repulsive. I felt the thematic core and character writing of this book was far stronger than that of Holly Black’s debut, Tithe, but her fairy writing has remained excellent from the start. “She thought of something her mother had told her when she'd finally broken up with one of her most dysfunctional boyfriends. When a man tells you he's going to hurt you, believe it. They always warn you and they're always right.”Holly Black’s love of ladies and of lady knights is consistent and honestly my favorite thing about her canon. Her female characters are so deliciously and delightfully morally gray: Tithe’s Kaye, Coldest Girl’s Tana, Darkest Part’s Hazel, and The Cruel Prince’s Jude are each very different, but they share a core of strength and willingness to do messed up things for their reasons. She writes characters who are consciously mean and consciously kind and focuses on their agency. Despite the terrible circumstances Val finds herself in, the romance of this story is built on firm ground from the lead’s side. This was one of the sequels I needed to read in 2019, so I’m excited that I actually succeeded in reading it! Onto Ironside. TW: drug addiction, and a moment of serious animal murder that made me sick to my stomach.

I honestly found these sections less compelling than the rest, but perhaps this is only because of my adoration for our newest narrator. Pheris has been given up by Erondites in an attempt to pull one over on the king, by giving him a grandson he believes to be not just physically but mentally disabled.

Now located in the Preservation Alliance, a non-corporate socialist society, Murderbot works to protect Mensah’s daughter, Amena, on a mission. But things soon go haywire when Murderbot and Amena, along with Mensah’s friends Thiago, Arada, Overse, and Ratthi, find themselves in an empty system with potential alien tech. What's a murder-robot to do? Well... shenanigans. I love it when humans forget that SecUnits are not just guarding and killing things voluntarily, because we think it’s fun. Yet again, this series is giving us a fantastic focus on the relationship between ART and Murderbot, and I'm enjoying this relationship more and more each novella. This novella once again adds complexity to their relationship and builds it into even more of a complicated dynamic, one I'm as invested in as ever. I'm also extremely excited by Amena, who is a really fun character even in her smallest appearances. I was a thing before I was a person and if I’m not careful, I could be a thing again.With a great plot built to both entertain and develop Murderbot, I loved this as much as always. I have yet to tire of this series and am hyped to read the next one.

I couldn’t finish unless I imagined a boy was . . .’ Iris did this tiny thrust, with her tiny giggle, ‘ . . .you know . . .”‘I know.’May I just ask, why, as a 30-something man, you would decide it was appropriate to write about the teen lesbian character in your book only finding sexual pleasure through fantasizing about a man? May I also ask why it is so hard to accept that some girls possibly just... don't like men? (Iris, as may not be surprising to any sapphics in the audience, is the only lesbian character in the novel, so this can very easily be seen as a representation of all lesbians, and thus enforce an already-existing stereotype.) We could also talk about the gender binary of this. And probably at some point ask, why?Because I think the point of this conversation is to say that no one is truly fully gay. Which, even if true, is besides the point when we’re talking about queer identity. Why is it so bothersome about certain people only dating people of the same gender? Even if you deeply believe all women are attracted to men on some level, how exactly is it hurting you for them to find happiness with women?The other point of this book seems to be that labels are false gods. With the understanding that I do think sometimes within the community certain people can get too hung up on labeling our sexuality down to the smallest point and more importantly, we often fail to recognize that being a broad community with different experiences is actually what binds us, I don’t agree with how this book does it. For me, labeling myself as a lesbian, or as sapphic, or as a dyke, is empowering. It’s saying that I don’t conform to norms in a certain way; it’s acknowledging that I look at the world differently because I am attracted to women, and it’s finding solidarity with other people who feel the same way. For others, labeling themselves as bisexual, or as nonbinary, or as trans, is exactly the same thing. It’s finding a way of putting into words something about ourselves that society as a whole at times alienates. I think this is what people fail to understand. Labels are used by some people as restrictions on identity. They are used by most queer / lgbtq people as a way of finding community and identity in a world that desperately wants to take that away.And it’s so sad to me that a book about two mga and (possibly) nonbinary characters falling in love was written with this in mind. Because love between queer people is so fundamentally about finding love with someone who sees you the way you are, and that is so wonderful, and I deeply resent that a book which tries to lean into that instead leans away.“We were gender and sexually fluid before it was cool because we didn’t do it to be cool – we did it to be who we truly are.”Here’s an edited version. “We were gender and sexually fluid before it was cool because we didn’t do it to be cool – we did it to be who we truly are it’s quite literally never been cool and I, as a man who apparently believes that queer kids are doing it to be cool, should not have written a book about two mga and/or nonbinary teens falling in love before realizing the dehumanizing nature with which I conceptualize other mga, nonbinary people, and the way in which I perceive the modern-day queer community as evil demons forcing everyone into boxes, which I am not aware will enforce the tendency of many, many straight people to perceive all queer people as such.” TL;DR: If I never again read a man trying to be deep by criticizing the exclusivity of the lgbtq community for an hour straight, but actually just enforcing an “everybody’s-secretly-bi-but-the-bi-label-is-bad, lesbians are fake because every woman wants to fuck men, The Gays Are Such Evil Regressive Label Policers, labels are awful and restrict you so I’ll erase nonbinary labels and mga labels to fit my narrative of how there are no labels for the in-between” view of things, I will feel a lot better about the world.

The Watchmaker of Filigree Street follows ThaniThis is a strange and very wonderful book about making clocks, the future, and also love in the 1850s. The Watchmaker of Filigree Street follows Thaniel, a local clerk who finds a watch on his person. When this watch alerts him of a bomb about to go off, his suspicions lead him to Mori, a Japanese clockmaker who is strangely kind to him. Pretty cool setup, right? We don’t get a strong sense of Thaniel right off the bat; Mori, meanwhile, comes off as ambiguous but always strangely likeable. There is also another character, Grace, who shows up and slowly becomes a part of the book’s narrative. It is weird, and atmospheric, and very interesting to see the cogs turn. The thing is that there is very little I can say about this book without at least vague spoilers, because the entire thing is a bit of a let’s-go-in-and-fuck-with-your-head-a-bit. So. If you’re okay with a spoiler for fifty pages in, you can continue this .We get the sense very early on that (view spoiler)[Mori can sense the future, (hide spoiler)] simply by an amalgation of his clear knowledge of the watch and his actions in the past Japan-chapters. And I absolutely loved how the author played with this power as something fallible. (view spoiler)[Mori can predict friendships far into the future, but cannot detect based on the fall of a coin. There’s a tidbit about Mori’s accent that I really loved – he predicts that he won’t be seeing Thaniel very much anymore, and so his English accent loses its definition. (hide spoiler)] This definition becomes one of the main conflicts of the book and is played with an extremely deft hand. There is also a romance, and I want to talk about something here. At one point in the book, Thaniel participates in a marriage of convenience to Grace, and when he alerts Mori of this, he thinks to himself that he is stealing years of their strangely-close-roommates relationship from him. At this point in the book they’re not in any type of relationship; they’re simply living together, but he still feels as if he has lost something in giving up this living arrangement.I’ve brought this up before, but I think there’s something unbearably tender about loving someone so deeply as a best friend that you don’t notice your feelings have turned romantic. With being queer comes a lack of ability to notice the difference, sometimes, and a weird penchant for falling head over heels for friends you love too much to ever ask or expect anything from. It was incredible to see that explored so explicitly. While the narrative does at times explicitly challenge racism against Japanese characters, some xenophobia within the narrative goes unchallenged; an off-color remark about kimonos is perhaps realistic for a white character in 1800s Britain, but sort of in bad taste to go uncriticized. The treatment of lady suffragettes also struck me as odd; they are treated by Grace like idiots, and the narrative does not implicitly criticize this. Grace is not on any level written to be a voice of reason within the narrative, but I did wonder about the narrative purpose of these bits. On the whole, however, I thought this was a fun and very engaging ride, and would love to read more. I honestly am not sure how to sum up why I liked this so much – it’s a book about the conflict between fate and chance, and also an imaginative clockwork fantasy, and also somewhat of a mystery, and also very Tender love story, and the finale is... Wild, and I honestly just really enjoyed this.

But other times, life changes in an instant with a lightning stroke of good or bad luck with glorious or tragic consequences.This book is weird, because it’s sort of a meta-thriller-character-exploration that has no genre and hates genre convention, and what’s perhaps even weirder is that um… this is Liane Moriarty’s brand now. I find it really interesting how Liane Moriarty’s brand has become thrillers that aren’t about the horror element, and how aware of that she is. With books like her two last, Big Little Lies and Truly Madly Guilty, she's used the thriller conceit to tell stories about the everyday horror that comes with domesticity and being a woman. I felt like she did this perfectly with Big Little Lies, but that the thriller conceit was ridiculous in Truly Madly Guilty. Here, I think she's truly leaned in to her talents for character development. The thing is that what she lacks in actual suspense, she makes up for with interesting characters and some cool messages hidden under a simple story. She remembered her first-ever boyfriend of over thirty years ago, who told her he preferred smaller breasts than hers, while his hands were on her breasts, as if she’d find this interesting, as if women’s body parts were dishes on a menu and men were the goddamned diners.This is what she said to that first boyfriend: “Sorry.” This was her first boyfriend’s benevolent reply: “That’s okay.” Frances is a struggling romance novelist going for a weekend away to try and revamp her life after another bad experience with romance. Napoleon, Heather, and Zoe are a family who seem far more perfect on the outside than they are on the inside. Zoe was arguably my favorite character in the book; compared to several other characters, she is perhaps the most rational. And while Napoleon and Heather aren’t quite as central, each has a lot of development and emotional conflict: there's this moment where they just hold hands and yet it is so amazing. The characters don't end there; Ben and Jessica are a struggling young couple having a conflict over their previous lottery win. Carmel is a young mother dealing with body-image issues after her husband has left her for a younger woman. Lars is a divorce lawyer still attempting to retroactively fix his mother’s situation and in just a bit of conflict with his husband Ray; he was one of my favorite characters. Tony is an ex-football player attempting to change his life up again. Together, they make up the title's nine perfect strangers, all trying to change their lives. And what I enjoyed the most is that all of these characters have their idiosyncrasies, and aren't particularly likable, but all manage to gain your sympathy anyway. Perhaps the novel’s biggest problem is that the thriller aspect is really nothing but a ridiculous framing device, and doesn’t actually cause that much conflict to be brought to life. This is not fixed by the pacing issues — the beginning of the novel is far too long, and while the payoff for all her setup is fantastic, I thought Moriarty could have streamlined the middle by integrating character development into the plot with far more care. The novel’s tenth and eleventh character, Marsha & Yao, both get good development, but their role in the narrative itself is somewhat overextended at times. I also struggled with the novel’s perspective on ers – a negative er for the main character’s most recent novel is arguably the book’s most personal villain. This aspect is minor and sort of dumb. That being said, the payoff truly is excellent. The book ends its chosen arcs with about eight different quality character endings, including but not limited to an amicable marital breakup that subverts expectations, a sendup of romance novels & commentary on the thriller genre that ends one couple’s story, a very sweet coming-to-jesus moment for one couple, and an excellent and very feminist ending for one woman. Overall, while bits and pieces of this didn’t quite gel, the whole was an enjoyable, entertaining read, and I’m glad I picked it up. release date: 12 November 2018✨Arc received from Flatiron for an honest .

But… I was honestly pretty disappointed by this? I loved book oneThe title of this book is. a pun and for that I rightfully should have enjoyed this. But… I was honestly pretty disappointed by this? I loved book one of this duology so much and this just wasn’t nearly as good for me. I’m going to skip introducing the very excellent concept of this series and just get right to discussing this book. The main problem I had with this book is that the overuse of asides began really grating on me. In book one there were asides to establish the world and add to characters, but here I felt like genuinely nothing was being shown; I honestly began feeling like the book was just telling me more about this world every few paragraphs with no growth or change. I politically agree with everything here so the first time this happened I was sort of like “yes”. But: 1) this is book two so I kinda knew broad details, and 2) I’m sorry but you only have to establish that the world has single-payer healthcare once. You can just say that once and then you can add details to it later. Sometimes when the doctors are talking… the audience will just like. remember that.The plot described in the blurb is cool, actually, I liked the plot of this a lot and I thought the buildup was actually better executed than book one. But the book gets to what is described in the blurb. At 55% of the way through. The first 55% of this book is spent building up to the A plot and spending time making you worry about the B plot, which is fine, but… I think this could’ve been improved by editing down the first half (see above) to maybe 75% of its current length. And then spending extra pagetime in the second half (which is far more streamlined and thus far better) on giving the B plot an on-page resolution (as it is currently resolved offscreen). I am trying to be very unspoilery about what each of these plots are, but: I loved the B plot and I really wanted that to get more of it in the second half. The plot of this book… is actually good, eventually. It’s just that nothing really happens until the 60% mark. By nothing really happens I unfortunately do not mean that there is no plot but heavy character development; I mean that both characters and plot begin moving very, very slowly. In my  of book one, I wrote this:the plot was hovering somewhere around “just good,” the character dynamic is so completely 20/10, and I adored all the themes and various existential tensions so much that I just can’t not five star this.The thing is that here, I felt that no themes or existential tensions or characters were actually changing. The character moments themselves are great — Janet in particular gets a lot of pagetime dedicated to her PTSD and I liked that — but it. just doesn’t quite lead to growth. The whole novel feels like the too-long first half of an excellent character arc.The relationship between Holmes and Watson, in particular, is just crying out for character growth on both their ends. And I know this is petty but: the fact that they are separated for half the novel seriously fucked with my interest. Like yes, it works narratively, but I am reading this book 65% because that dynamic is so well written. I also… I don’t particularly know how to identify this, but I sort of wondered about the reaction of black readers and ers to this book? I read book one solidly thinking it was written by a black author and was honestly quite surprised to discover the author is white. The author is clearly extremely well-intentioned and I know she has done research, but I wonder how black readers might feel.This was not in any way an awful book or even really a bad one: there were still a lot of moments I enjoyed, the last 25% has some solidly great writing, I read the last 60% in one sitting so clearly I was engaged, I liked the romance plot a decent amount, and I still am super invested in the lead character and the dynamic between the two leads. I just think this needed more editing, frankly.Thank you to Harper Voyager for the arc — I received no compensation to read or  this.

Following Arthur Less, a writer down on his luck, as he travels around the country to avoid the wedding of his ex, who is also his one-time-rival Carlos’s nephew. Things do not go as planned. Ever. Add in a complex relationship with a literary-genius ex and the question of the past vs. the future. The writing of this book is both incredibly humorous and incredibly real: it’s a book that is at once deeply funny and deeply sad. The shifts in tone make the book as a whole feel more honest, more real. I also absolutely love the meta-commentary on Odysseus, personally. Arthur Less is a low-selling author of one famous novel: an Odyssey retelling. In Less’ Odyssey retelling, though, the lead leaves his lover for his wife at the end, because that is what Less believes about the world: that love does not work out. Less is in itself an Odyssey retelling in which Arthur is Odysseus, traveling the world (view spoiler)[to return to the person he has loved all along (hide spoiler)]. He has never seen another gay man age past fifty, none except Robert. He met them all at forty or so but never saw them make it much beyond: they died of AIDS, that generation.A major focus of this book is Less’ fear of aging, and more specifically aging past his desirability. It takes a long time to parse through his deeper fears: Less is afraid to be happy with Freddy because he feels he wasted his own life with Robert; he doesn’t want a younger man to be his person, because he was that younger man. He feels Robert was the love of his life, so how could he have another one. The thing is, though, the age contrast between them wasn’t actually the problem in their relationship: it was that Robert was the genius, and Less was the non-genius. It is our duty to show something beautiful from our world. The gay world. But in your books, you make the character suffer without reward. If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were a republican.I wrote about 90% of this  and then found out that audreyhheart on Tumblr had made a bunch of these same points, but I also loved this: that Freddy is the only character in the book who isn’t an artist and the only one who untangles Arthur’s self worth from his work. It's sort of a critique of the way in which artists are tied to what they produce: the talent, rather than the joy. Twenty years of joy and support and friendship, that’s a success. Twenty years of anything with another person is a success. If a band stays together twenty years, it’s a miracle. If a comedy duo stays together twenty years, they’re a triumph. Is this night a failure because it will end in an hour? (s the sun a failure because it’s going to end in a billion years? No, it’s the fucking sun. Why does a marriage not count?The thing is we live in a world where life sucks and people suck but we’re all able to come together to reach in the dark for love. And it’s so important to discuss the tragedy but it’s also important to discuss the romance, the small moments of human connection to be found in the ridiculous. Love is brilliant. Happiness isn’t bullshit. The thing is that it is so easy to give up on love, or happiness, because it does not feel like the right choice. But it is worth it, sometimes, to risk the expected for real happiness.

Caught in politics between Cardan’s Seelie Court and the Unseelie Court of Teeth, she must attempt to hold herself and Taryn together against a person she never wished to see again. This is a third book so it’s a bit awkward to describe every significant detail that resonated with me. If you came here for a roundup of my thoughts on character, plot, etc, next section. And if you have read the first two books, and just came here to remind yourself what the hell happened last book, go with the last section. Aspects I EnjoyedOkay there was actually a lot I enjoyed about this novel. →JudeIf I continue the way I am, will I become like Madoc? Or will I break?Jude is… okay, I cannot even explain how interesting Jude is as a lead. Jude is so cold and so ruthless in comparison to a lot of YA heroines I have seen in this era of literature. Her emotions come through in small moments, which makes it all the more satisfying to see her grow. Her power plays never stop being neat to me. I love this ambitious bitch so much. →CardanThere is no banquet too abundant for a starving man.Okay, just to be totally real, I disliked this character a lot during the first book. But I think I like this character’s arc. Cardan started off as such a frustrating character, but I enjoyed the slow growth of his character arc. And I strangely enough enjoy this romance. When he tells Jude, “Unlike Locke, I never thought love was a game. You may accuse me of much but not that” the Implications..... I enjoyed Jude’s speech about how she and Cardan get each other because they both feel shame about heir tragic backstories and have covered it up by not having feelings.I often really struggle with this trope—the asshole love interest thing was very much not conceptualized with gay women in mind—but I think what I enjoy about this dynamic is that Jude is the one in control. In a lot of ways, The Cruel Prince is a story about power, and Cardan, who initially and by appearance has most of the power, is often rendered powerless by the narrative. That is what I find so interesting and compelling about this romance. →Taryn“It really is a magical word: no. You say whatever bullshit you want, and I just say no.”Taryn’s character development in this novel made her… dare I say it? Interesting. Much as I know she’s disliked quite a bit, and I understand why on a personal level, Holly Black has built this character into a complex and dynamic one. Taryn has a legitimately satisfying arc that allows her to grow and change without being either easily forgiven or easily dismissed. Her actions in this book are, dare I say it, fascinating. →Vivi“It’s ridiculous the way everyone acts like killing a king is going to make someone better at being one. Imagine if, in the mortal world, a lawyer passed the bar by killing another lawyer.”Vivi, Jude’s oldest sister, felt really well-fleshed out during this book. Her arc with Heather gets resolved in an interesting way and I frankly just felt good about this. →The VibesOOH okay there were a few aspects of this book I wanted to draw attention to. First of all, Black is incredibly good at writing scenes that are just a little bit off. Not horror, exactly, but something close to it. The visceral horror of the dream scene was especially memorable here; a certain scene with Taryn also lives in my head a bit. A few scenes, including (view spoiler)[It’s revealed the Ghost betrayed her because he gave Locke his true name, which is a neat little twist. I adored Cardan and The Roach saving Jude, and this entire scene was really dynamic. (hide spoiler)]Aspects I DislikedHm... okay. I wanted more from Jude in this book. I thought her decisions were at times mediocre to bad, which is frustrating, because one of her defining character traits is that she's a great schemer. I liked that a lot of the areas where she fails were challenging distinct character traits, but I wanted a bit more of her succeeding as well. The much much bigger issue is that this book feels like it lacks the meat of books one and two. I honestly suspect that Queen of Nothing was just too short to truly convey the level of intrigue and drama that I've been enjoying for the rest of the series. So... I missed that. I guess I also felt most of the emotional directions of this book were a bit more predictable, which isn't a bad thing in terms of wider series plot, but definitely impacted my personal enjoyment of this one. Maybe I should simply admit that I am doomed to never enjoy series finales nearly as much as the rest of the series. (No, truly. I always like the middle book best in trilogies, and I don't agree that middle book syndrome exists, and this is a hill I will die on.) Overall though, please do not be fooled. This was good. I enjoyed reading this. Spoilery SummariesIn The Cruel Prince:(view spoiler)[Jude joins Dain’s Court of Shadows spy ring. She also brutally murders Valerian, despite the danger to him from Dain. The book ends with the court going up in flames as Balekin interrupts Dain’s coronation to wrest power for himself, helped by Madoc, who kills Dain. When his siblings refuse to assist in his coronation, Balekin needs to find Cardan. It is revealed that 1. Locke was only toying with her to prove that Taryn really loved him, and 2. Oak is not Oriana’s child, but Liriope’s—the woman Dain killed over a prophecy their child would take the throne. Jude gets to Cardan first, forcing him to swear himself to a year and a day of service to her. Jude then uses her self-poisoning to Princess-Bride Madoc into unconsciousness, which was extremely sexy of her. And then she tells Cardan she’s going to crown Oak, before commanding him to kneel and be crowned. So… in essence she games everyone into accidentally making her the most powerful person in their world for a year. I forgot how good The Cruel Prince is. (hide spoiler)]In the Wicked King:(view spoiler)[Jude has Cardan ensorcelled for a year and a day, and things are going… fine, but so delicate. Cardan tries his best to wield what little power he has. Jude kills Balekin, Cardan’s abuser, for Roiben. Meanwhile, the Ghost betrays the court of shadows. Oh and the finale was INCREDIBLE. Many other things happen but I just really want to publish this  now. (hide spoiler)]IN CONCLUSION: I really enjoyed this book, though as a single entity I did not enjoy it quite as much, and I am excited to have finally finished this series. Now on to more Holly Black. Probably.

One criminal, one southern belle, and the only dynamic the authors could think to put between these two women was a love triangle. Which I found very disappointing. And the modern-day plotline is downright boring. We’ve established a conflict between which of these historical women will make it out and which will either die / not get the guy, but the modern-day character has barely any influence on the plot. Not a fan. Of course a book can work despite a somewhat tropey and trite plot, but I found myself very uninvested in the characters, despite getting 180 pages into the novel.

The amount of clave-dragging in here…… I’ve been waiting for literal years. And though I think this becomes much more clear in book two, it’s clear from the beginning that hate is about to be the villain. “This is why fairies are despised, this senseless cruelty.”“Careful, boy,” said Gwynn. “You have your laws and we have ours. The difference is that we do not pretend ours are not cruel.”Lady Midnight follows various characters and plotlines, most notably including our Forbidden Romantic Plotline, our The Cold Peace Is Terrible plotline, and our Julian Gets Repeatedly Fucked Over By The Clave plotline, but every plotline has a common villain: systematic prejudice. Also, can I just say: I can’t believe the main villain of this series is a Donald Trump allegory. ➽E M M A A N D J U L I A N✔Emma Carstairs - a literal ICON, invented big dick energy✔Julian Blackthorn - definitely would kill a man for his own selfish motivations but listen… he's in love with Emma, that's too relatable and therefore i can't hate him[image][source for both]I literally love that the main couple of this is a reversed bad boy / good girl who’s maybe turning evil dynamic. It’s this strange dynamic because this author feeds into this trope, and seeing such a conscious subversion of that ideal in her work was incredible. There’s this one line where the female lead is like “oh this is his first kiss meanwhile I’ve slept with like 20 people but that’s okay it’s us” and I was SCREAMING I can’t believe this book killed slutshaming. Anyway, I love this so much I’m obsessed with it. Also, their relationship is so tense. Like, the mutual pining is too good. Also, please let me just share this meme I’ve been laughing at for three years:[image]I will actually admit that I did not like Emma and Julian’s dynamic… quite as much in the next book, which I talked about in my ? BUT OH WELL.➽K I E R A N, M A R K, C H R I S T I N A ✔Christina Rosales - an ICON, a blessing to my life………. I love that she’s close platonic friends with Emma and they never feud, I love how much she asks for herself and how unapologetic she is about her life, I just relate to her a lot and I hope she’s happy forever✔Mark Blackthorn - my boy, my man, the bi icon we deserved. I actually loved his entire reintegration arc so so so much and I adore that he’s trapped between two worlds but still doing his best to get back within his home. too good we did not deserve him✔Kieran of the Hunt - did anyone try the chicken? I thought the chicken was lovely. book two Kieran is the superior Kieran and that’s my discourse for the day. [image][source for both]I’m sorry, but if we’re going to talk about Cassandra Clare redoing constructs from her own work in a different way: the three-sided love triangle of Kieran and Christina and Mark. I will not be elaborating on which dynamic this echoes at this time. In other news, I cried twice during this book, and both times it was about - you guessed it - Mark and Kieran’s backstory!! They didn’t have to do me like this. (view spoiler)[Kieran didn’t have to do anyone like this. INCLUDING ME that line where he was like “I cannot bear it” Kieran can’t lie he’s not lying he literally means that. in other news I fucking hate this (hide spoiler)]➽T H E B L A C K T H O R N S✔Diana Wrayburn - genuinely one of my favorite characters from this series and i have NO IDEA why she’s so slept on. i mean, it’s not like anyone hates her, but i would like you all to be screaming about Diana for 40 hours per week as i do? this is a full-time Diana love zone. i love my canonically trans wife✔Taavy Blackthorn - he’s ten and i’m pretty sure ten year olds don’t have personalities. pure. ✔Dru Blackthorn - I would fucking die for Dru she’s too legendary. also, she’s plus-sized and the narrative is so good about it. ✔Livvy Blackthorn - a small bean doing her best and it’s just not very good.✔Ty Blackthorn - deliciousfinallysomegoodfuckingfood.gif it is really, really depressing how few books have canonically autistic characters who are not essentially used as jokes, but here we are. ✔Kit (view spoiler)[Herondale (hide spoiler)] - chaotic bisexual. i have a tumblr post to share about this involving the phrase “token straight family member” but unfortunately, spoilers. (view spoiler)[what is up with this whole plot twist about someone being a Herondale motif. (hide spoiler)] In case you haven’t noticed, I love the Blackthorn family. The dynamic of the siblings with Julian is absolutely the best, and their mutual love and support for each other means so much to me. “You pointed a knife at me.” “It wasn’t personal.”Soooooo, Ty and Kit had two separate meet cutes in this and both of them were the best thing I’ve ever read. They definitely get more development in book two, but Kit’s joining-the-Blackthorns arc, even here, was absolutely the best. Basically, I really wish I could continue to be emotional about the Blackthorns forever.➽O T H E R C H A R A C T E R S✔Diego Rosales - not nearly as perfect as the marketing would indicate but I actually him?✔Annabelle Blackthorn - a very very interesting character of book two. ✔Zara Dearborn - a very very awful character of book two. fuck off, Zara. I think we all know Cassandra Clare is really into the overlaps between worlds, and I’m honestly… here for it. Jace and Clary’s cameo is the most I’ve liked them in the entire canon of the universe. Jem and Tessa showed up for three pages and it was my favorite thing I’ve ever read. There was some line about the Carstairs “owing the Herondales” and I feel like that’s the exact opposite of TID canon but okay? also, I know I’m a bitch, but Tessa and Jem were not in book two, and I think that makes it a bad book, personally➽S H U T U P, E L L EANYWAY, the point is, I really enjoyed this book, and so far I'm really enjoying this series.

So this book is a love story, but not the love story you expect. One of the narratives I’ve heard about this book is that its intermingling of the world and of the romance feels muddled, and I understand that; however, for me, this intertwining made the book feel more real. I liked the contrast between this really personal story and a broad story. Life takes many forms. Because Exit West is a love story between two people, but also a love story with the world. It’s a book filled with the idea of love taking many forms, and Nadia finding a girl as her happy ending, people finding people of different races and genders: it subverts our expectations for what’s coming. I see this criticized a lot for its strange optimism through despair. I will grant that I tend to adore this kind of hopeful story, but I’m also going to say I think this optimism is the point. And through the strangely optimistic dystopia of Exit West, there’s something incredibly transgressive being said about the world: “Part of the great political crisis we face in the world today is a failure to imagine plausible desirable futures. We are surrounded by nostalgic visions, violently nostalgic visions. Fiction can imagine differently.... We certainly need it now. Because if we can’t imagine desirable futures for ourselves that stand a chance of actually coming to pass, our collective depression could well condemn humanity to a period of terrible savagery.” -Mohsin Hamid, The New YorkerIt’s a very personal, down-to-earth story about a major, wide-world subject. In the first chapter, an adorable story of a student attempting to ask out a cute girl as the city falls apart. In the second chapter, a strongly humanized immigrant accidentally creeping into the home of a strongly humanized australian family, not to disturb, but to move on. He presents a global narrative, but doesn’t present the story as a political one. He uses magical realism to criticize the nationalistic, broad-strokes manner with which we see the world, to engage with topics that in a “real” world, we would not accept. It’s a book in which the beauty of nature is intermixed with the beauty of humanity, in Marin and the London Belt. We don’t think of a love story as growing apart, but for Nadia and Saeed, this is not a love story with each other - this is a love story with the world, with our cosmopolitan earth. Cosmopolitanism, in this novel, is a mindset, something which Saeed must find in those of other faiths, which Nadia must find in a kitchen and a tall cook. And Saeed and Nadia, despite their moving on, do not hate each other. They take long walks on the beach and they think of each other fondly, because that is how the world works. We see love in so many forms - in Saeed and Nadia’s relationships with each other and with other people, in the two elderly men who share art and find their humanity together, and in the love story with the world. We see migration in so many forms - yes, there’s the the migration story of Nadia and Saeed, but interludes such as the maid’s interlude, towards the end, presents an idea of the optionality of leaving. I want to end this with a question to think about: 1) I hold with Hamid’s views on immigration, and 2) I think his method of demonstrating his views is such a fantastic example of what makes this book so powerful: “I personally tend to believe that there is a right to migration in the same way that there's a right to love whom you like, to believe what you believe, and to say what you want to say.” -Mohsin Hamid, NPR Morning Edition65 million refugees is such an easy number to trot out, to put in place of faces and names and humanity. But all 65 million of those people have a family. All 65 million have friends. All 65 million have a past, a home they came from, even a temporary home. All 65 million have hobbies and love and romance. And I think Hamid’s main point is to humanize that, to humanize every refugee and every journey.in conclusion: Mohsin Hamid's version of the world, and of human beings, is so real and flawed and yet so hopeful, and the endings aren't perfect happy endings, far from it, but there is something beautiful and real in the imperfection.

I don’t know where I even got this idea, but it’s there.”A gorgeous dark fantasy set in 1920s Mexico inspired by Mayan mythology, featuring a fantastic smattering of Mexican history and a god's heart. In Jazz-age Mexico, Casiopeia Tun is trapped in the home of her disapproving grandfather. That is, until she accidentally releases Hun-Kame, Mayan god of death, from his brother's prison. Helping him could mean her death, or it could help her find her freedom. As they journey from the small town of Uukumil to the darkness of Xibalba, land of the dead, they find that the stakes can sometimes mean danger. I have two main praises for this book: 1. Utterly wonderful setting. Silvia Moreno-Garcia has an incredible talent for building a world that feels just as beautiful as it is terrifying. The journey carries the protagonists through Veracruz, to Mexico City and El Paso, to Tijuana, and each city brings with it a distinct history and culture. The design of these secretaries is fantastic. 2. The dynamic between Hun-Kame and Casiopeia. I just found this relationship so deeply affective. It builds slowly, based around true friendship; it feels shockingly grounded in real love and care, even as Hun-Kame and Casiopeia consider fates of the world. And that is why it works so well. Gods of Jade and Shadow is fundamentally a book about the value of mortality, and the value of freedom, even in a world ready to take it away.

I feel like Agatha Christie is just very consistently good, but that might also be that I’m exclusively reading her books that have been recommended to me? Christie is excellent at taking a similar structure - crime committed and investigation ensues - but making each case distinct and clever enough that the story is compelling. We know the beats of this story; we know that at the end, we’ll have a nice detective reveal, and it’s always fun to see more.I will say that this kind of made me want to punch Poirot in the face sometimes and I feel bad because I liked him so much in Murder on the Orient Express.

We’ll talk about it. Never Contented Things follows two foster siblings who are in love, or so they think – no, this is not romanticized – and their journey after one makes a deal with faerie. So, yes, the first half of this book is deeply fucked up, but that’s the point: we see these characters hit their lows and we are forced to empathize deeply with the situation they’ve been put in. Josh and Ksenia’s relationship is based on intense codependency, one where they have been forced into a mutual relationship based on necessity; the narrative does a frankly impressive job of showing this while still sticking in what the characters actually feel about each other. By 50% through, you’re rooting for both of their characters (in very different ways) but actively rooting against their relationship. Also, you are very fucking terrified of the faeries. The reason this probably shouldn’t be a five is that I actively did not enjoy reading the first 20%, and indeed struggled with a lot of this book – you read because you’re almost too horrified and scared for these characters to look away. I do get why the average rating is somewhere around a 3. It’s not a fun novel. This novel was also marketed, as I believe my er friend Acqua pointed out, somewhat poorly — Never Contented Things is asking for a very certain type of reader, I think leaning older teen and new adult demographic, and is certainly not a book that should be placed on read now on Netgalley. I also have noticed that a great percentage of the bad ratings are readers who DNFed this and rated it one star, which is perfectly fine — it’s just that this has dropped the rating pretty damn far. The reason this is, for me at least, a five, is that it is frankly one of the most emotionally cathartic novels I’ve ever read. Here are just a few things we should talk about in regards to this book: ➽gender as it plays into self-image➽the idea of only loving what you want to see in someone➽the fact that one of the plot points is essentially about the mortifying ordeal of being known and it made me cry➽rape culture and the way in which Ksenia’s character has closed herself off due to being an unspoken victim➽the degree to which the narrative works against romanticization of self-harm➽the narrative’s focus on healthy love as not something revolving around ownership➽the sheer tenderness of loving someone as your best friend before your crush and being willing to sacrifice a lot for them simply because you love them without it mattering how or whether they love you back ➽the idea that no matter what your past is you can always find your way out. I’m going to really unpack all of these in further depth because I honestly just… have so many feelings about this. But if you’re already intrigued and want to avoid any possible spoilers, please do just go read it yourself! Seriously. It’s one of the most wonderfully well-written narratives I’ve had the pleasure of reading, go buy a copy, etc. Ksenia is a character who projects, to the outside world, being very comfortable in her identity. Actually, she dresses androgynously to the point where characters mistake her for a boy (also, every description of her outfits within this book made me cry she’s such a legend). But inwardly, she’s not there for herself at all, not yet. There’s a plot point in this book involving Ksenia’s inner selves being captured into tiny bodies and being used to create the upstairs of her and Josh’s house (it’s terrifying and I’m such a fan of it). And neither she nor Josh can get more than two steps on the stairs to the upper floor. This makes sense, given that Josh doesn’t want to see who she really is; it’s just that she doesn’t want to see who she really is either. The truth is that Ksenia is dealing with a lot of trauma from being sexually assaulted, something she has refused to allow herself to truly process because no one has given her the space to process what happened to her. You’re still real enough that I love you.We need to talk about the sheer fucking power of the other main relationship in the book, between Ksenia and Lexi. Lexi is Ksenia and Josh’s friend; she’s black, has had a steady boyfriend, and has grown up in a fairly stable environment. To some degree, she has historically been Josh’s best friend. But she also loves, and has always loved Ksenia. There is something very wonderful to me about the way in which this relationship is conveyed. The reason Ksenia is willing to trust Lexi is because Lexi respects her boundaries and does not see her as a sexual object; that’s not anything Ksenia is willing or even able to give at this point. The two of them love each other as friends do and also as lovers do, but they’re willing to fight for each other whether the other loves them back or not. And though they eventually self-actualize and define how they love each other, they put each other’s boundaries first. Okay, bear with me. When Josh attempts to seduce Lexi into the faerie world, there’s a moment where she walks up Ksenia’s stairs and tells her she’s not afraid of what’s inside and Ksenia subconsciously lets her, because Ksenia wants to let her in. There’s this one line Lexi says to Ksenia during this scene that is just… the most tender thing I’ve read in my entire life, and you don’t even think they’re going to be a thing at this point, but I fully teared up. It’s a scene 50% of the way through and I am in love with it. So there’s that. I think I tend to be really sensitive to the idea of saving yourself for another person, or love solving personal problems. Which is why I so deeply appreciate the degree to which the narrative works against romanticizing Ksenia’s self sacrificing nature, even when it is technically what saves the day. Ksenia is someone who cares deeply about other people partially because she struggles to value herself on a deep level and considers herself on a lower level than other people, but this is written as a clear part of her characterization, not as a factor of just how in love she is with Josh or with Lexi. Like… chef’s kiss. I also think using sapphic love as a force for good in any literature is, on some level, a revolutionary decision. Even in literature of today, queerness is so often framed as baggage, something that makes it harder to live a full and fulfilling life. In this book, queerness is a pathway to (subtextually) identity and (textually) to healthy love. That is such a major shift. But what’s perhaps even more meaningful about this book is that it ultimately decentralizes romance as a path to recovery, while still emphasizing that anyone can come out alive from a traumatic past. Ksenia and Josh spend much of this book in a toxic relationship that each believes will on some level save Ksenia, or fix her. Josh’s approach to love is one tied in with ownership of identity, with owning who Ksenia is as a person. And without hitting you over the head, while still allowing the audience to connect their own dots, Never Contented Things subverts that narrative time and time again, allowing its characters to grow without romantic love as a savior. Look. I know I’ve gone on about this book for a very long time at this point, but the main point is: I don’t think I’m going to be able to get these characters or these ideas out of my head for a very, very long time. This was so scary and so wonderfully cathartic and I know I’ll be reading Sarah Porter’s next book. TW: discussion of rape and sexual assault, incest between foster siblings (criticized), codependency (criticized), parental neglect, some really terrifying body horror, death on page.

But on a quest to save the city of Bataanar from a mysteriously powerful naga dinosaur, she meets Rider, a mysterious rider of their own naga. There is a lot of praise to give to the Tensorate’s incredible worldbuilding, strong writing, and compelling character dynamics, but to be completely honest: Mokoya’s character just blew me away. I grew so incredibly close to this character, and their relationship with Rider, in just 200 pages. We get far more into Mokoya’s head than we did in the previous novella, and I genuinely adored every second. Mokoya has been running ever since the death of her daughter with Thennjay. In order to save Bataanar, she needs to process her own grief. I found myself understanding every word of her experience. I can't wait to read the next book.

It's just...are you for fucking serious?This Adventure Ends follows Sloane, a high school loner who falls into an unlikely group of new friends. There’s Vera, an instagram influencer; Gabe, her twin; Remy, Sloane’s new lab partner; Aubrey, his ex; and Frank, the neighborhood party host. So, in other words, Sloane is essentially a loner, and has never had friends before, and her new friends open up her heart. This could probably be cheesy, were it not for the fact that this was, in fact, my senior year experience. I mean, obviously I didn't try to buy back a painting for my newfound friends, and my father didn’t write metaphor-for-Teen-Wolf fanfiction. But you get it. I always forget how incredibly funny Emma Mills is until I read any book by her, first of all; legitimately don't know any other authors who can write such consistently entertaining dialogue without it sounding fake. Dialogue is funny because of who says it. Her characters’ style of communication realistically varies: Vera types in simple sentences with returns, while Sloane types like she speaks. It’s tricky to balance heartfelt with funny, in young adult lit: I think so many books I’ve read have fallen so far into being sad, and emo, that they forget to be entertaining. Emma Mills never falls there. Her books are nerdy, and fun, and endlessly entertaining, but always have deep-seated heart. A heart that hit me really hard.Going into my senior year, I kind of… had never allowed myself to admit I had close friends? Even when I’d had close relationships, I’d consistently given into the fear that I wouldn’t be liked. So watching Sloane feel that same way, and play the constant game of loving too hard, but not wanting to say it because she knows if she pushes too hard they’ll give up, and all the while finding genuine happiness with those same friends… I got this, and it hurt me. This just reminded me of my friends, and how out of place our meet-cutes could’ve seemed, and the ways in which our weirdness draws us together. This summer, my friends and I have hate-watched Too Hot to Handle, talked extensively about Dragon Age, made extensive fun of horrible content on Ao3, played dungeons & dragons, read tarot, trawled through Spotify at three a.m., taken thousands of uquizzes, and started a group chat for Bachelorette theories. If you said that sentence to me in sophomore year I probably would have locked myself in my room forever. Now, it just makes my heart hurt with how much I want to hug all of them. It’s not a perfect book. Building such a large squad led to sacrificing giving several of the side characters’ arcs; while all members of the squad feel like real people, all feel one step away from an excellent character arc. The romance was particularly out of nowhere. Cute, and it worked, but a little out of nowhere. I definitely preferred my first Mills read, Foolish Hearts. But overall, Sloane’s arc and the excellent humor won me over, and I’m excited to continue on my Emma Mills journey. Which... will happen. With less than a year's gap. Promise.

In a post-apocalyptic Western society, people who don’t fit are a class all to themselves: some are hanged, like Esther’s old lover Beatriz. Some become librarians. This novella is an excellent exploration of the politics of otherness: of the ways in which those who do not “belong” learn to live at the margin of society, to make their own rules. This becomes specifically relevant with Bet and Leda, a lesbian couple, and Cye, who is nonbinary. The idea of queerness as a marginalized identity is wonderful. Oh, and the tension between Cye and Esther is excellent. There’s this sense of push and pull between them: the conflict between Esther’s newfound rebellion and her intense feeling that any feelings she has not for a man are wrong makes watching her pine after Cye satisfying and interesting. Gailey conveys the world mostly via dialogue and occasional hints, creating a seamless transition between your brain and the space of the novel: it feels as if you have always been a part of this world. I at once wanted to see more and was happy with the ambiguity; the novella focuses on character, and doesn't get bogged down by intense worldbuilding. I don’t know if I’m going to remember this forever; it was mostly just really, really fun. But I loved my reading experience and would definitely read this again. Basically, I second Tor's blurb:What Sarah Gailey's upcoming novella lacks in hippos, it makes up for with queer librarian spies on horseback.Blog | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube | About |...more",Notes are private!,0,134,1,"Jul 24, 2020","Jul 26, 2020","May 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45320365-upright-women-wanted

They’re not true.”Oh my god, I’m so sorry if this is like… an unpopular opinion or something, but I love Tessa so much. She’s such a quintessential female character that got ignored because Hot Guys and she deserves better, and if I see any Tessa Gray hate on my timeline I will throw several hands. I fucking love Tessa and she has never done a single thing wrong in her life. She is simultaneously a gentle soul and one of the most savage people in the world and I absolutely adore her. I still love and would die for Jem; he’s a very pure and good soul. He made a lot of really dumb decisions in this book, and I am mostly not annoyed by them because they’re in character for his stubborn personality.Also, Will is an annoying person, but he’s my annoying person. Actually, guys, I really love Will, which “me after book one” would not have classed as something in my future. His development in this book especially is so good, and I trust him, and I love him. LET’S TALK SIDE CHARACTERS.✔Honestly, don’t kill me for this, but Cecily is… I have mixed feelings? ✔Like, she’s cool, just vaguely thrown in the fucking final book of a series, and reads kind of like the girl version of Will, but we’ve still only known her for one book, and I love that finding-my-place conflict but she’s just taken over by a romance plot that is cute but also out of nowhere, and I don’t find her compelling enough to want 20% of the book to be her chapters. I... still like her and it’s fine✔I… actually really like Gabriel.

Aka I had to use that line somewhere, aka the reason I like this series so damn much, aka the ot3 of my damn dreams. But I really think all of the characters just… complement each other really well. Jem is more of a sunshine being, and he pulls that out in Tessa, and Will is more forty pounds of sarcasm in a trenchcoat, and Tessa is so much more savage around him, and I find that so endearing and adorable, and god I just want them all to be together.I am not joking when I say I don’t ship any of the three arms of this triangle individually like, nearly enough to love this series all on its own. [I actually like both of the Jem ships more than Will & Tessa, which is ironic because that’s the ship that’s being pushed?] Nope. They’re just… all in love, and it’s beautiful.Also, Jem leans against chairs when Will is sitting in them and it’s so adorable and also, Will threw his hands into the fire for like, one thing for Jem, and wow but people keep burning their hands for people they love.and now for some SPOILERY THOUGHTS: um, so everyone has been telling me I was going to cry reading this, and, uh, I did. Here are the moments I cried at! (view spoiler)[✔Where Will feels Jem die, because I have more emotions about Jem and Will than anything else in this fucking book. Also, ✔where Will & Jem talked again during the battle? I was such a wreck. ✔Jem & Will’s final conversation. I finally started balancing my crying a little bit more with several tears shed over ✔Jem & Tessa’s final conversation. And then I sobbed my eyes out at ✔Will dying while Jem played a fucking violin, Cassandra you little bitch I know what you did, and then I cried really hard at ✔Jem coming back at the end. (hide spoiler)] Also, I think I might have gotten myself into tears of laughter over several funny moments. I was howling. “I believe that might be qualified as resistance,” Will said, “you know, eating one’s son in law.”Oh, and just before we go, let me mention that this is… a strangely hilarious book considering how fucking sad it made me. That scene where Gideon and Gabriel write a letter about Charlotte in chapter six? That was literally the funniest thing I have ever read in my entire life. It was the source of all my non-awful tears in this godforsaken book. Anyway. I yelled a lot in this , but bottom line: yes, this was really good, yes, I loved it, yes, I cried, no, I'm not going to give you my answer on the team Jem vs. team Will thing. highly recommended. obviously.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,289,1,"Jun 09, 2018","Jun 23, 2018","May 27, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24885506-clockwork-princess

And I’m not convinced I really understood this as well at 17 as I do now. “I think,” Hoa says slowly, “that if you love someone, you don’t get to choose how they love you back.”You can always check out my s of The Fifth Season and The Obelisk Gate, but I’ll give a brief summary of my thoughts: This series won three Hugo awards in a row for a reason. The characters make me feel everything I possibly can. The worldbuilding is incredibly complex but not so convoluted as to be boring. The first book, which is still the best one, is a twisty mess and I adored it. There are reveals everywhere, about the world and the characters and the plot and so much more. The buildup and payoff dynamics are excellent. The thematic core around oppression is fucking awesome and done with an all-black and majority-queer cast.There are two things I will say about this book. First of all, (view spoiler)[the loss of Alabaster (hide spoiler)] is a loss; I missed him throughout the novel both in investment and in missing the dynamism he brought. Secondly, when I first read this series at seventeen, I read The Stone Sky entirely on audiobook and barely understand the backstory chapters. Though I absolutely adore Robin Miles and want you all to see what a fantastic job she does narrating these books, I don’t think this particular book is the best choice for an audiobook. You will be confused. The Stone Sky once again receives POVs from three characters; Essun, Nassun, and a new narrator who has narrated all along - Hoa. ➽Essun is so mentally strong, so drily sarcastic, and so gorgeously developed. Even in her unlikability - which only amplifies in this book - it is impossible not to root for her. ➽Nassun continues to become more and more of an antihero over time, and this book emphasizes the aspect which has always existed in her - her desperate need to be loved. When She’s also still such a fucking… teenager, and I find it really endearing and deeply sympathetic. She means so much to me. ➽Hoa, meanwhile, allows us to reveal the past of the Stillness. Via the biggest angel of an immortal stone creature I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about. This series has just been… a really good experience for me. In general. And I love these characters, so much, and I don’t think I could ever really hate a book containing them. So, we have a new narrator who we’ve all been desperately awaiting for a book now, and the characters - especially Nassun - have changed a lot since book two. Which is so awesome. You can really feel the development in them and the conflict within them. But you know what really made this book for me? The conflict around motherhood.I mean, since the beginning, this series has been adamant about how loving someone is not enough for them to know you love them, and drilled into our heads that Essun has not always been the best mother. But I wasn’t expecting… payoff. I was not expecting the degree to which a mother can mistreat her daughter, despite loving her, despite thinking she is doing the right thing, to become the focus. I love that it has become the focus.I can’t believe what a good job this story has done at balancing Nassun and Essun in this conflict, at seeing both their motivations and realizing that neither one is completely wrong or completely right, not really. It is not about which is right, but about whether or not they will be able to break a cycle of generational trauma created by the Earth itself. Now they’ll all know. Every season is the Season for us. The apocalypse that never ends.And then… the ending. It’s just stunning. I love the writing of it - we finally see a powerplay we’ve been building up to for three books. I love the character bit of it - it is utterly gutwrenching. And I love the hope in it, and the sense that even though the world is fucked up, there is always, always hope. If you look hard enough. I'll miss this series.

You really want to hear it? Because I have thoughts.First of all, I was not invested in the plot like, at all, and it is due to a fundamental structural flaw. In a series that is structured with each book playing into the next, as this one is, a good second book should be about the fallout of book one. But here, while the repurcussions of book one are part of the plot – Verity and August are both now a mess, how do we deal with that – a random new monster is the cause of 80% of the book’s plot points. It is not the result of any occurence in book one. In fact, it really isn’t a result of anything in particular. It just fucking shows up and somehow manages to cause Kate to go back to Verity [i.e. the setup for the whole book] and then, as if that weren’t enough, directly causes around 80% of the plot. So basically, because none of the plot is a result of character action, all the plot points feel kind of… random. Like they’re happening to the characters rather than the characters happening to the plot. This random plot point thing is actually a general problem - as this book begins, we’re thrown into a lot of really cool new plot points, including a larger world context, a hunting team for Kate, an attack team for August, a character shift for Ilsa, a major character shift for August, a character shift for Kate, a new reign in Verity, a new big bad Malchai, a brand new automatic supersonic hypnotic funky fresh new Sunai, and a brand new automatic supersonic hypnotic funky fresh monster. And we have gotten no context for any of these things from book one. Most of these new details don’t even get an explanation here!! The outside-of-Verity stuff is actually badass, but it has no depth - the monsters aren’t well-explained, and Kate’s random squad of friends barely get introductions [besides Riley. I love Riley.] Kate’s entire outside-of-Verity life gets dropped in like, two pages, and Schwab tries to get us to care, and I only care a tiny tiny bit and at least 50% of it is because I'm pretty sure Kate left Verity and immediately fell in with a band of gays and it's excellent evidence for bi Kate theory. Perhaps more annoyingly, my favorite part of the worldbuilding in book one was the backstories for the monsters; the fact that Ilsa & Leo & August were all similar to the events that caused them was just fucking brilliant, my favorite thing ever, etc. What caused Soro? And perhaps more plot relevant, what caused the Chaos Eater? Because that’s a really big worldbuilding point that I don’t have an answer for. I’m waaaaaiting. I also think in doing this fast change, Schwab really lost the thread on August. Seriously, what the fuck happened to August. August’s character here doesn’t make sense – not because he feels out of character, because he doesn’t, but because he goes through extreme regression off-page rather than on-page. When we see August in This Savage Song, he is an anxiety-ridden kid who wants to do his best, and through his arc he gains more confidence in himself and loses some of his self-hatred. When we see him here, he has totally and seemingly randomly lost his sense of humanity. And that’s a really interesting character arc, don’t get me wrong, but when it happens off page it feels so abrupt and random and just… lazy. He also… kind of barely feels like the same human being? August reads very clearly as mentally ill in book one, and that just goes missing here. [Full disclosure, I think this trend where books start with “two months later” is bullshit and I want a refund.]But even if August’s character shift had made sense or felt authentic, the fact remains that Kate and August, as characters, feel more like vehicles for the story than influences on the story. Victoria Schwab has never in her life been good at character motivation driving the plot, but come on, we don’t even get as much motivation as in book one. I don’t feel why August is doing what he’s doing or why Kate is doing what she’s doing. This book has no drive. It feels like a desperate attempt to finish things off. And it underutilizes its two leads.All the characters in this book are underutilized, honestly. Soro is so underutilized. Ilsa is so, so, so underutilized. All three of the villains are kind of underutilized, because, ya know, there are three of them. So much underutilization. Oh, and beyond that, I’m going to try and make this quick, because it’s a little bit spoilery, but I love these two characters so much, and I think these characters were way more compelling for me in book one. Kate’s arc here is all about fighting her demons, in literal form, which is an arc I happen to love. But the tension to her meetup with Alice isn’t really built well enough for this arc to feel meaningful. [She also does a significantly smaller amount of ass-kicking. I’m gay and I would read an entire book about her kicking ass.] Oh, and August’s new arc wraps up in about one singular page, which doesn’t quite feel finished, but the main problem is that I just wasn’t invested in him in this book. Which is actually really sad, because book one August is my son and the light of my life and I would die for him. I also kind of feel that the entire red / white soul blend thing is a really lazy way of getting Soro and August to admit that things aren’t black and white.Oh, by the way, the whole kiss scene thing is very much exaggerated, and I just want to point to this Victoria Schwab tweet.This has been a rant, but I think the general problem for me is this is just not the type of character-focused story I like. This Savage Song worked as a very personal and character-focused story within the context of a greater world. Our Dark Duet is trying to be this big, expansive story, and besides not expanding the world very well or focusing on anything at all, it loses the focus on what made it so great - the characters.Oh, and spoilers ahead: I don’t like major character death ever but I think the fact that I knew it was going to happen really just made me go “okay” and close the book, mad and disappointed that the Kate & August platonic wedding will never happen.petition for Schwab to stop writing conclusions she’s not as good at it as she is at anything else ever lmao.

You can only fit in around 50 literary allusions before it starts being kind of annoying. [WE GET THE TALE OF TWO CITIES THING FOR THE LOVE OF GOD]. Also, it totally has that overdramatic fanfiction quality, but it kind of… works. Yeah, I’m aware that I liked this book more than it might have deserved, and I’m aware that people make fun of this series for The Love TriangleTM. Cool. So I just came here to say: all of them are in love and it should end in all of them dating. I am not giving up this opinion. Jem and Will are both in love with Tessa, canonically, and Tessa is in love with both of them, canonically, and let’s just be really fucking honest with ourselves and say that Jem and Will are completely in love. It's 2018 and it's time to admit that, as a society. I am aware that this is not what occurs in this series and it is my firm belief that under different circumstances, they would all be dating, and I do not care who fights me on this. I guess we stopped pretending this was a , so here’s the part of the  where I scream about the characters [aka the reason why I would die for these occasionally trashy books]. It will still be spoiler-free. “Yes, she doesn't really look like either of us, does she? Perhaps she's a girl who's fallen madly in love with me and persists in following me wherever I go.”“My talent is shape-shifting, Will, not acting,” said Tessa.[she really said this, out loud, she really said this and I would kill for her] Okay, seriously, I love Tessa. Like, I’m actually pissed off by how much she gets slept on, because she’s such a good protagonist?? She’s a total Gentle Soul who loves her friends but also has the ability to drag everyone within an inch of their lives and uses it. Every time Tessa burns someone I have ten years added to my life, she's an icon and I love herOh, Jem?? I love Jem. Jem has never done a thing wrong in his entire life. The only man I trust. He projects being So Confident and So On Top Of It and he’s struggling so much. Help him.Oh, and I guess we’re talking about Will now, too? Will and Tess are my least favorite couple within The Love TriangleTM, but I still… kind of love Will as a character? So, this book had one of the best backstory reveals in any book I’ve read recently, and I think this particular backstory is quite brilliant in how it explains his personality and some parts of his character in book one that kind of didn’t make sense. I think it probably should have been revealed at the end of book one [these books are drawn out] but it really is That Backstory Reveal that changed me as a person and gave me a whole new attitude towards Brooding Bad Boy Backstory RevealsTM. Let’s talk about Jem and Will and Tessa as a dynamic. First of all, I love them. Second of all, I would die for them. Third of all, help them. The plot of these books is just “two of them worry about the third person” repeated over and over for six million pages and don’t get me wrong, I think that’s beautiful, but also, help them. And before you ask, yes, I actually genuinely mantain that the three of them should end this series dating, and I’m 85% sure that is exactly how I am supposed to feel. I am also around 72.4% sure that had this not been published in fucking 2011 [a hell time] that is actually how it might have ended. Anyway.This book had such a delightful cast of side characters. I love and would die for Henry and Charlotte. That one cute scene between them was... really fucking cute. Like, cliche, but also I was crying? Sophie is such a good character and always has been. I wanted a little bit more out of Jessamine, but I think she’s given a decent amount of nuance [and hey, she got me to sympathize with her and root for her redemption arc even though she’s kind of awful]. Oh, you know that thing I talked about in my  of book one where I was like “they’re finally going to address how the downworlders are treated?” I lied, they didn’t talk about it even though the lead character Literally Is A Downworlder, and no one is more emo about it than I am. talkaboutsocietalinequalityinmytrashliterature.jpg“Ah,” said a voice from the doorway, “having your annual ‘everyone thinks Will is a lunatic’ meeting, are you? “It’s biannual,” said Jem. “And no, this is not that meeting.”Oh, also, I thought this book was fucking hilarious. Every single line is the most iconic thing I’ve ever read and I love it.s/o to this asshole and my ex girlfriend for screaming about this with me, y'all really ruined my life hope it was fun. and also, if one more of you tells me that I'm going to die when I read Clockwork Princess, I will genuinely threaten to never read itBlog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,278,1,"May 24, 2018","May 26, 2018","May 20, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24885507-clockwork-prince

You know, my most popular, most liked one-star  of City of Bones? That one? So I guess the thesis of this  could be people change. Oh, no, not me - I still think that book was a piece of shit, because it really was. I mean Cassandra Clare. As in she got better at writing.The BIG thing that shocked me here was how incredibly addicting this was. Like, I tore apart City of Bones, but kind of the main thing about that book was that it was really boring. I took over six months to read that book. This book, on the other hand was better than entertaining - it was super compelling. I think it’s chiefly because - if you have ever read a single one of my s you know this is coming - the character work and development, which is just so so so much better than anything in the Mortal Instruments. Tessa’s conflict is about whether or not she is human, and what that should mean, and it is so quality. And speaking of the idea of monsters vs. humans, the portrayal of downworlders suddenly doesn’t suck. While Rafael and Magnus are both sympathetic characters in the Mortal Instruments, I think the portrayal of Camille - I love her, by the way - goes further than subverting: it subtly but clearly critiques the Shadowhunter idea that Downworlders are lesser. While the ending of this book is fucking heartbreaking and made me want to punch a certain someone in the face, it also does something I did not expect - it sees Will’s bigotry and it criticizes him for it by putting us into Tessa’s head as she experiences it. Also, love that Tessa is powerful as fuck. I feel like I’m always bothered by the lack of agency for female protagonists from this era, but no. I love her. I’d give my life for her. There is also a very compelling cast of side characters, including:➽Charlotte - the badass lady mentor Tessa needed and deserved➽Henry - a mess who has never done anything wrong in his life➽Jessamine - girl hate but like, compelling and subversive, but also annoying but also I don’t hate her??➽Sophie - my girlfriend, my wife, I would die for her, an iconI kind of intoned girl hate in this, so let’s talk about the narrative implications of girl hate and why this book actually did really well. Jessamine comes close to being a very stereotypical character, but she’s far beyond that - she’s a character who has very clearly been socialized into believing in her own superiority for not fighting, and now firmly believes it. The reason this character works is because she is highly motivated. The reason this plotline works is because there are two seperate really badass women in here, both of whom express femininity in really different ways. There’s also the fact that Tessa is dealing with her own internalized misogyny, but the narrative still kind of decries what’s going on. That’s a super hard dynamic to pull off but yes. Also, let’s talk about this love triangle. I literally don’t think I have ever been this invested in a love triangle just ending up with them all dating each other. I also am somewhat convinced that is exactly the dynamic Cassandra Clare was going for, because like… it is really really there. BUT I will say I was rooting for The Three Love Triangle People All Dating Each Other Endgame up until the ending and then Will... u Trash Man.... #justiceforTessa2k18And because someone will someday ask on my , if I actually had to pick a team - and I am still very opposed to picking a team - Jem is a better person than Will will ever be. I started this book highly empathizing with Will - even though I am currently so mad at him - but Jem has never done a thing wrong in his life and is good. In summary:➽Jem - Kind Musician Man, disabled and biracial Chinese in a society that looks down on both, put up with Will’s shit for seventeen years, an overall good➽Will - trash man, basically only likes the two people he’s simultaneously datingBut honestly… they’re both interesting characters? I love the direction this series is going.Don’t get me wrong, there were still cheesy moments. But overall, this was so compelling and fun. A Quality Read.I will also say that while I highly enjoyed this book, I kind of... liked it as fun trash? Weeeeeeeeeeell. Maybe just see my s of Clockwork Prince and Clockwork Princess.

I want to be torn apart by everything.If you’re a fan of the writing in books like Carmen Marie Machado’s Her Body and Other Parties and Roxane Gay’s Difficult Women, you’ll probably adore the writing throughout. For me, the writing didn’t quite work until the end - but then it did. I found the first half of this somewhat all over the place but then the stylism becomes more centered in the second half and better yet, the odd structure is the point. Can I just say that the structure is really fantastic? This is a book that confuses you on purpose. The narrative begins very non-linear, and then goes to a more linear direction, and it really works in conveying the author’s state of mind. It’s a wonderful use of unreliable narration, in which the memoir’s author isn’t consistent on her own thoughts either about herself or about her mental illness. There were several moments in the first half that felt like too much romanticization of mental illness, but as the book continues, the book shows a subtle recognition of the biases of the author. It becomes a testament to how our heads can be embroiled in a concept of how romantic our struggles are, how common they are, when they’re not. There’s so much nuance to what’s being said here.Overall, I thought this was utterly magical - a tour de force of word choice with a super strong thematic core.

Through the Red Rubber system, the people of the Congo were essentially enslaved to harvest rubber. Those who failed to collect enough rubber had their hands chopped off. Some died from disease brought on by the terrible conditions, while others were just flat-out murdered. It is estimated that around three to thirteen million people died between 1885 and 1908, perhaps 25 to 50 percent of the total population. By the end of this period, the Congo, which just a 100 years ago had hosted the expansive and successful Kongo Empire, had seen its natural resources destroyed, its people mutilated, and its entire society changed forever. The negative legacy of colonialism is strong throughout Africa and across the world, but the Congo is one of the countries that suffered most. This is a horrifying, disgusting legacy. And one that this book does not on any level respect. On the surface, this book can be read as anti-colonialist, a narrative that decries the brutality with which King Leopold II and other rulers allowed African people to be treated. This reading is comforting to us. It feels right. How can we read of their deaths and not feel ashamed? How can we see the heads of so-called rebels on pikes and not find ourselves filled with horror? How can we read a scene in which people walk in a chain gang and not find our deepest sympathies with them? How could Conrad not have felt the same?But I do not believe that is the intent, or, to be quite honest, an accurate reading of the narrative of this book. Conrad’s descriptions and depictions of black people are dehumanizing to their core. No black character in this book feels real, feels like a person we may empathize with and care for. It is in the descriptions of Kurtz’s black mistress, of the slave-boy whose only contribution to the narrative is the line “Mistah Kutz, he dead” - Conrad does not share our empathies. Our horror at their fate and in their suffering is our own, not the narrators. The thing about this book is that it’s not a criticism of colonialism, and while reading it as such feels viable on the surface, looking deeper into the narrative makes this book feel odder and odder. This book is a look at the depth of human evil and how that can be brought out when society breaks down. Notice the end of that sentence? Because the reason Africa is the subject of this book is because this narrative fundamentally believes that Africa is a primitive, uncivilized, immoral landscape. Which I find to be an inaccurate and frankly immoral view of Africa. The historical record of our time shows that pre-Colonial (and pre-slave trade) African civilization was filled with the same life as European civilizations, and populated by strong kingdoms. Conrad emphatically believes otherwise. And while I am willing to understand on some level that this was an ingrained belief of European colonists, this book pushes this message to a very high degree - it’s irrevocably tied to the message of the book - that I found impossible to ignore. Yes, the idea is also pushed that the people of Europe are really no different from the people of the Congo. I am fully aware that Joseph Conrad is getting at the idea that none of us are so evolved and none of us are so civilized ourselves and white society cannot put itself totally above others. Conrad is explicitly attempting to put black people and white people on an equal level of brutality. But this narrative is still fundamentally flawed. The white characters in this book are evil colonists, but they are depicted as people. The black characters of this book are “savages.” They are rebels. At best, they are the helmsman, unnamed in his own narrative and dying ten pages in. At worst, they are literal cannibals. The narrative shows a fundamental dehumanization of each “savage” character, undermining any sort of anti-colonialist or pro-African message.And I find that fundamentally disturbing. If I cannot feel any horror within the narrative for a genocide, a time in which culture was destroyed and the environment strangled and thousands slaughtered for the profit of an empire, how can I garner anything from this book? How can I, in good conscience, enjoy or recommend this book? I understand and appreciate that many are going to read this  and think I misread the text, because this book is a classic. I would remind them that no work of literature can be kept free from critique because it has stood the test of time. And beyond that, I do not believe this is at all a surface reading. It’s been pushed in the minds of many that reading this book as racist is a surface-level interpretation, but I genuinely believe that the racism is what you get upon close reading.Literary analysis of racist historical works is a polarizing and complex topic, and I recognize that many will feel antagonistic towards this viewpoint. I also fully admit that this book makes good use of an unreliable narrator and is one of the most gritty classics I have read as to its depiction of the human soul, and I have nothing against those who enjoyed it. But I cannot enjoy this for those and erase the flaws. I cannot appreciate the literary merit of a book that lacks a fundamental understanding of the humanity of black people. And I'm not sure I believe that I should. recommended reading: Chinua Achebe's beautifully rendered essay on Heart of Darkness.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,5,556,1,"Apr 30, 2018","May 02, 2018","Apr 30, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4903.Heart_of_Darkness

My insides may in an instant become my outsides as I stand here before you.”Attolis, the new king of Attolia, is a pawn. He is lazy, unloved by his wife, and there to be a victim, unaware of the political machinations of his court. At least, that’s what his guard thinks of him; they love their queen, of course, but do not love their king. This includes Costis, his newly appointed guard, who hates him. With a clever point of view shift to a new character, this book is a clever and eerie ride.This series feels so classic, like something everyone would’ve been obsessed with ten years ago. I hope people will still obssess over it now. So what do people always praise about this series? Because item #1 is the plotting, and item #2 is the character work. I second both. I’ve been thinking a lot about why the plotting of this series is so great, and it’s because Megan Whalen Turner is so good at planting and payoff. If a plot element shows up in the beginning of the book, it will be become a part of the book further on; within the world, with political elements, with character elements. Element after element is used for plot twists and it is always so satisfying and compelling.And perhaps even more importantly, the character work here is fucking incredible. Gen is a fantastic mastermind. Costis is an impressively likable character, especially as he’s just shown up. Gen and Irene are one of the most endearing couples I have ever read about. Also, I absolutely love and adore the dialogue. It’s glorious and adds so much to these characters.So why only four stars? You know, this has gotten the hype of being the best book in this series, and I have to admit, I’m not sure it lived up to that. One of my absolute favorite parts of The Queen of Attolia was the development of Irene; her slow character arc, the growing relationship between her and Gen. This book… lacked Irene. Okay, she’s there plenty, but I LOVE her and she was not in this book enough. Costis is a really interesting character and I really loved the growing relationship between him and Gen, but I admit, I was disappointed by the overall smaller scale of the plot twists and the action. I do really like that this series is becoming primarily the story of small but powerful players within a very large world, but the shift was surprising, especially as the narrator, Costis, drives very little of the plot. It’s an interesting plot device, but as a result, I found myself losing focus on action within the middle. But this worked pretty well, because we’re so invested in the characters involved in the action. And when it comes down to it, I really enjoyed this. It’s such a fun classic fantasy; I feel reminded of old Kristin Cashore and Tamora Pierce in the best way.

He scarcely saw a face, scarcely heard a voice say, “That is your friend,” and then it was over, having filled him with beauty and taught him tenderness. He could die for such a friend, he would allow such a friend to die for him; they would make any sacrifice for each other, and count the world nothing, neither death nor distance nor crossness could part them, because “this is my friend.”Maurice follows the story of Maurice, a gay man in the early 1900s, as he falls in love, gets his heart broken, and gets his heart repaired. This book hit me… really hard. There are two love stories here, one between Maurice and his school partner, and one between him and a garden worker. In one of these, his class colleague asks for their relationship to never go beyond kissing; he is always at arms’ length, until he is discarded altogether. In one of these, he is free to love as he is, freed from the bounds of false intellectualism and performance. It’s not clear from the summary how sectioned this book is, but it is decidedly split: the first half deals with Clive and the eventual breakdown of that relationship, while the second half deals with Maurice’s attempts to ‘cure’ himself and then eventually, with Alec. I found the first half of this novel interesting. The second half made me cry of happiness. It’s infused with so much more hope. The final scene focuses point of view on Clive, framed in the light, while Maurice is a voice in the dark; that, though, is his happy ending. Maurice ends the novel in love in the dark, while Clive ends the novel thinking that his lack of love in the light is superior. (It is we, as the audience, who must make our own decisions on that matter.) I enjoyed the movie, which I saw before reading the book, a lot. Though it’s easy to quibble with certain changes made from the book to the movie, there’s one bit I particularly like: the final shot, in which Clive looks out at the greens, wondering what he could have had, had he not been afraid. In so doing, Forster creates an idea of love in the dark as a positive thing. This reminded me of that quote from Black Sails: “In the dark, there is discovery, there is possibility, there is freedom in the dark once someone has illuminated it.”I love how Jami @JamiShelves put it in her : “Forster invokes the concept of the Greenwood as a metaphor for relationships existing outside the socially accepted framework for romance. The Greenwood exists as an unrestrained space, drawing connotations of 'the wilderness'. The country acts as a locus for desire, its existence outside the restraints of society and allowing desire to flourish unrestrained.”There’s something profound about giving a happy ending to two men falling in love in a time where they were few and far between. In the outro, E.M. Forster says this:“A happy ending was imperative. I shouldn't have bothered to write otherwise. I was determined that in fiction anyway two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows, and in this sense, Maurice and Alec still roam the greenwood.”When this book was written, in 1913 and 1914, this seemed almost ridiculous, that two men could fall in love, and not marry, and be happy. Forster wrote this novel almost to challenge that idea. This book could not even published until after his death, in 1971, and was then incredibly controversial. This book made me feel like I believe in love again. Also, and this is only a minor spoiler, but I think about this scene a lot: “You do care a little for me, I know... but nothing to speak of, and you don't love me. I was yours once till death if you'd cared to keep me, but I'm someone else's now... and he's mine in a way that shocks you, but why don't you stop being shocked, and attend to your own happiness.”(view spoiler)[to my ex: i fucked your gamekeeper. in your house. and in a hotel. and in your boathouse. bye lmao see you never -Maurice at the end of this book (hide spoiler)]TW: conversion attempts & suicidal ideation.

Then says evenly: “It's satire.”This novella was so addicting. I absolutely love the worldbuilding of this book. The Black God’s Drums is set in a post-confederate New Orleans in which the South achieved their goal of armistice. While many cities rebelled, they succeeded in keeping most territories, using slave labor and keeping them confined via a type of poison gas called drapeto. The aesthetic used is perfect, keeping you very firmly within the alt-history lowkey-sci-fi vibe but also not feeling overdone.The characters in this book, all of them black, are first and foremost trying to keep their sanctuary together, and though they are all selfishly motivated, their love for New Orleans brings them together. I thought this was a super compelling story thread - it’s hard not to root for New Orleans to avoid falling under confederate rule and Drapeto. All to fall in with this whole compelling-thematic-narrative thing, we have some super cool characters! This book is about a fourteen year old girl named Creeper and a lesbian ship’s captain named Ann-Marie. I love the murder nuns. I love the doctor’s daughter. And Oya, Creeper’s Orisha presence, is so iconic. I love her and I would die for her. I never have enough to say about short Tor novellas, so I guess all I can say is… I really liked it? It’s an overall fun and compelling read, very fast-paced [clocking in at only 100 pages], and will almost certainly interest you if you’re at all into Tor’s line. Which I always am.

But rather than focusing on the power plays of that fascist movement, this novel goes a lot more in-depth; it focuses on just three of the characters affected by the new regime, and how they react to the disappearances, the burgeoning fear.And I think this is the narrative choice that makes the whole book so haunting. As the novel builds up, we get the sense that there’s a lot more going on than what these three characters see, and indeed there is. But this small scope feels like a far more relavant portrayal of a society in crisis. You don’t always know your life is about to be wrecked until it is.

The thing about this play is that it absolutely relies on tension. And that tension is absolutely there in a quality rendition of this show. But it is not conveyed on page. Likewise, most of Blanche’s character is in her nuance, in the subtext of each scene where she acts nervous and worried and in how she is framed and in her fear and turmoil. In a character like this, a character full of ambiguity and hurt and angst, how could an on-page rendition be so sympathetic? How could she gain your sympathies despite her flaws? The answer is that she doesn’t. Until you see the movie and she breaks your fucking heart.Honestly, I think there is a lot to be said about this play and its connection to the downfall of Southern white life [wow, we have read about that a lot in AP Lit this year]. There is also a lot to be said about its occasionally-weird gay subtext - there’s some explicit text that the movie cuts because homophobia, but also the fact that this is essentially a love triangle between a woman’s husband and her sister? Which is something the movie plays up, um, kind of a lot. [There’s a scene framing the two sisters as Hollywood lovers and it is weird.] Also, I’d like to point you all to the comment underneath this status stating that Stanley is a caricature of a straight man and Tenesee Williams just doesn’t understand straight men, because holy shit, that is the funniest thing I have ever read.But honestly, I think explaining the subtext wouldn’t be the best decision either for spoiler purposes [a lot of the thematic stuff is pretty easy to understand] or for my mental health [I am running off far too little sleep and I don’t think this  is coherent, probably.] What I will say is that you should see the movie, and then read the play and compare the two, and that I really liked this.

I don't know why I'm like this either. (Comment your favorite Antigone translations and I'll read them.)Oxford edition, trans. unk (2015): In ninth grade, I read the Theban plays in my English class. I liked them. Antigone, specifically, made a very very large impression on me. I promptly forgot every single thing I thought about them. [I have a terrible memory.] So when audible offered a free audio of the plays with a full-cast narration… I went for it. And of course loved it again. Will need to reread these translations to fully retranslate.Audio edition, trans. unk (2018): This audio stars the excellent Jamie Glover as Oedipus and the always-talented Hayley Atwell as Antigone, but casting such as Samantha Bond as Jocasta, Michael Melone as Creon, and Lydia Leonard as Ismene stand out as well. This is the reading upon which I decided perhaps Oedipus the King was very good. Antigonick trans. Anne Carson (2019): More an adaption than a translation, and certainly not my favorite, if only because I love Antigone's original words so much. Worth reading, but after reading Antigone proper. Reviewed here.The Greek Plays edition trans. Frank Nisetich (2020): I loved the biting stychomythia of this translation. Play Reviews for Everything→Oedipus the King←★★★★★Oedipus means swollen foot, in reference to his broken feet as a child, but holds a double meaning: Oida means I know, and Eidon means I saw, so the term could also be 'seeing foot'. If only he could see where his feet were going. Seeing, indeed, is the primary tension of the play. One eyewitness has two key details to give: the story of exposing the baby for Laius, and the story of watching a stranger kill Laius on a dark road. What I like about this play is that it is a tragedy where no character has purposefully fucked things up. Every single character — from the later-unsympathetic Creon to the excellently written Jocasta — is sympathetic. It is so upsetting to see it unfold, see these characters have their lives so completely ruined. Around halfway through the play, Jocasta figures it out, and begs Oedipus to stop the process; knowing, but thinking to take it to her grave: he does not take it. Oedipus receives the opportunity to blame it all on Creon and keep his leadership: he does not take it. He is finding the truth for altruism, and will take it to the end. For Oedipus, his recognition and reversal are a nightmare come true, a dream he never thought could occur. I was near tears during Oedipus’ final speech.→Oedipus at Colonus←★★★★☆I actually, in hindsight, am not sure I read this in ninth grade. [We were only actually required to read Antigone.] This is the Family Feelings play, as in… the relationship between Antigone and Ismene and Oedipus is upsetting and I don’t like it. Almost all the action of this one is offstage, which makes it far harder to follow; honestly, this feels like a joiner between Oedipus the King and Antigone. I did enjoy the sense of tragedy and the character development. →Antigone←★★★★★What I like about Antigone is Antigone. No, that's not quite right. What I like about Antigone is its focus on very different characters as they try to undermine Creon in three very different ways. Acting from honor, from logic, from empathy, the three youth of the royal family protest his decisions: Antigone representing the god’s honor and the woman’s honor; Ismene representing the woman’s honor; Haemon representing the youth’s honor and the city’s honor. The actions of Antigone, Haemon, and Ismene break the heirarchy down, and though by the end of the play, two lie dead, they have taught Creon his lesson. When the tyrant does not listen to those around him, he has nothing, and leaves the dead in his wake. Antigone loves her honor before the gods, and will break any heirarchy, woman or not, to get to it; yet the city is on her side, following her lead. Ismene and Antigone have a fascinating sisterly relationship. The stychomythia (certain kind of meter used for conversation) between Haemon and Creon is one of my favorite scenes in any play I’ve read ever. The 'guard' witnesses two very key events in Antigone's life: he is almost more 'casual', and oddly comedic. He introduces two burials, one scattering of earth, one seemingly divine and done by Antigone. This is not notable on the first readthrough. On the second, the question of who actually does the first burial hits. Notable in the sense of tragic convention is that the chorus is all-male; in this genre, the chorus is generally the same gender as the protagonists, generally of a lower social position, but sympathetic. Though the chorus here is at times kind to Antigone, they are never fully on her side. By the time she gives her death speech, about to walk into her tomb, we know she is truly alone. Antigone is a spectacle to the chorus, as Oedipus once was.Notable Lines (Frank Nisetich translation):ANTIGONE: No dread of what some man might think would ever make me… be guilty before the gods. (457-459)ANTIGONE: And I can’t join in hate, but only in love. (528)ANTIGONE: Your thoughts appealed to some, mine to others.ISMENE: And yet we’re both found guilty, both alike. (558-559)CREON: Rulers own their cities--isn’t that the saying?HAEMON: A fine ruler you’d make, alone, in a desert.CREON: This fellow, it seems, is on the woman’s side. HAEMON: If you’re a woman: it’s you I care for. (738-741)HAEMON: Do you want to talk and talk and never listen? (755)These plays are an excellent look at the nature of humanity, the hypocrisy of us and the fact that we all have our good sides and our bad. I know I will not be ending my love affair with Antigone anytime soon.

This… was so fun, and a four star book for me, and also it bugged the shit out of me to the point where I texted someone to bitch about it. But… I honestly did have so much fun.Let’s get the complaining out of the way: god, I fucking hate 2004 YA. I mean, this text has a bunch of homophobia and racism in there for “realism,” and yet somehow it still managed to sound like How No Teen Talks Ever. Everything that happens with Corny kind of pisses me off a lot. And some of how Kaye’s being biracial is introduced… rubbed me the wrong way? I can’t really figure out why. It just felt weird.BUT.So first of all, on the good side… the fairies. The way Holly Black draws her fairy worlds and fairy characters is genuinely so imaginative, gorgeous, and… creepy. Every time I dive into one of her books, I find myself both terrified and enamored with her fairy world, and I am so okay with that.And more importantly, this is a very thematically strong book! There’s the fantastic meta-narrative about growing up, and learning to live with how others perceive you. There is no easy fix for Kaye’s life; no box to easily fit into. She is a member of the fairy world of the human world and she can’t figure out which one is which. Kaye, though, is a really unlikable lead. I don’t mean that she’s flawed – though she is – I mean, I actively didn’t like her at all, and I love unlikable lady leads. I found that she was one of those early YA protagonists who’s written just generic enough that she’s easy to make into a self insert. She’s not... awful. But she’s very selfish. And not in a delicious way — in a way that’s really annoying because she keeps fucking up and the narrative doesn’t notice or criticize it. Oh, but I will admit - I fucking love Roiben. I really hate reading YA sometimes because inevitably, if there’s some male love interest that everyone fangirls over, the female lead will be unquestionably the best character in the narrative. [I mean, to mention another Holly Black book, The Cruel Prince?? some of you just don’t appreciate Jude like you should.] But no, Roiben is so incredibly likable and compelling. It’s a cliche trope, but I adore it when characters who keep up walls fall for characters who encourage them not to do so. I absolutely loved him.The main thing I want to say is that this is just… a really fun book. It's so short that I basically bingeread it and oh, loved it. And do you guys even understand how fucking short this book is? it's 320 pages but every page is like, in sixteen point font, and also half the size of a normal book page, and I'm honestly just confused as to how this is a full novel. This would be great for fans of any of Holly Black’s current books or anyone who just wants to read a really fun, trashy YA book with a gorgeous fairy world and a really good love interest.

I’m going to be talking about this a lot in relation to Stalking Jack the Ripper. So here’s that .First let’s talk about the mystery, because that was something I didn’t like in book one and… wow, I love him. The cleverness of the solution here has really stepped it up. I didn't guess the solution at all.  Okay, for the most important part, let’s talk about characters, because that is the real success of this book. I really really really like Thomas - I only liked him in the last book - and I never like love interests in books like these. He’s such a good man. There’s a scene in this book where he totally fucks up, and I was expecting it to be glossed over completely, but he immediately apologizes and doesn’t blame Audrey Rose at all. Speaking of such, I love Audrey Rose. Audrey Rose is suffering from severe ptsd and I think the way she is written here is so clever, so beautiful, so stunning. I love her. And I also love their relationship. Just… every scene between them is so tense. I love it. K, let’s talk about Same issue with the lack of discussion of colonialism in Audrey Rose’s backstory - she’s biracial and Indian and that’s really awesome but colonialism is like… not discussed at all. BUT I will say the feminism thing has improved a lot - so many of the major characters in this book are ladies and it's great. There are even side sapphics and it's what I deserved. But perhaps more in the vein of feminism, I adored the narrative around Audrey not wanting to be protected and Thomas having to learn not to violate that but being totally willing to work on his own privilege. I felt like the takedown of that was missing from book one?Unfortunately, I did think this one could've used some editing down - it's a hundred pages longer than the first book and it really drags in the middle. Part of that is the fact that the plot points feel less convoluted and weird and thrown-in, which is good, but Kerri Maniscalco hasn't quite gotten a handle on how to make plot points that aren’t convoluted but are still interesting, which means there are just fewer interesting plot points.I think my slump ruined my enjoyment of this book a lot but also... it was good.

Or have they destroyed imagination and beauty by capturing and codifying them? In which case—am I the final result? I… absolutely loved this.So this is an exploration of the world in the future, with technology but mostly with genetic engineering. but there's something about it that really made it stick out for me - throughout, this leaned into discussions of privilege, who gets modifications and who doesn't, who gets forced into modifications and who doesn't, because at the heart of this conversation on genetic engineering and technology and our future is a far larger and far more consistent question - who gets to decide on the humanity of others? where do we draw the line at human and subhuman? and we have drawn these distinctions for centuries, for millennia, we as a species, but when we talk about the future we always assume power will somehow become a thing given by merit. but power is neverbased on merit - it is based on privilege and money and in the very best case scenario, what we might call merit-based growth, it is based off pure dumb luck. and not since The Hunger Games have I seen a book about the future lean into that reality. So I suppose what I'm trying to say is that every story in this book is about genetic engineering, but every story in this book is also about the people who wield power. It is frighteningly rational that one man makes an impact on every story in this book, sometimes criticizing and sometimes normalizing but never, ever giving up the power he has been given by a society desperate for a guide. → T H E S T O R I E S ←I’ve talked about thematic overlays, but each story stands fairly well on its own too. The first story follows Julia and Evan, semi-identical twins semi-merged in a landmark surgery. The second story follows Gabrielle, a girl who is definitely not morally good, and also Oppression. The third story… should not be spoiled, and contains a lot of very fucked-up religious overtones, and the title is an allusion to The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. I have seen them riding seaward on the wavesCombing the white hair of the waves blown backWhen the wind blows the water white and black.We have lingered in the chambers of the seaBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brownTill human voices wake us, and we drown.The fourth section is my favorite of the book, and I just realized it (possibly accidentally) follows the plotline of the poem, and also discusses how human beings will always alienate those with different brains. The fifth section is the second section again, evangelism of the normal. The sixth section is essentially reverse colonialism, and a reverse of the fifth story and the second, a detail I found confusing at first; but in the end, I found it a brilliant commentary on the human tendency to reverse prejudices to where they suit us. Who is human and who is subhuman is a matter of opinion no matter what side it comes from. This had a few sections I just wished went further, and I’m not sure everyone will enjoy this as much as I did - it's certainly a certain taste. But I would highly recommend to anyone intrigued by the description. release date: 4 Dec 2018✨Arc received from the publisher via Netgalley for an honest .

And then it turned out to be a story about a wonderfully crafted antiheroine falling into darkness in the face of relentless oppression, and then Really Doing That, and I was just shook. If you liked hero-to-villain arcs in books like The Young Elites and The Grisha Trilogy and want more of that nice slide to evil, you should be reading this. Actually...I have a feeling it might be even more hardcore later on. How about I promo this book to you with one anecdote: (view spoiler)[at one point, a man shows up to Nedra trying to bring his wife back, and it’s revealed that he was the one who murdered her, and Nedra is like “fuck that” and allows her army of the dead to murder him while walking off. (hide spoiler)]Because I think about that a lot.Okay, okay. Give the Dark My Love is an antiheroine origin story, but more importantly, it’s a book about losing your people and the grief of that - the horror of losing the people who have defined your humanity.I mean, if you want to be sad for 300 hours, you will be over Nedra’s relationships with the people around her. Grey and Nedra’s romance is a sweet touch, perfectly geared to make you sad. I really loved Nedra’s family; there’s this one scene where she switches places with her sister to fool her mother, and it’s one of the most adorable and sweet things I’ve ever read. Ernesta in general is a great character, a delight in every page she’s in [and also canonically bi? which I love?] Master Ostrum is a great side character and ambiguous-support for Nedra and it’s fantastic.Which only makes it more upsetting when her family is involved in the conflict. “I love you, Nedra, but...” I didn't realize until that moment how the but cancelled out the love. Love could not exist when it came with conditions.As the book goes on, Nedra is left feeling alone, unsupported, forced to do everything herself… and is driven to levels of unspeakable morals. And despite his best efforts, Grey’s refusal to allow her to be happy with her dark side drives them apart as well. The ending wasn’t unpredictable, but it was cool as fuck.I will admit, I struggled with Grey’s point of view. It’s not the worst – he’s a compelling enough character. It’s just so clear that despite his not-insignificant impact on the narrative and its depiction of poverty, this book is not his story. In a book that is in every other way Nedra’s book, where Grey fills the role of a compelling love interest and no more, it feels odd and somewhat distracting to get his POV.Oh, speaking of Grey, here’s another thing I absolutely adored: the fact that this book is, at its core, a story about the repression of lower classes. In this world, the north of Lunar Island has been left behind the economy of the wealthier south. So when a new plague spreads in the north, richer southerners assume it’s a disease based off the dirtiness of the north.Not that this is a parallel to the real world or anything, but… this is a fantastic parallel to the real world. It’s just overall a very strong book about necromancy and antiheroine-ism. The world doesn’t always give you fairness and sometimes, you need to wrest it back. Spirits don’t always want to come back. And even the villains have a point. Also, can I just say… it really fucking goes there. Nedra is such a queen. The last hundred pages changed me as a person, obviously. But I also… there’s this one section in this book that I can’t stop thinking about because it was so deeply fucked up, and then the narrative just kept fucking describing everything. You’ll know what I mean when you get there.Anyway, I absolutely loved this, and I cannot wait to get to book two - look out for my  here!Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,302,1,"Jul 31, 2018","Aug 03, 2018","Apr 09, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38907226-give-the-dark-my-love

The thing I enjoy less about this book is… that is all I have to enjoy. The whole point of this book is to recount the very upsetting events with a dry tongue, which makes for a narrative that takes time and effort to find the light spots beneath. It is a book that does not give up its emotions easily. Indeed, protagonist Thomas McNulty, a little-educated Irish immigrant, I would be interested to see s written on this book by people more familiar with this history and specifically by Native American people. While the book clearly has no love for anti-Native rhetoric, it also has very little to actually say on the topic. Winona stuck out in my mind as a character I rooted for easily, but in writing this  it struck me that I know very little about her as a person. With some caveats, I think the book in general functions best as a historical account than anything else. We know Thomas McNulty and John Cole are in love, and we root for them as our protagonists, but we barely get to know anything about them as people. I doubt I could give you a suitable description of the characterization of either one. Characterization doesn’t have to be the end all be all of a book, but I definitely craved more.The thing I like most about this book is the very concept: that it follows two men, one of whom has a perhaps more complicated gender identity, as they adopt a daughter together. I like queer historical fiction because I am gay and I really enjoy the idea that even in the past, when there was almost no space for it, people like me existed and thrived. I don’t know enough about the topic to judge whether this is an accurate historical account, but I am aware the author did a huge amount of research. If a fairly play-by-play historical account of the Indian Wars and The Civil War that utilizes a backdrop of gender and sexuality sounds like your thing, I think this will hit you very hard.

Not the faintest trace of an understanding.”In the aftermath of the fabulous Amberlough, I was worried I would be let down by this book. I was. But thankfully, not completely.This one follows Cordelia and Aristide, two of the three leads of book one, and Lillian, an ambassador for Gedda… and Cyril’s sister. Ari is a traumatized refugee. Cordelia is in hiding after a resistance bombing campaign. Lillian is being blackmailed. But as things get more complicated, Lillian will have to risk it all to save her son. It took me a while to really get used to the worldbuilding of this; while book one was set almost exclusively in Amberlough, one of the provinces of Gedda, Armistice is set in Porachis, a nearby country, which conveniently is not depicted on the map. We also get little snippets of information about nations like Liso that I found hard to keep up with and sometimes convoluted. And I still could not fucking tell you where Liso is. And added on to that, the character cast is huge. There’s Daoud, Ari’s new lover, Jinadh, Lillian’s ex-lover and a prince of Porachis, Memmediv, Lillian’s maybe-current lover and a possible traitor for the Tatie province, Pulan, the head of Ari’s movie-making company, Sofie & Mab, two wives and undercover operatives, and a few more. As a result of these two aspects, I found the plot overall somewhat hard to track, and found it hard to be invested in action I didn’t always understand. I will say I really liked Lillian’s character direction; since the other two characters are old, I didn't feel they progressed as much. But she grows from a fairly dislikable - though sympathetic - character to one of my favorites. She's almost a subversion of the Ice Cold Blonde villain trope, at first coming off as closed-off and emotionless but eventually showing a far softer side. I don’t think I have much more to say than that on the quality of this as a sequel. It was good enough and the ending was nice - I liked seeing all the threads come together. But I’m hoping book three goes back to being more character-drivne. ✨Arc received from the publisher via Netgalley for an honest . released: 7 May 2018.series s: Amberlough | Armistice | AmnestyBlog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Aug 15, 2018","Oct 27, 2018","Apr 02, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36480645-armistice

In trying to consider why this book workeA group of girls are trapped at an island boarding school as their bodies mutate and change underneath them. In trying to consider why this book worked so well for me, I keep coming back to this: This is one of the most chilling books I have ever read. (If you’re really turned off by body horror probably don’t read this. I mean it.) The writing is excellent—the odd style, slipping between long sentences and short beats, contributes well to the atmosphere—and the anxious tone is wonderful. We follow three characters:→Hetty : An unassuming hero. Better at making the hard choices than you initially expect. →Byatt : A lot of unexpected backstory. Also my least favorite character on a personal level. →Reese : Very complicated and very damaged by the loss of her father. Also would’ve totally been my type two years ago. The complicated dynamics of friendships between queer girls are a front center of this book. Reese, Hetty, and Byatt have a complex dynamic, built up by years of baggage; Byatt is the friend in the middle, the person they’re both close to. Hetty envies her dynamic with Reese, and maybe is a little jealous, too—of one or both. Two things: (view spoiler)[A few goodreads s essentially said ‘it’s so weird that hetty liked byatt for so long and suddenly she kissed reese… it’d been like three days!’. i appreciate this viewpoint. unfortunately this is just what being gay is like and i maybe did do this exact shit in the same time frame in the month of December 2019. so like, it resonated. (hide spoiler)] (view spoiler)[Also this is RANDOM but someone on twitter referred to hetty and reese as ‘adam and ronan from trc but girls’ and it’s WEIRDLY fitting. like really fitting. it’s a good dynamic and i’m here for it. (hide spoiler)]The building of the world forms a strange metaphor for two things: one, growing up as a girl, and two, consumption of body. As the main characters’ bodies change underneath them, they feel differentiated, othered from themselves. But those changes are not necessarilly always bad, not for every person. (view spoiler)[I read Byatt taking the worm out of her system and then not surviving as an idea of her attempting to do away with her own body. In the logic of the book, that would be a death-causing move. (hide spoiler)]I loved this book; actually, this book was working pitch-perfect for me. Yes, certain plot points at times went unexplained, but it worked: I was as confused as the characters, leaving me on the edge of my seat, and I felt confident the payoff would be worthwhile. There was very little, I thought, that could mess up how much I liked the book. Except for… the ending. (view spoiler)[Which doesn’t answer a single mystery set up by the book. Not even whether the characters survive. (hide spoiler)] In her , Hadeer put it that the payoff was not proportional to the setup, which is a really clever way of putting it so I’m quoting that.

The first book ends with the leads off to a new adventure. That new adventure is coThere’s a repeated problem within this novel where the time skips. The first book ends with the leads off to a new adventure. That new adventure is compromised and they are in the same old situation as before the finale less than twenty pages in. The second book ends with the lead characters in a bad situation. They are out of that bad situation less than forty pages into this book. It’s a really weird element and makes this story feel really unpolished. Now, you might be thinking, Elise, I love you, but what the fuck does this have to do with anything? Because it’s emblematic of a larger problem in the book: this book doesn’t know where it’s going. This is a deeply weird book because it does not have a consistent tone or consistent character development or even, really, a consistent plot. It is a book with many interesting points and interesting characters and so many interesting themes and then the narrative doesn’t want to actually deal with that shit.➽➽First of all, let’s talk about Alina fucking Starkov. Because Alina is… such a complicated character and I don’t think that nuanced nature is being written very well. She’s so interesting because inwardly, she considers herself weak, but she’s playing with fire and desperately trying to avoid her own antiheroine nature. There are ways the nuance of her character can make sense, but the narrative isn’t very clear about her motivations and her struggles... until it’s convenient for the narrative to give her character depth. ➽➽Perhaps more importantly, the narrative is trying to force a conflict out of her Being About To Go Bad. Which… we know isn’t happening. What antiheroine things does Alina do and think? Like, she complains a couple of times and… is sad, and then a couple of times per book, she threatens a guy with murder and it’s the most compelling she ever gets. Her narration doesn’t show us much at all of her desiring vengeance or Being A Power Hungry Antiheroine Badass; her primary motivation is usually a) being left alone or b) nonexistent. So we, as the audience, aren’t really afraid of her becoming a villain or turning bad. What’s the conflict here, then?➽➽Forced conflict is kind of a general problem within book two between Alina and Mal, and though it lessens a bit here, there’s still this underlying feeling throughout the books that… the obstacles between Alina and Mal really aren’t that big? Yes, they’re in vastly different walks of life and that’s causing resentment on his part, but it really gets boring seeing them play out the same patterns over and over again.➽➽Nothing character-wise really grows or changes throughout the entire fucking series. I mean, think about Mal and Alina. Book one: Alina thinks Mal doesn’t like her back. Book two: Alina thinks Mal doesn’t like her back. Book three: Alina still thinks Mal doesn’t like her back, but also they can’t be together because... she thinks he doesn’t like her power back. But perhaps more importantly, think about Alina herself. Book one: Alina feels weak and not pretty enough, but also maybe she’s turning evil. Book two: Alina feels weak and not pretty enough, but also maybe she’s turning evil. Book three: Alina feels… maybe she’s turning evil. [But again, even if this weren’t repetitive, we as the audience don’t believe she’s turning evil!!]➽➽I said it in my  of book two, but as a general thought on this series: Leigh just will not let this get dark enough. Alina makes for such a compelling antihero, but the only real motivation we see for her most of the time is a desire to be left alone. And that’s just not as compelling or interesting as her need for vengeance, her darker side. ➽➽What was the plot? Where did it go? All they did was travel more and then I think the ending happened at one point maybe.✔✔I think the thing that really clearly improved in this book was the side character development. Tolya? Iconic. Nadia? Iconic bi. Tamar? Lesbian and iconic. Genya? So iconic. David? A good and totally iconic man. Zoya? Absolutely one of the most iconic characters in modern literature. Nikolai? I’d fucking give my life for Nikolai. I think this series gets that really good banter and those great character dynamics that I loved so much in Six of Crows, but watered down and we don't get enough of them because we're in Alina's head all the time. I really think Leigh Bardugo is meant to write multipov.So… let’s talk about the ending. Because it’s what everyone fights about. SPOILERS, obviously.✔✔Alina ending up with the Darkling would have been kind of fucked up. That did not occur.➽➽Did we ever resolve Alina's antiheroine shit? I don't think we did.✔✔I guess she murdered someone and that was cool.➽➽How the fuck did we resolve the Nikolai thing?✔✔The epilogue was nice. It was. I really don't hate the ending. ➽➽I mean, it would have been cool if we resolved like, anything other than Alina's character?✔✔y'all are going to kick me off Goodreads for this but I don't hate who she ended up with, he's kind of a bland character to me but like. i think from a character standpoint for her it makes sense➽➽But all that being said, Alina's character doesn't get the development needed for the ending to really make any sense or feel like a reasonable payoff for the character.Yeah, whatever. I'm giving this two and a half stars because it was somewhere between okay and I-liked-it. But I'm out here reading this  and realizing I didn't really like this all that much. It has a lot of narrative and structural flaws and the series as a whole has just been very consistently disappointing. Honestly recommend just skipping these for Six of Crows, the inventor of modern literature.

Claudia and Lydia are both excellent➽the fact that very casually Claudia is an ace lesbian and Lydia is bi. the solidarity of it all➽Simone being bi and closeted even in a situation where she’s not in danger: she’s just not ready and has had bad experiences, and the fact that the narrative is empathetic towards that and it’s also not the only experience in her life➽Simone’s drama passion feeling like such an important part of this narrative➽just in general I think this book does an amazing job of making Simone really multifaceted because that’s what human beings are like➽also, the drama teacher tea in this book. hit so close to home why are drama teachers Like That➽this one quote:(view spoiler)[  Last week, my health teacher made this long speech about how girls should spend their formative years discovering themselves and making close friends.

Again, very mixed feelings, so I’m going to start by talking about why this book is BETTER!First of all, way better plot! Bigger scope! Higher stakes! More interesting buildup! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN EVER! I know nothing really happens, but it manages to be so high tension anyway. Not to be all writer-y, but you can totally tell that Bardugo knows what she’s doing with dramatic tension now. She has that shit far more in control. And also there’s political intrigue with Nikolai and Vasili! Except this is the non-boring kind of political intrigue. I support this political intrigue and not the bad excuse for political intrigue the first book offers. Second of all, char-ac-ter-de-vel-op-ment. I suddenly like Alina! I suddenly really like Alina, who is exploring her dark side. Wish the narrative would let this series get as dark as it deserves to be and will discuss that down below!!As a last note, I know everyone says this, but I love Nikolai. I think my mother might actually be in love with Nikolai. This might have something to do with him being the only non-shitty guy in this whole love triangular pyramid. Mal crossed his arms and considered the privateer. ""I can't decide if you're crazy or stupid.""""I have so many good qualities,"" Nikolai said. ""It can be hard to choose.”The thing is, this book is a huge improvement over book one, but it’s still not really all that good? I will admit, on a small note, I thought the beginning of this book was kind of shitty. A thing happens in the first, like, four pages that negates everything that happened in the prologue or at the very end of the last book. Entire plot points could have been skipped. Why.→ the love pyramid ←All of you failed basic geometry, because this is not a love square, it is a love triangular pyramid. In which one of the ends is rotted, one is also maybe banging a different point of a different triangular pyramid, and one has zero chemistry with the point of the triangular pyramid but is so awesome that he’s the best option by default. Yeah, I don't like this triangle very much. Shocker. Mostly because the Darkling is a burnt chicken nugget and I hate him, and I might actually find his villain-y character really intriguing, but the fact that he is discussed as a viable love interest on this website is creepy. But the issue isn't even really with the love triangle! It's with the fact that the love triangle is there to build into love drama that takes away from the seriousness of the plot. So let's discuss the real trouble here:→ all the petty drama ←We Need To Talk About Mal. Who is suddenly an asshole and I understand why everyone likes Nikolai better. But... okay. I actually think his motivations make a lot of sense? Yeah, he's being a dick, but he's not being an abuser (as much of the discourse on book twitter has previously seemed to imply). More than anything, I'm simply bored by him.""'Not my type, but handsome.'My brows shot up. In my experience, Mal was just about everyone's type.""There’s this moment where Tamar says Mal “isn’t her type” and Alina is literally like “but Mal is EVERYONE’S type” and although A) I call bullshit on that, I also think it's absolutely hilarious that B) the line is meant to indicate Tamar is a lesbian. [Okay, yeah, I actually knew that going in.] → the real problem ←But the problem isn't even really with Mal. Or really with Alina. The problem is the narrative of this book just will not let this series get as dark as it deserves to be. This series is one about awful characters doing awful things in which the lead is basically slowly losing her humanity and the villain is maybe possibly doing it for the right reasons and the love interest is insecure and the princes are shitty and really, no one is doing the right thing, and certainly not for the right reasons. But it refuses to let itself be this. I keep feeling Bardugo come thiiis close to inner darkness and antihero power and then shying away. I respect that the YA market a few years ago was very different, that we ate up that Zoya-makes-Alina-jealous plotline and weren't so invested in Alina's glorious antiherodom. But I really think this series is wasted potential personified.Yeah. Those are my thoughts. I am not a fan.

When I completed it I started yelling audibly and my roommate, who was also awake, I believe may have become genuinely concerned for my sanity. Gideon the Ninth looked at me and said I could make her worse, and then it did, and it’s incurable. The gay people at my college own four collective copies of this and we pass it around to first years like a mini cult indoctrination and you now the worst part? It works. I cannot talk about the things about this book that make me genuinely crazy without getting into spoilers, so here is my short pitch: Lesbian necromancers in space, except the space part isn’t that relevant. In reality, it’s a And-Then-There-Were-None-esque murder mystery in which the two main characters are a buff lesbian with a sword and the most fucked up woman you have ever seen in your life. You will not solve the murder mystery. Gideon, the main character, makes the worst puns I have ever heard and it’s fantastic. I cannot even begin to explain how compelled I am by Harrow. No one in this book can be normal for more than ten seconds at a time. At least one meme will be quoted per book. I have never read anything more homoerotic in my life than the pool scene. I laughed. I also cried a lot. You should read it. Here are a few more detailed thoughts that I can give: Tamsyn Muir is genuinely fantastic at crafting a building narrative. You do not know how invested you are in Gideon the Ninth until the hits start coming, and by then Muir is ready to hit you with a punch. The first half is solid and interesting, but the last hundred pages are fully the best hundred pages of any book I have read in my life. (And it helps that her action writing is fantastic.)The main characters and side characters alike are so interesting. Harrow has the single most compelling backstory of any character I have had the delight of reading about. She has so many problems and I love her. Some highlights of the wider cast include Judith of the Second House; Ianthe and Coronabeth, incredibly abnormal twin heirs to the Third House; Palamedes and Camilla of the Sixth House, the latter of whom is honestly the most normal person in this book; and Dulcinea and Protesilaus, also normal people of the Seventh House. I am also obsessed with Gideon because she has just… the funniest narrative voice. Some examples?“I need to be inside you,” Harrowhark bellowed over the din.“Okay, you’re not even trying,” said Gideon.“Did you know that if you put the first three letters of your last name with the first three letters of your first name, you get ‘Sex Pal’?”Speaking of which I am. Embarrassingly invested. In the dynamic between Gideon and Harrowhark. I think about them all the time, by which I mean I’ve spent several days of my life consumed by thinking about them. I cannot say anything else at this time for legal reasons but just now that as if we are ever speaking I am pretending to be invested in our conversation but I am actually thinking about Gideon and Harrow. ___SPOILER SECTIONgay people: (view spoiler)[“I’ve lived my whole wretched life at your mercy, yours alone, and God knows I deserve to die at your hand. You are my only friend. I am undone without you.”Okay. Listen. I think there might be something wrong with me but this dynamic genuinely kills me. The desire in my heart for them to tenderly kiss on the lips is like a physical urge it’s tearing me apart. This might have been my joker origin story. (hide spoiler)]about harrow: (view spoiler)[I think “born a war crime” is a genuinely fascinating allegory for childhood trauma.

Patrick Ness really shines when given a basic thematic core to live off of; even a simple story like this feels super engrossing in the context of the gorgeous art. So what I like about this story is the commentary on war and prejudice. Within this story, the primary dynamic is between the whale world and the human world - the human world resents the whales as killers, and the whale world resents the humans as killers. And the world of whales lives in fear of a monstrous creature known as Toby Wick. The main theme here is the idea that a side of a war is not a monolith. Every person of a certain population is not the same, do not think the same. And villainizing one side, blaming a monolith for the sins of one, will not end well. The writing is a bit dry, and I'm sure it won't work for everyone, but I adored slipping into this mythic world, and I adored looking at the art. And the art wasn't even finished in my arc.

""I think of all my classmates, bent over textbooks, shoulders strained under heavy backpacks, eyes hooded from lack of sleep. We’re all in it together, whether we want to be or not.""You Asked For Perfect follows Ariel, a bisexual Jewish boy trying to become class valedictorian and later get into Harvard. BUT: his best friend Sook wants him in her band, he has fierce competition from fellow amazing student Pari, a failed quiz grade has other plans for him, and to top it all off, his math tutor Amir is just really crushworthy. This book did feel a little too slice-of-life for my personal tastes. The character arc is absolutely there, but it takes place over the course of a month, and it's honestly a fairly simple story in actual plot concept: boy can't be perfect, boy fails to be perfect and beats himself up over it, boy realizes he doesn't have to be perfect. What makes this stand out is the subject material, but I definitely wanted... a little bit more. I think the reason this will work for so many people is because it's just so entirely relatable. And if you'll forgive me, I had a lot of thoughts about academic pressure and high school. Ariel, the lead, is — I swear to god — so similar to many of my friends it kills me. But that's not to say I don't understand the academic pressure, because I completely do and I've been there in a lot of these situations. I've never been the friend who doesn't show up, but I've absolutely been the friend who doesn't make the effort, and who thinks too much about getting everything done. And I've also been the inferiority. I'm a really good student — I don't want to downplay that — but I've genuinely never been at valedictorian level grades. I go to an intense private school where being a good student makes you just sort of average and by those standards I'm not good at science and just okay at math, and reading this was so strange because a part of me almost felt jealous; not of the stress, because I've had that level of stress, but of the fact that valedictorian was a payoff in sight. And there is no part of me that wants to go to Harvard, and I'm actually ecstatic about the school that I'm going to, I think it would have been my favorite school whether it was an Ivy or not, and I am so glad that it wanted me in all of my humanities-student glory (I am, truly, a very good writer). But there's a part of me that was almost angry reading this book, that everyone is working so so hard and perfect is just what we expect from our students now.It's not just Ariel's parents, who are fine, or his teachers, who are putting pressure on him but not malicious. It's the pressure we all put on ourselves. And I know me ranting about this does absolutely nothing to solve the actual problem. But I think it might be worth considering, to the high school students that follow me — you don't have to go to Harvard to be the smartest person in any room. And it is amazing to ace classes, I completely understand just how important it feels, but no amount of acing your classes will make you the most interesting person in any room. And this sounds dumb, because you've heard it, but you really, really can get into college without being the valedictorian, and you really, really don't need to be at Harvard, or even be Harvard material, to be an incredibly brilliant, interesting person. Can I tell you a secret? I never would have gotten into Harvard. And you know what, I could have tried, maybe. I could have dropped this blog and stopped reading and stopped doing the school shows and stopped talking to my friends and stuck with Mock Trial and done math homework in my English classes and gritted my teeth through that godawful biology class just to get an A. But instead, I took my SAT one time and wrote my common app on this blog and my essay on the legacy of being a very-out and super-friendly lesbian at the school, and I'm going to the right school for me. So maybe the real secret is that we all need to work on drawing our self-worth from school. And maybe get a cute significant other, spend some time with our siblings, talk to our Rabbis, go to all our friend's band performances, and get some sleep. release date: 5 March 2019✨Arc received from the publisher via Netgalley for an honest . 💜Buddyread with the wonderful Kaylin!Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,309,1,"Jan 16, 2019","Jan 17, 2019","Mar 10, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33299465-you-asked-for-perfect

Everything about this fantasy commentary on misogynoir just hit exactly at the mark, and I devoured it in two days out of sheer enjoyment. I know I’ll keep Tavvia and Effie with me for a long, long time. A Song Below Water follows sisters Tavia and Effie, the former of whom is a siren—a magical metaphor for misogynoir—and the latter of whom might be cursed. This fast-paced YA fantasy novel has a fantastically creative premise, but the execution doesn’t take that for granted—instead, it pays attention to the humanity of each character. These two each feel so fleshed out. Tavia has a passion for song, a complex relationship with her father, a complex ex named Priam, and a loving relationship with care tutorial maker Camilla Fox; Effie has a job playing a mermaid at Hidden Scales fair, a long-term love affair with a coworker named Elric, and significant trauma with sprites. Their character quirks and interests make them each instantly compelling and a treat to root for. I particularly adored Effie, but each narrator resonated with me in different ways. I think fantasy metaphors for racism and systematic oppression are both fantastically easy to get wrong and, when done right, can be stupendous. Morrow’s handling of this particular element is brilliant, and one of the best examples I’ve seen in recent years. Overall, this book instantly grabbed me and was a treat the whole way through.

Also correct in every aspect except for all the facts, like something out of a historical adventure serial.Amazing. As always.I’ve written a full  for the Murderbot series before, so I guess the biggest thing I have to say about this conclusion novella is that it sticks to everything it has already succeeded at. This series is… so much fun, and also one of my favorite examples of playing with tropes I’ve ever seen. Robots-turning-human stories often utilize the trope of the robot falling in love. This is a trope we have all read before and been annoyed by before. This series? No romance. No romantic feelings. Murderbot is growing feelings, yes, but platonic feelings.The thing I really, really, really like about these is how they play with the trope of the close-to-human-being who reads as non-neurotypical. I think often when books use or incite this trope, it’s for a side character or evil character, and it just kind of reads awful. But I personally love this trope when done well.I think neuroatypical people are very, very used to seeing themselves in mostly villains. But more importantly, I think we are very used to seeing ourselves as outsiders - we project ourselves onto characters who are considered monstrous by the rest of the world because they don’t feel in the same way everyone else does. That’s… me, and it has always been me. I obsess over media because it is one of the lenses through which I first saw the world. I avoid being emotional in front of other people because I have taught myself to hide my emotions. I overcommunicate and feel too much [had to get that Hayley Kiyoko reference in]. But I am also a human being, even if it’s sometimes hard for people to see me as such.So though it may sound weird, the fact that this series writes a character who reads as somewhat non-neurotypical, but is not villainized for this, and is constantly framed as a good person trying to do their best - that means a lot to me. Well, and also they’re really funny. It was just announced that Martha Wells is coming out with more, and I honestly cannot wait.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,101,1,"Jul 04, 2018","Jul 04, 2018","Mar 03, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35519109-exit-strategy

When you’ve never been given any, you feel the lack of them your whole life.”Emotionally, I feel like I was just hit by an entire truck.In the city of Janloon, jade rules: those with have power, and those without lose it. Those with jade, though, must fight to keep it, and nowhere is this more true than between the No Peak and the Mountain clans. Jade City follows the Kauls, leaders of the No Peak clan, as they attempt to hold power with their grandfather Kal-Sen dying. The best way to describe Jade City would be… tense. Despite the length, this book is genuinely stressful from start to finish. Lee’s talent is at building a world that seems tense, but generally okay… and then breaking things down, bit by bit. The setup is intriguing, sure, but the real satisfaction (and tears) comes in seeing it all fall to pieces. There’s a grand focus on setup and payoff, especially with regards to characters. Kekon, the country, is a fully realized location, with history and intrigue that feels imagined even when not relevant to the plot. One of the most standout elements of this book is the constant feeling that you’re a part of a context you’ve barely seen: we focus on Janloon, but we see hints of something outside. (I’m interested to see what the series does with this.)It really helps that the characters are so easy to invest in. Jade City does a fantastic job of building its characters into distinct people with distinct motivations, but making us root for all of them. The relationships between the family are so vivid and real: even when we feel the conflict between sister and brother, we also see the love between them. Before this ends, let’s run this down by the numbers. Cast of Characters:Main players: →Shae, sister who left Kekon for study, chasing an ex, Gerald. Her conflict is about finding her identity apart from her family. Everyone tries to forgive her, but she is the one who’s been wronged. →Hilo, the Horn, charismatic but simultaneously the most ruthless of the family. Should be the least likable and yet is so deeply endearing. →Lan, the Pillar, the diplomatic leader. He is supportive to Shae, kind to those he loves. This is a conflict, though, too: how can he rule, without doing what needs to be done? →Anden, cousin and adopted son to the Kauls, lives at a nearby academy. Gay icon. His conflict is about growing into his power, and what that means. →Wen, girlfriend to Hilo, smart and always ready to plan. We also have: →Doru, Weatherman of No Peak, advisor to Kal-Sen. →Barrow, a failed kidnapper who falls in with Moot, informer for the Mountain. →Gom Ash, Horn of the Mountain, who walked away from a death of consequence. →Ayt Mada, Pillar of the Mountain. Certified badass.

After a really interesting and excellent beginning, I think this has stagnated pretty hard – the stakes feel a bit low for the story being told. Edgar's romance with Sarah Elmira Royster and desire to stay at UVA are just not high enough stakes; knowing the history, I'm really struggling to get invested. I think this spends too much time introducing the characters, and the horror just isn’t terrifying enough to hold up the book. The Raven's Tale plays with the idea of art as a rebellion something others attempt to suppress; one of the narrators is Lenore, Edgar Allan Poe's muse. The characterization of this book holds that the father has pushed his muse, Cassandra, into a fire, which is fascinating. The first 15% was really fantastic; I just think the ideas haven’t gone any further.

That I tried not to think about that kind of stuff, because it was painful, because I thought I could ever have it, but when I did end up liking someone, it always made me ache right down to my core. I realized pretty early on that the who didn't really matter so much. That anybody who listens to me, I end up loving them just a little.Heartbreaking, hopeful, and impossible to look away from. I am really loving this recent trend in YA thrillers of killer women. Books like The Female of the Species, Far From You, Big Little Lies, Black Iris, Dangerous Boys, The Girl from the Well, and Dare Me. What do all of these have in common? They are about women taking back power from men who hurt women.I think the narratives we are used to give men the agency, and it is so interesting to see the trend of women fighting back. So what is this book? Sadie follows podcaster West McCray, a mid20s man investigating a two-sister disappearance for posterity. And in scenes throughout, we see Sadie herself, off to kill her sister’s murderer. There’s not exactly a wide cast of characters for a novel, but Sadie makes up for it. Sadie is such a fantastic lead character; she’s out for a revenge, bitter and angry, a sexual assault victim, pansexual, grew up poor, and has a major stutter. I absolutely adored her, and watching her go further down this awful track was so horrifying. There’s a really interesting element of this book where, at least in the arc copy, no one in the book really does anything beyond imply pedophilia until around 60% of the way through the book, when Sadie asks a man point-blank whether he's a pedophile. It’s a horrifying reality for Sadie; it’s a simple accepted fact of her life. And she attempts to push it down, but when the sentence is finally said, when Sadie finally calls it out, I winced so strongly. That element is just one facet of the horror of this book - that Sadie knows it's wrong, and yet she refuses to say it. Courtney Summers does not shy away from the harsh realities of this world - the contrast between poverty and wealth, the idea that privileged people often get away with horrifying deeds, the lack of agency given to girls in our society. I really think the most accurate description of this is stark. I could not look away, but I think it was worth it. This will haunt me for a very long time.

The lace gloves on her hands were just visible, though their color had faded to a pale gray.“How did you-”“Deduction. And a certain empathy born of like experience.”god, this was so good. it's a really fucking awesome reimagining of Sherlock Holmes but they're both black sapphic ladies and also, it takes place in a post-Trump era, and also, it's a political thriller. [this feels like it should be a solid recommendation all on its own.]So I have not read Sherlock Holmes, but I do know from general life experience [and from watching this hilariously dedicated literary analysis, like, eight times] that it is episodic in nature. Something this does not do, as an adaptation, is act episodic in nature. Another thing this does not quite do, as an adaptation, is give you the clues and let you figure it all out. Also, Irene Adler is a villain. I think. This is slightly disappointing. However, the element this novel chooses to adapt well is the characterization of the two leads, and personally, I thought that was pitch perfect. So I mean, the plot is fine, but the best part of the book? The characterization. I mean, first of all, there are the two lead characters themselves. Watson is super well-written and one of my new fave characters of the year. She’s the focal character here, disabled and dealing with ptsd and constantly stressed. Oh, and Holmes is this gloriously sarcastic and enigmatic character who also feels human. All of the Holmes-is-completely-a-dick narratives can go fuck themselves; this Holmes is occasionally a dick, yeah, but she's also a genuinely loving and caring person who wants to use her smarts for good.And then there’s the centerpoint of the novel, and the reason I loved it so much: the relationship between Watson and Holmes. Their dynamic is this weird in-between where they're best friends but also Watson is just so Tired™ of Holmes but also they have a vague amount of romantic chemistry, and it's kind of the best thing about the whole damn book. I still kind of want them to be girlfriends, but I… also am happy with their current relationship? Which I actually think is the authorial intent and I. Love. It. I found their dynamic so effortlessly compelling and interesting and fun.This is also the first book I’ve read that feels very much like fiction that is… explicitly a reaction to the Trump presidency. So let’s talk about that. In recent months, we have seen an incredible immigration crisis – in which children, down to preschool age – were separated from parents. This is a crisis author could have in no way known of when she wrote this book, yet the book itself is explicitly a book about an America in which political discourse has become tinged in racism and discrimination no matter which faction you belong to.Which is… harrowing. And accurate.I’m wondering how this novel will hold up in five years, but still, it’s a frightening portrayal of a world gone wrong; just not in the overt, dystopian way. It’s gone just wrong enough that people like Janet Watson, a disabled veteran and a sapphic black woman, would feel it. Would hurt because of it. But not wrong enough that it feels like a far cry from our society, which is perhaps the most terrifying thing of all. We are so complicit when we want to be. The world is horriying and the way that we as human beings use the media we produce and consume to deal with it is fascinating. Anyway. On the whole, I thought this was excellent. Like this year’s earlier Witchmark, despite my feelings that the plot was hovering somewhere around “just good,” the character dynamic is so completely 20/10, and I adored all the themes and various existential tensions so much that I just can’t not five star this.

That’s how I feel about this book. This has all the good qualities of really good romance [well-used tropes, story beats we can sense but still aren’t bored by, interesting and likable characters] and then all the good qualities of a good fantasy novel [great worldbuilding, compelling thematic journey] and then all the good qualities of a murder mystery [murder! intrigue! maybe family being evil? we'll just have to see!] and it is so so lovely. Witchmark is sort of steampunk-fantasy murder-mystery with paranormal romance vibes set in a world inspired by WWI Britain, following a witch disguising himself as a doctor to avoid being essentially enslaved by his sister, Grace.→worldbuilding←So first of all, the worldbuilding of this book is completely excellent. The inspiration for this book is super palpable and clear and it works very well. I don't tend to get that into worldbuilding, but this world is just imaginative enough and just obscure enough to feel enthralling. →plot & pacing←I mean, see what I said above about tropes used well; the plot isn't necessarily the most original thing ever, but it has some good moments. This murder mystery, especially, is super interesting. This book is full of twists and cool reveals and interesting points. And also… I kind of devoured this? Aside from the first hundred pages, I binged the entire thing in a night, and I was so addicted.→characters←I really liked both Tristan & Miles as characters. Miles especially has a lot of inner depth, and his conflict over his family is really well-done and lovely, and also I talked about him more below, and he means a lot to me. And then there’s the romance between Miles & Tristan. And… so listen, this romance does have a bit of instalove going on. But their dynamic is so lovely and full of care and I am so into it.→themes←So first of all, I would die for the way agency is tackled in this book. Miles is absolutely driven by his need for agency, for independence, for release from being under the boot of his family. And even when he’s offered freedom within that role, he doesn’t want it because he knows that freedom would be conditional. He knows it could be taken away at any moment. It's also a very good exploration of class privilege. I really love discussions of agency and I think this book really did a great job playing with it. I also love everything my blogger friend Acqua mentioned here. I was confused at first about why another book is coming [I want more but this wrapped up so well!!] and it turns out it’s focusing on Grace, a character I liked but was not obsessed with. But I'm still super super excited. But basically, I would die for this book. I would die for the Super Important Agency Focus and I would die for the plot twists and I would definitely die for Tristan and Miles. This is one of my favorite books I’ve read this year and I would totally add it to your list of 2018 releases, because it is not to be missed.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,321,1,"Jun 04, 2018","Jun 06, 2018","Feb 19, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36187116-witchmark

This book… is not its blurb, and I am disappointed by that.A love story stitched across time and war, shaped by the power of books, and ultimately destroyed by it. In the heart of World War II, Tom and Ben became lovers. Brought together by a secret project designed to hide British targets from German radar, the two founded a love that could not be revealed. When the project went wrong, Tom and Ben vanished into nothingness, presumed dead. Their bodies were never found. Now the two are lost in time, hunting each other across decades, leaving clues in books of poetry and trying to make their desperate timelines overlap.[I actually think I understand this blurb more than I understand this book.] Okay. So Time Was is marketed as a love story across time. It is not. This is a 70-page manifesto of a modern-day historian and a sort of testimonial as to how this character discovered these two lovers were time travelers. Which is fine as a mystery / suspense premise. But as a book marketed as an angsty-in-a-good-way, speculative-fiction-y romance? Really disappointing. Because, really, I am just disappointed in the idea of this as a romance book. There are short pov chapters from Tom and Ben, but their romance is - don’t kill me - pretty bland. And the ending.... hm. Okay, very real spoilers ahead:(view spoiler)[Ben dies. Under incredibly confusing circumstances. But really, can’t even have the gays as the focal point and now you want to get away with burying them? Nah. (hide spoiler)]Like... I'm not crazy here, right? This does feel kind of distasteful, right?Perhaps even more confusing, given this blurb, is half the book being buildup to the reveal that, wow, those two mysterious lovers from World War II were - wait for it - T I M E T R A V E L E R S!

I call bullshit because this was masterful.If you have read this book and also follow my s, you know the topic of abuse is one I sort of talk about a lot. this book got it right. this book got it so, so right. So let’s talk about why.→ character work ←I knew I would love Lily from the moment she stood up at her abusive father’s funeral and refused to speak. And oh boy, was I right. Lily works so well as a protagonist because she isn’t the archetype. She has been through abuse herself and she is so, so sure it would never happen to her. She would leave if even one thing happened. She would. ...But then she doesn’t. She reads as absolutely, totally real. And her character development? Fucking iconic. → friendship focus ←Something that really bothers me a lot in romances like this is that a romance tends to save the protagonist, and I think this book - despite marketing that made me concerned this trope would rear its ugly head - does the opposite. The lead friendship here between Lily and Alys is so 20/10 and so important. And even though there is a touch of romance, I think the book is very explicit about it not being healthy for Lily to jump right into a new relationship. I appreciate that a lot. → narrative treatment ←I think this is one of the only books I have ever read that actually seems to understand that abuse is a mortal sin. The wild thing is, aside from his moments of extreme rage, Rylin never appears to be that bad of a guy. He apologizes every time. He continuously seems to account for Lily’s feelings. But his actions against her are enough. There is no question in the narrative on whether she was being unempathetic: Lily was right to leave, no matter how he treated her in the aftermath. And I think that means a lot to me, how his character is nuanced but also irredeemable for Lily. I mean, aside from these three things, everything about this novel was basically good - the writing is extremely clean and easy-to-read, there are some really really funny moments, the romance that does end up occurring is genuinely sweet, and it's overall a win - but on a personal level? I am destroyed. This book is not just good, this book is Fantastic. and that's my opinion. goodnight.

Do you think my body couldn't decide what it wanted to be?”4 1/2 stars. This was so good. Living on the lower levels of a worldship from which there is no escape, a group of characters live constantly struggling to survive, as Aster attempts to figure out coded messages from her mother… and perhaps a route off the ship.I think to me, this book is about collective trauma within a community. While Aster is perhaps one of the most okay members of the community, we see in every interaction between her and the people around her that she is struggling.I have never been much a fan of worldbuilding, but I really think it is at the heart of this book - the world is a fundamental part of these characters and forms the very thematic core of the novel. There’s a lot of thematic discussion of colorism via the structure of the ship. I’ve kind of alluded to this, but Aster and her friends are on the lower levels of the ship, where most of the inhabitants are black and brutality from the upper-deck “owners” is the norm. The upper-deckers of the ship are white. Within the book, this functions almost as a sci-fi version of American slavery with even less of an escape route. Another really major dynamic within the story is queer acceptance, and the fact that while lower-deckers live in a less cisheteronormative environment, upper-deckers are very confined by gender norms. I don’t know if this is the intent, but it kind of echoes the fact that gender-normaitivity was artificially forced on many cultures in Africa that did not have such strict roles previously, or that interacted with these roles in very different ways. Certain decks on this ship use all they/them pronouns, and then are often misgendered by upper deck members. It's this incredibly subtle part of the story and it is brutal to read. As you might have gotten from that paragraph, this is really not an emotionally easy book to read [though a very readable one]. You really should be prepared for that going in. There is a lot of racist & transphobic violence [major trigger warning for that] and it is... often not easy to read.Oh, and also, I really like all of the leads. Aster is queer, autistic, and black, and written with so much dimension and honesty. I love how she's written - her thought process is very consciously rigid compared to the voices of characters like Theo and Giselle, and she has a strict view of the world that is not shared by other characters within the ship. Meanwhile, Theo is quiet and as kind as he can be given his situation - he’s above Aster on the ship’s heirerchy. Aster and Theo both describe themselves as not being girl or boy, and are both very much written as nonbinary [the quote from the top of the page is Aster speaking, and the author is agender themselves!]. Side characters such as Giselle are similarly well-written, effortlessly gaining audience sympathy even as they anger us. The problem is mostly that the plot is really all over the place, which makes the story feel unbalanced and the ending… unearned. I personally think Katie describes it super well in this  - the plot is 1) not driven by the characters, and so lacking in agency and 2) lacking in full conclusion. I love these characters, but they didn't push the plot forward, and that disappointed me. Honestly, the amount I loved it anyway should say a lot about the strength of the characters and the strength of the thematic core - despite some plot structure elements feeling a bit first-draft, it's impossible not to fall in love. audiobook: recommended. I utterly adore the voicing of this narrator, and their shifts between voices for different points of view were really spectacular. Yeah, anyway, the point is: I really enjoyed this novel. I think the plot could have used editing, but there is just so much worth reading here. This is a book and an author definitely worth your attention.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,379,1,"Apr 24, 2018","May 14, 2018","Feb 18, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34381254-an-unkindness-of-ghosts

I honestly think This Mortal Coil is bit of your typical plot-twisty-but-not-very-quality YA sci-fi, and although some things stood out, I just didn’t love it.The obvious upside of this book is that it is just... really wild. The broad concept of worldbuilding is sort of terrifying — I mean, a disease that causes people to explode and leads those in the vicinity to try and eat them? Holy shit. Suvada is truly not afraid to get into the gore of the premise, meaning things get kind of hardcore — someone gets their ear bitten off? There are so many twists and reveals that I’m sure you’ll be surprised somewhere, including a twist in act three that I… okay, I did see it coming, but I liked it anyway. The big problem here is that I just found this one very hard to connect with. You all know what a slut I am for character-driven stories, and while I actually liked the protagonist of this story, I never connected with her. I will fully admit that she is kind of a badass and this only makes it more sad that I didn’t connect with her.I was also disappointed by the focus on the unnecessary love triangle. One of the love interests is just not even a bit necessary. I do not exaggerate, this book would barely even change if he weren’t a love interest. The other is just kind of bland. Like… he’s fine, I don’t hate him, but his characterization is nonexistent. He goes from Bad Boy to Soft Boy by the second as if he’s trying to hit every YA trope at once, and overall just reads bland.So overall, this was interesting, but I don’t think I’ll be continuing. Something plot-driven and well-paced like this would’ve been enough for a standalone.

But a three star rating still means I liked it, and I think if you actually like detective mysteries [in which the lead goes back to the small town and then has to solve Two Related Crimes] you’ll like this far more than I did. Let’s roll up in here with some compliments. One thing that I really liked and appreciated about this book was that it’s really dark, but doesn’t lose a fundamental sense of humanity by using that darkness for shock value. I think the author realizes that we will be sufficiently horrified by one or two inciting events and then knows where to let our horror take over. This feels very nice and natural. And the characters don’t suck; they’re all sort of given backstories and nuance. I really liked the explanation behind one red herring because it gave a lot of depth to a character I’d not liked. It’s also fairly atmospheric. On a side note.And then there’s the fact that - this should not be revolutionary but it actually totally is - I was actually surprised by the murderer reveal. I did not expect who it was, and I thought the motive especially is something you would not have expected. Actually, I think the motive reveal is fairly brilliant, as it plays off audience expectations as to what the motive for a crime like this might have been.Okay. That’s done. It wasn’t awful. You might like it. Now let me complain. Because you know what, I think this book doesn’t do enough with the Three Big Things It Has Going For It. Good characters, good atmosphere, and a good killer reveal should be all you need, but they are not. Just as in several of the books I have read recently, we never really see our characters break down. Aaron Falk is a character who we get a sense of, but never a character who we actually see break down. The murder reveal at the end offers hardly any emotional impact for him. The atmosphere is there and it's good, absolutely. But I really didn’t get enough out of it? Creepy-small-town-in-environmental-disaster is super overdone at this point, and you have to do something new with it to really get me, and this book just… doesn’t?And then there’s also that the murder reveal and plot element suffers from two things. First of all, the murder reveal suffers due to a lack of actual love for these characters. It was surprising, but it didn’t Change Me As A Person because I wasn’t that invested in the characters. And second, this really suffers from having the exact same setup as every one of these books ever, from the small-town return to the crime in the past that is somehow connected to this one to the small-town returner being hated by fucking everyone. Like, this is just so deeply unoriginal, and I never really liked this trope much anyway? What the fuck, this has the exact same setup as Tana French’s In The Woods. So, um, I wasn’t obsessed.

There is something to be said for really interesting books that had you expecting mediocrity.The Opposite Of Here follows four friends on a cruise ship journey when the lead believes she has seen a boy fall off the ship. This hit a lot of my criteria for thrillers I can love. It is very eerie. It plays quite well off innate human fear - in this case, claustrophobia and the fear of losing your mind. It has actual plot twists and a sense of I-don't-quite-know-where-this-is-going. And okay, yeah, this is not exactly the most objectively high-quality book ever published, but we know that. As vaguely mediocre YA thrillers go, this is just about the best you can ever do. I read this in an hour. I got chills down my spine. I did not predict everything, for once. And I adored all the characters.But I think what sets this book apart from other YA thrillers in this vein is the subversiveness. If you're expecting a simple story, you will not get it. This story explores a lot of darker themes than I was expecting [I've put trigger warnings below] and is very much a she-did-that thriller.The Opposite Of Here really stuck out to me because of its feminist undertones and subversion of tired tropes. Not going to lie, I started this book expecting a huge element of girl hate. Group of friends in a cabin, possible conflict, this will be a thriller with the normal stereotypical “bitchy” drama to top it off. Booooooring. And then… it becomes a story about the strength of friendship between girls. A major conflict between two leads that I thought would have been shitty and boring end up being about some really deep and awful things in the girls’ past. Similarly, the book sets up a generic love triangle and then subtly does... exactly what you don’t expect out of it. There are some really significant feminist themes in general; one of the major themes ends up being - yes, this is a spoiler - (view spoiler)[the lead character’s sexual assault. (hide spoiler)]Something I really appreciated was the devotion to Hitchcock references and aesthetic. So many callbacks to Vertigo. And assorted other movies that I have not seen. So. Much. Aesthetic. Altebrando’s main method of showing her character’s current state of mind is through little tiny two-line Hitcockian sketches written for a film teacher’s assignment. These sketches starts out super funny and end up super creepy as the book progresses. I feel like this kind of device could end up gimmicky, but it’s not - it’s SO effective in making you love the lead. Some of the sketches are sad, some are amusing, some are horrifying, some amazing. [this is a very real spoiler, but - (view spoiler)[ you sexually assaulted me at a party. SHE REALLY DID THAT. (hide spoiler)] Anyway. If you're looking for an actually-good YA page turner that will give you something a little different, this is absolutely recommended.

The main cThe Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a thriller following an investigation into the murder of a girl who is murdered every singe night. The main character switches bodies every day in an attempt to get different points of view. And yes, it is wild.So the thing I’ve seen praised about this book is that the plot is ridiculously complex, and it very much is. I am in awe over the tight plotting used in this book. This must have taken a very long outline and the complexity certainly makes this stand out. I think, however, that the marketing has been very focused on plot twists - I was only seriously shocked by a few twists reading this book, and I’ve already forgotten what, exactly, it was. The delight in this book is not in plot twists, but in seeing the full story come together. I will say that the actual ending, though I predicted parts of it, had enough surprises that it was still delightful. As with many adult thrillers, I struggled to connect to or care about any of the characters. The lead character is almost completely lacking in personality, which makes sense given the entire theme of him being absorbed into bodies, but doesn’t work, as we’re led to believe that he is in constant danger of becoming something awful but never given details to notice or a reason to care. There’s a way of writing a compelling character with amnesia; high motivation, people around them we care about, etc, and this book doesn’t do a great job. I was mostly, however, really disappointed by the bodies Aiden switches into: almost every person he occupies is a dislikable person. Bell is quite boring and later revealed to be terrible, Mr. Collins spends his entire day in agony, Ravencourt is terrible (and for unrelated reasons his section was my absolute least favorite of the book). That’s just the first three, and I will not be going into the rest because they get much worse. Something I really enjoyed about this book, however, was the message - this book is very focused on realizing the changeability of people, and though I never cared about any of these characters much, I did find myself believing in and enjoying the message. I think this message is probably the most daring the book ever gets. ..So I actually considered and came very close to rating this book a four star, but I found myself forgetting it very quickly. With a thriller of this type, I usually would have kept my rating a four no matter how much I forgot. However, the fatphobia in this book was utterly ridiculous. I found it rather disturbing to read such an absolute distate from the narrator and author for the fatness of the character he inhabits: Ravencourt is described as a “pig” and a “cow” over and over, and repeatedly described as “disgusting” with seemingly no regard for his humanity. The voyeuristic imagery of fatness is, exclusively and completely, meant to disgust and shock the audience. It is the main thread of a good 20% of the book. a few quotes are stated here, and this er only got to the beginning of this section, at 20%, so can I just say: it’s like, five times that many. I found this incredibly distasteful from about the third comment on, and the near-constant repetition of this rhetoric had me wanting to put the book down. I'm really wondering what the authorial intent is here, and perhaps more importantly, how the author must interact with overweight people in his own life.I also felt that rape was used as a plot device in a way that made me somewhat uncomfortable – SPOILER: (view spoiler)[a bunch of the book is told through the pov of a person who committed a rape approximately two hours before, and it’s criticized, but… the impacts on the victim are very much ignored. (hide spoiler)] This is a huge and very common issue in literary fiction, but I also hated it and it impacted my enjoyment of this as a thriller.So… despite many good elements, I kind of just want to tell you to read The Westing Game instead.

This is Lovecraftian horror, and for that I have to compliment: it is very, very disturbing. The entire book is a journey in how far your mind can take you to dark places, in how to terrify human beings without ever really being specific about what we are meant to be terrified by. It is a book that forces you to stare into the void and then beg someone to look back.It’s excellently written, mysterious enough to be compelling, and a bit existential. So, I’ve been super complementary of this, but I also three starred. And that’s because I am not a horror person at all. I was expecting a lot of cool worldbuilding and cool character development and then horror as one aspect of a whole. But the sheer level of horror was kind of… all I got out of this book. Especially as it’s a novella, causing existential fear is the end-all-be-all of this book.But I will also say that as a whole, this narrative is so confusing that I ended it feeling as if I had gotten nothing out of the book as a whole.

I really didn't love Shadow and Bone - actually, I kind of hated it - and subsequent books only disappointed me more. It was only my love for Six of Crows that kept me a fan of this world. But guys, this is a leaps-and-bounds improvement on the Grisha in terms of everything: the sheer writing quality, the thought put into the plot, the character development. All in all, while this wasn't perfect, it was a worthy and entertaining entry into this world.“All fuels burn differently. Some faster, some hotter. Hate is one kind of fuel. But hate that began as devotion? That makes for another kind of flame.”I have always been a total sucker for post-war storylines - the post-chaos world of Six of Crows was always incredibly compelling to me, and this was possibly even better. Nikolai and Zoya are attempting to pick the pieces of their country up, hanging on by a delicate thread, as meanwhile, Nina attempts to save as many Grisha as possible. It's a situation in which there is no grand rebellion to have, no grand war - only a slow attempt at progress towards a better future. And it is fascinatingAnd I absolutely loved how this book handled generational trauma. The people of Ravka have only ever had kings and dictators and each leader has been worse than the last. And it is the Grisha who have suffered most, in the second army, under the Darkling, in each moment. It is utterly horrifying to realize the truth of how much this has affected every one of these people. I think King of Scars does an excellent job discussing agency, and the way everyone is victimized when war and oppression ravage a country. It's interesting - though the second half of this book is undoubtedly the faster one, I enjoyed my journey through the first half far more. The second half let me down, as we'll address later, but guys, the character development here is just so amazing. Notably, Leigh Bardugo has clearly hit her stride in third person pov - her ability to quickly craft interesting, developed, compelling leads cannot be overemphasized. King of Scars was, admittedly, pretty slow, but I had absolutely no trouble getting engaged, and it is all because of her character work. Here, we're following four leads:→Zoya, a Grisha general close to the king and attempting to work through her trauma. →Nikolai, the struggling but charismatic king of Ravka, who happens to be hiding a demon inside him. →Nina, a Grisha spy going home to bury her love in Fjerda, and maybe get in deeper along the way. →Isaak, the only ""new"" character, a soldier plucked from obscurity to impersonate the king.(I also appreciated cameos by characters like Genya, David, Tamar, and Tolya; these four were some of my favorite characters in the original Grisha series, and I loved seeing them get involved.)You cannot protect yourself from suffering. To live is to grieve. You are not protecting yourself by shutting yourself off from the world. You are limiting yourself.Three of these four lead characters are written exceptionally well, but Zoya's character arc is just incredible. Zoya started off as a bit of a mean girl character in the Grisha trilogy - a bit part, albeit an interesting one. Yet here, she shows her badass side and her more vulnerable one.He thought he had grown used to his scars, but he had never grasped how much of his will it would take to hide them.Nikolai's fate in the Grisha is definitely left a bit open for more development, and trust me, despite not being the star, he gets some great progression. In the Grisha, Nikolai is left as a part-monster, something he and Zoya desperately wish to solve. And in many ways, he is an actual King of Scars: his emotional scars, and his physical ones. Seeing him work through these was one the best parts of the book. There's a detail involving a childhood friend of his that I thought was just so sad, and beautifully written, that I cried. “Call me Grisha. Call me zowa. Call me death, if you like.'”Nina in this book does not have a huge arc - actually, I felt her plot was more of a setup for her role in book two. But I still really loved my time reading her chapters. Her arc surrounding mourning, and surrounding revenge, is exceptionally well-written, and her plotline is tense, with high stakes and several new side characters. I was not expecting to be obsessed with the fate of Fjerda in a post-parem world, but I really liked what was done here: the idea of Nina staying a soldier, a girl who has changed the fate of history remaining unknown, is so interesting. There’s a bit where Nina encounters a girl addicted to parem, and the raw echoing of her soul at that moment is just… so difficult and so well written. And I loved her two side characters, including Adric and Leoni (who was? saved? by Jesper’s mom?) There's also a line where she fondly talks of “that little bastard Kaz” and I laughed so hard I cried.Isaak is the only character here who's new to the book, and I felt that though his storyline was incredibly interesting, Bardugo didn't do as great a job with giving us a reason to care about him. In sharp contrast with the other three, I felt more invested in his plot than in his character development. I also, in a move surprising to both me and everyone else, really liked the romance. Nikolai and Zoya were an unexpected pairing, and yet... I love them? Their dynamic is so funny, most of the time, and then there are these little tender moments between the two that I absolutely love. Zoya is a character who does not trust in love, and seeing her consider letting someone back in was heartwrenching. (view spoiler)[The moment where Nikolai turns into a monster instinctually to save Zoya was just... incredible. One of the best scenes of the book. (hide spoiler)] And I'm also shocked and disappointed to not have heard more about Nina and her very-slow-burning enemies-to-lovers dynamic with Hanne, a Fjerdan Grisha girl. Hanne is a super well-written character and I really liked getting to know her; I think this couple will get more development in book two, but even what they have here is amazing. “We are all connected, King Nikolai. The Grisha, the Fold, the power inside you. The Fold is a wound that may never heal. But perhaps it was not meant to.”Unfortunately, I found the second half of this book... disappointing. From around 60% on, I struggled to suspend my disbelief on Zoya and Nikolai's plotline; it felt like a very odd, reaching extension of the general Grisha magic system. Bardugo also utilizes in a couple of plot reveals about two hours before the end, involving characters Secretly Being Shady, that I thought were so incredibly obvious they were barely plot twists. (view spoiler)[The saint? Yuri? The princess? The fact that I wasn't surprised by a single one of the three says something. (hide spoiler)] Nina's plotline, thankfully, was the best of the back half of the book. In contrast to my earlier comments, the plot reveals here were excellent, with well-done slow buildup; there are two specifically, one at the very end of the book, that I absolutely adored. I think Nina is going down a really dark path and I'm excited to see what happens next.There is one ending reveal here that I think people are going to be very torn on, as it removes a very large repercussion of the Grisha trilogy. (view spoiler)[I have never been a fan of bringing back defeated villains. (hide spoiler)] I, personally, can't decide how I felt about it. Possibly, this is because I was spoiled about this particular reveal and was expecting it to go down very differently; thus, I was pleasantly surprised by the actual manner of this twist. (view spoiler)[There's an interesting setup here - the Darkling is here, but under control. It could be a trainwreck. Possibly. Or it could be FASCINATING. (hide spoiler)] I just hope Leigh Bardugo knows what she's doing.“A handsome monster husband who put a crown on her head? It’s a perfect fairy tale to sell to some starry-eyed girl. She can lock you in at night and kiss you sweetly in the morning, and Ravka will be secure.”Anyway, I genuinely enjoyed this book. It was certainly slower, but there were some excellent elements here, especially in terms of character development. And though the ending was a little disappointing, I think it sets up an excellent sequel. I can't wait to see what happens next.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,355,1,"Jan 30, 2019","Mar 02, 2019","Feb 13, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36307634-king-of-scars

Special shoutout to the audiobook narrator for adding to this effect! I don’t know who the hell this narrator is, but she is a Talent. She’s also trans, which I think let her understand the experiences far better than a cis reader might have.

I liked them a lot while reading, but ing this, I’m sort of thinking of them as Religious Girl, The Gay One, and The One I Don’t Even Remember, which isn’t a good sign. I will say that I have super positive things to say about the love interest - Grant is one of the sweetest love interests I have ever seen in YA, and I liked him a lot throughout. [Except for a few things at the end.] And in the same vein, there’s a certain character in this book who I loved until the ending. → the story progression and ending ←You may have noticed there were several characters I liked until the ending, soooooooo…. let’s talk story progression and tone. This starts off as a BIT of a typical YA contemporary with elements that discuss Amanda’s feelings as a trans girl, and weirdly, that’s what I liked about it. It’s really nice to have a story like this for trans girls — one that’s realistic about transphobia in the flashbacks but also not ten fucking hours of torture porn. It's a super dark book but also a super hopeful book, which some of you may know is my specific favorite thing in literature. SPOILERS: The only thing I disliked about this book, really, was the incredibly dark ending segment. I thought this book was trying to make itself a book for trans readers to relate to and adore, and I felt that way up until the incredibly cruel outing. I will say that it was so obviously the direction the book was going, so it wasn’t really a surprise. And I think this segment was meant as education for cis readers to really understand how awful life can be for trans women, which is really important, don’t get me wrong. But can I be totally honest? It was… really awful to read, and I think it would be even more awful to read for a young trans reader. I don’t mean this in a condescending way at all - I mean, I’m a seventeen-year-old very-out-of-the-closet cis girl, and I think the ending of this was one of the most difficult-to-read endings I have read in my whole life. I honestly cannot imagine reading this as a fifteen-year-old closeted trans girl. I do think the ending is done pretty well for what it is - it ends on a super hopeful note! - and I respect Meredith Russo for bringing up important topics, like - SPOILER - the rape of trans women. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that if this book were published in 2018, Russo would have been able to write something a bit less awful for trans readers reading this. Maybe Amanda telling Grant herself? Maybe her best friend not outing her to a hundred transphobic people? I don't know, man, I just really want Amanda to have the chance to come out herself. It's what she deserves. But also... okay, I do understand this as a writing decision and an opportunity for Amanda to develop. I just would’ve preferred something different. → overall ←OVERALL I REALLY LOVE AMANDA AND THEREFORE I REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK. This is getting on my favorite audiobooks list and I would definitely recommend.

In this bookIn An Absent Dream is a story about a girl who does not fit exactly what a girl should be, who would rather dream than be a perfect girl. In this book, we follow her journey through the Goblin Market, where there are only three rules: Ask for nothing. Names have power. Always give fair value. It is this final rule that becomes the undoing of so many characters.To be a child is to be a visitor from another world muddling your way through the strange rules of this one, where up is always up, even when it would make more sense to be down, or backward, or sideways.Lundy has appeared before, the eight-year-old-or-maybe-eighty-year-old therapist who leads the group sessions in Every Heart a Doorway. She doesn't quite fit in anything, and doesn't quite want to. There was always a vague impression that they expected something different from her, and she didn’t know what to do with that. She didn’t want to know what to do with that. She suspected it would involve changing everything about who she was, and she liked who she was. It was familiar.It is deeply sad how easily tragedy can be forced by circumstance, how even when you find a story that feels right for you, a narrative that wants you, the people around you can be too far gone. There are certain fair values that may take your life, and the world is sometimes cruel enough to try and take them. And when you come from a world that accepts unfair values, sometimes the consequences of not giving a fair value are darker than they may seem.Melanie’s  puts this very well into words:Jeff Bezos’ kids walking into Walmart and buying food isn’t the same as an underprivileged kid in Flint, whose family is on a fixed income (and still forced to buy their own bottled water), walking into Walmart to try to buy groceries for their family. But no matter how easy that is to see, I can’t teach people to have empathy. We all need to do better, and we need to change this obviously broken system. We live in a society that tacitly accepts the mistakes of the rich while asking the poor why they can’t just bootstrap themselves out of poverty. And that isn’t realistic. We live in a world where fair value is not as simple as it sounds, where money always comes with baggage except when it doesn’t. If something mattered enough for the author to write it down, it would come back before the last page was turned. It would always come back.Imagine ending up in a world where something worth a lot to you cost, literally, all you had. For some, that’s terrifying. For others, it’s reality.

With an incredibly weird conceptand a fantastic exploration of character,You are never going to read another novella like this, and that is okay. With an incredibly weird conceptand a fantastic exploration of character, this novella makes for such an interesting read.In a world where memories - primarily traumatic memories - can be extracted and turned into their own people, what should their rights be? When most of the Mems become nothing but the trauma they’ve experienced, why is our lead different? What makes her so?[This novella is one of the most philosophical I’ve ever read, maybe.]The thing I liked about this, specifically, is that MEM doesn’t try to force an easy answer to the questions it raises. Because Bethany Morrow knows there isn’t one to all of these questions. Is it better to remove trauma or live with it? How can we judge those who made one choice or another in their struggle to remove trauma? How can we know that people who seem to be acting on memory alone are truly not their own people? And perhaps it seems like an odd message, but our pain, our fear, our hurt, our ability to deal with the above - they make us who we are. We don’t need to be grateful for our pain, nor should we be, but learning to cope with it is part of what makes us human. This is reflected through the protagonist, a Memory herself, and through almost every side character.I will say I was not a fan of the romance - there’s a bit of a power dynamic between them I wasn’t a fan of. But I think Bethany Morrow handles it quite well, to the point where it’s challenged multiple times, which made me feel a bit better. And let’s be real: it was so interesting. On the whole, this is a compelling, interesting story about people, with all our flaws, and asks us to question our future.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,"Mar 26, 2018","Mar 29, 2018","Feb 08, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/39299201-mem

[This  will function as a full  for the series.]This novella seriess dabbles really explicitly with the idea of being human and trying not to be human. Murderbot lives in a world where it cannot be considered fully human, and as a result, it shuts itself off from other humans and tries to avoid group dynamics altogether. And as a result, I love the character of Murderbot so much and I’m going to rant about this. Something I like about this series is that Murderbot is written as a powerful killing machine and actually... is. Murderbot is really competent at what they do, but not in an unrealistic way? I feel like a lot of lies I read in fiction are so obviously lies that anyone could guess it, but Murderbot just genuinely is talented at making lies sound real and knowing when to drop info and when to stay quiet. I love realistic badassery. But Murderbot also has this compulsory need to be above human attachment and act as if it does not have feeings. It totally does.The worldbuilding of this series is really fantastic especially as the series goes on! I talked about this more in my  for book two.

You just have to survive it and go on.”They all stopped talking and stared at me. It made me nervous and I immediately switched my view to the nearest security camera so I could watch us from the side. I had said it with more emphasis than I intended, but it was just the way things were. I wasn't sure why it had such an impact on them. Maybe it sounded like I knew what I was talking about. Maybe it was the two murder attempts.I honestly am on the four-hundred-s-to-come portion of my evening, so this will be a bit briefer. First of all, sci-fi novella. Second of all, I already ed book one in depth. Here's a quick bulleted list of things I liked about this volume:➽A lot more worldbuilding. We see Murderbot go beyond just one singular arena and really see a lot more of the world. I also just liked seeing everything; in the first book I really didn't perceive the world, and here I did. ➽There’s a character introduced who uses gender neutral pronouns (!)➽Murderbot's first crew is missing in this book, but the new characters are super interesting as well - a pissed-off transport operative [ART] is my definite favorite.But here's the REAL kicker: I just love Murderbot more and more each volume as it continues to explore its humanity. In some entertainment media I had seen, the bare metal bot-bodies were used to portray the evil rogue SecUnits who menaced the main characters. Not that I was annoyed by that or anything. It was actually good, because then humans who had never worked with SecUnits expected us to look like human-form bots, and not what we actually looked like. I wasn't annoyed at all. Not one bit.The way in which Murderbot is treated by society as a whole is kind of one of the main functions of the world, and I really enjoy it. It's a really interesting character to me because its thought processes echo that of a very traumatized and somewhat emotionally locked off human. It gets the most depth, the most narrative sympathy, and some of the best development I've ever seen. I love how it keeps denying having any feelings and I love it. On a sort of related note, I totally love that Murderbot is humanized via caring about people in the non-romantic way. Robots-Becomes-Human-Because-It-Feels-Romantic-Love is a really overdone and, if thought about critically, totally fucked up trope; I'm really loving the subversion of this. On a related note, I'm loving that Martha Wells didn't give the robots gender. That shouldn't be a huge statement, but damn, this is the era that gave us alien robots with ponytails.Anyway, summary: it’s as if Martha Wells knows Exactly what I like in literature and plans to use that knowledge. For evil. And for an excellent novella series that I can’t see myself putting down anytime soon.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,141,1,"Mar 05, 2018","Mar 05, 2018","Feb 08, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35064104-artificial-condition

With sarcastic, witty narration, a compelling mystery, and an on-point vibe, I was completely impressed.Undead Girl Gang follows Mila, who brings back three girls from the dead: astrology-obsessed and complicated June, joyful and hilarious Dayton, and Riley, Mila’s best friend back from the dead. First of all, you guys, I binged this. I haven’t binged a book in a day in around a month, so that should definitely say something. The snarky tone of this book is a huge standout. This book feels all over the place, but in a good way. It’s uper super funny, but occasionally heart-touching and sad and sweet. There are cliche bits [like the romance] but the author is so aware of her genre tropes that it feels more meta than everything else. This is all topped off with an excellent bittersweet ending. You’ll tear up a little, you will probably be surprised by who it is, and you will obviously love the conclusion that really reminded me of one of my favorite movies. Oh, and not to spoil, but speaking of favorite movies, can we talk about how this entire book is a sendup of Heathers? I don’t think I’m reaching here, right? Two popular bullies who are best friends die, along with one friend. (view spoiler)[Not even mentioning the rest of the parallels you can see later on. (hide spoiler)] Come on, man.And then there are all the characters! Mila, the lead, is such an icon, first of all. And let’s face it, the girl gang at the center is an absolute favorite for everyone. If you don’t stan them I probably want to fight you.I think this alone would make for a fairly strong novel, but like other dark comedies of its nature, this has a super strong thematic core. This novel is about redemption and moving on at the same time. There’s also a lot of subtle stuff interwoven about being the only brown girl in a white town, and also being the fat girl at school and how people treat you for who you are [Mila is latina, Wiccan, and fat]. Unfortunately, while I’ve mentioned my love for the bittersweet ending, I didn’t think the ending totally stuck the landing – I mean, the conclusion for Mila felt really rushed and I wished we saw more of her arc throughout. She does that thing characters do in YA where suddenly she makes changes to her life after the climax, and we’ve seen the events that led up to that, but we haven’t felt her actual growth till the end. It makes character development feel like a narrative afterthought when it clearly is not in this book. Okay, fine, all right, spoilers under the cut: (view spoiler)[I wished we saw more of Mila questioning her idealization of Xander. I love that the ending is framed as a subversion of the not-like-other-girls trope and the romance-curing-death trope, but Xander has never invoked the not-like-other-girls trope, and I would’ve loved to see more of Mila’s development from swoon to self-realization. Maybe one more scene of their interaction in which they really start dating before the mushroom reveal scene? Then we have time for her to start questioning the narrative he offers. Or alternately, a few more scenes between when she finds out and the climax. (hide spoiler)]So maybe the climax didn’t totally work for me. Maybe I thought that this book could have gone just a bit further and turned out one of my favorite books of the year. But does it really matter? Overall, this was lovely. Totally worth the read if it’s what you like.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube✨oh hey, it's my first ever blog tour! that I now have ten days to complete my arc from. send me luck!...more",Notes are private!,0,163,1,"Apr 24, 2018","Apr 24, 2018","Feb 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35707056-undead-girl-gang

[The bar for abuse books is currently underneath the floor.] Buuuuuuuut I also think this is of slightly low actual quality than both of the other abuse books I have despised recently. And the ending? The ending is a total mess.Let’s discuss. ✔️The transition to abuse is done really well. There’s a very subtle transition from a fairly okay relationship to a horrible relationship that isn’t overtold or exagerrated, which is really rare and great for books about abusive relationships. ❌Unfortunately, the abusive relationship is so ludicrously instantaneous that it’s actually hard to believe in them as a couple. Abusive relationships starting quickly? Fine. Believable. But like… when the protagonist says she feels like a girl falling in love after they have literally only met once and flirted for thirty seconds and the first I love you is dropped two weeks in, you’re not going to get the readers at all believing in their progression as a couple. A longer timetable would have made this 300% more believable. But two weeks? Come on.✔️The relationship between Jo and Bee being how Bee pulls herself out? A fucking mood. Amazing. Outstanding. Showstopping. 300/10. Joanna is the best character in this book and in my opinion, the only reason it works. She is constantly sticking up for Bee and helping to show her exactly how shitty Aiden’s treatment of her is. She is also sapphic and gets the girl at the end!! Having abuse end partially as a result of the bff is a great decision and I love it.❌Guys, the ending just crashes and burns and ruins the book. The conflict around the abusive relationship is essentially solved by a plot device, and a somewhat overdramatic one at that, rather than a character arc. Everything the novel has built up to for Bee’s character doesn’t fucking happen. A scene romanticizes how controlling her mother was, when it seems fairly clear to me that her parents were basically horrible - I support their thoughts on Aiden, but y’all, her mom is never nice to her. Our intro to her is Bee’s mother walking in the house and ordering her to get the table set without even saying hello. Who the fuck does that to another human being and then doesn’t apologize? ✔️I will say that the ending doesn’t totally go in the romance direction. Way too close for comfort, though. Why couldn't the entire thing with Eric be cut. on the whole, this just felt like one of those times when you read a book that builds up all that fucking potential and then just crashes and burns and you're extra bitter because it Could Have Been So Great and it Almost Went There and then it didn't. I am in disappointment city and will now proceed to cry in a corner.

It. Was. Worth. The. Wait. Well-written, existential, and so so deeply human. And the last twenty pages are singlehandedly my favorite thing I’ve read this year. Here, we’re essentially following three lead characters:➽Ryann Bird, trying to raise her brother James and James’ adopted child Charlie. She really likes rescuing people➽Alexandria McCallough, black & biracial, the daughter of an astronaut sent to die in space➽Ahmed Bateman, Ryann’s best friend and the child of Jack, August, and RiyaThis actually took longer to grow on me than The Wicker King, as it’s definitely just a little more slow burn, but I ended up binge reading it. Kayla Ancrum is so good at getting you invested in characters in very brief moments. Ryann and Alexandria fall in love and the romance is just… can we talk about tenderness? I'd like to talk about tenderness.What’s interesting here is that the book sort of starts off as a contemporary romance, and then dives into being sci-fi, but its tone works because the focus stays deeply humanistic. We know these characters and we care about these characters, and so the story becomes one about the people involved in these great space missions, rather than the great space missions themselves. It’s a story about the great void of space, but it’s really a story about two girls with seperate trauma falling in love; these things can coexist because that is how our world works, as broad conflict merged with small interpersonal griefs.The ending is... amazing, and the mixed-media element of the last ten pages or so (you’ll know if you’ve read it) is stunning, and made me tear up. The final two pages honestly tore me into a million pieces in a good way. I don’t think I can actually explain why, but the last pages made me feel such a deep connection to the world as it is, to the point where I started crying choking sobs. There’s a little decision in here, the decision to have Jack and August and Rina as loving parents who still have their issues but are Good and Healthy people, that is just so wonderful and so revolutionary, on multiple levels. These are characters who we’ve seen go through some really dark shit and now we’re seeing them on page as really good parents and that’s so important. And I think that’s what ultimately makes this book and The Wicker King so special – there’s this fundamental sense of hope to everything in this world. both of these books go dark, but still constantly position love and human connection as guiding forces, and winning forces.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,213,1,"May 13, 2019","May 15, 2019","Jan 31, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36952571-the-weight-of-the-stars

We ourselves find it hard to remember the narrator’s presence as anything beyond an afterthought. By contrast, the narrator serves as a stand-in for the memory of Rebecca to everyone around her. The narrator lacks a name, while Rebecca does not. Memory becomes a threat, closing in around the narrator, compacting her, leaving her feeling the need to ‘escape’ to other echelons of the house.To her new husband Maxim, meanwhile, the memory of Rebecca is something to be swept under the rug, hidden, and ignored. Maxim explicitly counters the narrator’s framing of memory, even as the narrator grows more fascinated. SPOILERS: (view spoiler)[I think being critical of the choice to make the narrator sympathetic to Maxim’s killing of Rebecca is not really getting the point. The narrator is not meant to be on the moral high ground here, nor is Maxim, nor is Rebecca; they are three awful people making each other worse. I think it's so interesting about her reaction to the murder reveal, and indeed the entire second half of the book, is that over time the narrator becomes closer and closer to becoming Rebecca, dreaming of herself seeing Rebecca in the mirror. Yes, the narrator is nothing, because ultimately Rebecca drowns out everything. Even in seeking to compete, to win over Rebecca, the narrator has lost from the start.The gender politics of this are even more fascinating. Maxim, who the narrator has previously seen as the caretaker, is suddenly a scared dog who the narrator can only try to protect; when she has framed herself as a dog to him, she suddenly describes him as a dog to her.  (hide spoiler)]I think this novel begs the question constantly quite strongly of who, exactly, is winning over Maxim, Mrs. Danvers, and the outside world—the narrator, or Rebecca? To me, the answer is this: SPOILERS: (view spoiler)[Rebecca had cancer of the womb, meaning she cannot reproduce futurity; instead, she reproduces futurity by converting the narrator into someone just as duplicitous as she. Even from beyond the grave, she wins by burning the mansion and taking the narrator as a second self. (hide spoiler)]Anyway.

This is a compelling survival story that is marketed as a revenge story and I just… didn’t get exactly what I was hoping. But let’s be real, this was still entertaining. So, my main thought about this is that this is very well-written, but it's essentially just a survival story and doesn't go much beyond. Maybe my main problem was that… I just didn’t get exactly what I wanted? The revenge element is there, but it’s very low on intrigue and definitely not the main plot point. We don’t even see the lead plotting revenge until like page 200, and in a book where the marketing that caught me was Revenge, this was disappointing. But on a counterexample, it was the plot that kept me reading - survival stories are always fun for me. I binged this in a day. And yeah, as survival stories go, it didn’t do anything new, but it didn’t have to. Survival stories are great and always have been and always will remain so, so who really cares?I mean, I guess it made the book a little less entertaining for me. I did not find the main character, Jess, particularly compelling on her own, which is something that tends to really set survival stories apart for me. Jess has a disability and the narrative does a really good job with it!! But that was kind of… the whole list of everything that set the story apart. But... it was still an interesting, quick read. I wouldn't rush to recommend but I'm certainly not going to tell you to take it off your TBR if you like survival stories.

The plot feels at time repetitious due to the lack of narrative weight presented by certain plot points. However, the book is almost entirely redeemed by its characters: Katherine and Toby are written with so much heart. I loved how Katherine’s character’s inner turmoil and conflict was written and conveyed by the narrative. I also adored how Toby’s grief was subtly conveyed through the narrative. Oh, and I loved how this played with Shakespeare. There’s a tidbit here about the original story of Twelfth Night involving Viola killing Orsino under dubious circumstances. The play evolves as the story does, which I thought was so incredibly meta and interesting. Okay. Okay so I want to talk about gender for a second. One of the characters in this book, as in Twelfth Night, spends the entire book dressed as a boy, and the two fall in love.(view spoiler)[It wasn't that you were a girl--are a girl. It's that you lied to me. I know why you did. But you knew my secret.When Toby of course eventually finds this out, he feels deeply betrayed not primarily because of the lie — but because he has let her know that he is bisexual, in a time where that is quite literally illegal. (hide spoiler)] At one point, I wrote an essay about Twelfth Night discussing how it holds gender as primarily performance: Viola’s transformation of gender allows her to take on a freer ‘role’ in the world, a role which at once suits her and forces her to hide. Yet Orsino wants her as both a maid and a man — in other words, he loves her for who she is.I think this book leans quite far into this exact same idea in a very good way, albeit a far more canonical way. ✨Arc received from the publisher for an honest .

It was a weirdly emotionOkay, first of all, this book made me so deeply fucking happy. like, on a level of my soul I did not know existed I am happy. It was a weirdly emotionally cathartic read for me because it’s a happy book, but it also doesn’t shy away from the fact that these are all teenagers dealing with their own shit.Foolish Hearts follows Claudia, who, after accidentally witnessing the great breakup of Her School’s Popular Sapphic Couple, is forced into a rivalry with the exceptionally closed-off and hurt Iris. Here are some things that resonated with me about this book: ➽There is a romance and it’s freaking adorable, but the main developing arc of this book is a friendship – that between Iris and Claudia. you wanted developed female friendships? you got developed female friendships.➽I love Iris, so fucking much. Iris starts out the book as a really mean character, very closed off from other people and bad at pulling herself out of her shell, and then she develops into one of the most compelling and freaking amazing female characters of recent years.➽I love the cast of this book so much. I would give my life for Iris and Paige and Gideon and Claudia and Zoe and Alex and Noah and Del and even fucking Lena, and I just… don’t know the last time I liked a full cast so much. Oh my god. ➽And of course, this book is freaking hilarious. Like, some of the best humor I have ever seen. I don’t know if this will be for everyone - humor is a super subjective thing, after all - but I found this book absolutely freaking hilarious in its entirety. Take a look at this shit:”Kill Darth Vader, and marry Voldemort,” Zoe finishes.“What the hell?” Alex says. ""That’s the exact wrong answer.”I don’t want to participate, but I can’t stop myself: “Why would you want to marry Voldemort? Why would you not kill Voldemort?” “I think-““No, literally, who chooses not to kill Voldemort?” Alex says.“I think I could change the course of his whole life,” Zoe says simply.“You don’t think you could change Darth Vader?” I say.“Nah, girl, Padme tried.""“I feel like I would fuck Darth Vader, because he’s got like powers and stuff, you know?” Alex says. “How would the force factor in? How would we negotiate the suit and stuff? It’s a guaranteed wild ride from start to finish.” [I was screaming at this. It's so in character for all of them and it's also something I would say and I adore it. nahgirlPadmetried.gif]The reason I really liked this book is that I think this book is a super authentic portrayal of the fact that teenagers are people, each with their own passions and obsessions beyond just “hanging out with friends.” Which seems like such a basic point, but trust me, in current contemporary YA, it's really not. The lead character being a gamer girl and bonding with a new friend over a boy band, without either of those things being belittled, is something I think I’ve literally never seen before. Also, the portrayal of being an unpopular person in high school is so… not-over-the-top. It’s not like Claudia is all alone and it’s all she ever thinks about and oh, woe is me; it’s just that she isn’t as close to any of her school friends and she wishes for more. Also, very accurate humor and dialogue; the phrase “my guy” was used properly within this book, and at one point a character calls another character “Straighty McHetero” and it’s basically the funniest thing I have ever read. And then there’s the entire portrayal of a high school drama department being accurate, and so much more. Basically, wow, finally someone gets what high school is actually like beyond the cliches. in summary: it's a super emotionally real but also freaking hilarious book. I adored this and I could not recommend more.

Another stunning, if sometimes confusing, installment. It took me a while to remember details after a two-year break from keeping up with these, and I actually spent quite a bit of time on the Wiki, but I found it easy to get reinvested in these characters. [image]So, a brief reminder of the politics of the known world. On one side of the world is the human federation, oppressive to Arcanics and the cats alike. On the other side lie the Arcanics, half-human & half-animal beings persecuted for their powers. A shade of post-cataclysm adds further intrigue. The Ancients leave behind the Dawn and Dusk courts—one led by Maika’s grandmother, the Queen of Wolves, & one led by the duplicitous Corvin—and the cats, descendants of Ubasti who helped them to defeat the Old Gods in war. Within this context, several groups fight for power, or at the very least autonomy. The Cumaea, an anti-Arcanic group led by Mother Superior Desteria and the Inquisitrix, seek humans with power. (view spoiler)[The Blood Court, led by Maika’s father and thus the only other member of her monstrous bloodline, seek to usurp both the Dusk & Dawn courts. (hide spoiler)] Smaller forces function as well: The Thyria-based trade empire of Kenzi is relevant to several plotlines. And then there’s the Ancients. The first Arcanic, the Shaman Empress, left behind the mask, broken into many pieces, which could offer a connection to another world. The Old Gods, meanwhile, are imprisoned in this other world, save for a few—(view spoiler)[including a few that have infiltrated the Cumaea, attempting to find the mask. (hide spoiler)]In this series, we follow Maika Halfwolf, arcanic child of Moriko, who holds an Old God named Zinn inside her arm. She fights first to escape the Cumaea, then to escape from the Dawn & Dusk courts, and then (view spoiler)[to keep the mask fragment from the Mother Superior, who requires it to open the door between worlds (hide spoiler)]. She struggles to gain trust in her companions: fellow arcanic Kippa, and cat nekomancer Ren, (view spoiler)[a bit of a double agent (hide spoiler)]. She struggles with memories of her old (view spoiler)[lover (hide spoiler)], Tuya, (view spoiler)[now working for the Dusk court under dubious circumstances. (hide spoiler)]OKAY, now I’ve gotten that extremely long summary out of the way. [image]This story focuses on dynamics of oppression via allegory, and does so in a world that is complex and rich. At times, you’ll need to turn a few pages back, but the story will still hold weight. There’s an idea here that behind all these petty conflicts are secrets of the world, a war with the gods that will eventually hit a boiling point. As the story has continued, it’s leaned into more of a post-cataclysmic vibe that has really resonated with me. I hope certain threads will begin to progress, as the story has finally reached a point where we understand the world to a certain degree.On a firm character level, this volume is coming closer to a theme I really like. I really love seeing Maika slowly grow feelings for Kippa. I loved the complexity of the relationship between Ren & Kippa in this one—it felt like a very well set up challenge of Ren’s willingness to do what he must. He’s ready to act for his own interests with Maika—but what about with Kippa? This is also the first volume where the complicated relationship between Maika and Tuya has been explicitly depicted as romantic, which like… we knew, but it’s nice to get confirmed. This dynamic is increasingly fascinating. (view spoiler)[Also, I spent the week after reading this binge watching the She-Ra reboot, soooo lesbians who end up on either side of a global conflict is the mood now I guess. (hide spoiler)]As this is the third installment, I’d ask that anyone who wants a  for the beginning of the series, which I definitely did not understand as well as I should have, to check that  out. I would also recommend reading Melanie's two fantastically detailed wrap-ups!

If your future was foretold, then you weren’t accountable for it. Enjoyable stanNo one wanted to believe their mistakes were preventable. If your future was foretold, then you weren’t accountable for it. Enjoyable standalone fantasy is something to be thankful for! So Beneath the Citadel is an enjoyable book about a fantasy heist: four criminals, and their maybe-ally on the inside, attempt to pull off a rebellion against the oppressive high priests ruling their city. But can they trust the allies they’ve picked? This is a supremely entertaining premise, and on the whole, I thought this book worked pretty well. It’s a fast-paced and entertaining romp, well-written. And Beneath the Citadel manages this fast pace without losing structure – the book keeps clear character motivation and thus a clearly established goal. The world in which Beneath the Citadel takes place in is... functional. I genuinely think recent YA fantasy may have forgotten how important imagery is in drawing together a world - I just couldn't picture most of the locations or cities this took place in. They all felt just a tiny, tiny bit generic, as if the author had written them for functionality rather than placement. Which is fine! Seriously, it's fine. I do think the world as a whole needed to be cleared up with a map - is there a map in the physical final copy?The characters, on the whole, work. I liked that there wasn’t much romance! One m/m romance is plenty of romance and was super fun. Cassa, the group’s leader, is driven to a fault, often stubborn and unable to admit her mistakes. Alys is the plus-sized and ace bisexual fortune teller of the group, quieter and occasionally insecure. Vesper was by far my favorite character: she is a girl in disguise, attempting to hide her memories and save her friends. And then there are the two final leads: Evander, Cassa’s ambitious and funny ex, and Newt, the group’s spy. …okay, so I really really hesitate to call things overly derivative in terms of characters – that’s weird territory as a er. And I actually don’t think this book, in and of itself, is a super derivative work; it distinguishes itself in both plot and characterization, for the most part. But …. when you’re comparing your book to Six of Crows, as this book's initial blurb did. You really cannot have a couple in the story in which one is a white gay guy who has a dead mother and a bad relationship with his father and a whole self-realization arc, and the other is a black bisexual guy who jokes to suppress his feelings, deals with nervous energy, has some past romantic tension with the lead character, and whose special talent is that he can – I shit you not – manipulate metal. I genuinely struggled to see these characters as something more than Jesper/Wylan fanfiction. This, to me, was deeply weird; I'm actually struggling to believe the author wasn't aware of this. I completely understand we all have character dynamics we like, which is totally fine; this is just way too much similarity. Something else that I enjoyed about this book was the focus on the quality of memory, and on the power of memory as a weapon to control society. There’s something deeply terrifying about forgetting, about not being able to fight back because you cannot remember what someone has done to you. That’s fascinating and Destiny Soria leans into the horror of it well. I also enjoyed how much the book and narrative as a whole leans into change as a force of good: especially in our current world, the younger generation as a force for good is genuinely a compelling idea. On the whole, this was a decent read but not a fantastic one. A solid three, just not more.release date: 8 October 2018✨Arc received from the publisher via Netgalley for an honest .

And they are so much fun. This collection had an average rating of 4.0 for me, which is a result of an exact split: five three star stories and five five star stories. Let me explain myself: I think pretty much any story in this book could be rounded up or down to a four. They are all of high writing quality, with a touch of ironic humor and plenty of sarcasm. I had personal favorites, but every one of these feels very strong, and I don’t think you’ll be disappointed no matter what. → Gender Studies ←★★★☆☆About a gender studies professor and her one-night relationship with a Trump-supporting taxi driver in 2016. This is about how women can feel connected to men who don’t share their sensibilities or way of looking at the world. Loved the inner monologue, just overall mixed on what it’s trying to convey or… the point? → The World Has Many Butterflies ←★★★☆☆Follows a woman named Julie who becomes obsessed with a man named Greg because he makes her feel like herself. Sort of obvious in messaging and not particularly memorable, but I enjoyed it all the same. → Vox Clamantis in Deserto ←★★★★★Follows a woman who decides to be like a girl she sees named Rae. An interesting story about how we can be strongly impacted by someone else but not impact them at all. → Bad Latch ←★★★★★Follows a woman at a pregnancy group and her observations about Gretchen, a woman who seems engineered to make other new mothers feel bad about themselves. It’s essentially about the guilt felt by new mothers who ask for help. Also, I honestly found this hilarious?→ Plausible Deniability ←★★★☆☆Follows a man emailing a woman music notes, and also his relationship with his brother. This was certainly not bad, and plays with the same kind of romantic-vs-innocent perception as the earlier The World Has Many Butterflies, but was kind of forgettable for me? Points for some twists, but overall not a fave. → A Regular Couple ←★★★★★Follows a woman named Maggie who has just defended a man accused of rape in court, her far-less-successful husband Jason, and her nightmare from high school, Ashley Frye. This story is about power dynamics between people, primarily. Again, a really interesting story – every one of the characters is hard to know what to make of. → Off the Record ←★★★☆☆This follows an interviewer named Nina on her last interview with a woman named Kelsey she met five years before. I honestly felt nothing for this; it didn’t feel like it was trying to say much, and → The Prairie Wife ←★★★★★Follows a woman obsessing over her first girl date. This one is nice because it plays with your expectations a lot – all these stories are about incorrect perception of those around you, but this one plays with audience expectations as well, which is not true of every one. → Volunteers are Shining Stars ←★★★☆☆A woman and a new volunteer who appears. I thought this one was honestly kind of… odd? It plays with a narrator who frames her actions in different light than we’d expect, which is something I always enjoy, but it honestly just didn’t do much for me. → Do Over ←★★★★★Follows two high schoolers looking back on events of their school days. This was so weird, but I adored it? Both of the two leads feel very real and are both likable and hatable depending on the page.all in all: despite being a little variant in how much I loved the stories, I thought this book was overall quite a solid read, with some excellent stories.

Her descriptions give her entire writing this very sinister feel, and it’s glorious. But there’s also a hint of sardonic humor to her writing. What’s interesting here is none of the characters, including the lead, are good people. But perhaps the strongest antihero of the book is Diane. And I… empathized with Diane. A lot more than expected. Which I think is perhaps the most transcendent part of the book; that we find so much sympathy for these characters, even though we shouldn’t. This book also thrives primarily off a relationship between two women, and just as the relationship between Beth and Addie in Dare Me, it is wonderful and fucked up. They are at once each other's biggest rivals and each other's biggest allies and Kit's feelings for Diane are so wonderfully complicated.Megan Abbott’s work never really sustains itself off plot twists or reveals for me; she’s more of a talent at creep factor and character work. But I will say there’s this particularly nasty twist towards the end, and I didn’t think there would be another twist, and it’s kind of the most fucked up part of the entire book.

Jericho and Evie specifically when they interact with each other Picture thisWithout further ado I present to you: The King of Crows Power Ranking27. Jericho and Evie specifically when they interact with each other Picture this: you are New York Times bestselling author Libba Bray. In your recent book series, you wrote in a love triangle. Unfortunately, the first prong was boring, lacked any chemistry with the lead, and also was the love interest to your lead’s best friend, so your entire audience was invested in the second prong. In book three, you make the incredibly lazy and in poor taste writing decision to end this love triangle by having prong one try to sexually assault the lead while under the influence of drugs. Now, it’s time to write book four. Do you (A) move on from any possibility of romance between these characters and just deal with the effects of the assault, or (B) write more angst between them? If you guessed B, you’re right. And I truly, truly wish you weren’t. 26. Eugenics supporters:(((( automatic bottom slot25. The plot point where everyone is separated for forever and then randomly reunite in Kansas in like five pages This plot point has the geographic sense of the last season of Game of Thrones. and I say this with every ounce of hate in my heart. 24. Performative Activism With the exception of the Mississippi River chapters, in comparison to books two and three, King of Crows is I think significantly less willing to deeply engage with the character of racism and bigotry. In a series which I’d found previously very willing to engage with queerness (Lair of Dreams) and the impacts of American eugenics (Before the Devil Breaks You), the lack of political drive in any plot line besides Memphis’s felt like a glaring hole. 22. The concept of Nebraska The amount of times that characters reminded me we were going to Nebraska to see Sarah Beth, before immediately reminding me that they hate Nebraska. Could someone use their kindle version to command F “Nebraska”? 21. Sarah Beth herself no comment but who honestly gives a fuck20. Jake Marlowe I didn’t feel I particularly needed what we got of explanation for Jake Marlowe. He’s a man torn apart by the evils of capitalism. I felt I either wanted the book to lean into his horror, lean harder on his dismissiveness and destruction of Diviners—a character they know, perhaps—or leave him more ambiguous, a figurehead for American exceptionalism beyond an actual villain. 19. The term ‘baby vamp’Nicknames can be sparing. I promise I remember that Theta calls Evie ‘Evil’, Sam calls Evie ‘Baby Vamp’, and everyone calls Isaiah ‘Little Man’. I promise I know those are nicknames they use. The audiobook narrator deserved a bonus. 18. Every single adult with one exception Sister Walker and William Fitzgerald, how does it feel to be slightly boring as characters? 17. Evie ONeill :/ sorry Evie but what if you literally need to get smart. On a serious note, the lack of significant character arc given to Evie here beyond her grief is notable. I craved knowing more—I craved a breakthrough, a moment of character break where she recognized her own selfishness and truly changed. The catharsis never came. 16. Jericho Jones I almost forgot Jericho existed between books. In the book’s defense, it has been three years since I read book three. Less in defense, he was the only character I’d forgotten. The issue is that I think Libba Bray does the same. Jericho at his best is a character genuinely worried he is Frankenstein’s monster, worried he lacks humanity, desperate to find it again. Jericho at his worst is just some white boy. Jericho, in this book, was both or neither depending on the chapter. 15. The King of Crows Creepy? Oh, yes. Some of the best horror in the series comes in his town scene. You know the one. (Or do you?) But I really felt like his political positioning in the novel—his metaphorical stance as villain, destroyer of the Diviners, or metaphorical expression of their anger—switched too fast to make the impact it should have. 14. The legacy of Before the Devil Breaks You While the use of Jericho and Evie’s past in King of Crows feels primarily odd and in bad taste, the impact of Mabel feels well-drawn and heartfelt. A countrywide hatred for someone you once loved—a hatred for you by their very association—carries a kind of pain this novel explores quite well. I only wanted more. 13. Vera the random woman who killed her mother in law and also accuses someone of fucking a priest right before being murdered by the ghost of said mother in law This is maybe my favorite creepy Diviners chapter of all time because I just think this woman is so funny as a character. I want to have cocktails with her. She’s like those TikTok povs of ‘your friend who always thinks she’s in the right’. 12. Gay people Did we win? That’s a really good question. Henry and his offscreen lover’s single conversation got me good and manages t be one of the most heartwrenching moments of the book. By contrast, Alma and Ling felt like an afterthought. We end the book without any second conversation. (I honestly thought I must’ve fallen asleep during the audiobook, because this left me so confused.) 11. Isaiah Cambell Isaiah loss: Most of this book, his biggest one yet, contains shockingly low levels of character arc. Isaiah win: His ending is absolutely fantastic. Isaiah my best friend Isaiah. 10. Random family from the South, circus people, and random train porter King of Crows does, for all its faults, have some truly fantastic one and done side characters.9. Sarah Cambell While Memphis and Isaiah’s mom is not a main character in these novels, she has perhaps one of the single most tragic stories of the entire series, and I genuinely loved her chapters. For so little pagetime, her impact on the story is amazing. 8. Malewife/girlbosses couples The real reason Jericho lost the love triangle is that Sam is more of a malewife than he is. Jericho could never be a damsel in distress and have Evie rescue him from harm. Sam proves his damsel in distress aptitude fantastically within this book by being one. While the Theta and Memphis content here was fairly lacking due to their long separation, their status as ‘one of my favorite book couples when I was young and impressionable’ has stayed with me, and I cannot help but be invested. 7. Sam Lloyd Speaking of damsels in distress. I honestly wanted slightly more out of Sam in this book; I hoped for more character development for him, a bigger moment of character breaking after the trauma of the kidnapping. It felt almost unbelievable to lack that. But… okay, I also just find Sam endearing. He’s funny to me. 6. Bill Johnson I genuinely forgot that Bill existed before this book, which is crazy, because he’s maybe one of my favorite Diviners characters. I think Bill is both genuinely hilarious and one of the more complex and sympathetic of the adults. He’s done bad, just as much as any of the others, but seems unwilling to sweep it under the rug. I enjoy him. 5. Henry Dubois Henry has little to do here besides being a white ally—sort of not kidding when I say this is his only role in half the book—but that’s okay, because Henry is one of the characters who I think has developed the most in previous books. He’s just a little guy to me. 4. Woody the Reporter Who would’ve thought that this random side character would be one of the main reasons the Diviners succeed? Certainly not me. A surprising amount of love poured into this character whose original concept was ‘reporter desperate for a scoop because of his gambling addiction’; I appreciated it. 3. Theta Knight Theta was almost bumped down in the ranking for receiving an incredibly wasted plotline around stalker ghosts, but then failed to be bumped down because your honor, I love her. Theta’s fear and simultaneous desire to be free could’ve been shown and not told to a greater degree, but still lead to a fantastic ending. 2. Ling Chan Ling my best friend Ling. In full disclosure, Ling is my actual favorite Diviners character, and she could have been in two chapters of this and would still be in my top five. I find her genuinely hilarious. I love a girl with autism swag and no ability to read social cues at all. My only complaint here was her underdeveloped plotline with Alma; a resolution, please. Otherwise, I continue to stand by my view that she is just like me in high school. 1. Memphis Cambell It is a truth universally acknowledged that Memphis, among every Diviners character, won King of Crows. His arc here is the most consistent and most well-conveyed. He’s always been my no 1 Diviners man, but this time, he’s earned it doubly. Congratulations, Poet. IN CONCLUSION: Was this book amazing? No. Did it ruin the series? No. Is this series about to be my poster child for Middle Book Syndrome Is Actually Made Up And Middle Books Are Often The Best Ones? Yes. Hope this helps!

It remains such, but deserves higher praise than that: this book is the reason I love poetry today. When I read this book (aged 16, dumb), I did not 'get' poetry. Even then, though, I remember vividly noticing the purpose behind each placement of words and phrases. This collection made me cry out of a feeling of being, and you'll forgive me if there is no better word, seen: the words went down to my very sole. This is work that goes on forever but I think this collection, in impacting me so much, made me think of systematic oppression even moreso as a very personal issue made political by outsiders. There should not and cannot be anything political about the systematic murder of black people; the fact that issues around black life are ever political is morally depraved. Rethink your associations, always.My favorites from this collection include: dinosaurs in the hood → why must it always be a moment of racism for the white eye, why can it not just be black people, livingevery day is a funeral and a miracle → a piece that skips between mediums and themes and combines them all into a masterpiece. contains several of my favorite short bits from the piece, including this: “do I think someone created AIDS?maybe.

With a blurb that promises entertaining drama and not much else, I think I was expecting to find this one good but not great. A three-star read in the making. And those stories have merit, don’t get me wrong. But honestly? It was so much better than that.I think one of my favorite things about this book, in general, is how it subverts and plays with genre expectations. I liked that this book subtly subverts the usual character dynamics of good girl and slut. I love that despite a premise that leaves a perfect opening for girl hate, this book never gets dragged under, and our lead has several great girl friends. I love that the lead of this book is not a virgin and never shamed herself for not being one. And I love the feminism; there is a tirade against rape culture here hidden under the facade of simple good girl to bad girl drama. Perhaps that’s the best tagline for this book: a lot of depth under a facade of innocent drama.On the topic of the lead of this book, she is such a badass. I love her. I’m pretty sure I was screaming “iconic” at almost everything she did in this book. like, if any of you remember my literal pre from right as I finished this book: the main character of this book is possibly one of the most iconic of all time I love her I would die for her and I would protect her with my own body but she'd definitely be better at protecting herself than I would be at protecting her so I'll let her handle it herselfThe side characters are just as compelling; there are around seven major side characters, and every single one has some kind of narrative sympathy or agency within the narrative. [Simone is, obviously, my favorite.]I honestly don’t know what to say about this one, because it is not what you are going to expect. The Accidental Bad Girl is a strange mix of mystery and contemporary with several clever plot reveals that kind of flipped what I thought I was reading on its head. The Accidental Bad Girl is subversive, dimensional, and totally addicting. Definitely worth a try.

It plays on your deepest fears. It's a page turner — I found myself turning pages so quickly that I got a full 100 pages through without even checking the page count. I am one of those people who obsessively checks page counts. What did this book do to me. I feel like this is a book I really can’t say much about because it is one you don’t want to know anything about going in. But let’s try to write some crap. This was such an improvement on Lauren James’ earlier stuff. Her writing has gotten a lot better for me, a lot more streamlined, a lot less romantic, and a lot more clever. I'm so ecstatic to see a writer whose debut I rated three stars write such a 10 / 10 book.What really solidified this as a fave for me is the concious subversion of everything you expect. The plot is… not really what I expected, even though I had been told there were twists? I am particularly impressed by how subversive Romy’s character arc is. I mean, I know I talked about this up above, but she is so well developed and so fantastic. I cry a lot. So some of you might know I love subversiveness and it’s basically the only thing I care about. Some of you might also know I love books that read as light and fluffy but have a crapton going on behind the surface. I feel like this  hasn't gotten all my thoughts across, but this book was just my cup of tea, and I'm so excited to continue reading Lauren James's work.

But oh my god, you have to rate it high because everyone else thought it was so important and what kind of pitiless person are you that a story about kids forced into prostitution? Yeah, that’s how this feels to me. So here’s the thing. It is important to bring awareness to child prostitution. It absolutely fucking is. But you know what? The awareness you bring is meaningless when the book feels so flat. This book is not trying to craft a satisfying arc for each character. I doubt this author gives one singular shit about her characters, because guess what? This book thinks raising awareness is more important than crafting compelling characters. What do you get when you take a brutal premise and subtrack any semblance of character development, friendship development, or hope?

You know, when nothing goes right and life is shit for 200 pages and then it ends without any relief or character arc or like, anything. Here's my hot take: depressing crap is only deep when it's countered by hope. And this narrative is one of fundamental repulsion. You are meant to be so horrified by this that you cry. Okay, but how is that deep? How is that new? I don't like crying out of horror - I like crying out of catharsis. Listen, I am so tired of books like this. It is 2018, and books can be both important and genuinely amazing. The Hate U Give released back in February, and I think we can all agree: that book is both important and fantastic. This just does not feel that way to me. At first I felt really bad rating Little Peach low, but I’m thinking now: that’s the game. Because you have to think important books are worth reading.

Neverwhere follows the story of Richard Mayhew, a pile of anxiety who becomes immersed in the world of Door, an injured girl whose life he saves.

I mean, maybe. But if this is all there is, then I don't want to be sane.”Gaiman is an expert at worldbuilding that’s clever but not overwhelming. The reader is thrown into his world in the same way the characters are - no infodump, no exposition. The worldbuilding here is, while sadly no longer as original as it was in 1995, quite entertaining – I especially loved the concept of a hidden market spread by rumor. And a series of plot reveals and developed characters help the book gain a sense of true authenticity. Maybe my favorite thing about this book is the excellent comedic irony. Something I’ve consistently loved about Gaiman is his villain writing – his villains tend to be humorous characters in their own right. While it’s a little thing, it helps to give his books their sense of timelessness and blurring of the boundaries between children and adult literature. But honestly? The main strength is the writing. This was the first Gaiman book I read in physical copy, and I think his writing may just translate better for me on paper than on audio because I liked this so much more after I switched from audio - and that’s even though I love his voice!! The lack of references within the writing give a sense of timelessness and ambiguity that feels perfect for the story. Maybe there's not much special about the story, but his writing is so much fun and so good. Okay, quick shoutout to racism in the 1990s - the line “giggled like a Japenese girl” is racist as hell and should’ve been cut in the new versions, and I’ve read multiple  articles on the racist implications of using “caramel-colored” or other food metaphors as a skin description, so that was cringey. There is also a character whose death, while handled really honourably, is super tropey. REAL SPOILERS AHEAD: (view spoiler)[a sapphic black woman being killed off when literally every other non-villain character survives the book? That is…. an interesting and utterly unsurprising choice. (hide spoiler)] The only reason that shit like this didn't bother me more was the fact that this was pubbed in 1995, but damn, would really like that cut. Overall, though, I found this book supremely entertaining. With developed characters, interesting worldbuilding, a timeless feel, and such excellent writing, this is one I’d highly recommend.

It is a discussion of the animal capacity to feel and the morality of making animals props in our war. And it is a discussion of the human tendency to let things progress as long as it doesn't hurt the privileged class. With a discussion of revionism, a strong undercurrent of revolt against the horrors of our past, and compelling leads, it is so amazing. It’s amazing how much I’ve begun to appreciate Tor’s recent novellas. Short fiction like this is a really amazing medium for thematic explorations that might not be conveyed in long-form fiction, and perhaps more importantly, Tor's novellas are so in my niche. Novellas like this one are about revolt against oppressive institutions and the subtle patterns humanity exhibits, whether in an alternate universe or our own. There’s so much here crammed into so few pages and I love it. I honestly don’t have a lot else to say about this - morality discussions of this caliber benefit from actually being read - but I want to mention one thing so you're prepared: this novella is weird. I mean, just try reading that blurb. It is a fucking TRIP. And the story itself is one too, honestly - quickly-changing perspectives made the first 20 pages or so a bit difficult to read. But as the book progresses, it becomes easier and easier to connect to the story and the characters. And maybe the weirdness is a good thing: I can honestly say I have never read anything like this before and I doubt I ever will. Brooke Bolander is definitely an author to watch in the future. This novella made a huge personal impact on me and I'd totally recommend it for a short but super developed thematic meditation.

I think what I like about this series is how it makes the personal political. This is a story set in the freaking 1920s, a time that could easily be whitewashed dry of racism and discrimination. Easy to make unpolitical. But this story is so directly about the issues of the 1920s, the racism, the classism, the homophobia - the dark side you don’t always see. It is brilliant. For example, did you know that from 1930-1960 in America, 64,000 individuals were forcibly sterilized under state-sanctioned programs?? That several mental health institutes purposefuly fed their prisoners toberculosis-infected milk upon admission, killing 40% of their patients? That these same eugenics programs served as inspiration for the Holocaust? That they were performed almost entirely on nonwhite and mentally ill women? These facts may seem painful. They may also seem irrelevant to some. After all, we aren’t in the 1960s. But Libba Bray emphasizes here that if we do not come to terms with our past, we are doomed to repeat it. So here’s one final question: did you know from 2006-2010 in California, 148 mentally ill women were sterilized by state mental hospitals without their consent? In my fucking state during my fucking lifetime, 148 women were violated by the state. History is not one faraway thing; it is a continuum, an endless repeating cycle. And it is something we may never escape. The villains of The Diviners are not the ghosts, scary as they are. The villains of this book are classism, eugenics, racism, prejudice. This story gets its true staying power because it is so grounded in reality. “The colonizer writes the history, winning twice: A theft of land. A theft of witness.” I especially don’t want to scare people off this book who don’t like scary things, because though I think this series is freaking terrifying in places, you could ignore those bits and enjoy nonetheless. But guys, the Diviners is flat-out terrifying in the best way. I… uh. All I am going to say about this is that the audiobook bathtub tap scene scared the utter fucking shit out of me. I have never been less okay in my damn life than after reading that scene. Okay. So let’s talk why this book is a 4 1/2 and not a fully solid five.First of all, there is a section from about 70%-80% in which nothing happens besides characters hooking up for the first time. Listen, I know it had to happen, but this section feels a bit detached from the rest of the book - this really could’ve been two books - and worse, it is so goddamn boring. And possibly even worse, this section is incited by a scene in which sexual assault is… sort of used as a plot device to flip a complex situation? I knew exactly what occured in this scene going in, but I really disliked this - after the attempted assault occurs, it is never brought up again. And I also think Libba Bray has a penchant for the brilliant middle and then slightly lackluster ending - or slightly disjointed final 25%, in this case - as she tries to throw together the setup for her next book. Not that she’s exactly alone on that issue, but I remember getting to the point of an hour left in my audiobook and thinking “what else is there?”I do think that listening to this book too fast was part of my issue - I binged the last 40% of this audiobook all at once after spending a week on the first half, and I think the transition just didn’t go as well as it should have. ADVICE: please slow down on the second half !!Second, there’s the fact that my two favorite leads, Ling and Henry, both got very lackluster storylines. After Henry’s fantastic story in book two, he’s relegated to the role of side character. And Ling actually has a storyline - well, a sexuality crisis that we all saw coming - but gets too little pagetime. All right, all right, Ling is my favorite character and I’m being biased. I’ll shut up now. (On a positive note, my other favorite, Theta, got the storyline of the fucking CENTURY— I’ll shut up now.)But overall, I don’t think that section could really ruin this book for me? The first half of this book is actually so brilliant I don’t know how to talk about it. Dark, horrifying, and fun. And the character work is totally solid throughout.“Because I’m not enough, she thought. That was the terrible echo shouting up at her: Fraud, fraud, fraud. She got drunk and talked too much and danced on tables. She had a temper and a sharp tongue, and she often blurted out things she instantly regretted. Worst of all, she suspected that was who she truly was—not so much a bright young thing as a messy young thing.”I’ve already ranted about the themes, but I think the character work in this book was literally perfect. Evie’s character development within this book is my favorite she’s gotten so far; I never really loved her, but she’s become so good? wow? Mabel’s character development offers something very new for the book and series both. And Theta’s storyline is something truly special - this is the first book where she has really begun to recover from the trauma of her past. And you all know that I love Memphis and Theta, but I think I’ve actually officially dedicated my entire life to their love after this book. Listen, if you want even more thoughts on this series, maybe try out my s of The Diviners and Lair of Dreams. But I genuinely hope all of you read this series - it's become one of my new favorites. And I'll leave you with a quote from the author's note:“We are a country built by immigrants, dreams, daring, and opportunity. We are a country built by the horrors of slavery and genocide, the injustice of racism and exclusion. These realities exist side by side. It is our past and present. The future is unwritten.This is a book about ghosts.For we live in a haunted house.”Bravo, Libba Bray.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,367,1,"Jan 03, 2018","Jan 10, 2018","Dec 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25985241-before-the-devil-breaks-you

I have had so much more of an opportunity to read great books. And what's more, I have learned what my tastes truly are. In years past, I dabbled around and ended up reading anything I could get my hands, anything I saw at my local library / bookstore, or anything recommended to me. I was not at all critical of the recommendations I got. This year, I've realized what a mistake that is. I know what I am most likely to enjoy. There is no reason for me to continuously prioritize books with tropes I dislike when there are so many books out there I know I'll like. Of course, that doesn't mean I'm never giving other books a chance, and it definitely doesn't mean genre discrimination! Trying new genres has turned out well for me this year — what has hurt is trying out books I know from s will be too tropey for me. I know what things I love in literature. If a book promises absolutely none of those things, reading it rarely turns out well. And in a world with so many promising books, why not focus on those I know I'll love?WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID.

Instead, Will tells them he has something new to confess-but there's only one person he's prepared to confess it to.

Sounds vaguely like Silence of the Lambs, hm? Sounds like an interesting character exploration… right? Well… no. This is completely plot driven with barely any character interest. And unfortunately, the plot is just not twisty enough to hold up lacking character developments.I really… wow, that, sums up half my thoughts on this mediocre ass book. Okay. Our lead protagonist is by no means a bad character. I think in a book with some fucking awesome twists, I would’ve considered her a fairly solid narrator - she’s realistically traumatized but not overusing alcohol constantly in that tropey unreliable-narrator way. I also think that the handling of our lead’s trauma, especially surrounding romance, is pretty half-assed. There’s a very thrown-in romance. A half-assed mention of the lead protagonist’s parent trouble is quickly forgotten and ignored so the lead can forgive her mom in the last chapter.Okay, listen, here’s the big problem: this book has zero twists. There is technically a red herring. I guess. And technically one of those last-chapter fakeout twists we all know is coming, although this one isn’t… at all impactful to the actual story? But even when we discover who the real killer is, the character is so far removed from the narrative – not even being a side character in the book – that the main reveal just doesn’t feel shocking. The only thing I actually enjoyed about this whole book was one singular scene towards the end that I found incredibly thrilling. It lasts three pages.

Let’s talk about all the shitty ass ways this book copies The Girl on the Train, a 2015 novel that I have an immense distaste for. They have the exact same plot. Lead observes something. But no one will believe her because she is Un Re Li Able. You can read literally any one of these novels and there’s an unreliable narrator. Why is she unreliable? Some unspecific mental condition that will play into her character development absolutely zero! Or better yet, alcoholism! It is 2018. The Girl on the Train was a shitty book. Stop copying it.And listen, okay, I am fine with unreliable narrators. But in books like these we know from the beginning that they’re unreliable and that they might be hallucinating it all. Ooooooooooooooooh. You know what else we know? That no author is going to end the book with “yup, they hallucinated that all.” Because then how can you market it to work-tired middle-aged readers to bring on their Bahamas trip? Although I’m sure a vaguely boring sixty year old scholar somewhere could work out a marketing pitch about how an ending with no reveal simply demonstrates the pointlessness of existing. They would be wrong. Nothing could possibly be as pointless as this book. Also, you know, complex characters do need to have some vague veneer of consistency. For example, let’s say your lead character looooooooves her boyfriend. She wants to solve all the issues in their relationship and be with him forever. So what does she do? Something nice? Of course not, because that would be logical! She gets in a fight with him and proceeds to ignore all his emails for days. Yeah.And you know what? You get a bonus fucking round for the cringiest thing that happened in this book. The main character’s ex-boyfriend touches her boobs without any consent or even hint she’s into him. She knees him in the groin for touching her boob. Great, right? No, because Ruth Ware then promptly ruins the iconicness of the moment by having her protagonist apologize for it and say it was her fault. He touched her on the boob without asking. He absolutely deserved to be kneed in the balls. this book can actually go jump in the ocean. just like that woman who still has not been thrown in the ocean despite me being THIRTY ONE FUCKING PERCENT IN and it being in the damn BLURB.

American Panda is ownvoices contemporary fic about a Taiwanese-American girl struggling with her strict parents and with trying to carve her own path. And holy crap. It’s awesome.American Panda is chiefly a character study. This is a book that would fail without being underpinned by some freaking fantastic character development, and holy crap, is it. Mei’s character voice is one of the strongest I’ve read in contemporary fiction. Her journey feels so real because she is so multifaceted - Mei works through germaphobia, her passion for dance, her relationship with her brother, and her relationship with Japanese Darren all at once. She even learns to work through her own prejudices against her roomnate, whose name I have somehow forgotten despite how much I love her character, and Ying-Na, whose purpose I will not spoil. The narrative of this book is perfectly balanced between exploring Mei’s struggle with strict parents and not condemming her cultural values as the cause of those parent issues. Gloria Chao is so quick to remind the readership that the issue isn’t her parents strict cultural values - it’s their prioritization of themselves over her. My parents may have done versions of what he was implying, but not in the same tone.It’s so… subtly drawn. The story of American Panda works because it feels so effortless and natural, as if it’s coming straight out of the author’s heart. Gloria Chao's author’s note explictly says this is her personal story, but it’s unecessary: you can absolutely tell just how personal a story this is.I’d honestly say the lead character’s development and the subtlety of the story is the best part, but there are so many moving parts helping the buildup. The perfect balance between comedy and dark elements. The pacing - I found the beginning a bit dull, but it picks up speed quickly. The relationship between Mei and Darren being basically the cutest thing. The focus on Mei's relationship with her brother, Xing. The relationship between Mei and her mom, which basically single-handedly makes American Panda worth the read. A part of me lowkey wants to give this a five and I am so picky with fives. guys, you know I've been trying to read less contemporary because I'm so picky about it, but this... American Panda is going to be one of the best contemporaries of 2018. I never know how to do justice to personal stories like this one, but I can’t recommend this enough.

Each of these essays stands alone as I think commentary on a nonfiction book of this style is somewhat hard to do, so here are a few, brief thoughts. Each of these essays stands alone as fascinating and relevant reads. I have read The Case for Reparations before and it still resonates well. Elements of the book as a whole, especially examples used to back articles (the same statistics will be cited, and the same personal anecdotes), feel a bit repetitive—factor of the compilation. I think this is fine. There is still original thought unique to each piece, and the effect is counteracted by the interest of Coates looking back at his own career. Roxane Gay is right in mentioning a lack of focus on gender. I cannot stop thinking about My President Was Black or Epilogue: The First White President. I grew up with politics, and I grew up into Barack Obama’s political world: one in which I felt anger, upset, but also hope, knowledge that the world was moving forward. This was, of course, accompanied with the naïveté of a child: U.S. imperialism was lost on me until sophomore year of high school, when it became my main focus for months. But what was lost on me further was the fact that white supremacy was not a slowly dying force: it was a strong one, one that could win a national election. The election of Donald Trump was a defining moment of the generation born in the 2000s. It was the death of my hope in politics, in a way difficult at best to convey: I almost overnight stopped reading the news at age 15. The sense of dying hope is almost impossible to convey.

I am not special. I am one woman who has experienced something countless women have experienced. I am a victim who survived.”This is one of the most powerful memoirs I have ever read. I’ve realized that Roxane Gay is, while not my style as a fiction author, a fantastic author of nonfiction. Her stories are so emotive, so well-conveyed, so horrifying and so real. And most of all, so incredibly well written. The writing here is just… it’s stunning. Roxane Gay seems to know exactly how to use repitition and exactly how to convey what it is to be in her place - emotions we’ve all felt, but maybe haven’t put to words. It’s horrifying and heartbreaking and beautiful, all at once. I listened to this on audiobook, and the experience somehow made it even more powerful. Gay’s narration perfectly conveys every emotion, perfectly conveys just how horrifying and hard to talk about her experiences are without melodrama or tears. → 🌺 let's talk empathy ←I’m a little horrified by several s seeming to imply - or outright state - that Roxane Gay is making her problems worse by wallowing or by “refusing” to open herself to others - or even worse, that she is “choosing” not to heal. Roxane went through a horrible experience, and choosing to heal after an experience like that is work. The fact that she is working so hard at healing now is a testament to her strength. It is insane to me that anyone could read this book and have the immediate reaction “well, she was the one with a trauma-created eating disorder, so obviously she’s choosing not to heal!!” This response is horrifying and displays, in my view, a shocking lack of empathy towards other people. Or reading comprehension, for that matter; she is angry at herself for not being able to heal faster. I hate being this person, but: why are you all like this?I am possibly just as horrified by a comment saying that “she acknowledges she wants to lose weight, but also blames society for treating fat people badly!” So maybe this is a shock to a few of you [I’d hope rather few of you??], but people don’t deserve to be treated as less than human because their bodies don’t look how you feel they should. Basic empathy is actually a thing you should feel for people whether their bodies, which do not affect you, fit your standards or not. Genuinely, if you wrote something like that in your , you should maybe look at yourself. Examine why you felt so offended by Roxane’s criticism of societal systems meant to keep women with unruly bodies in firm self-hatred. I’d wonder why you weren’t horrified by her rape, by her own experiences, and jumped straight into ""but why doesn't she just lose weight?"" She's dealing with trauma and human empathy is a thing that exists. Jesus.This is a book that deeply affected me and one that I’ll think about for years.

I have to admit, I’m a little disappointed, because besides the admittedly amazing concept, there is really not that much to love about this book.So let’s talk.All Of This Is True follows four teens who spill their secrets to an NY bestselling author; their favorite, in fact. But when this author writes a book focusing around their real-life struggles, the lines of reality and fiction blur, and the four are put in an awful position.First of all, these characters are unforgivably bland. For a novel with unsympathetic characters to work, you have to feel those characters. You have to connect and relate to forgive bad people for their actions. And honestly… I just didn’t feel that. These people read like caricatures. Penny was the only character I even remotely felt sympathy for in interview chapters. Jonah gains sympathy in early chapters of the fake book, but only through writing that is incredibly emotionally manipulative. Since we mentioned the emotionally manipulative Jonah chapters, let’s talk about that. The writing style of this whole book is, let’s be real, amateurish. Which actually could have been fine — except parts of this novel are excerpts from a fake book written by an author whose first book was an NYT-list, incredibly pretentious mediation on grief. The fact that excerpts of her second novel feel like they could be the writing style of someone who had never written before makes the whole book really unbelievable in its own universe.And then there’s the fact that despite this book being basically unputdownable — you have to find out what happens — the actual book only lays down a few reveals. Even worse, most plot points or plot twists are guessable very early on, and the ending is especially weak on this point. I tend to seriously love hard-to-guess-but-not-out-of-nowhere reveals and live for them in my suspense / mystery reads, so I guess the lack of shocking reveals sort of hampered my enjoyment of this one? The upside to this one is that it is — and I am so not kidding — impossible to put down. I read most of this book during a study period that I had promised myself I’d use for a certain long-term project. I was also in a slump the week this happened. I could not put it down.So overall, even though I wasn’t all that impressed by all the dynamics and elements here, I’d give this one a somewhat positive . It was marketed as a cheesy YA thriller and it gave me cheesy YA thriller. Just be sure that’s what you’re expecting, and you’ll enjoy it enough.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,182,1,"Mar 23, 2018","Mar 23, 2018","Nov 27, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35068735-all-of-this-is-true

The problem with this book is that there are a lot of events and sideplots and about 75% have nothing to do with the book. That blurb? That romance and exploration of incorrect expectations promised by this book? Basically nonexistent in the first half. You know what the focus of the first half is? Well, me neither.

See, I love that there’s an autistic protagonist who gets to be the focus. And I’m hoping this book will improve on this front later. But Martin’s mother is… really clearly anti autistic people, and the narrative is very unclear on calling her out. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Okay, a lot uncomfortable, but I'm trying to stave it off because I DNFed this and I can't form full opinions on narrative agency in books I DNFed. I don’t know, guys.

But I am also telling you that I liked reading it a lot. It is no-holds-barred entertainment with hints of substance underneath that I’m hoping continue to develop.Audrey Rose does autopsies. On cadavers. This is obviously not generally considered acceptable for societal women in 1888. She is kind of not the most street smart person ever and keeps doing things that are completely lacking in common sense. I do not respect or like this about her. However, I like her as a concept [and no one ever said I had to be consistent]. Despite doing Things That Anyone Could Tell You Are Not Smart, she’s an interesting character with well-done emotional arcs. Also, I shockingly like the character of Thomas Cresswell? I think I was expecting stock asshole YA hero, but that’s not what I got. He’s not trying to be an asshole, he’s just genuinely obtuse about other people’s human emotions and other people in general. Which I like because I on some level relate. I like that the love interest has that trait, which is something I think we as a society usually frame as making a person terrible.In terms of the feminism I was kind of… no. Full disclosure, I do think this narrative will improve in further books. But the thing is, this book is not really that feminist. I honestly think my favorite Em, who also has read this book and also really likes Thomas Cresswell, put it best [as usual] - this book was so caught up in showcasing Audrey going against societal rules that it completely ignored and overshadowed other women in the narrative, and it is a lazy decision. And as she also pointed out, Audrey’s Indian heritage is basically glossed over. I have two original thoughts. My first original thought is that this book could have discussed colonialism way more if it were willing to make Audrey Rose’s dad a more nuanced character. [This is a really boring thought that everyone has already had]. Love that the heroine is half-Indian, but like… it is the 1880s in Britain and India is being brutalized right now. That would have been nice to mention once or twice, my guy. My second thought is that Thomas Cresswell should definitely have been a girl. Because the thing about this novel is it contains approximately four main characters aside from Audrey Rose, and all of them - by nature of the narrative and what it’s saying about male privilege - need to be men. Except for Thomas. And a book about two girls kicking ass and saving London together is sort of obviously more feminist than a book about one girl and one guy. Yes, I’m saying this book would be better if it were gayer, and yes, I’m right. Thanks.And now we get to the topic of the killer , which you should not read about because going in without knowledge is always good! Okay, the funny thing is that enough people said the killer was obvious “from chapter two” that I was really expecting it to be even more obvious than it was, and I ended up thinking it was the most obvious candidate instead of the actual killer for like half the book, until I finally realized that was just way too obvious. So yeah, fine, the reveal is kind of easy to guess. But… I still like this killer reveal. This killer reveal is good because it doesn’t really depend on shocking you? I had heavily considered the possibility and it still just made me sad for Audrey Rose. Which I think makes for an overall stronger reveal.Anyway, I think this  is probably over because I’m tired of writing it. But I thought this book was really entertaining. I haven't read book two yet - that might be the source of my decision on whether to recommend this - but I mean, I did enjoy it. Guiltily. So you might too.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,252,1,"Mar 29, 2018","Apr 09, 2018","Nov 25, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28962906-stalking-jack-the-ripper

Ovid found dead.There is something very satisfying about reading a book that sees fit to rectify the sins of the past. The story of Atalanta is a story of an arrogant woman being outsmarted by a clever man — just as in the story of Circe, or of Antigone, or of any of a number of women who have been raped & betrayed in Greek and Latin myths, there is no greater sin of a woman than arrogance. In Outrun the Wind, however, Atalanta is the heroine, and her desire to not be married is not the opponent. Outrun the Wind is, in basic conceit, a romance between the famous Atalanta and an ex-oracle of Delphi and huntress of Artemis named Kahina. And as a romance, it is quite good! We see the development from enemies, to friends, to lovers. It’s sort of heartbreaking at times and really really nice. The idea of the power of women is very strong within this book. Our main wlw romance, for example, is based quite solidly on connection between women and intimacy between women. The very sympathetic Artemis and unsympathetic Apollo serve as another distinct and interesting choice, playing into an idea of women as the forces of good in this text. The parts where the book faltered fell primarily in character development and plot structure. While Kahina and Atalanta are both likable enough characters, I sometimes found it slightly hard to invest in them as individuals; I feel like I got more of an essence than I got actual characterization, ya know? It just felt first-drafty. The plot structure is another big issue; I really felt I didn’t know where this book was going for a really long time. It’s just one of those narratives that feels like it lacks thinking out from the beginning. Again, this is the kind of issue that gets ironed out in further drafts; it didn't quite feel like the book had yet arrived. Overall, this was good, and entertaining - it just feels like it could have gone through another round of drafting.

I mean, just look at the 3.3 average rating. And you know what, I do not disagree. Hawthorne repeats every single thing he says eighty times because that's the style of the time. But the strength of the message shines through. And despite the marketing, I'd argue this book isn't really about slut-shaming. The Scarlet Letter is about the effect of shame on people, both when external and when external. And it's an exploration of the roots of shame - the way our society's view of us can be a root into our view of us.This is a surprisingly complex book to analyze - with so much nuance added to every theme and symbol, it's hard to argue that this book is one-note. And the characters have some interest to them, too; Hester has some amazing moments, and Pearl is simply an icon. Listen, I'm not one to stan classics just because they're classics; classic books are books like any other and should be praised or criticized at will. But my experience with this book was completely different from the experience of other ers on this page. I do think having a good English teacher can be super essential in reading books like this; having a bad one is going to totally ruin your experience, and I get that. But I loved this book.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Nov 07, 2017",Dec 2017,"Nov 07, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7158816-the-scarlet-letter

Following a normally shy teacher who ascends a mysterious and mythic tower in search of his missing wife, Senlin Ascends brings both the intrigue and the magic to the table.Senlin Ascends follows schoolmaster Thomas Senlin as he looks for his wife, lost on a vacation to the Tower. As he attempts to look for her up the first six levels of the tower, he meets a large array of strange characters… and perhaps learns a little courage and determination, along the way. This book loves the unexpected, and the random, and the dark and weird. This world is excellently crafted, with each level holding a different story. My favorite thing about this book, I think, was the fantastic cast of distinguished and compelling side characters. (view spoiler)[These included: →Adam Boreas, a character who is not what he seems (twice). Loved what was done here.→Finn Goll, a Basement-level acquaintance. →Edith, a strange friend of the Parlor. Would absolutely die for her. →Ogier, a painter of the Baths. This man is embroiled in so many plot twists. Help him. →Voleta, another lost relation. My love. →Iren, a very morally grey Amazon. One of my other favorite characters. (hide spoiler)]I really feel like all of these female characters feel very realized for a book written in 2013 by a man, and am hoping that trend continues on to later books. I also enjoyed how this works as a takeoff of the dead-wife-motivator trope: while Marya does not appear within much of the actual book, we get a good sense that she is not only brave, but very clever. While Senlin’s motivation is certainly to find his wife, she is not only a motivator. What I really liked about this story was that it contained so many incredible plot reveals. It is a very particular talent to turn seemingly random details into an interesting plot reveal. I figured out a few plot twists, but that’s okay: there were always more to impress me. It’s also just very satisfying seeing all the pieces come together into a fantastic reveal. Worldbuilding this detailed is hard to make noteworthy to a plot. Saying anything else about this would start giving way to spoilers, so here we are: any fans of fantasy that’s more full of mystery and intrigue than epic will really enjoy this.

Be Not Far From Me is a short book about Ashley, a former hiker, attempting to survive in the woods after a disastrous night out. In many aspects, this is a fairly standard survival story; a character with some knowledge of the woods gets stranded, and has to find a way back home. It succeeds because of excellent writing. McGinnis is a fantastic writer of suspense because she crafts characters who are easy to root for and puts them in dark, impossible-to-beat situations. Her characters succeed because they stay highly motivated. You believe in their mission, so you can continue to root for that mission. Be Not Far From Me is supremely well-written and tense, especially if you vibe with other McKinnis works. It is a book that refuses to pull punches.

Yes, I manage to tell myself as I sink my teeth into a bread stick, I'm not taking Oxy because it makes me feel good.I'm taking it for other people.This is a matter of taste. This was marketed a bit as a suspense book and it really really isn't; it's more of a contemporary. At this point in my life, in terms of contemporary I look almost entirely for books I see as providing hope, some kind of catharsis and release. It is this, that for me, makes literature and television and movies and music so compelling: stories so worth coming back to, narrative so worth building my life around. Heroine contains a release of tension, yes, but it does not occur until the very end, until lead character Mickey has spiraled so far into an opiate addiction it's almost impossible to find a way out. This is not inherently damning to a book's objective value, but to my ability to appreciate the book, it was a kill shot. This book is the kind of thing I probably would have found compelling five years ago. Now, however, I found myself almost bored. This is a deeply important topic, but Go Ask Alice and every Ellen Hopkins book have already trod the ground of far-down spirals (albeit less well). I know how this story progresses and I know how this story ends - literally, given the prologue is the climactic scene. The character beats here in Mickey's life are compelling enough, but the spiral remains. That is not to say there is no value in portraying the opioid crisis in a new way - as a result of prescription drugs. Every day in the United States, over 130 people die of opioid overdoses. After pharmaceutical companies in the late 1990s denied that opioid prescription could lead to addiction, prescription skyrocketed; when the opposite was later proved true, the damage had already been done. Approximately 80% of heroin users, even today, were first prescribed opioids. This is a real public health crisis and it's important to tackle. And yet... I found myself wishing that the book were about the recovery process the end only suggests, about Mickey dealing with her issues with her parents and her stepmom and so many more. We know Mickey has issues, and Mindy McGinnis knows she has issues - that's not the problem. The problem is that the narrative is so focused on the downward spiral that it forgets to leave room for the healing, the catharsis. It is a twenty-page catharsis in exchange for 400 pages of drug abuse and three deaths. (This isn't a spoiler, as it's the opening scene.)Mindy McGinnis is an utterly wonderful author in terms of actual style, in terms of crafting a good sentence and tension and conflict. I've already adored her books The Female of the Species and This Darkness Mine. It's just that this book, as a whole, lacks a lot of actual content beyond the slow fall into addiction. And while it makes for a fast, dark read that left me breathless - please don't get me wrong, I read this in two sittings - that's just not what I want to read anymore.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,"Jun 13, 2019","Jun 15, 2019","Oct 28, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40536342-heroine

Divinia didn't have the luxury of such fragility. She had to be made of granite.Creepy sapphic reads are my new aesthetic. This is the shortest short-story collection I’ve ever read, and I don’t mean that ironically. While I liked the concepts and writing styles of both short stories, I felt they each could’ve been a bit longer and had the chance to flesh out more ideas. Because both these ideas are truly brilliant, and both of these ideas need just a little more pagetime.➽The Haunting Of Divinia: This is the more melancholy of the two stories. But it's eerily-toned and definitely made me emotional. I think if it'd been a bit longer, the ending would've had far more impact. ➽Taste: This one is super creepy. The level of buildup and dramatic tension is perfect, and although I did feel that a longer buildup could've had a greater impact, this one was a great read. Altogether, I'd definitely recommend this collection! I know it's short, but come on - it's spooky, it's sapphic, and it's cheap on kindle.

Not even death.I do not think I expected one of the best books I read this year to be a retelling of Frankenstein where it’s not just about the nature of monstrousness, but about the power of women working together and escaping an abusive relationship, with intoxicating writing and a morally grey lady as the protagonist. And yet… here we are. I don’t think you can talk about this book without talking about the characters, because they really do star. Their group is so fantastic and I absolutely loved the importance of the various character relationships within the book; rather than being driven by romance, Elizabeth is primarily driven by her relationship with Justine and, to some extent later, Henry and Mary. ✔Elizabeth – one of the most interesting and developed narrators I have had the pleasure of reading about this year. she is so deeply morally ambiguous yet so sympathetic to the audience and also, the narrative agency.

I have no evidence for this she’s just gay. book nerd badass. ✔Justine – the more naive, or stereotypically ladylike, lady character in this novel, and yet is treated just as well by the story as Elizabeth and Mary. deserved better.✔Henry – a good man, a pure man, the only man we’ve ever trusted. I support him.✔Victor – no. a bad man and we hate himI absolutely loved the way Kiersten White wrote the abusive relationship at the heart of this - we see the fucked-up nature of that relationship long before Elizabeth does, but it never feels as if Elizabeth “should’ve known better.” In every moment, she has full audience sympathy - in every moment, even if I hated her actions, I understood her. The narrative puts you so far into her mind that it is impossible to look away and it is glorious. I think the focus on agency within a narrative should be clear, but I really do want to say - this is why retellings are my favorite. Taking a book that is about the essential nature of humanity from the perspective of a man and flipping its themes solidly is something I will always be in full support of - the meta-textuality of the narrative is absolutely brilliant. And it’s not just about one woman - it’s about the relationships between women and the strength found in them. Mary, Justine, and Elizabeth form such fantastic relationships, and each feels so fully-formed in a way they may not have in the original narrative. I could criticize this - the first half is far too slow, in my opinion, and I still can’t decide whether to love or hate the ending but I’m not sure it’s what I would have wanted - but I can already feel an urge to reread and annotate and write even more about the themes in this book. For me, that is a declaration of love. I think this book [and my new love for Victorian horror] convinced me to read Frankenstein for a project this fall, so maybe I’ll use it as an excuse to reread.

Passing Strange is a speculative fiction ode to San Francisco’s hidden history, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I know the blurb is marketing the story as one of six different women, but it truly only follows three characters - a woman in our present day, and two women in a budding relationship in the 1940s. ➽Helen - a Chinese immigrant working as a dancer, because. you know. racism. Also, apparently lived to over 80 years old, like the lesbian icon she is. ➽Haskel - a famous artist in the future, unknown to most even as being a woman. I fucking love women who have to publish under male names and no one knows are women!! this is my favorite plotline and I love it that's all bye!!➽Emily - a new arrival to the town, traveling to San Francisco after being thrown out of her boarding school for being queer.All of these characters were so effortlessly compelling, in so many ways, that I didn't have any trouble connecting and rushing through.Honestly, though, my true favorite thing about this book was the setting. Look at that painting on the cover. Then think about San Francisco. Then think about the lesbians. Then think about the 1920-1940 era. Tell me that isn't an aesthetic you're totally into.

In love with Baphomet. ♔ Baphomet— the dude who pretended to kill a human, and may be getting some hidden depth? Also, may not be a god at all. In love with Morrigan. ♔ Baal Hadad— we know he had a fight with Inanna, we know that Luci may have slept with his boyfriend, and we know that he looks really good in that red suit. ♔ Woden— the racist pantheon leader. ♔ Minerva— a young god. ♔ Sahkmet— only seen in first. ♔ Inanna— all we know is he had a fight with Baal. And now we know he also dresses like a badass and is probably nonbinary. Was at the panel. A GOOD. I’m sad and I miss him. ♔ Dionysus— Just wants to make people happy, which kind of rocks. ♔ Tara— an unknown entity who wants too much attention, according to Luci. ♔ Uror / Cassandra— a badass Asian trans girl reporter who’s researching Luci’s death.

When you witness the breadth of history, you understand how small you are. And yet at the same time you realize how much your life matters...how much you shape the people around you.”This book feels like a lacking-in-character-development version of Firefly, which – while taking away one of the key things that makes Firefly so good – still has some surprisingly great moments. I couldn’t even put it down for the last 250 pages. This is one of the most creative stories I’ve ever read. Beginning as a story about a heist crew and time travel and ending as a story about the multiverse and the nature of memories, Invictus certainly jumps around – but somehow, the chaotic plot works. SUCH a fast-paced read. I couldn’t even put it down for the last 250 pages. To me, this is a story about identity – and moreover, what your identity becomes when memories leave. But it’s one hidden behind an action-filled exterior. But I honestly felt this could’ve gone way deeper. There were a few themes here that seemed so intriguing - there’s a brief conversation on modern-day prejudice compared with that of the futuristic setting, and I thought that was so great! And then it goes away after being mentioned once. The worldbuilding of the futuristic society itself seemed so compelling! And then it doesn’t get mentioned for the rest of the book! And though the concept of heists through time is brilliant, more could’ve been done with that, too. The setting descriptions don’t feel very immersive, to a point where I had trouble getting a mental map in my mind of the locations.But honestly, the core issue is the lacking character work. Who started out with such potential and ended… null. 🌺 Far – our egotistical lead character, whose arc deserved to go far deeper🍀 Eliot – our mysterious stranger girl character, who started out leaving me worrying over manic pixie dream girls but ended up awesome and dynamic🌺 Priya – Far’s girlfriend and maybe my favorite of the characters🍀 Gram – the ship’s engineer and a generic love interest who could’ve been more🌺 Imogen – Far’s cousin, crazy-haired, part of a boring love plot, and honestly kind of annoying🍀 Saffron, the red panda, who is definitely my favorite character. Saffron protection squad.Here’s the thing: I think if the characters had been better developed, this would’ve been a perfect book. The lack of character development is a huge detriment to another aspect of the book: the romance. While one of the romances is established before the book and fairly well-done, the other one is instalovey, and it just does not work with so little development to either of their characters. The attraction doesn’t feel very deep. Because truly, aside from my annoyance at the lacking character and theme work, this is a wonderful book and a delightfully campy story. The fake curse words and ellipses should feel cheesy, but they honestly feel like a part of the book’s fabric of humor.

The representation of Bengali culture is #ownvoices and feels very full-of-heart. Rukhsana’s situation is handled with a good deal of care; her scenario is deeply psychologically terrifying, and I think the author does an excellent job of playing around with this.I think the value of this book is its representation of the fact that not every Bengali person thinks the same way, as American media outlets and White American cultural centers often assume. There's an excellent discussion here of Bengali LGBTQ activism; Sohail's character is an amazing touch and made me love this book so much about halfway through ((view spoiler)[the mlm/wlw solidarity... I loved that (hide spoiler)]). And indeed, I liked the portrayal of the fact that even the thoughts of Rukhsana’s parents are influenced by their background; as fucked up as what they are doing is, they are not portrayed as evil people, simply deeply misguided ones. I loved this conversation Rukhsana has with her friends:“Every time I say something bad about my family, it becomes more about where I come from than just regular stuff people go through with their parents.”I also adored reading about the support of other parts of Rukhsana’s family. Aunty Meena’s lesbianism conversation was so iconic. Shaila is so supportive, and her relationship with Rukhsana is such a nice touch; I’ve never really noticed this, but I don’t think cousins are often major players in YA books? And my cousins are such a big part of my life that all of these scenes really hit. Nani, Rukhsana’s grandmother, is an utterly fantastic character; her story absolutely killed me. I genuinely think most of the shining moments of the novel originate from Rukhsana's conversations with Nani. These sections got me and got me hard. I think my main problem with this was the actual writing was… just flat out not amazing. There is an overwhelming degree of Tell, Not Show in terms of story. Occasionally, Rukhsana changes emotions between paragraphs, making her feel like an irrational character - which she clearly isn't intended to be. This carries over to characters like Rukhsana's girlfriend, Ariana, who just doesn't have a consistent personality and as a result does not read as likable as I think she's meant to be. Plot points often feel really random and abrupt for the story due to lack of writing consistency. But what's weird is I think I probably would have gotten past that. Sure, the writing is not great, but the story is good, I see the broad strokes of the characters, I like the themes explored. I think I would have given this a 3 1/2 and rounded up, until… the last quarter.I am someone who really does not click with surprise twists in which you think everything is going to be good again, and then it all goes to shit. I am especially uncomfortable with how this particular twist occurs and its impact on the narrative. It’s impactful and important to point out the extent to which lgbtq people suffer under homophobia, but for me… it deeply did not work. I think this twist… might (heavy emphasis on might) have worked if the book had been more consistent about themes, but it honestly just felt like… a really out-of-taste plot point to me. Here's an ownvoices  by user Rushda that I think says this quite well:Though it was not there for shock value, the timing of it made it come across that way and, in my opinion, it was totally needless. It was not given adequate time and was rushed through, making it seem more like a convenient plot point for others' character development than a genuine tragedy.The way this twist is used essentially uses gay pain, and really graphic and heavy gay pain, to make Rukhsana's parents decide homophobia is bad, actually. This is somewhat lazy and on a far more personal level, a decision I found disturbing, given the history of the trope employed.I have issues with how we got there. But the ending made me tear up. I think the thing about this book is that it comes so close to being something genuinely revolutionary and it still... sort of is? It has something to say. It just says it in a way that is not as incredible as it could be.

I was somewhat enjoying this for a time. While I found this book slow-moving and everything up to the climax a little boring, I was hoping for some more plot development and enjoying Jack's character. But I'm put off by one relationship I felt was unhealthy and heavily disliked. Be warned there are spoilers ahead. At one point, a character (Paladin) who has up to this point identified with male pronouns changes pronouns partially to appease a romantic partner's homophobia (Elias). This left a sincerely bad taste in my mouth. The other character's use of the word ""faggot"" and fear of being perceived as gay is, effectively, the catalyst for his romantic interest changing gender pronouns. Especially considering the bots do not have gender identities, having a major character decide their genderless bot crush is female just so he doesn't have to worry about being a ""faggot"" is really, really uncomfortable. I initially found out this event from a friend's status, and honestly, I think it somewhat ruined my enjoyment of the book from the beginning. While I liked some parts of the early book, I could never get fully invested in Elias due to my knowledge of what was going to happen. I hoped that my er friend had overexaggerated this issue, but honestly, I think she was completely right in her interpretation (as usual). If not for that one issue, I think I could've enjoyed this book more. But honestly, who knows.

I suppose I've always felt that Shakespeare depends mostly on performanceWell, this has always been one of my least favorite Shakespearean tragedies. I suppose I've always felt that Shakespeare depends mostly on performance; it's not meant to be read until it's been seen at least once. And though I've seen one movie adaptation of this play as a child, I don't think I've seen quite enough to form an opinion. So instead of reading this in full, I listened on audiobook. And you know what? I think it wasn't enough. I think I needed to see this again before listening to it. Moreover, I think this is a play generally better seen than performed. While the language is beautiful, the emotionality of this play comes primarily from seeing these two young lovers - dumb, yes, but in love - kill themselves for what they believe. When reading this, it's simply something happening, something far away and removed. When you see it - really see it, see them gasping, see them desperate and upset - it's a call to action. Romeo and Juliet is, at its core, not a play about two lovers. It is a play about how prejudice and hate can destroy the happiness of two innocents. Reducing it to ""they were stupid"" is missing the point. They were stupid. But if not for the hate of their families, the feud that had been destroying their family for generations, they would have survived. Dumb, yes, but they would not have died if not for the hate of generations past. I really don't have much else to say: the language used in this play is gorgeous, of course, but among Shakespeare's tragedies, the characters don't speak to me on quite the level others do. Yet I think this play has the potential to be fantastic if seen live with talented actors. It's a play that will chiefly depend on its performances, but I think it's a play worth seeing if you get the chance. #BAZ LURHMANN MOVIE REVIEW Can I just say: this movie adaptation is completely wild. The cinematography is weird, and wild, and completely all over the place on purpose, as Lurhmann often does. The setting of the balcony scene is wonderful and beautifully done; I'm a huge fan of everything about the opening scene, which is so tonally odd that it sets a perfect tone for the show. I actually think the Mercutio performance in this one is my favorite; several of the other characters are just a little bit flat, although well-cast to emphasize the youth of the characters.#AUDIOBOOK PERFORMANCE REVIEW I liked Calista Flockhart's performance; while I felt she went too breathy at parts and didn't add the proper layer of characterization underneath all the innocence, I felt her intonation conveyed her feelings quite well. Unfortunately, I felt myself hard-pressed to truly believe in Matthew Wolf's performance. His intonation spoke to me of lust, not of true love. The only moment where I genuinely loved his character was in the final poisoning scene; I was left near tears during his final monologue, the only moment I truly felt strongly during the play.

I feel like a lot of stories about queer girls like this might’ve been full-out angst over how to come out, and that can be really well done, don’t get me wrong. But I love that this book a) does the coming out scenes in a way that feels authentic to the characters and the situation of coming out, b) avoids violently outing anyone [listen, too many of my favorite lgbtq reads do this] and c) doesn’t make coming out the focus of the book. I feel like so many reads focus too much on this and unintentionally turn great romances into stories about The Struggle Of Being Gay, but I also desperately need more realistic coming out stories. This one is both.“I think I just assumed everyone looked at girls that way. Because girls are beautiful and pretty and why wouldn’t you want them? Took me a little while to realize that wasn’t the case.”I honestly don’t have a ton to say about this novella other than it was a really cute and easy read, but I will say a few random thoughts I had in my brain! First of all, I loved the supportive friendships and subversion of girl hate. Stella and Kyle’s best friends become friends too and they’re both basically angels and I love them. The writing is a lot more quality than inI also love the banter. I fucking love good banter. There should’ve been more. But still, A+ humor, am I right?“There are never enough shows with lesbians,” I said. “Aren’t there any? I never really noticed.” Oh, sweet gayby. I kept forgetting that she was so new to this.[THIS IS THE MOST RELATABLE SENTENCE I’VE EVER SEEN IN A BOOK]This book is solidly in that NA / YA transitional gap that I’ve seen a lot recently, so there is [not particularly explicit] sex and a few scenes featuring masturbation. I actually really appreciated this, it’s really rare to see girls masturbate in literature at all and I’m down for Breaking The Double Standard. Unfortunately, I think this was simulataneously my small negative thought on this book? On an objective level, I love the normalization of queer girl sexuality, but on a subjective level, I am not as into sex as a n y o n e in this novel and I honestly spent like a quarter of my time being like ????? but you know what, I acknowledge this is a me problem.

There is a lot of good going on in this book. The writing is still good, with several lines that made me gasp just a little. The plot is entertaining and easy to follow. The discussion of addiction, grief, and trauma is wonderful, as I discussed in my  for book one. This series remains one of the best in shooting down heteronormativity in the YA canon, featuring a casually bisexual protagonist who gets a lot of development and narrative agency; it is also deeply sex-positive and handles elements of consent well. I think one of my favorite parts of this book was the burgeoning romance between Odessa and Meredy, which was honestly a struggle point for me in book one: partially because I really struggle with the falling-in-love-with-your-ex’s-sibling trope, and possibly also because one of my biggest character shifts over the past year has been deciding I like romance in fiction. In this book, though, their  intimacy, both emotionally and physically, is just so nice. (I took a photo on page 141 because they had just... such a cute scene.)And I honestly cannot stress this enough: Sarah Glenn Marsh really is great at getting you invested in a wide array of characters. Seriously, this book is a fucking masterpiece of amazing character development for side characters. Valoria, Kasmira, Jax, Simon, Danial, and Karston all offer a lot of compelling moments and development; new animal sidekick Nipper, a baby dragon, is also an excellent addition. In fact, almost all of the many major plot arcs – Jax’s character development, Simeon’s job as a teacher and upcoming wedding to Danial, Kasmira’s repeated struggles in a new realm, Valoria’s new queendom, Karston’s coming into his powers, and perhaps most notably, Meredy’s grief and its effects – are really about side characters we’re invested in. And this presents a problem. The majority of this book is about people around Meredy – she almost entirely stays uninvolved in the drive of the plot.On one hand, it’s deeply impressive that Sarah Glenn Marsh has so much to say in regards to character development; Odessa’s struggle with addiction and grief was exactly what made the first book so compelling. But in a narrative with only one protagonist, Odessa’s self-realization in this book makes her feel more stagnant in this book than other characters. Please don’t get me wrong – we, as the audience, are deeply invested in her growth and her relationships. But here, Odessa doesn’t have the central character arc. It feels as if we’re seeing the book progress. I think the story would feel much more cohesive were these characters also protagonists rather than side characters. I’ll give a few examples of good changes multi-pov could make: —Valoria’s point of view would give us far more chance to see the political drama of this book, which occurs primarily in the periphery. —Jax’s character arc feels as if it could be so much more heartrending in first point of view. —There’s this excellent romantic scene around page 315 that takes place between two characters we’ve been invested in seperately since book one, and I just feel in my soul that this romance, in dual POV, would have both killed and revived me. —Odessa and Meredy’s dynamic in dual pov?? Can you even imagine. We spend a lot of time not knowing where Meredy is at, but just IMAGINE seeing her conflict through first point of view here. —Most of the good aspects stay quite stable: the main “twist” of the book is still an excellent twist, well set-up and paid off. One minor issue is that  this world just doesn’t quite feel realized. I get the politics of the realm, for the most part, but without almost any setting descriptors (they’re seriously lacking here) it’s often hard to get a mental picture of the world, and thus hard to get invested in the world’s wellbeing. This book demands I care for Karthia and I need more setting to do so.Another issue is that the plot lacks some structure. A tragedy occurs around page 300 that feels like a climactic buildup and escalation, only it doesn’t feel as if tension has been built up very well in the preceding pages. This confused me at first, as tension does continuously scale. Then I noticed the problem: each chapter is attempting to be dramatic, focusing on a conflict (and often distinct ones, focusing on different characters) that is often resolved within the very same chapter. This is well-intentioned, but the short chapter length ruins the effect. The result, instead, is a book that feels just… somewhat disjointed. It’s a mixed bag, but generally forgivable because this book is so chock-full of amazing ideas and discussions. I genuinely loved some of the character development and plot build here, and though I can’t pretend I don’t see the potential here for something even better, I would still recommend this duology as a character-development-filled, well-written series about grief, both cultural and personal. ✨Arc received from the publisher via Keplers for an honest .

And that I hate cheating as a plot device so fucking much oh my god can it just die already? Finding Yvonne is a slice-of-life story about a girl who becomes pregnant, and while some elements - like the unapologetic feminism - stood out to me, other elements - like the aggressive cheating being completely excused - left me less optimistic. Inherent to Finding Yvonne is a sense of forgiveness for bad deeds, and a great sense of objectivity on the part of the narrator. Colbert clearly does not want to condemn Yvonne for her actions or slut-shame her at all, and this is both the greatest strength and greatest weakness of the book. On one hand, I think the lack of slut-shaming is lovely, and I definitely loved the nuance with which this narrative was crafted. On the other hand, the book does not acknowledge emotional cheating as a wrong. Like, the narrator literally says it:""I did nothing wrong.""Yvonne, I appreciate that you don't want to pay forever, and I appreciate that you've taken down slutshaming but um, yes, you did do something wrong. ➽It's no one's business that Yvonne had sex with two people in a week, but pursuing a serious relationship with two people at once is bad, period, and I wish the book could've acknowledged that nuance. And honestly, ignoring the cheating, I just didn't think the book was all that good? The writing is excellent, and the feminist take is stellar, but due to the slice-of-life nature, the character progression is lackluster at best - and that's what makes a novel for me. Though I think Colbert writes excellent voice, leading me to begin the book really loving Yvonne's character, frankly, she doesn't have a particularly interesting character arc. And since the side characters left me cold, as I think is usual for Colbert books, I just found myself feeling one step removed.I will give Brandy Colbert a definite check in the activism and being an awesome person box. Themes like the heavily anti-slut-shaming message - though it's marred by the book barely passing the Bechdel test - and the important discussion around race and erasure of mixed-race Warner's blackness all definitely left an impression on me. But with so little attachment to the characters, this just could not progress past a 2.5 for me. So let's run this down. We have:♔ A fairly interesting narrator♔ Slice-of-life nature and readability♔ Feminism, primarily black characters, and important conversationsAND YET all good things are ruined and we also have:♚ A lackluster love triangle involving cheating♚ Excusal of said cheating♚ Barely any solid character progression♚ just... nothing especially interesting.Just... god. I wish there was more happening here and less weirdness around cheating, because I feel like this could have been really awesome.

Fowley-Doyle's writing has a tone I've never quite seen before. She's not writing magical realism, but it's somewhere close. There's a sense of everyday magic to Spellbook of the Lost and Found. As the book goes on, you're forced to ask: is the magic is even real? And perhaps more importantly, does it matter either way?Yet despite all the weirdness, this is a book with a lot of meaning. I don't want to get into any spoilers here, but some of my favorite themes here are so strong at the forefront of this book. There's just so much here:🌹 The exploration of self-hate through Hazel's character.🍁 The exploration of the sins of the mother not defining you, again, through Hazel's character. 🌹 The exploration of (view spoiler)[sexual assault (hide spoiler)] through Rose's character.🍁 The found family trope. While both leads have very pure romance plots - I'm excluding the cryptic third pov - romance is not the focus. I also definitely want to give out a shoutout for the diversity. I got the impression from s that this was going to be side character diversity or a side f/f romance and NOPE. The two leads of this book are BOTH sapphic women. One is an Indigenous lesbian and one is disabled and bi. There is another side bi character. There are only two negatives, one of which is minor. First of all, though I understand the intent of the book enough to ignore this, I was a little confused by the characters in the first half of this book. Why? BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY LEADS. There's the group formed between Hazel, Ivy, Rowan, the pair of besties, Olive and Rose, and the cryptic third pov of Laurel, complete with plenty of her own side characters. I actually love how many characters there are, and how many layers the book is given as a result, but the initial experience was not my favorite. And there's one more thing that bothered me. (view spoiler)[I was bothered by the fact that a plot twist involving Ivy effectively means Hazel had a crush on her half-sister. They never date, of course, and neither knew, and it's not even brought up. But idk, it loosely bothered me. (hide spoiler)] I know this is minor, but I thought I should point it out. In summary: I adored it, even more than Fowley-Doyle's debut The Accident Season. This was the gay witch book I’ve always deserved, and I can't wait to read Fowley-Doyle's next.

You start with nothing and maybe end with everything.”One of the unexpected sweetest books I’ve read all year about failing at perfection, but finding something close anyway.What If It's Us follows two characters on a summer in New York forming a very-imperfect and very-cute relationship.✔Ben - Written by Adam Silvera. Puerto Rican and gay. Way too relatable. Thinks about prices more due to being from a low-income family. Just went through a breakup where he was the dumper but also feels like he was the one who cared more. Basically the epitome of thinking fate is fake and wanting to believe in love but also not really believing in love. His dynamic with Dylan, Hudson, and Harriet was so great, and his family dynamic is so sweet. ✔Arthur - Written by Becky Albertalli. Jewish, gay, and has ADHD. Did not enjoy as much at first and then he grew on me. His paranoia over his guy best friend, Ethan, being subtly homophobic was way too real; I loved his relationship with him and Jessie, and with his parents, and most importantly, with two interns at his parent's workplace. I felt his complex around everyone finding him too enthusiastic so hard; I feel like my persona on this website is the most enthused version of myself and I love her, but trust me, I am not as much like this with the general population in real life. I feel like all of Goodreads has been waiting for this all year - a collab between two of our most popular authors!! This is the fourth book for both of these authors, and having read all of Adam’s previous work (and most of Becky’s) I was of course hyped. But I was also concerned. I love Becky’s sweet books, but they often have a certain lack of plot structure. And I love Adam’s sad books, but they often get caught up in the sad of it all. Most of all, I worried that the two halfs of the book would not blend.That was not the case. Actually, I think this book was the best of both worlds, and it is perfect. Becky’s tone falls closest to her cute but realistically flawed Leah on the Offbeat and Adam’s closest to my absolute favorite book of his, They Both Die at the End. I feel like Becky is generally a much more fun writer, while Adam has a bit more of that quality factor; here, I felt like their different stiles both got those good qualities. I never once found myself thinking about Becky writing one chapter and Adam the next. And I think their collab lends this book a unique tone; both of these characters are flawed, their relationship is flawed, and things aren’t ever perfect, but things don’t always suck, either. I absolutely adored the balance between realism and subversion of typical romantic tropes - their first date is awkward, their first kiss is not magical - and dramatic romantic gestures - a two-sided search through New York, a romantic last-date scavenger hunt, and THE DOUBLE CHOCOLATE COOKIE. Can I just emphasize that even with the nice rom-com tropes, it reads very realistic? The characters do struggle with jealousy, and with miscommunications, but it always read as fairly real to me. The three-part structure of this book is excellent on this front as well - each one has a different “goal” for the characters that then lends itself to a now-what question. It feels like a really good representation of the tumult of life. I feel like the pop culture references in this will be somewhat polarizing - I thought they were cute. Like, yeah, I think saying they went a little overboard is fair, not all of them completely rang true, and I think I once had the thought that not even theater kids think about the line ""not throwing my shot"" this much, but on the whole I was quite pleased by the dialogue and banter of this. And I have now seen several s saying this was meant exclusively to appeal to ""booktubers,"" which, I'm sorry, are booktubers the only people who like Harry Potter.........? ? [No spoilers here, but if you really want to know nothing, skip this.]And last but not least, fuck you ALL for making me think I would be mad about the epilogue of this. May I just state right now and forever: the epilogue is absolutely fantastic. I heard “realistic” and I was expecting “tragic” as in they lose touch and I cry for years. That was not what I got. The epilogue is so strange because it’s not a typical happy ending, but it made me happier than almost anything else I’ve read this year. This went from a rounded up 3 1/2 to a solid five exclusively because I adored the epilogue so. much. It’s absolutely what will keep this book stuck in my head in six months; the perfect acknowledgment that not everything always ends perfectly, but sometimes you can find something even better.TW: racism, homophobia, panic attacks, past cheating. ✨Arc received from the publisher via Edelweiss for an honest .

It has been a full month since I read this book and I am still so shook by it and so invested and,,, oh my god. Guys, do not sleep on this. This is going on my preemptive top ten of the year and no one can stop me. Okay, so now that I’ve stopped crying again, let’s get to why this book is so good. At its heart, I think this book is a perfect conveyment of what it is really like to be a teenage girl growing up in our current society and what it is like to struggle with yourself, to struggle with your friends right before you go to college. So for me - I am also beginning to deal with the college application process - there’s that sense of how personal this book is for me.That’s one level to it, but there are so many more. Like, okay Final Draft stars a pansexual biracial Ecuadorian plus-size lead with anxiety. And listen, the way the narrative talks about Laila’s experience of being pansexual, of being biracial, of being Ecuadorian, of being plus size, of having anxiety: it’s all there and it’s all amazing. And if you relate to any single one of these things, or probably even if you've been a teenager before, you will get her. The way Riley Redgate writes Laila is so… empathetic. I have never felt a character on the same level that I felt this character. Redgate will just make one passage at the end of a chapter focus on a specific part of Laila’s experience in the world, and suddenly you feel as if your life has been changed forever. Like that one chapter where Laila talks about how she was taught to be ashamed of sex and romance to the point where her pansexuality felt shameful, and it’s not even about her being queer, but about her being ashamed to feel at all - I felt that.You know, I think integrating so many different discussions into the narrative could have made for a slightly all-over-the-place book, but it does not at all. Redgate knows exactly where to place her quotes and exactly how to compose the narrative so that every aspect of Laila’s life feels like an authentic part of a big picture and more importantly, a fundamental part of her character arc. I don’t know how that’s possible. But... she did it? This book is also about Laila falling in love with - it’s kind of a spoiler but I DON’T CARE I HAVE TO SCREAM - her best friend, Hannah, who is a Korean lesbian. And can I just scream for a minute because their romance is SO SUBTLE AND SO PERFECT. Oh my god, I spent the first 45% of the book thinking I was imagining it, maybe, but totally shipping them anyway. You do not understand. Hanna/Laila being canon is the best thing in my life and the only thing keeping me alive for the next year. I've been struggling for a few months to figure out why this book made such an impact on me, and I've landed on this - there's a passage in that book where Laila talks about being pansexual, but not having considered it very much because she's been taught not to feel sexual attraction or even romantic attraction. her identity as a queer person has been tied up so much in her anxiety and her identity as a woman and as a woman of color and as a plus-size woman, and I just remember reading that on page and realizing that I'd never seen the experience of having different identities affect you in different ways on page.Let me put it another way. Laila is just a fucking teenager living her life before college and thinking about losing her friends and living her future career and she's also dealing with her own identity, and none of that is there to be the Message. she is not there to be a message book, and she is not there to have everything fixed because that's not how life works. but she's there to grow and change as we all do, every day and every year, and she's there because girls like her exist. girls like us exist. Listen, guys, this book made one of the biggest impacts on me of any book I read this year. I don’t remember the last time I read a YA contemporary so real, so in touch with the emotions and moods of every character. and a total masterpiece. I have no idea how ANYONE could write something this fantastic but I do know that this is one of the best books of 2018 and one of my absolute F A V E things I’ve read.

I knew this wasn’t going to be a book for me. I knew, going in, that both Binti and Binti:Home were extremely well-written and yet absolutely nothing I enjoy reading. I should not have read this, I should have stopped at Binti, and I regret my actions. I’m sorry, okay? But... do you want to hear my severely mixed opinions on this book anyway? Because I’m giving them. I think the problem with this novella series is it is entirely for people who looooooove worldbuilding. And here is the thing: I do not care that much about worldbuilding. I am so consistent on this that I have it in my bio - I read primarily for atmosphere, characters, and themes and I genuinely don’t think I have never enjoyed anything primarily because of the worldbuilding. Okay, but I have mentioned characters and themes, right? So why aren’t those factors? Yes, the character work in this book is - occasionally - really fantastic, and the theme work even more so. I think my greatest excuse for not liking it is that… the themes just aren’t the focus. I know everyone markets these books as being all about theme work, but jesus, where the fuck is the theme work? Because to me, it is buried under about eight layers of worldbuilding that I don’t actually care that much about. I would totally love these... if the themes were the focus. And I would probably evangelize them if Binti herself were the constant focus. Listen, the only reason I kept reading these is because I literally adore Binti - her coping mechanisms for ptsd, her mix of anger and calm, the occasional exploration of her now being two species all made an impact on me. And her platonic relationship with Okwu randomly means a lot to me, your local platonic relationship stanner. But it’s just not the focus!! Hey, maybe I’ll get some comment saying I just didn’t get it and I need to reread. Maybe I just don’t understand Good Literature. It’s chill.Okay, let’s be fair to the book - I’ve seen a lot of s praising how subversive this book is. This book is also a part of a genre I have no knowledge of. Sooooo before taking my  as the gospel, please do consider that I may just not be the intended audience for this. As the #1 supporter of trope subversions everywhere, I would consider leaving this out of my  a huge waste. Oh, but on the topic of tropes, because I’m angry: something I always appreciated about this series was the total lack of romance. Adding a romance in the final book with a newly-introduced character? Bad choice. I know I sorta hate romance, but really... why?Listen, I hate giving it’s-not-you-it’s-me s. I hate feeling like I’m copping out or trying to avoid offending anyone when I write these. So trust me when I say I would not hesitate to trash these if they were bad - I just actually genuinely think this is a case of it’s-not-you-it’s-me. I guess we can’t win them all.

The most important question on whether or not I can enjoy high fantasy, at least for now as I’m still a newby, is whether or not I can engage in the narrative. High fantasy is an enjoyable genre, but sometimes, the longer and slower of the genre make me forget. Or my mood will. And this novella-length fantasy novel with an incredibly engaging story is the perfect example of entertaining and fast-paced high fantasy.Okay, let’s break down why this novella works so well. note: This  contains two spoiler sections, both marked with both tags and don’t-read-this notes.→thematic concept and ideas, p.ii←There are a lot of ideas in this novella, but the basic concept can be summed up like this: it’s about how oppressive groups systematically perpetrate marginalization, and how bystander culture is used by these groups to stop pushback.“Did we have to do it?” she asked.“No,” he answered, his voice breaking, tears falling into his beard to turn the flakes of ash to gray slush. “No, child. We didn’t.” He took a deep break then spoke again. “And making us complicit means we will never call them to account for the crime.”It’s so easy to make a population complicit in their own oppression, to force them to be complicit and ignore the suffering of those around them. The thing I thought was most interesting about this novel is how - yes, this is a spoiler - (view spoiler)[two character’s being queer and them being wizards are integrated as parts of the plot. It's sort of an interesting narrative and I'm interested to see where it goes! (hide spoiler)]→worldbuilding and concept←The world isn’t the focus, but it’s clearly built to criticize a deeply religious and discriminatory culture. The metaphor of this strict religious dictatorship is used sort of as a metaphor for queer oppression, which is clever. The world is not the focus of this novella, but it’s used well, tying into the themes of oppression perfectly. Never be sorry for loving, Heloise. No matter who it is, no matter how it is done, no matter how the person you love receives it. Love is the greatest thing a person can do. Most go their entire lives knowing only ritual and obligation, mistaking it for love. But you have loved truly, as few can ever hope to do. This pain you are feeling is a triumph, Heloise.I will say that I’m not personally into the typical oppressive-world concept and don’t tend to adore grimdark fantasy. Constant brutality isn’t my thing and I sometimes think it goes down the path of torture porn. But I felt good about this novella - it walks the line very well between happiness and torture, grief and hope. But this one is kind of brutal with a bunch of death, so just be aware of that going in.→plot and story structure←This novella is structured so well. It’s difficult to give a novella such a clear arc of development and such excellent pacing, not too fast and not too slow, but I think Myke Cole achieved that. Unfortunately, one hangup: I felt sometimes that the plot was a bit unconnected. Specifically, the author tries to use a magic structure as a plot twist, and it felt a bit clumsy to me. From other s, I’m getting that the author does this because he’s trying to consciously subvert several genre constraints of adult sff, which is a fantastic idea, but I haven’t read enough adult sff as of yet to really recognize those points. [I mean, I enjoyed it anyway, so…?] Overall, though, I was a huge fan of the plot anyway. This book never really went where I was expecting, but still felt like a fairly logical progression. Events felt both out of nowhere and sensical. I never stopped feeling engaging in the narrative and didn’t really want it to end [okay. my slump wanted it to end.]→character development←The character development here is so great and it makes this novella such a shining gem. Heloise is an impulsive teenager who also doesn’t feel annoying - she’s a flawed character who makes bad decisions and that’s okay. Her arc focuses mostly on her realization of the oppression she’s facing and also - this was the part I liked most - her discovery of her sexuality and her feelings for her best friend, Basina. These two arcs are integrated in a way that makes them feel like they’re each a part of the same story, which is exactly what I want out of character development like this. I’m really excited to see more of her saga!Yeah. Anyway. Those are my thoughts on the core aspects of The Armored Saint and why I found it, on the whole, entertaining.Something I noticed critique of in this book is - spoilers, but this might be worth knowing for lgbtq ers - (view spoiler)[the #buryyourgays trope (hide spoiler)]. I have… thoughts. First of all, yeah, it’s an accurate criticism. (view spoiler)[There’s a sapphic lead, one queer mentor, and one possible love interest, and then two of those characters die. Wish that were changed (hide spoiler)]. BUT I will say that it didn’t bother me personally for a couple reasons. (view spoiler)[It feels less like baiting and switching and more like those first books where the childhood love and the father figure both get fridged so the protagonist has to rely on themselves. [Which I literally think I’ve only seen happen to male characters until today?] Maybe it also helped that I was as warned - like you’re being right now, hmm? (hide spoiler)] So yeah, that’s a warning I’d add to the book, but it didn’t feel exploity to me personally [a Huge Sapphic]. Again, totally fine if you hated or loved it! That’s just how I felt.update 11/5: unfortunately, book two of this series did not work as well for me - you can find my  here.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Apr 08, 2018","Apr 09, 2018","Sep 25, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35018914-the-armored-saint

Kerry Washington as Mia is a really good choice. also, for personal reasons, Pearl is my favorite character now. “Most of the time, everyone deserves more than one chance. We all do things we regret now and then. You just have to carry them with you.”Never in my life have I read any book, any narrative, that cared as deeply for all of its characters as this one did. Little Fires Everywhere lives in the grey area, leaving it impossible not to be invested, impossible not to love every character and cry for every character and root for every character, despite all their flaws. I really struggle to characterize this book; it’s sort of a combination between a mystery and literary fiction, and will probably work best for you if you’re a fan of both? Little Fires Everywhere is a very slow-burn story about a small town thrown into disarray by a court dispute. When an Asian baby given up by her mother is adopted by a white family, it causes a spiral of events that lead to a scene of a house on fire and a family driven away.I think I’ve already expressed this, but this book is.... a masterpiece. It’s one of those books that I finished and then was just on my bed tearing up because it’s so well-crafted. The reason this book is so fantastic is primarily structural; we see the end, and then we go back and see the beginning. But anyway, the reason this book works so well is the characterization. There is so much to appreciate here. I like that Moody is sort of written as the stereotypical jilted nice guy, and and then we see more nuance to that characterization. I loved the complexity of the dynamic between poor characters and rich characters; I loved how no character is black and white, but they have definition nonetheless. Of the approximately-eleven-person main cast, Izzy is my absolute favorite. Izzy is a ridiculously relatable character for me personally mainly through her relationship with her mom. There’s a line somewhere where Izzy says she thinks her mother sees her as such a demon that all her actions are framed in that light - that was me. And that is still me in my relationship with one of my parents. The degree to which the narrative of this book validates her trauma and her feelings is incredible.And on another very personal note, Mia… kind of reminds me of another. Some of you who follow me on this platform might now that my mom and I are really, really close, and I grew up with her as my main support system. And I think… her relationship with Izzy just felt so personal to me for that reason. So maybe this was too personal a read for me, but I’m going to be honest: it’s my belief that reading is something that is meant to be personal. And maybe the degree to which this personally affected me is the most important part of all.There’s a scene within this book that has stuck with me since the beginning, in which the adoptive mother of the baby is asked how she plans to incorporate Chinese culture into the life of the baby, and she brings up “oriental rugs” and how she gives the baby rice. And it’s this awful moment, because we know she loves that baby. We do. But in that moment she becomes the persecutor of her own child. She does not understand, and so she perpetrates a culture that has been trying to swallow up her child. I think that’s what this book is about, in the end: the degrees to which we can hurt people without ever attempting to. This book was masterful. And I hope you all read it.

I don't care if it's given critical acclaim - fuck off, Kenneth Branagh - Hamlet is supposed to be compelling, and if you didn't find the character compelling, that actor didn't do their job. You need a Hamlet who knows the character, not a Hamlet who wants to do grace to the character or some shit. Here's the thing: I used to hate this play. Not lowkey hate, I fucking despised it. I thought it was boring and overrated and most of all, I thought Hamlet was a dick and a boring character. And then everything changed when the fire nation attacked when I saw Santa Cruz Shakespeare's 2016 production of Hamlet, starring actress Kate Eastwood Norris as Hamlet. [image](CHECK OUT HER AND OPHELIA ON THE RIGHT!! THE BLACK COAT AND PURPLE DRESS!! IF ANY OF Y'ALL HAVE A DUBIOUSLY LEGAL RECORDING OF THIS SHIT PLEASE LINK ME)I loved it. Not only did I love it; I loved it so much that my entire interpretation of the character changed. I keep using she/her pronouns to describe Hamlet because that actress has literally replaced the character in my head. And that is what Hamlet should be about. That is how you should feel after you watch a truly great production. You should feel like you've been inwardly changed as a person. You should also probably have cried at least once. // HI GUYS. HERE ARE MY CHARACTER PERFORMANCE OPINIONS. HAVE FUN➽ In general, every character's pain should matter. Every character needs to matter, every character needs to make you feel. ➽ Hamlet shouldn't be an asshole. Hamlet is a very complex character, and yeah, he does a lot of screwing around with people. But his interactions with Horatio, all his interactions excluding Claudius in 1.2, his love letter to Ophelia, and other's descriptions of his newfound madness as being out of character paint a very different picture. It is not compelling to watch an asshole be an asshole for four hours. You know what's far more compelling? A kind young man struggling with grief and anger, informed suddenly that he must become cruel and unkind.Let's put emphasis on the “young” part. If you accept the first folio as real, the only line referring to his age establishes him as 20 at most. It is the second folio where the same line is changed to referring to a 23-year period since Yoric's death, rather than a 12-year period. As a result, the idea that he's thirty probably comes from dialogue changes as the Hamlet actor aged. I know no one read this, but Hamlet should be a teenager.➽ A lot of people think of Ophelia's character as this very innocent virgin and I'm going to utterly disagree. Ophelia's character is about agency. Her character is doubted by all the other characters, yet keeps to her guns and continuously sticks up for herself. So many adaptations of this show will take away her agency and give it to the other characters, making her final mad scene seem silly and out of place. Do not let the narrative take her agency away. Emphasize her inner turmoil! Build up her ending madness!On a related note: if scene 3.1 between Hamlet and Ophelia didn't make you cry, I'm vetoing it. You are supposed to care about these two characters, both separately and together. You are supposed to feel both of their pains. You are not, not, not supposed to only care for Hamlet because of his blinding angst over his girlfriend. Give this moment to Ophelia. Give her the agency she deserves.➽ Give the villains characterization too. It is so, so important to get Gertrude right. One of the best scenes in this entire show, to me, is the closet scene between Gertrude and Hamlet. But you have to make Gertrude's character interesting. Her pain has to matter as much as anyone else's. In general, y'all suck at portraying Claudius. He's obviously a bit of a smart villain in contrast to his heroic older brother, but that's not the extent of his characterization. Claudius is, in actuality, somewhat of a clever political player. You shouldn't love him, but if you hate him, this will not be as interesting a play. VERDICT: I fucking love this show. Please watch it before you read it because it's not as good unless you've seen a really good production. Save yourself and skip Branagh - Tennant's a little better, actually.

For now, I will leave this as a four star, but I don't stand by this opinion, frankly. As a bonus Carmen Marie Machado story worth a read: The Lost Performance of the High Priestess of the Temple of Horror‘I only know how to scream,’ she said. Marcel placed his hand on her thigh. ‘And that’s all anyone wants from me.’******“I choose this life,” the prostitute says to the social worker. “I do. Please put your energy into helping girls who aren’t here by choice.” She is so right. She is murdered anyway.Strange, visceral.First of all, I absolutely adore Machado's writing. It's not a controversial take to call her one of the most talented writers in the game right now, and deserving of all the awards. Her writing has a visceral, imagistic quality - it breaks through your skin, struggles to come out of your mouth. I also really appreciated how unapologetically queer this collection is, and would definitely recommend it in my stack of great queer fiction. But these stories... well, you’re not going to enjoy them unless you get them, at least partially. I feel like someone on twitter is going to declare everyone who didn’t get this a typical straight feminist or whatever, so to clarify: the women kissing are not the confusing part of this collection. Either because of my too-high expectations via The Husband Stitch, a story I'd read earlier, or because I was just plain young - I was sixteen when I read this collection - I didn't find myself quite understanding the metaphorical point of every story. Generally, the theme is clear; the conclusion is not. I would recommend this to those who loved the metaphorical stories in Roxane Gay’s Difficult Women. (I was tragically not one of those people.) ♔ The Husband Stitch - ★★★★★I read this twice earlier due to Melanie's awesome recommendation. This is a story about being consumed, losing your own agency, and how much you can give before you break. One thing is clear, though; it's worth the read. There were a few metaphors here I only understood on the second and third reads due to sheer exhaustion, which is really upsetting - I feel like this would be my fave story ever otherwise. You can read this story here. ♚ Inventory - ★★★★☆A story of a woman’s sex life as a plague destroys her world. Honestly, I don't even know what this was. Okay, I do; it’s an exploration of how sex alone can reflect an environment. There's this sort of raw quality to it, but I can't say it ever really got under my skin, and the character work could’ve been far stronger. ♔ Mothers - ★★★★☆No summary. Uhhh... somebody please explain what the hell this story's ending means? Because I honest to god do not understand. I think I kind of loved it, though. Maybe worth a reread. ♚ Especially Heinous - ★★★☆☆This is a slightly-too-long rundown of a series of Law and Order: SVU episodes. Using the real titles, Machado makes up an intriguing plot full of supernatural elements and twists. The ending of this worked perfectly for me, but the story itself was too long; twelve seasons is a lot of episodes and apparently, a lot of repetition. I got the point about dead prostitutes 30 pages in and at points it just kept going. Have to admit, though, that several of the episode descriptions will stay with me.♔ Real Women Have Bodies - ★★★★☆This story is one of women who become translucent over time. I really appreciated it; the detail is visceral and the emotion raw. It is far more metaphorical than I tend to prefer, though. ♚ Eight Bites - ★★★★☆An exploration of disordered eating and fatphobia in society especially among women! and yet I also just didn’t fucking understand 75% of this, so?♔ The Resident - ★★★☆☆This one is about confronting your past and all it comes with.

A story about police brutality, focused around a boy whose brother is shot by a police officer. And, as I think most of you may have guessed, the shooting occurred unprovoked. The fact that this is reality for so many black teens in America is absolutely horrifying.I feel as if it's hard to  good issue books. Because Tyler Johnson Was Here is undoubtedly important, but with fantastic books about the same topic like Dear Martin and The Hate U Give, I know that many people will skip it. But here's the thing: you shouldn't. With excellent characters and a fantastic emotional heart, this book deserves so much more than being written off as generic or not worth the read. The main strength of Tyler Johnson Was Here is how personal it feels. With a well-written sense of grief and of empowerment shadowing the book, Coles' writing feels authentic and from-the-heart. Despite not much specific development, each character feels just as true to heart. And to be quite honest, the casual diversity is really special. If someone told sixth-grade-me that this many books I picked up would have casually sapphic side characters and all-black casts, I would definitely not have believed them.

Someone had to wield the knives, but someone also had to write the treaties.Sanao Akeha is one of the two youngest twin children of the Protector, ruler of an oppressive government. Black Tides of Heaven follows a thirty-year period in their life as they come of age and begin to assert their own identity. I have so many good things to say about this. The magic system of Tensorate is wonderful, resonating with me on a near-instinctual level. Additionally, the relationship between the twins, Akeha and Mokoya, is incredibly crafted. People in this world also select their own genders, something the book explores in a fascinating way—one sibling selects to be a man and one selects to be a woman, and the selection of this is is so interesting. I really enjoyed this elemental integration of worldbuilding. I should disclaim that I accidentally read the second chronological novella in this series first, and I think its effect on my consumption of this novel was that I just wished I were rereading The Red Threads of Fortune. The thirty-year expanse of this novella made me feel as if I wanted more from various relationships - in particular the twins’ relationship with their mother, the Protector, and their sister, Sonami. Even Akeha’s relationships with his rebel lover Yongcheow, and the twin’s relationships with the Head Abbott, felt as if they could have been shown more. I wished for this novella to really focus on a shorter period, so we could get a full glimpse of the characters.

First of all, Kiko’s struggle with self hatred feels super personal and authentic and relatable. I loved the ""what I wanted to say"" and ""what I actually said"" dichotomies [and how they translate at the ending? you know it's coming, but it still hits home]. I loved the art mentions at the end of every chapter; they give the audience a connection to Kiko's art that would not have existed before. I loved the sensuous, gorgeous writing. I adored the relationship between Kiko and an art mentor she finds. I loved the emphasis on Kiko learning to accept her worth while being biracial [Japanese and white]. I liked her relationship with one of her brothers. I really love and connect to Kiko in general and I think - I know - many, many readers will as well. Starfish is nowhere near being a vapid or bland read - you will get something out of this pretty much no matter what. There are many, many, many fantastic #ownvoices s on this page by readers who saw themselves in the text, including my good friends May and Ju. Unfortunately that was not in any way my experience. So... the thing about this book is that it was always going to be way more personal a reading experience for me than it ever was trying to be. Parental abuse is a topic that hits home for me. It is not a topic I can in any way look at objectively. And when a book like Starfish comes along, and I've seen so many amazing things, and I'm expecting it to be That Book and work perfectly for me, and then it gets so many things right, and then it hits just a little bit off in all the places I'm hypersensitive about, it gets bad for me really quickly. Nothing in this  is in any way a value judgement on Akemi Dawn Bowman's experience with parental abuse; it is a judgement on the way the text read to me personally and how it made me feel. →healing love and abuse←I feel, very strongly, that Kiko's main arc in this book occurs due to a romance, and it fails narratively by weakening her character arc and falling uncomfortably close to the love-curing trope. While it’s framed somewhat well within the narrative of the book, the fact that Kiko is essentially saved from her mother’s house by a romantic relationship – seriously, the entire plot is incited by romance – set off so many alarm bells with me that I just could not get past it. This is a narrative we see all the time. This kind of romance is always. here. And unfortunately, not everyone gets a shiny perfect boy to save them from their abusive parent. So... this is a really alienating narrative, and that doesn't necessarily make it bad in its use here, but. I felt it.""They don’t expect me to be—"" I let out a breath.""A human being?” Jamie blinks at me.I feel my entire body getting hot. I feel like I’m being interrogated. I feel offended.I also feel that as the love interest and a character who's kind of framed as the best person in Kiko's life, Jamie's ignorance is often not really criticized by the narrative? Lines like this made me uncomfortable due to their framing of normalcy as something apart from Kiko's anxiety, and that's something the book never really figures out how to subvert. I think the intent was to eventually have Kiko realize the degree to which her anxiety affects her life, but in context stuff like this reads a bit victim-blame-y, and it hurt. →that one really awful victim blaming sentence←It's been six months, and I keep thinking about this book, and thinking I don't know why I reacted so badly to it, and then I think about this fucking sentence about Kiko’s sexual assault:“Upsetting dad wouldn’t help anything. Giving him something extra to worry about when he has two little babies isn’t an option. I won’t make him unhappy just for the sake of needing someone on my side. I won’t be like mom.”I won't be like mom. I won't be like mom.Okay, listen, this wouldn’t bother me as a part of Kiko’s arc that she questions later on. Wanting to avoid being a burden is a huge part of abuse. That’s fine. But this quote is itself occurs at a key part of the story around 30 pages from the end, and the framing felt as if the author almost agrees. And… holy shit, guys, this is the worst thing I have ever read. Her dad can fucking handle being unhappy to deal with his only daughter’s sexual assault. It is not Kiko's responsibility to make a grown ass man feel better about something that is happening TO HER. Her fucking molester is living in her fucking house and we want to talk about how reporting this shit to her dad makes her like her mom? guys, I know this is just one line and maybe it is meant to be looked at as a factor of Kiko's unreliable narration - although being able to tell might be nice for, ya know, kids who actually think this way!! - but. this. implies. reporting. literal. molestation. to. her. father. would. be. narcissistic. That is not good.→show-not-tell & abuser portrayal←So… okay. I like - well, I don't like, obviously, but appreciate - that this is a story about a completely unsympathetic abusive parent. I also appreciate that the book explores how Kiko's mom is kind of motivated by racism, and is very stark and unflinching in portraying her. But I think in her efforts to make Kiko‘s mom unsympathetic, Kiko’s mom comes off so blatantly evil that Kiko’s reaction to her feels inauthentic. Kiko’s mom is so consistently and obviously terrible that Kiko is given no reason to even remotely believe in her. Every single thing that comes out of her mouth is utter trash, and we're kind of told-and-not-shown that sometimes she can be nice. Which doesn't feel fully authentic. One of the worst things about abuse is the hot-and-cold aspect - the mood swings, the moments of sweetness that make you think staying is a good idea and you won’t be hurt again. And while we got the sense from Kiko’s narration that her mother’s changing mood is a part of her reality, the hot-and-cold is kind of absent on page - her good moods feel so ridiculously fake on page I’m shocked her nose didn’t grow. I don’t know, I almost felt as if the sympathetic moments were removed because there would have been those Four Awful Reviewers who decided a lesser situation would’ve not been abusive. Which I understand. I mean, god, guys, I got ten pages into this book and wanted her to die a painful death. Along with every abuser in the world. Kidding. But I guess as a statement about abuse lit in general, I would love to see more sympathetic moments and how that makes the lead feel, because right now, it's as if YA thinks making an abusive character anything but consistently terrible will invalidate the abusive things they do.→abuser portrayal and mental illness←...split-personality, narcissistic, psychopathic mom.Kiko's mom is a terrible person. She is self-absorbed and she is evil and she is so, so awful. And I don't even think untreated narcissistic personality disorder is necessarily a total bullshit theory. But the fact that most insults to her in this book revolve around her alleged mental illness bothers me. And even worse, there is absolutely nothing in this book to imply she suffers from BPD, yet allegations of split personality are tossed around a lot. And though Kiko’s anxiety rep made me feel slightly better, it felt gross that mental illness is associated with such a demonic character. Thankfully, in future editions of the book, this is being changed.→shock value←Okay, here's the big one, and the thing that kind of ruined the book for me. Kiko's mom started to feel like she was being used for shock value. And not in a “this is lazy” way. “I cannot imagine how I would have gotten through this book last year” type of way. In a “how is anyone who needs this book going to read this book” kind of way. and it kind of made me feel like throwing up. which is absolutely a personal problem. it absolutely, absolutely is. ""this was too fucking hard for me to read and I couldn't read it"" is not a quality judgement and it's not going to be everyone's experience and that's totally fine and totally valid. but I also kind of feel like if a book is written for abuse survivors and they can’t handle reading it, it’s not working.As the author has made clear via twitter, this book was not written for me, as a white abuse survivor. Which is... okay. This is a genuinely unpopular opinion and I am so glad it is. I am so glad I am the minority opinion and so many other people saw themselves in this. This is a book that reflects some of my experiences and didn't work well for some of my other experiences. There were deeply personal experiences going into my feelings about this book and how awful it made me feel, just as there were in Bowman's writing of this book. And this is how I felt about it and why.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,166,1,"Dec 18, 2017","Dec 18, 2017","Sep 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29456598-starfish

Somewhat entertaining, a few great ideas that go underdeveloped, not much dramatic tension. Or like, any. It's, uh, basically a contemporary where people die and every fifteen percent it gets really messed up. GOOD THINGS♔ Perkins has stepped up her game on avoiding tropes, surprisingly? Makani is definitely not the stereotypical virginal blonde protagonist - she's biracial, for one, she sort of hates herself and isn't afraid to take action, and she's also not a virgin. There's also a balanced tone towards sex and it doesn't become either a huge thing or a non-entity. Surprisingly rare balance, damn it. ♚ Makani's character arc around no longer hating herself is kind of a brilliant idea. Execution was mixed, but man, good concept and perfect for the tone of the book. I wish her character arc had gotten more pagetime. ♔ This seems to be an unpopular opinion, but the kill scenes were viscerally terrifying in a really good way. A couple didn't end in a very terrifying way, but they usually succeeded at giving me a good scare. ♚ The love interest, Ollie, is definitely sufficiently cute. And the romance between him and Makani was super cute. I love 3rd person pov romances. ♔ I liked that it was more diverse than some of Perkins' other books. Having a side trans character who doesn't have some tragic story about being trans was lovely - I am so sick of the Sad Tragic Gays. And I've already mentioned that Makani is biracial. I can't speak for the quality of the rep, but none of it fit tropes I know of or was blatantly offensive. If you want more info, feel free to check out some more info down below. ♚ A lot of the ers here are saying the killer's motive sucked, and okay, it wasn't shocking or fantastic, but it fit with the theme of the book. In other words, if the rest of the book had been fantastic, it would've been fine. BAD THINGS♔ You know what makes thrillers unsettling? A really terrifying killer reveal. You know what this did not have? A really terrifying killer reveal. ♚ It really lacks suspense. The first half being more romancey could actually work in the book's favor, with a fabulous buildup where you come to care for every character with the knowledge that things are about to get crazy in the back of your mind. But the second half? No, you can't focus on romance anymore.♔ Makani's character arc feels messy. Okay, there are two directions you could've gone with here. Direction one could've been making it something really terrible and having Makani as an antihero, the far creepier and more entertaining option. Unfortunately, Makani's secret is really not that bad. This could still work with Perkins' route; direction two would be focusing on her hatred for herself and writing a good character arc. But that's not the focus either. It just ends up as quite a drab and uninteresting arc. ♚ The writing. Okay, you cannot write like this: “Memories aren’t reliable, anyway.” Makani wished that she could forget. In the darkest hours of the night, her own memory was keen and cruel.This is just... so overdramatic?? And it was isolated, but it came across. ♔ Tone problem. Huuuuuuuuuge tone problem. This reads like a contemporary but then people are also DYING. And it feels as if it could work but it really does not. ♚ Sometimes the darkness of the material feels very brushed aside. Make it darker, make it creepier, make life more unfair. If I were to sum up this book's problems, I'd call it a decent book that could've been a lot better if it weren't trying to play it safe like this.TW: gore. a trans character is deadnamed in several early editions; this was edited out.

The Child Finder is a detective novel following Naomi Cottle, a girl who finds missing children. Why? Well, she was one herself. As she investigates the three-year-old disappearance of Madison Culver, she is forced to come to terms with her own story, and her own desire to be known. This book was incredibly well-written. Denfeld quickly engages you in her story, and specifically engages you in her character: Naomi Cottle is likable, smart, and takes action. I thought the snow child chapters, though gorgeous, ended up bogging down the main story in places. The book is in essence fast-paced, and frankly doesn’t have quite enough character development going on to sustain a literary fiction novel. That’s fine; it works wonderfully as a detective introduction. But it wants to be both, literary story and detective novel, and sacrifices pace to do so. Essentially my most major negative about this was that the main romance plot occurs between our lead and her foster sibling. Yes, Naomi is traumatized. Yes, this was an easy way for the author to find a character that she trusted. But. They’re also still siblings. They were raised as siblings from a really young age. This really isn’t appropriate, and left a really bad taste in my mouth. But in all that, when I hit the end of this detective novel about an ex-captive girl trying to find other captive girls, and then turned the last page to find the author thanking her foster kids in the acknowledgements.... maybe I teared up a little bit. So, I had complex views on this, but I guess the ending was positive. TW: child rape and sexual assault, child kidnapping.

Far From the Tree is an exploration of family, the one you find and the one you're born into. Great concept, right? But I definitely did not guess just how good this would be. A story like this is one that can only succeed based off stellar character work, and my expectations for character work in contemporary is often quite low. But this was so lovely.This book revolves around three siblings, each with their own conflicts. 🌹Grace has recently given birth and put a girl up for adoption. Ostracized at school and by her ex-boyfriend, she’s trying to fit in. 🍁 Maya is living with divorcing parents and a dysfunctional home situation. And also her first girlfriend. 🍃Joaquin is a foster child trying to decide whether to trust his maybe adoptees. And guess what: I loved all three of them. I don’t want to give away much about this book, because it’s one best experienced. But if I were to sum this book up, it feels so personal. With such fantastic characters, the friendship and family element totally stands out. The older she got, the more human her parents seemed, and that was one of the scariest things in the world. She missed being little, when they were the all-knowing gods of her world, but at the same time, seeing them as human made it easier to see herself that way, too.Oh, and I love the representations of being adopted. It's amazing. And I adore the way Maya is represented as a gay girl.It turns out she wasn't the only gay kid at school, and she was never harassed or teased - but she found she didn't know how to be affectionate with friends. Would they think sh was hitting on them if she just hugged them hello? Would she make it weird just by being herself? It hadn't mattered with Lauren, but at her new school, Maya found herself holding back, using sarcasm as affectionate until it became habit, until it became who she was.This book feels so personal, and so emotional, but also so hopeful. It’s the perfect tone for this kind of story. Would highly, highly recommend.

Brilliant ending, but downright bad middle.[image][image]// NEGATIVESThe problem with this volume of Saga is that issues 20-22 are mediocre at best. First of all, there's the fact that I just really didn't fucking care about King Robot IV or whatever. I'm sure he's going to be relevant later. Does it make me care? Not particularly. Showing that a guy loves his kid is cool, sure, but not enough for me to really care about him. Issue 19, the opening issue, is a fine entry to Marco and Alana's thread, but it all goes downhill from there; their family drama is incredibly manufactured. Marco's chapters from then on focus on a needless cheating storyline that had me cringing at every line. Ginny's character in particular felt completely wasted. What I've loved about this story so far is the lack of one-off characters; even villains get fleshed out. Marco's ex-girlfriend, Gwen, has gotten a ton of pagetime and become one of my favorite characters. But Ginny feels like she's there to cheat. Her character has no depth whatsoever. The drug storyline, too, didn't feel well-handled. It was hardly built up by the narrative or by Alana's dialogue. If Alana's trauma and ptsd had been built up more in earlier volumes of Saga, this could've been executed seamlessly. But here, I found myself not believing in it. All the family troubles felt like needless puzzle pieces because they were not built up. This just felt like a bunch of moving plot pieces and filler pages trying to assemble their way into a bridge in the story. I'm not fooled. Try harder, please.// POSITIVESThe final couple volumes, thank goodness, brought back what I've loved about Saga. Marco, Alana, and Hazel have an awesome climax, of course. But mostly, I just really fucking loved Gwen, Sophie, and Lying Cat's scene. With some of my previous faves annoying me, it was awesome to see Sophie and Gwen doing so well. AND OH MAN WAS THAT ONE LYING CAT PANEL NOT BADASS. OH MY GOD. I have to say, I'm also really loving the representation here. The characters are super diverse in terms of race, with plenty of dark-skinned characters (not including those with purple skin, lol). I also love the amount of lgbtq+ characters in here!! There are the two reporters, Izabel has a canon ex-girlfriend, and Gwen is canonically bi. It's all-around great.I'm mostly just excited for the potential of the next volume. Now that we've gotten past this filler section, we'll be back on track for some real content. Hopefully more Gwen, Sophie, and Lying Cat.

[image](THIS WAS MY FAVORITE PANEL IN THE ENTIRE ISSUE)This series is only going uphill since volume one. More worldbuilding is added every volume. More characters are added every volume, yet somehow I'm not having much trouble keeping any of them straight.  It's just all improving. There are four things really succeeding here. First of all, the characters. I love them all. There's also so much banter that works because it fits the characters so well. You see a panel and can immediately identify who's speaking. Okay, example - I'm not adding the panel, but take a wild guess who's speaking here:This doesn’t change my wedding vows. I’m still never doing the dishes. I like doing dishes!You are so fucking sexy.SEE??Second of all, the relationships. I am adoring the use of the found family trope. Marco, Alana, Hazel, and Klara, and there's Gwendolyn, The Will, Lying Cat, and Sophie. While I do think this volume could do with slightly less romance, most of the romantic storylines have been quite entertaining. Thirdly, the art, which somehow seems more stunning each time; I definitely prefer the realistic style of volumes two and three to the somewhat surrealist style of volume one.Last but definitely not least, the thematic work. This part is just getting better each volume. I love the way this volume talks about prejudice, both incorporating fantasy prejudice dynamics and A lot of characters are dying, which is of course saddening. But it seems fitting and realistic. Saga is a war story, after all. But it's also so much more than just a war story. This is a story about peace, about love, as well as a story about violence. There's a touch of hope to every volume that I adore.""Imagine armed men coming to seize your family’s home. You can’t see the honor, the beauty in defending your own land?""""It’s just land. Dirt is dirt.""""If you think that, you’ve never toiled in the exact same feilds as thousands of your ancestors.""""Klara, if assholes with guns are headed my way, I don’t care if everyone I love is buried in that dirt, I’m still running like a madman.""""And when they keep on you like hounds?

The author in question, Hafsah Faizal, has recently come forward to say it was her. This is upsetting and several other tweets seem to imply this was on some level common behavior widely known within the community, which is deeply concerning. I had actually already taken sequels to this book off my TBR over a few mostly unrelated incidents—first the book aging poorly upon further reflection, then some subtweets of ers I thought went just a bit over the line, then some tweets about incest shipping after the Game of Thrones finale, and then several tweets about John Boyega—and though I recognize the first two are fairly minor, I want to also point out, as Chupeco did, the racism inherent in harassing a black man over his lack of silence about racism he experienced as a member of a franchise cast. Also today, an anonymous account tweeted about issues with antisemitism within the book. Just to be so honest, I cannot remember most of this book and would prefer to share non-anonymous commentary in light of that, and if anyone can find the link to this  I would really like to link that instead of the Twitter commentary. In terms of my updated thoughts on the book, I second several points made in this .__We are all monsters, Nadya. Some of us just hide it better than others. It’s really been a while since I’ve fallen head-over-heels for a fantasy series in this obsessive, letting-it-take-over-my-time-for-a-week way, and Wicked Saints did that for me. I had a few problems, yes, but overall, I was engrossed in this novel and in this world. → worldly worldbuilding ←Okay, so, this is Russian-inspired fantasy, with blood mages, and also clerics. The Kalyazi can contact gods, sometimes, and these people consider Tranavian blood magic to be unholy. This has caused a war. The characters in this book are on both sides of that war; indeed, our two POVs are essentially the strongest Tranavian character and the strongest Kalyazi character. Something I loved about this was the way in which divinity becomes both a question and a force within the book: characters are motivated by religion, but the story does not become one entirely about a fight for religion. I think what got to me about this world is just how expansive it feels. Wicked Saints does an excellent job juggling many moving parts in the wheel of both characters and world. It feels expansive in the way good urban fantasy feels expansive: You’re juggling a great deal of side characters without points of view but you’re intrigued to see more about almost every one.→ plot and structure and all that ←The plot doesn’t twist and turns too much in the first half, and is indeed a bit oddly structured; to use my most recent film language obsession, the first act is a bit long, meaning the narrative as a whole feels as if it’s taking a while to actually get going. It was the rest of the novel that had me completely hooked. The final conflict had me absolutely screaming. → characterization blah blah blah ←sign me the FUCK up ...more",Notes are private!,0,265,1,"Mar 05, 2019","Mar 27, 2019","Aug 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36118682-wicked-saints

There is the big ending twist, where a book of buildup leads up to one whodunit revelation. There is the obvious-twist-but-ability-to-guess-it-doesn't-really-matter-because-that's-not-the-point. And then there is the ""so many twists, you cannot possibly guess all of them, or even half.""That's the category occupied by The Hanging Girl. And how. I am not exaggerating when I say the entire book flips on its head around three times. If you guess even a fifth of the plot twists, you've done the impossible. And with so many twists, it is really difficult to guess the final outcome. I doubt you will, and even if you do, I highly doubt you will guess the how and why. I've seen plenty of ers mention a few moments they found weak, and I have to say I'm not sure I noticed. Maybe I'm just less analytical than some. But I think the real reason behind my lack of notice comes from just how wrapped up I was in this story. Here's the thing: you are meant to enjoy this book, not analyze it. You are meant to find a kind of dark pleasure in the morally-shitty characters while also finding yourself lost in the dark atmosphere of the book. I don't think this is a book you're necessarily meant to question or think is the greatest thing ever holy shit; it's a thriller you're meant to race through and hang on every word. And you know what? I loved it.I don't agree that this is a weak or thin thriller, though - far from it. The narrative around poverty and what it can drive people to do is well-handled without being heavy-handed. I also loved how the book made a clear connection between being marginalized and being less-than-elite; the fact that many people in non-privileged positions are queer and nonwhite is something I see erased a lot in fiction emphasizing class, and it was good that the book made a clear connection with privilege. There's also a heavy focus on our lead character, Skye, who I absolutely adored. While I can't say I'd actually like her in real life, as a fictional character, she's written brilliantly. Her actions feel so highly motivated that I never found it hard to empathize with her. Even her decisions towards the ending felt real to me. I honestly have very few complaints about this book; while I think the meta-narrative of the book is not pro-slutshaming, there are several moments of slutshaming that do go somewhat unchecked. There were also a few characters I thought had more potential: Drew and Paige are both incredibly intriguing characters and deserved much more development than they actually got. All that being said, though, this was a super interesting and entertaining read. I shot through it in only a few hours and I expect many will do the same.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,"Oct 20, 2017","Oct 21, 2017","Aug 24, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33392114-the-hanging-girl

Any of you who know Agatha Christie willThere's got to be an award for starting out with me suspecting everyone and ending with me suspecting no one. Any of you who know Agatha Christie will know the approximate concept of this novel; a detective investigates a suspicious murder on a stopped train. Yet this one is quite good; between the a fast-paced plot, dynamic cast of characters, and humorous moments, it's a great read. Yet what truly stands out here is the reveals. Shocking me with a revelation despite it being a literal detective novel is brilliant. I suspected every character from the beginning, yet I still ended #shook at all the little reveals. The details of the story are so odd, and the ending solution so satisfying, that I almost want to give the book a reread. Perhaps my one complaint would be the character confusion; it was sometimes hard to keep track of all twelve suspects. This is where I'd like to give a huge thank you to Dan Stevens' audio narration. His voice alone could kill me in an alleyway and I'd be grateful. If you're going to read this, please try the audiobook.// SOMEWHAT SPOILERY PLOT SECTION //This is a novel of twelve main suspects. Yes, you heard that right; twelve. There's Mary Debenham, an English girl and former governess, described as cold and gray-eyed. The English Colonel, aloof and mysterious and possibly connected to her. The Italian, suspected by Bouc because of racism. Monsieur Hartman, a mysterious detective. The young English McQueen, sharing his room with Poirot. His older companion Ratchet, full of malevolence. Princess Dragomiroff, the ugly and oddly-named Russian woman. The Hungarian prince and princess, a handsome thirty year old traveling with a twenty-year-old foreign woman with pale skin. Mrs. Hubbard, an older American woman and a fantastic busybody. A sheep-faced Swedish woman. Monsieur Harris, presumably late. And of course, Monsieur Bouc, an old friend of Poirot's, and our detective himself. At 23 minutes to one, Poirot hears Ratchet moving around. A ting occurs at quarter past one, leading to a Mrs. Hubbard and conductor confrontation. Something heavy hits the door later, and a woman is walking down the hall near the conductor. In the morning, he finds Doctor Constatine, the big man, the vagonli conductor, and Bouc inside a cabin right beforeThe facts of Ratchet's death: Death occurred at about 1 am, or at least before 2. Ratchet was known to have been alive at about twenty to one from speaking to the conductor. The window was open, probably as a diversion. The door was locked and chained on the inside. He was stabbed in twelve places. Cheftor thinks it was a woman, but the Doctor thinks it was very strong and also a very unscientific crime. Who is right? Who is wrong? Why are they each so certain?VERDICT: A fast-faced plot ending in a truly satisfying ending. This should be a quick and fun read for anyone who enjoys mysteries or suspense.

[image]I read this... after I watched the Hulu miniseries. (Don't hit me.) But it was one of the best tv shows I've ever seen, leaving me sobbing for thirty minutes straight and completely, utterly shook. So I read the book version as quickly as possible, and what can I say? I really liked it. While I think the miniseries is at times a bit darker in vibe than the book, they're both just so, so excellent. This book does something rather brilliant: it begins in a everything-suburban-is-stable-facade, and then it destroys that facade, bit by careful bit. As the stories of Big Little Lies unfold, the layers of the characters are unraveled. Everyone has tragedies. Everyone has secrets. This is a very deep book hiding under a veneer of chick-lit and middle class drama. But I also liked that this story takes everything seriously. Conflicts about marriage. Conflicts about kids. Petty conflicts about kindergarten, even. These affect people’s lives, even the lives of the stereotypical “mothers”. And so many innocent words can just be impossible to hear. I also thought the book built suspense quite well; the reminders of how much time remained until the trivia night were helpful, but the little statements from other parents on their opinions? Offer hints and suspense while also offering hilarity. A lot of the characters in this novel are somewhat despicable, and honestly, a little bit hateable. But they're still compelling because all of Morality's characters are highly motivated. Even when you may dislike a character, you must admit that their motives are sensical, and often even relatable. I also appreciated the grim reality with which it treated parental lives; the disdain that mothers face is utterly humanized. Tonally, this is one of the oddest books I've ever read. It goes from a grimly realistic painting of abuse to a humorous drama and then back again. But it always stays true to the characters, and that is where its power truly lies.

I think this book was more focused on the fact that every single person is the hero of their own story. In the first half, I was thinking this book really could have done more with the discussion of slavery - like, come on - but the second half DOES that shit far better than I was expecting. → writing ←I think the thing that saves the writing of this book for me is that it feels like it’s laughing at itself. I can feel the dilapidated, possibly soulless ghost of Jay Kristoff laughing at himself as he types these ridiculous words, and I sort of love it. Every weird sentence is a reminder that this story has a narrator, a sarcastic and slightly pretentious narrator whose identity we still do not know. → plot and twists ←This one started sort of slow but it ended brilliantly. This series has a lot of battle scenes - trust me, I get it if you need to skip sections due to gore etc, I get it. The plot reveals are the best - um, my favorite was the backstory reveal and the way that worked thematically. I am so fucking sorry that I cannot say anything more than that.also, me an uncomfortable amount of times during this book:[image] → characters ←Miaaaaaa. I adore Mia as a character so much and I would read the series for her alone. She is such a complex and compelling antihero with such a complex and nuanced arc. I never know if she’s going to swerve evil or good, but I know I’m desperately invested in who she becomes. I love that she does evil things with good intentions and toes that line.→ romance ←Ash and Mia are the GREATEST. They have this friends-to-enemies-to-lovers slow-burn dynamic I basically adore. Uh… yeah. I really love the juxtaposition of them to other romantic relationships as being far healthier, even though they’re both literal assassins?→ more thoughts ←The cissexism is really bothersome? I mean, it feels like every two chapters there’s some mention of vaginas vs. dicks and like… I get that you like being Gritty and Dark, but what am I reading. I also think occasionally the Grittiness overpowers the plot. Which I dislike. That part is bad and I dislike it. → enjoyment factor ←I don't even know, guys, these are just so addicting. I always have trouble getting into the beginning but from there, I just enjoy every second I spend reading these. This book took a while to get started, but once it got going, it became a straight-up [gay-up] masterpiece of plot twists and of character development.

They just go by so quickly.Seanan McGuire has a talent for finding hope in the darkest of places; in this case, death. Behind its mystery front story, this novella is a study in the family you find and in finding hope in death. Dusk or Dawn or Dark or Day is a compelling mystery about the disappearance of ghosts in New York, but honestly, what stands out here is the next-level worldbuilding, theme work, and character work.Honestly, my feelings on this are very similar to my feelings on McGuire's earlier Every Heart a Doorway. Her worldbuilding is stellar. The idea of a city full of ghosts is brilliant, and the execution is even more detailed and clever; the ghosts age by taking life from others, and can give ti back, too, which is interesting. I'd love to read more from this verse.Her writing and theme work is also a standout. There's a lot of content here focusing around the death of kindness in our current age, and the sadness of aging in a world that seems to have left you behind. Yet the book also never becomes a session of look-how-terrible-technology-is; the concept is touched upon, but this story is no PSA. As is also typical, I liked the characters. I think McGuire is quite good at making her audience care about characters in a very brief amount of time and without too much description. With a vast and intriguing cast of side characters, this story feels as if it could really be taking place with this exact cast. And, as is typical - YET AGAIN - I thought it could've gone deeper. There's so much great here, but if the ending had done just a little more - the themes come closer to the surface, the fascinating worldbuilding get more exploration, the character development take full precedence - this could've been a five. But despite my lack of full adoration, this was great, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a creepy and quick read.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Oct 20, 2017","Oct 20, 2017","Aug 18, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31183180-dusk-or-dark-or-dawn-or-day

Oh, yes it did. What gets me about this volume is how it expands upon everything we've already established in such an organic, natural way.

Here, we were also introduced to a few new characters. There's Whitney, a former guard turned prisoner. There's Kamau's sister Morowa, (view spoiler)[and now we see why she was constantly referred to as Kogo's brother - she's a trans girl accused of gender nonconformity.

I’m kicking myself for going into this expecting a fast-paced novel I’d rocket through. Because this book may be post-apocalyptic and all depending on The Twist [which comes like a third of the way through, by the way] but it is certainly not fast-paced. Basically, even though I appreciated things about Never Let Me Go, my reading experience of this was 99% awful. I’ve split this  into several parts, but my overarching opinion falls into one category: this book has clever ideas, but they’re not the focus. Instead, Never Let Me Go becomes a long list of memories. There is such a thing as taking show, not tell, too far - it’s when what you’re showing is beginning to bore the reader. Listen, if there are three thousand reveals or a deep character arc running through the book, we’re fine, but there are approximately two reveals and a bunch of character memories that failed to make me feel attached. → the characters ←I want to say that I like the idea of Cathy’s character. She has been so torn down, so forced to be one thing that she has never considered being anything else or finding a different path in life. It is awful and horrifying. And yet, two things: one, she has no character voice, and two, the focus is not on developing Cathy. That is absolutely fine. Unless you’re me and literally only care about character development.→ the romance ←I’m so sorry, but this book did an utterly awful job with character chemistry. Tommy and Cath… I’m sorry, I just didn’t believe it. (view spoiler)[After spending an entire book screwing around and being just friends, they decide they’ve been in love for years because his ex girlfriend tells him they are. And then they start having sex and it is described so goddamn clinically. (hide spoiler)] They clearly care about each other, but where’s the romantic side to this? I don’t even really attach to them as best friends. Neither of them are all that likable or even all that relatable. → the worldbuilding ←A good idea, but I really don’t think this works when we see nothing about the rest of the world. I had sort of hoped the world would get expanded, we’d see the true context of normalcy juxtaposed to what the leads go through, and it just does not happen. → the morality conflict ←It’s as if authors of 2005 think they can bring up a topic, offer zero new insight into said topic, and hope the audience thinks about the book in the future. Which, okay, I admit this strategy can work. If you’re attached to the characters enough to feel your heart break in tandem. I was not. → the audio format ←I think, in general, listening to an audiobook of a book like this was a mistake. This is a book that required my skimreading technique. If I had read this in physical copy, I am quite confident I would have turned pages in a rush, read the whole thing in two hours skipping half the sentences, and liked it quite a bit more - I’m sure some of my thoughts would be similar, but the few reveals could’ve bumped this to a three or four at least. But by the end of this book… I was just waiting for it to end. I could no longer connect to Cathy because the book just needed to end. And that’s something to know for the future - about my reading style and about this book.Oh well.

I've had historical problems with novellas, always wanting either more or less, but novella series have treated me well enough that I expected more from this. Yet I'm just not feeling it. // SOME BASIC GOODSWhile I'm still not totally sold on the symbolic nature of this series, I have to admit that Binti and Okwu - both as individuals and as a pair - are lovely. Binti's narrative around PTSD is amazing and her narrative around being mixed race is intriguing. Okwu's narrative around prejudice is very well-done. Their friendship narrative, while it struck me as a bit rushed last book, means a lot to me now. I love their weird friendship and the entire concept of them being friends. // GIVE IT MORE DEVELOPMENT!!The issue here is the lack of development to all the interesting things brought up here. There are fantastic characters, a great worldbuilding concept... and yet none of it is going anywhere.I've seen so many praising this story for its worldbuilding and I have to completely disagree. The worldbuilding is utterly confusing and far underdone. The thing with confusing worldbuilding like this is you NEED some setting depiction. And yet, there's no setting. I have no idea what the university looks like, or even whether it's free-floating or in space. I have no idea what part of earth the characters live on or anything about its appearance beyond ""desert."" Maybe the point is for the audience to imagine everything themselves, or project themselves on the story, but I'm not buying it.In terms of thematic work, I feel as if this novella just won't go the distance I want. There's a really impactful story about colonialism and prejudice here, but everything is under the surface. There aren't enough explicit discussions for me. The issue is just that the characters just aren't getting the development they deserve. Binti and Okwu are two characters I really adore, and I'd love to read a whole novel about them. But this novella prefers to focus on the random details of whatever scene is being told. I can't seem to find the point. VERDICT: This series could be so much better, but it just won't go to that place for me. I'll read the final novella, but I'm not exactly desperate.

And it wasn't completely terrible; it just missed being great by trying to be a sweet romance. I actually tend to like these small-scope sci-fi books. They offer a great opportunity for exploring the nature of humanity. Books like The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet? You all know I ate that book up. The issue here is the lack of genuine exploration. There are some interesting ideas and concepts here, but nothing really happened. And when things finally did start happening, the ideas weren't explored.  ♔ For example, there's an idea here that humans are inherently evil due to how they ruined the planet. Which is a really interesting idea and I'm pretty sure the author knows this was an interesting idea. But it doesn't really get explored beyond like four lines.  ♔ I also wished that the concept of prejudice had been explored more. Whoever wrote the blurb has never read the book. No character in this book is inherently evil because they're an alien. That's just not a factually correct statement. To all basic ideas, these aliens are exactly the same as us. And I actually liked that. I like the idea of an exploration of prejudice in this setting. It could've been something along the lines of The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet. But nope. There are around three lines referring to prejudice, but it's never legitimately explored.  ♔ There's also the entire idea of the resilience of humanity that could've been explored. That's a great idea to explore. It just doesn't happen. I could go on. The point is that nothing is explored with the depth I wanted it to be. What makes me sad is I think the author knows these are interesting ideas!! The book comes so close to what it could have been. She just chooses to focus on some petty love drama and instalove instead. None of the characters here were really built up enough for me to care about their connections. I did like the friendship between our protagonist, Li, and her friend Mirabae. I also liked the familial relationships. But did either ever give me any emotions? Uh. Nope. What's even more annoying is that I could've gotten past all this instalovey packaging if the characters had been stronger. Instalove is a necessary device here due to the time frame, but it could've felt natural rather than false. If the characters are strong, it can feel natural. Laini Taylor's Daughter of Smoke and Bone makes instalove feel natural by building up the two lead's loneliness and desperation for a connection. There is so much potential in that for a really well-written, character driven one-shot.This is going to sound weird, but I have a firm idea as to how I would rewrite this. First step: focus more on Li's loneliness as the only human in the world. This makes the theme of the concept clear and builds up the possibility for romance. Second step: don't have her see Ryn as attractive until they've had a couple friendly interactions. This makes their connection feel authentic rather than a tropey little romance inserted for the hell of it. Third step: more inner meditation and dialogue. Boom. The plot doesn't have to change, the writing style doesn't have to change, nothing has to change besides those three things. Bam. You have yourself a five-star book.Before I finish this , I'll add one more positive. I liked the casual diversity. The protagonist is biracial, and there are several mentions of other characters dating people of the same gender.

I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts This  contains a spoiler for a reveal around 100 pages into the novel. I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful. And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.“Make them pay you as much as they would a white man.”The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her. But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn. Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I’m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She is such a good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and I love that. Evelyn’s story is one of being a woman in a man’s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman’s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices were right. Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don’t… I don’t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but… well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn’s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always. “People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.“You didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasons why we don't want to give. It shouldn't just be that we don't want to give up. And I don't... have any. “You have never felt like my other half.”I know I’ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don’t know exactly how to put into words what this book meant to me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reid felt this book. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo left me an emotional mess, but also a happy mess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,4,2835,2,"May 21, 2020Feb 12, 2018","May 21, 2020Feb 14, 2018","Jul 28, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32620332-the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo

They're all on a fairly similar caliber to me, although book one is probably the best one; it gleams with slightly wasted potential. Delirium has some great elements, enough that it made a big mark on me in grade six, but also far too much romance for my taste. This book focuses on a future society where love has been outlawed, and humans are cured of their ability to love at age sixteen. Lauren Oliver develops this concept into a terrifying yet realistic world; it's not hard to understand why the characters think of this world as a utopia. Sure, they have somewhat restricted freedom, but when their religion and all their elders believe so firmly in protecting them from love, how can they disagree? This book exhibits some of Oliver's best writing, with prose that's flowing yet not too flowery. There are metaphors, yes, but they never overwhelm or kill the book. ""Love; the deadliest of all deadly things. It kills you both when you have it and when you don't.""Lena is a believable narrator, although not very entertaining. She's a bit... typical. To be fair, Lena improves and has a decent character arc as she realizes the toxicity of this world. I ended up really liking her. Lena's best friend Hana is an interesting, dimensional side character. I have a complicated relationship with this series' romantic plots. Plots, you say? Yes, there are two. Love triangle pops up in the second book. To be fair, Oliver executes both these plotlines fairly well, and both Alex and Julian are good love interests. But there's just too much romance in these books. Oliver should've focused more on platonic love (Lena and Hana's friendship was RIGHT THERE) rather than entirely romantic love. All that being said, this is a fantastic series beginner. It's just one of those beginners that's good for its potential, not for its actual content. Pandemonium and Requiem are, again, not bad. They're just not great. Pandemonium is a gritty and a fun ride, with a good character arc for Lena. I know many ers hate Requiem's ending, but I thought the open ending fit. I was also glad to finally get Hana's point of view, although I really wished her arc were resolved. Hana in general is a very complex character. Hana's story takes us through the tale of her friendship with Lena, her jealousy and want for love. Hana's character in general is fascinating and I LOVED getting this insight into her motivations. I really wish Delirium had focused on Lena and Hana as the two leads, rather than just bringing Hana in for the final book. This short story also brings up issues of class between Lena and Hana. It just really fascinated me. And the last line is!!Probably not recommended, because YA can do better. In fact, Lauren Oliver can do better (Before I Fall, anyone?).

Because I absolutely LOVE this book. WHY THIS BOOK STANDS OUT: AN ESSAY BY MEWhenever I hear people joke about Tris being similar to Katniss, I immediately assume they haven't read both books. Because Tris is nothing like Katniss. Katniss can be very cold and dispassionate: she's driven by her need to protect her sister. Tris is not at all cold. She's driven by passionate, self-righteous anger. She's extremely reckless and These things are written as character flaws. Tris is called out for being reckless in the face of danger multiple times throughout the series. (view spoiler)[I mean, she fucking dies because of her own recklessness. I may hate Allegiant, but I'm still allowed to use it to prove my point. (hide spoiler)] She's flawed in a realistic way and she'll always remain one of my favorite fictional characters. While the worldbuilding of this book is admittedly a little odd, this book does a wonderful job exploring fear. (view spoiler)[Tris has a seemingly random fear of being trapped in a box slowly filling with water. As the book goes along, she realizes that fear is related to her fear of losing control. Tobias has two separate fears that stem from his abusive childhood. (hide spoiler)] There's such a deep examination of fear and its roots, which I've never seen in another book. This book does a damn good job with moral conflicts. (view spoiler)[There's a moment close to the end where Tris is forced to shoot a close friend to survive. While the drama of it all is arguably dragged out too long in Insurgent, this is a really interesting conflict to have in a book. It's brilliant writing. (hide spoiler)] OTHER GOOD THINGSTobias and Tris are my favorite damn couple. Their dynamic just... works. I love how they narratively parallel each other and reflect each other's flaws. I love how they fight but there's no dramatic breakup. (Oh, there's another bonus! No love triangle.) And that scene between them in the fear landscape remains one of my top ten scenes ever. The lack of jerkass guy x sweet innocent girl romance is also a plus. (Side note: I still think the movie Tobias was way too hot for the role. Maybe I should've known I was gay sooner??)And the side characters!! I love the side characters. I love the Uriah and Lynn and Marlene dream team. I love Christina and Will. And Tris' family relationships make me feel All The Emotions. SLIGHTLY LESS GOOD THINGS, AND WHY I IGNORED THEM AND LOVED THIS BOOKThe book isn't a very sensical dystopia. In some ways, I guess the faction thing is no less sensical than the Hogwarts worldbuilding. Actually, I think the alignments based on top values make more sense than HP houses. So I'm not really bothered by that. All the worldbuilding is technically explained in Allegiant, but I hate Allegiant SO MUCH that I'm just going to acknowledge how weird the divergent tests are. THE BIG BIG CON AND REASON I CAN NEVER ACTUALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOKBecause the last book fucking sucked. Sorry. Here's my ranty, spoiler-filled  about that. This book totally would've made my all-time favorites list if not for my anger over Allegiant. Divergent is solidly the best bookInsurgent is kind of a ""meh"" second book. It's not terrible, just not amazing. At least it's not as bad as book three. Allegiant is... a fucking mess. I wrote a separate  because I was just that pissed off. Fuck you, Allegiant.Four is a typical story collection, but it's one I liked a decent amount. I always did like Four's character....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,Jan 2013,Jan 2013,"Jul 26, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22698031-divergent-series-box-set

You'll notice that this box set only contains the first three, which is ridiculously convenient - I didn't read book four or the novella until 2016 and still loved both, which just goes to show that this series truly is amazing. Unwind is about a world where society’s distrust for teenagers has been taken to a further extent. Instead of aborting unborn children, governments allow parents to unwind their kids at ages 13-18. Your organs will be given to people who need them – cancer patients, car-accident victims, sick, mangled or disease ridden people. This concept could’ve been terrible in any other author’s hands, but Shusterman executes it perfectly. He writes about how teens are seen as property, existing as aspects of their parents or not at all. Shusterman has extremely well-written main characters. Connor's character development is complex and interesting. He’s sarcastic and willing to do what it takes. Also, nice socks. Lev isn’t the most interesting towards the beginning of this book, but he has incredible character development, going through a slight villain arc and learning who he is slowly but surely. Risa is emotionally cold, but also badass and lovable. He doesn’t stop there; this series is also packed with interesting, developed side characters. Una has broken my heart so many times, Hayden has broken my heart so many times. I've only read one or two other series where the character arcs are so consistently interesting, especially with such a large cast. There’s not too much romance, but what romance exists is amazing. The romance between Connor and Risa is developed extremely slowly, no instalove, with them gradually becoming a team. They’re one of my favorite couples. While this series is fairly diverse in terms of race and gender, I do have a few quibbles. Throughout the series, we have so many interesting girl characters… but none of the major girls are leaders. All the leaders here are guys, and it's not the greatest. Also, there is not a single lgbt character in this entire series. That’d be fine with a small cast, but there are around 20 major characters in this series. There’s a short novella where Hayden is implied to be bi (which he totally is), but a one-line reference to bringing either a boy or a girl to a party is not enough. I need more. There is also too much backstory for villains I didn't care about. This aspect is really awesome for the first two books, but it gets old after a while. Not every villain can be symapthetic. All that being said, I recommend this series wholeheartedly, to everyone....more",Notes are private!,-1,12,1,Jan 2013,Jan 2013,"Jul 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17334191-the-unwind-collection

This series has a really great concept and some good aspects, but it lacks quite enough emotional depth and ends up being somewhat superficial as a result. Uglies is about a world in which everyone is considered by default ugly and has to become pretty. The book certainly benefits from this smart concept; this is a world where beauty rules. Unfortunately, the interesting connections to our world aren't explored enough in this series. Pretties are stupid, Uglies have their brains. It's nothing new. Tally and Shay are each interesting characters with believable inner conflict. They're flawed and their friendship is flawed, but they parallel each other in interesting ways. I almost wish we could've gotten both their points of view. Unfortunately, this series goes all over the place in terms of plot and character growth. There's no solid arc for Tally and Shay; they have emotions, then go back to being terrible because of an operation, then they develop again. Tally has three different character arcs because she keeps having her brain remodeled. I have to admit, it was quite disappointing. It gets old after the second time her character regresses. Tally's ending as a character (after four books) is pretty good; she's changed a lot and lost many of her emotions, but she's not a robot. Her morally ambiguous character during books three and four was a lot of fun. While I didn't like Specials as much at the time, in hindsight it might be my favorite for Tally's slightly psychotic yet way more interesting character. Despite the fact that the twist at the end of book two was AWESOME. However, I question the need for her in-between reset to become a Pretty. All that happens in book two is a romance. What was the need? If I were to rewrite the series, I would've skipped Pretties and instead left Tally as an Ugly. Another issue with this series is the badly-written romance. The love triangle especially is just a fail. David is the love interest for this book, and he's a decent guy and decent character, but it's hard to ignore that he's supposedly dating Shay at the time he kisses Tally. Zayn, in the second book, is flat-out annoying. He's reckless and tiresome, and their entire relationship is based off his hotness. There's no need for the love triangle here, and frankly, both plots could've been executed better. The conclusion for Tally and Zayn is especially messy. This isn't so much a  as a compilation of thoughts. God knows what my views would be today.

I don't care about ing all six books because I don't remember which ones I liked best - I read the whole thing in a week, and then read Light a month later when I released. But this series is fabulous. The Gone series is basically Lord of the Flies with much better characters. This series is seriously weird and yet SO much fun and SO emotional. This series is the gold standard of dramatic tension. Grant's plotting is brilliantly crafted, full of twists and turning. The events are often viscerally terrifying. Michael Grant's writing draws you in, making you feel as if the events are actually happening. In terms of which book is my fave... who fucking knows. So I don't remember much about Hunger but it changed me as a person? I'm pretty sure mostly because I fucking love Diana. I think Lies was my least favorite and I honestly remember nothing about it. Plague is definitely the scariest; I don't remember the last time I was so terrified by a book. Fear and Light are both good, although not quite as great. The best part of Light is the fantastic conclusion. I am so, so okay with who lived and who died. Seriously, there are one or two characters I was sure were going to die and they didn't!! I'm so blessed!!CHARACTERS AND STUFFAll the characters are SO GOOD. Seriously, this series has such great characters. There are so many side characters and somehow you get attached to all of them. Even the antagonists get your sympathy, and sometimes even your genuine love. There's one particular villain-to-hero growth arc that touches my heart more than any other. [minor spoiler alert] I'm talking about Diana Ladris. She's seriously such a developed, heartfelt character. Diana's crisis over that one thing she did in Hunger made me fall in love with her. And then her arc?? Murdered me. We're so #blessed by her character growth. My original  of Light was “In this cruel world of YA lit, all I have left is Diana's character arc.” And I want to talk about this character arc a little. Diana is a self-confessed “bad girl.” She's not the greatest person; within this series, she does some fucked-up things and manipulates situations to her advantage. But she still gets a character arc and a happy ending. Bad characters in YA lit hardly ever get happy endings, and the fact that she did is amazing. Some of my other faves are pretty surprising too. I can't believe I like Caine as a character? Fight me Michael Grant. There's not much romance, but the existing romance is great. Sam and Astrid have a touch of instalove, but they get really developed throughout the book series. And the other romantic plots are even better, maybe just because they have less focus and way less instalove. Diana and Caine have an incredibly unhealthy dynamic on both sides, yet their characters are each so developed that you get invested anyway.This series has great diversity too, with major lgbt characters and non-white characters. Yes, the two physically strongest characters are both guys, but this series does have a ton of high-powered girl characters, like Dekka and Brianna and Taylor. And there are of course other interesting, multifaceted girl characters, like Lana, Astrid, and Diana, who is my personal favorite character of anything ever.

I don't exactly recommend this book, but I have to admit, I found it weirdly compelling when I read it in sixth grade. I found it trashy even then, but I wasn't bored and I never wanted to stop reading. Why? I'm really not sure. It's just one of those questions that will never be answered. WOW THIS SERIES IS REALLY FUCKING LONG??IT'S TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FUCKING PAGES NOT EVEN INCLUDING THE DAMN NOVELLAS. anyway I'm calling these books 1) the mediocre one 2) the angsty one 3) the abusive love triangle one 4) the really hella entertaining but also probably the shittiest one. Book one is just mediocre and underdeveloped. It's super entertaining and short though. Book two is maybe the one that was the least bad, looking back?? Yes, the romance plot becomes a love triangle between a vampire and a wolf. But the new guy, Jacob, is actually really nice in here. And actually, some bits of this aren't terrible. Rosalie's backstory shows up here, and it's one of the coolest things I've ever read. More on Edward's family later. Book three is actually the worst one. 1) Jacob's actually-kind-of-nice character got destroyed. Of course. 2) Edward went from slightly creepy to literally abusive. 3) And it was all just really, really boring. Did anyone notice that nothing happened until like page 500?Book four... oh man. Book four deserves five stars just because I somehow found it entertaining enough to finish and rush through, despite being SEVEN HUNDRED FUCKING PAGES LONG. even though the conclusion is bullshit and that stuff with the blood-drinking was creepy. Anyway, let's stop talking about the series and just get to my general opinions. NOW LET ME DISCOURSE A LITTLE BITTwilight gets a really bad rap, and I'm honestly not sure it's deserved. I have read way worse romance in YA lit. Bella and Edward's relationship isn't perfect, by any means. He's a bit overly controlling and they've got a severe case of instalove. But y'all have romanticized far worse. Twilight is somewhat addictive trash with a romance that is actually less terrible than some of the ones I've seen in ya lit. Remember Article 5?? You know, actual physical abuse?? A lot of it?? This entire romantic arc is stereotypical, but Edward isn't a terrible guy - a bit overprotective, but he doesn't treat Bella completely terribly. I do have to say that the next two books are a little worse in terms of feminism. New Moon romanticizes wanting to die without your boyfriend (to be fair, he wants to die without her too, but that's ALSO terrible!!) Eclipse romanticizes being overprotective and enforces toxic masculinity. And Breaking Dawn has some terrible shit to say about abortion, as well as some shitty connotations with those BRUISES. And don't even get me started on Leah's menopause thing.LET'S YELL!! A LITTLE BIT!!Uhhhhhh what are my opinions. Do I even have opinions. Oh yes, Edward and Bella's relationship. Sigh. It wasn't actually that bad in book one from what I remember; he's weird, but he's somewhat less creepy. He's actually not particularly creepy here either, it's just that this book perpetrates some really crappy ideas. This series is actually way less antifeminist than people act like it is; I have read far, far worse in terms of feminism. But being willing to die just to hallucinate your ex-boyfriend is not okay. Given that both Edward AND Bella feel this way, I don't even class this as a sexism issue; this book portrays a flat-out unhealthy, toxic relationship for both of them. Anyway, I love Edward's family kind of a lot?? Rosalie's backstory is one of the coolest things I've ever read. I liked that Bella showed sympathy for her and didn't just hate her for being pretty. There's also more backstory for Carlisle and the rest of the vampire family, which is really interesting and entertaining. Why did this book have to be about Bella and Edward??BEFORE YOU GO: Please read Natalie's  about how much the cast regretted Twilight....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Jan 2013,Jan 2013,"Jul 26, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2888213-the-twilight-saga

He didn’t see doing both at once as any sort of a contradiction.This novella is seriously messed up. And oh boy, it's terrifying. Did I mention that? I'm sorry, but it creeped the shit out of me. The thing that's so terrifying about this novella is how weirdly plausible it seems. Despite the fact that there are literal killer mermaids around, it's hard not to believe in everything that's happening. Something I didn't expect was the focus on science; Mira Grant has clearly done her research here and inserted just enough into the minds of the characters that we feel their scientific mindsets affecting our own feelings on the situation. Grant is also helped along with a seriously awesome cast of characters. Anne is a star of the company with ambitions of becoming a talk show host before she gets washed up. Alexandra is an ambitious and snarky scientist. Jill Hale wants cartography results so she can work in the military. Sonja Weinstein is a gregarious whale rights activist looking for a story. Jonny is opinionated and argumentative; his partner, Anton, is more camera shy. Peter Harris is the obsessed ichthyologist. There's David, a sarcastic Deaf crewmate. There's Jovanie, the captain.

Lair of Dreams is a book about identity masking itself as paranormal historical fiction. And it's brilliant. Holy shit. What I loved about this book is its focus on the outsiders of the 1920s.

Henry struggles with feeling alienated by a world in which he is not allowed to expose his sexuality. Theta struggles with fear of herself, Memphis - who is also black - struggles with his doubt in himself. Evie is hiding herself, Sam is hiding himself, and Mabel doesn't yet know herself. Every single character is, in their own way, on the outside. Even ignoring the major themes of the book, the focus on marginalized characters here is so strong. There's the budding solidarity between Henry and Ling, obviously, but I think it's the little things that stand out to me. One of my favorite lines in the whole book involves “an unspoken understanding” passing between Ling and Memphis after Ling is confronted by police. It's so good and so important to me. “So. Tell me,” Marlowe tried gamely, “what do you think is man’s greatest invention?”Jericho turned his head just slightly toward Marlowe, looking him straight in the eye. “God.”Aaaaah, okay, now that I’ve spent so much time talking about narratives, let’s talk characters! First of all: Ling. My girlfriend. My wife. My everything. “This is how it is now. There is strength in acceptance, Ling. Your legs have been taken from you. But how you choose to live with that has not.”I love her so much and I am so excited to see her get even more development in book two. And Henry - oh my god his fucking backstory chapters are so freaking horrible and beautiful. Henry is such a freaking well-developed character and I love him so deeply. And Theta? Oh my god. Her development next book is going to kill me, I just know it. But can we talk Memphis and Theta, because their relationship is literally the purest thing in this entire book. Besides Henry and Louie's relationship. Kill me. While Ling, Henry, Theta, and Memphis are quickly becoming my favorite leads and the holders of my favorite storylines, I’ve also gotten so much more invested in the original four love triangle leads. Turns out I ship Sam and Evie. A lot. Which is really surprising, considering how hard I was antishipping last book. “Okay. That’s fair. Abso-tive-ly fair. Let’s say the tables were turned. If I were about to walk off a cliff, what would you do?”Evie pursed her lips. “Push?”“I don’t believe that.”“You would on the way down.”I CAN'T NOT SHIP THEM.Also turns out I love Mabel with my whole heart and think she's about to get the best fucking character arc of all time. Also turns out I think Mabel and Jericho would make the most wonderful banter-y couple. And did I mention I sort of love Jericho?“No. He and Will spoke in newspaper articles about ghosts. They conversed through the careful curation of supernatural knickknacks. And Jericho couldn't help but feel cheated at how little he'd gotten when he'd needed so much more.Why was there so much silence between men?”It’s funny - I thought this book was far less scary than its predecessor. Rather, there’s a sense of melancholy to this book - despite terrifying sections, the book as a whole is more a mournful cry than a horror story. And though it leads to a slower pace, I found this book so utterly engaging that I didn’t even mind. This series has gone from a fast-paced and interesting paranormal story to a far more thoughtful exploration of America and a story primarily driven by its characters. While some might lambaste that as middle-book syndrome, I think this book is a leg up for this series as a whole.

After all the excitement of her initial job transplant,Tana French’s The Trespasser follows Antoinette Conway, a jaded detective on the murder squad. After all the excitement of her initial job transplant, she’s dealt with near-constant racist and sexist harassment, and essentially only worked on basic domestic cases, which she and her partner Stephen close quickly and cleanly. The death of Aislinn Murray at first seems like a clear cut case: she was preparing for a romantic dinner with a boyfriend, Rory, the likely suspect. The boyfriend, after all, is a common perpetrator. But as pressure from the squad builds up to close the case quickly, the two are forced to consider whether maybe, there’s something more going on here.Antoinette Conway is such an interesting character to follow. She’s sarcastic and hard-edged, even more so than some previous members, but always sympathetic: she’s loving towards her partner and sympathetic towards people when they deserve it. Though she tries to cover up these bits of caring, even within her narration, they shine through; it’s easy to get invested in her relationships and personal struggles, hoping she’ll be given the chance to breathe out and also desperately hoping she’ll win, if only to prove them wrong. Stephen Moran and Antoinette Conway have my favorite detective pairing of the three Tana French novels I’ve read so far. His happy-go-lucky spirit contrasts perfectly with her more jaded attitude; they feel very Holmes-and-Watson-esque. Their final interrogation scene together, especially, is deeply satisfying and interesting. Tana French’s writing is the definition of slow burn in the best way. Her red herrings are never quite out of left field; instead, they lead you in the wrong direction, but give you the information you need to find the right one. (I never succeed.) This specific mystery goes through so many excellent loops in such an interesting way. Aislinn Murray is a more interesting character than she seems, and discovering her origins kept me enthralled. I liked getting to know the victim just as I got to know the detectives fighting to save her. Even though I initially rated this four stars, I keep flashing back to how much I loved the experience of reading this book; how enthralled it kept me, how close on the edge of my seat, how I didn’t guess the ending at all, how satisfying I found it. I’m bumping this up to five stars and will certainly be keeping it in my mind.

It is a book about learning to moWe Are Okay is a book about learning the people you used to love were something beyond what you believed them to be. It is a book about learning to move on. It is a book about learning to be with yourself and be with your grief. It is also a book about loneliness, deep and profound loneliness, cloying and suffocating. In clearer terms, this is a book about Marin, a girl who has lost her grandfather, and in doing so, pushed away her former best friend, Mabel. So when Mabel comes to town, Marin does not know what to do with the memories. Marin at once does not want Mabel here, regrets her being here, but also desperately wants Mabel to love her. She has walls up and she wants them down, but she is too terrified for them to ever come down. Marin has lost everything, including Mabel, her best friend and her maybe-something-more. But it’s not a romance between Marin and Mabel. That is what is perhaps the saddest part. I once saw Nina LaCour talk live about this book, and she said something that perfectly sums up what is so arresting about this book: being queer and in love with your best friend is different than being straight and in love with your best friend. One is an experience in first love, and one is also that, but with an added experience of fear – not of rejection but of disgust. We do not want to hurt our best friends by loving them. We have learned to be ashamed of love and we carry that with us, through thick and through thin. “If only I had something to take the edge off the loneliness. If only lonely were a more accurate word. It should sound much less pretty.”Loneliness is not a queer-only experience, not by any means; that would not be a fair claim. But being queer is a loneliness experience. We are all, in our own ways, not a part of the norm, not a part of the life others are allowed. We find our own lives in the cracks and spaces. (“I could say the night felt magical, but that would be embellishment - that would be romanticization. What it actually felt like was life,” Marin says of her first and only date with Mabel.) And in the wake of losing a grandfather, of losing the only person she has ever been raised by, Marin has found herself caught in a trap of being alone; she cannot rekindle a friendship with Mabel, because their history screams too loud. None of this is stated in We Are Okay, but the idea of loneliness is perhaps the most consistent fact of the story; whether alone or with Mabel, Marin is always lonely. She is always lonely, until she and Mabel finally discuss and unpack their history, and move on to a future where they can both heal, as friends if not as lovers.We Are Okay is not an action-packed story, and it is not in your face, and it will not make you scream at One Specific Significant Line. It is a book to feel, a book to hurt, and a book to heal. I’ve been trying to understand for months how I felt about this book because I think sitting on something like this is absolutely essential. We Are Okay is an incredibly slow, an incredibly quiet, an incredibly subtle story, but thinking back on my experience reading it two years ago, I feel like crying. It means the world.

This a completely-impossible-to-put-down YA thriller about the day being saved by a combination of self care and lesbian love. Okay, main promo for this book: it’s really scary. Writing truly horrifying scenes takes a a lot of talent, and this book did a wonderful job at scaring me shitless. The paranormal aspects are brilliantly frightening and written with just enough restraint that it’s hard not to feel deeply, deeply scared. Tension builds up slowly and perfectly. One of my favorite horror movie conflicts is the man vs. self conflict - when we see a character struggling with their inner demons above all else. Here, I adored the main character, Marianne. her arc around self-hatred is very compelling and intriguing. Though the divorced parents storyline at first came off a bit cliche, her complex and somewhat-codependent relationship with her mother soon adds a super intriguing angle to The Dark Beneath the Ice’s paranormal elements.And I really loved the way the romance was written! It’s sapphic, and though it’s not a huge element of the book, it has a good slow burn - it’s hard not to get invested in the relatively slow build. Marianne and Rhiannon [who both have weirdly long names] make for a really sweet couple in a book that is otherwise pretty damn dark.

I think it's nigh-impossible to  a verse novel well. And this is not just a verse novel; it is a book that gets its chief power out of emotionality and importance.If you've read the blurb, you know this follows the story of 17th-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi. Or at least, the beginning of her story. When she was seventeen, Artemisia had taken on most of the duties at her father's studio and was preparing to marry a trusted teacher. Yet it was soon discovered that this teacher was far less than the fine man he seemed. She was raped and violated by him, and forced to undergo a trial for her honor that was violating and involved torture on her part. After her full ordeal, the man who had raped her and destroyed the lives of multiple other women was given one year in prison. He was released after six months. This book is a powerful exploration not only of Artemisia's strength, but also of the strength of Biblical heroines like Judith and Susanna. It's an exploration of the power we have and the power we take, and it is absolutely, completely necessary.I don't necessarily think the prose was the best I've ever read, but it's certainly quite well-done. Verse novels can occasionally have a tendency to come off false, yet that is not at all a category this falls in to. This book is powerful and important and worthwhile and I cannot recommend it enough.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,"Sep 02, 2017","Sep 04, 2017","Jul 12, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35540804-blood-water-paint

The man, Ted, begins talking about his cheating wife, Miranda. The woman, Lily, says she deserves it, and offers her help. And they build a plan to kill his wife. Ted, though, might get a bit more than he bargained for when the ensuing plot goes off the rails. The art of a linchpin twist is one few authors perfect. You have to build up a standing where the twist will be satisfying. But in order to make the twist surprising, you also have to ensure that readers will assume a plot point, or rather, not even think to question a point. The twist must also have consequences: for the rest of the book, a certain character, your understanding of the situation. For a twist to be shocking, it must be all three, surprising, somehow making perfect sense, and with clear repercussions. These twists—several seperate twists that change the entire direction of the novel—genuinely messed me up. I found myself desperately invested in trying to figure out the next one on my own. (I was rarely successful.) I was so desperate to figure these characters out, but whenever I thought I got it, I never did. Trying to remember why, exactly, this book keeps sticking in my head, and coming up a little short of things to say beyond ‘oh my god oh my god oh my god’ so I guess I’ll end on this: I read the last 250 pages in approximately two hours and was thinking about it for a week afterward.

The writing clearly needed at least five more rounds of editing. It felt fake-deep and pretentious, it felt shoddy, and it annoyed me to no end. And it's sad, because without my writing issues, this could be an easy three. Other than that one downside, Lambs Can Always Become Lions was fairly entertaining. I was more than fine with the characters and the plot and the romance in this. Although to be quite honest, I really didn't expect an established relationship. If you're going to write a romance story, why make them an established couple? Why not write their development? I felt like I was watching season eight of a television show where the leads got together in season five. Plot points often felt like manufactured drama, and I didn't feel that Marian and Robin had their drama worked out. Honestly, I'm pretty disappointed. Iwas really here for that gay retelling of Robin Hood; that's my version of wish fulfillment. But where was the slow burn? Where was the writing talent I've come to expect from some of the self-pubbed books I've picked up recently? Self-pubbed f/f doesn't equal unedited. What about the fabulous enemies-to-lovers trope presented by J.C. Lillis' underrated A&B? What about the fantastically-written scifi of Arden Ellis' In Ageless Sleep? The clever character dynamic and interesting retelling aspect of Sarah Diemer's The Dark Wife? There are so many better self-pubbed f/f books out there.

Don't make it clever just because it's old.Well, this was disappointing. I think the thing is that I read graphic novels almost entirely for the art. So when I dislike an art style, it becomes very obvious to me very quickly that the novel series is not for me. And unfortunately, the art style here is mediocre at best. I did not like the art in this comic for the first few volumes. The art gets significantly and suddenly better in three, and then goes back under. Whichever artist drew comic three needs to draw this whole comic, because wow, they're talented. In terms of story, Bitch Planet is... fine? I like the intersectional feminism, but the story itself is mediocre at best. I honestly only truly cared for a couple of characters. Kamau Kogo is our main protagonist, a former athlete accused of murdering inmate Marian Collins. I liked her fine, but didn't love her. There's also Penelope, who's fat and proud and maybe my favorite character. There's Fanny, a manipulative and good-at-spying lesbian with no depth whatsoever. And there's Meiko Maki, with a tragic backstory to rival the greats. You know, there's nothing particularly bad about the story, but nothing amazing either.

She's assisted by a new tiger general, Seizi, who knew Maika as a child, and Syryssa, his captain. Meanwhile, Ren's struggling with his loyalty. He may have betrayed Maika and Kippa to the dawn court, but he also promised Maika's friend Tuya he'd take care of them. But all this gets even harder when the Maika's demon hunters are taken into account. And back at the wolf-ruled Dawn Court, Moriko's sister is hunting Maika and searching for the mask. Some really interesting mythology was revealed here too. Here's a recap for anyone who has read this volume: (spoilers ahead!!) Thyria is ruled by the Wave Empress' appointees, the pirate queens. We know that long ago, the Cumaea invaded Thyria by air and were destroyed by a typhoon. We also know that the gods of the shadow planes are real; they've just given up their power to avoid killing. The Shaman-Empress was the one who forged the mask and tied the oldest god to herself as her slave. The Blood Fox is still alive on bone island. We also know now of the drug Dreamtar, popular among arcanics after the war. We've also found out that Tuya is secretly the Baroness of the Last Dusk, acting as an envoy for the dusk court. Mariko did what all mothers do when they want control; she had a daughter.I'm really interested in Maika's mother; I'm hoping we'll learn more about her soon. There's so much I'm confused about and so much I'm excited about. I can't wait for volume three.Blog | Goodreads| Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jul 13, 2017","Jul 13, 2017","Jul 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33540347-monstress-vol-2

But I'm going to be honest: I have a feeling she's tried and failed at YA before. And she got really bitter. At... the existence of diversity in YA, I guess??I only didn't quote because I had an arc, not a finished copy. But guess what? I checked today, and the quotes didn't change from the arc. This is from the second and third page of the book. Context: they're making fun of common ya tropes.""And everyone thinks she's hot but she doesn't care, because she has a secret...

""And then... she sees a gorgeous Iranian girl with oh my god, scars on her wrists.""Okay, so here we are with the obligatory ""being gay, or being iranian, or having a mental illness [etc] makes your life more likely to be represented in ya"" rhetoric. Yeah... if you're going to write a YA parody novel, please do yourself a favor and read YA. Can you tell me where you found the depressed Iranian lesbian in YA lit? Because I gotta tell ya - she doesn't exist in any YA I've read. And far more importantly, making fun of rape, incest, homophobia, and self harm, all at the same time. And not in a cute, all-in-good-fun way. This feels like an author who's really pissed off about diversity in ya. There is some real anger in this chapter, and I think it's worth questioning where that's coming from. ALSO: ""Why aren't we gay?""""I know. But we're not. At least, I'm not. You seem a little gay to me.""""You know what would be really good? If one of us was gay and like, dying of secret lust for the other. And then there could be a discovery scene.

You made us into monsters, both of us.”Actual Rating: 3.5 stars. Do you ever read books that don't really stand out? That you love while reading, but can't think of anything standout to mention? That's how I felt about this. It's a very solid and well-paced book, it's lacking in romance but strong in friendship, and it's a creative retelling. But there's nothing here that makes me cry with delight, you know? A fun read, but not a memorable one.First of all, the plot and concept is really interesting. A retelling of Frankenstein in which Frankenstein: the book actually exists? Alternate history? It's just as interesting as it sounds. This novel is so fast-paced and entertaining I can hardly complain. Just the thing for my reading slump. “We're all monsters. We're all careless and cruel in the end.”The themes here about evil are so interesting and well-done; maybe my favorite thing about this book. For that reason alone, I'd definitely rec this to fans of This Savage Song by V.E. Schwab, one of my current reads. They have very similar vibes. While these characters maybe aren't the most nuanced of all, they're all solidly interesting characters. There's main character Alasdair, the Frankenstein of this story. His reincarnated, maybe-a-monster-and-maybe-not brother Oliver. His ex-girlfriend Mary. And his new friend Clemence.I also LOVE how this doesn't focus on romance. I kept waiting for Alasdair's relationship with Clemence to turn romantic, and it never did. They only have a strong friendship!! The only romance takes place in the past, which I loved.I do, however, feel this was a little underwhelming. It just didn't go deep enough into the situations for my taste. The characters were never pushed to their limits or broken to the degree I wanted them to be. There's not much development and not many plot twists. Nothing bad, just nothing particularly fabulous or standout either. VERDICT: Maybe not a fabulous book, but I solidly enjoyed this. Recommended for anyone who needs a good fast-paced read. I preferred Gentleman's Guide, though. Also, my  for Mackenzi Lee as a person would be a five-star gush . I LOVED HER TALK SO MUCH.

After how much I adored Radio Silence, I hoped I was going to love Alice Oseman’s next book, and… unsurprisingly, it was fantastic. This book follows Angel, a girl on a mission to see her favorite band. And when several things go wrong, she might end up actually meeting some of them. A huge, huge cast thing about this book is that it preserves the humanity of all the characters. It is a book that focuses on friendship, not romance; character development, not plot. →Jimmy is a fantastic character and so wonderfully complex and lovable. Jimmy is trans, biracial Indian and Italian, gay, and has severe anxiety. His character arc in this book focuses primarily on his anxiety, and his struggle to handle his own mental health in a world where his privacy has increasingly been invaded. →His bandmates, Rowan and Lister, are just as compelling - Rowan is biracial and Nigerian and dealing with a hidden relationship, and Lister is dealing with alcoholism and depression. Oh, and his speech about the perception of his bisexuality by others is incredible. →The Jimmy/Rowan/Lister dynamic is so good and complex and real; Lister’s jealousy of Jimmy and Rowan, especially, is written honestly but empathetically, and I loved the relationship between Jimmy and Lister. →Rowan’s girlfriend, Bliss, has got to be my favorite character - she is the hilarious icon I needed in my life, and her arc around her relationship with Rowan is fantastic. She is bisexual and biracial Chinese.→Jimmy’s grandfather is flawless and I would give my life for him.→Angel, our second narrator, is an intriguing character on all levels. Angel is a Hijabi Muslim and describes herself as being queer and questioning. And while she has moments of crossing boundaries, the way the narrative both empathizes with her and critiques her behavior found me caring for her anyway. →Angel’s internet friend, Juliet, took a while to grow on me, but is human as can be - and for that reason I liked her. →Mac is so annoying, and is clearly written to be annoying, and he still reads as fairly real, which is something to pull off.Perhaps you’re getting this from my list, but this book has some of the most nuanced character arcs I’ve had the pleasure of reading in recent memory. Almost every character, side or main, has some kind of point A to point B journey. “That's why people get into fandom and bands and stuff. They just want something to hold on to something that makes them feel good. Even if it's all a big lie.”There’s a discussion of religion, of outing, of toxic relationships. There’s a huge thread around what we demand of celebrities, especially in terms of privacy and mental health. Making your internet friends real-life friendships… but also keeping that freedom to be weird that makes them so special. Perhaps the reason I didn’t like this book quite as much is because it very much reads as a slice-of-life; while all the characters grow and change in ways both large and small, they don’t necessarily get satisfying conclusions. This is a style of storytelling that tends to appeal to me somewhat less, and despite knowing this is the point, I admit to wishing for more. But maybe there’s some value in slice of life - when it comes down to it, this is a book about being okay with not being okay. None of these characters end the book feeling totally okay, but they ended this book just a little better, and there’s something rather valuable.

Ginger!”A stagehand pulled open the curtain, and I got my first look at the audience.“Her hair's not red,” one of the hecklers shouted. “I want my money back.”A good and probably-about-to-be-underrated-read! This was my first-ever physical arc I received directly from an author and publisher, and I have to say I’m pretty pleased it was this one.The Art of Escaping is a book about finding your passion, whatever it is, and finding a group of people who want to be a part of that passion. I think in high school, wanting to find a group who want you - it could be one person or fifty people - is one of the most important things in the world. This is a book that knows how important that can be, and wants to show you.First of all, can I just say: this book is really humorous. The humor here didn’t always fit my sense, but several moments of sarcastic humor gave me a good laugh. And there were so many minor things that worked for me! I appreciated the moments of poking fun at typical high-school tropes. I also really liked, though it was minor, Mattie’s history class - cool good teachers in YA are always something I really enjoy.And okay, a nitpick section for somewhat eh lines and themes that I, personally, disliked? Okay, there’s one moment - this is arc and not final copy - where a teacher suggests a gay-straight alliance and the main character responds with “I’m apolitical” and, you know, I am dead tired of being queer being defined as a political thing. Would love if that got released. And the minute girl hate element is... hm. On one hand, Mattie talks a lot about how Meadow isn’t really bad, just above it all, and puts her on the same level as several dudes. But on the other hand, the intro is so filled with bouncy hair that the entire thing feels like yet another “wow, aren’t girls who fit western beauty standards terrible?” And in general, I think a few of the attempts to point out racism and homophobia fall a little short. Will’s thoughts on his mother’s treatment of gay men as objects beyond people are so amazing and important. And then… they disappear in two pages. His later coming out exemplifies his mom’s homophobia, but the whole thing is written off. And in general, I think this book was not without flaws — a few more complicated sections feel somewhat messily written in that debut-novel way, and there’s a dream sequence towards the beginning that could really use some editing. But in the end, I thought this was a really fun story about finding your passions. I’ll definitely be reading more by this author.

And I'm a stressed Latin student. So that was nice to see. It's also a really good play as characters go. Every character parallels around three other characters in interesting ways; Brutus especially is a foil to all of the other three leads. All the relationships between the characters are so interesting and heartbreaking. This is also just one of the best-written plays I've ever read. I love how Shakespeare varies his meter for every character. Okay, example time: Brutus ends at least half his statements with weak endings rather than in typical Iambic Pentameter. Cool, right? Maybe it's not if you don't know what any of that meant. Nevermind. But my nerd ass loves it. Also, so much rhetoric. That assembly scene changed me as a person. You could write a freaking term paper on that scene and still not fully analyze the whole thingAnd it's still a relevant story today!! This play has some really fucking relevant political commentary. There's actually a line in this play about how this bloody scene, this surprise betrayal, will be reenacted a thousand times over in the future, and it's maybe the most brilliant line of all time, ever. I love it. I can't believe we cut it. Beyond all that, though, this is just one of the most narratively strong plays I've ever read. This is my favorite kind of tragedy. Every single character has sensical motivations!! There's no villain!! There's no fate as the villain!! Every bad thing that happens is the result of a character decision. I just really love this play narratively.

Every sex scene should fade to black so no one got dumb ideas about how to be sexy.Okay, before we get started: three stars means I liked it. I use the GR rating system pretty harshly, and this was definitely good - just not good enough to be a four. See, it's not really a fault of the book - it's just that this was far less funny to me than her other romcom-ish books. Sense of humor is a very subjective thing, and the truth is, Lillis has always got mine with her funny dialogue. Her reliance on secondhand embarrassment? Not as much a fan.And you know what the chief problem is, for me? The lack of funny dialogue. Lillis' earlier Mechanical Hearts and later A&B are both excellent chiefly because the dialogue keeps you laughing. There's a funny conversation every two pages. But this one? Nah. Instead, most of the humor here relies on funny plot moments - I.e., secondhand embarrassment. J.C. Lillis is usually pretty good at absurd humor, which means she's also talented at making cringeworthy moments amusing. Yet here, a few scenes stuck out as more horrifying than funny; the inhaling-disgusting-gas scene was especially nasty. It feels as if Lillis is trying to get more serious, and it's fine, but it also removes exactly what I adored so much about her other two books. She pictured herself decaying with Riley in Puckatoe—or living with him in California, dreaming of the life she gave up, resenting his happy chatter about iridescent tiles and surfing lessons. She imagined their catastrophic breakup fight, the “we’ll still be friends” resolution they’d never be able to keep. She thought of a lifetime of awkward Woodlawn family reunions, the raw ache in her throat when she’d smell Tidal soap or hear a Modern Shirts song, the deadlines she’d blow ten years from now when Riley’s cute bohemian wedding invitation arrived in the mail and she’d stay in bed for three days with a bag of donuts and a giant box of tissues. There was no end to the hurt they’d cause each other. They’d invent new ways with each passing year—without meaning to, without even staying side by side.I feel bad for having this many issues, because truly, this is quite a good book. Leads Riley and Rachel are both quite compelling, and their relationship is easy to invest in; Lillis has you rooting for them within a few chapters. I tend to really despise the grew-up-like-siblings trope, but it's done very well here; they didn't meet until they were each around ten, and essentially thought of each other as BFFs rather than siblings till the end. VERDICT: A solid book, just not one that stands out like her other two.

And if I could have I would have broken the entire length of my life across her face, but instead I screamed back, And this is how you treat your daughter?This book is about the legacy of colonialism. Call it what you will - Diaz calls it fukú, the Dulles brothers called it profit, and most U.S. government officials of our current time call it nothing at all. But make no mistake - it's a legacy of brutality. I'm not going to go into a symbolism analysis here, but I think it's fairly clear that fuku is directly linked to Trujillo and his dictatorship. Junior's toxic masculinity, Oscar and Lola's self-hatred, all the characters' lack of agency over their own bodies... it's all connected to colonialism's legacy. Diaz is undoubtedly quite skilled, and I adore his ideas about the world. But I did not adore this book. // SYMBOLISM... OR LACKING SUBSTANCE?Ultimately, I don't think this book does lack substance - I think the substance is buried very, very deep. Too deep.The thing is that Oscar Wao was originally a novella that was extended into a full book and, unfortunately, you can feel it. In this six-chapter book, one of the chapters was essentially exposition on the family background and was far longer than it needed to be. Abelard's chapter could've easily been shortened. There were times when I felt Diaz was only repeating his ideas over and over. It was as if he felt uncomfortable adding new material to his novella, so he simply repeated concepts he already had. This book needed more. Or possibly the same amount and less pages. Or possibly just more actual conclusion to certain themes. Maybe the real issue here is that sections of the book got bogged down by symbolism. I like symbolism too, and Diaz built it very well - it just felt as though he could've gone further with the characters if he had stopped clinging to the symbolism. Perhaps it's preferences, but I will always take characters over symbolism. Now, I have no problem with symbolism, yet it got far too convoluted and truly wasn't meaningful until the end. One of those extra chapters in particular didn't contribute meaningful character work at all. What it DID do was emphasize elements of setting and symbolism that were already established in other chapters, but wow, it got repetitious fast. If each chapter were briefer, the book would've been far more powerful. // YOU CAN'T ENJOY IT WITHOUT OVERANALYZINGThis is the main problem with the book - you can't enjoy it without understanding the symbolism and overanalyzing it.I also thought it was interesting that the only time the book made me cry was because I read an article explaining some of Diaz's thoughts. I would highly recommend giving this a read around 200 pages into the book, as long as you don't mind spoilers, because there are some super powerful sections. That interview single-handedly made this book go from a bad read to a good read. Unfortunately, it improves the book because it adds things to the text not in the text. But here's the thing: those things he said should have been a part of the book. His extracanonical thoughts add deeper meaning to the symbols, to the characters, to everything. Yet as he admits in the interview, all these thoughts were ""just his interpretations"". The book would've been far more emotionally hard-hitting if he'd put those ideas explicitly into the book; some of his thoughts about Yunior's backstory especially deserved a place in the light. // GENDER ISSUES: CRITIQUING VS. ROMANTICIZINGme trying to figure out whether Diaz realizes that Oscar is the horny I've-just-been-friendzoned dude we all know and hate:[image]I have a ton of issues with this in terms of how it plays with gender!!! It's not a coincidence that, as my AP Lit teacher stated, women overwhelmingly like this book less than men. Through Yunior's character, Diaz does a good job criticizing hyper masculinity in the Dominican culture and show how it isn't the fault of a people, it's the fault of colonialism and Trujillo. This aspect of the book is pretty well-executed. While it's not explicitly stated that Yunior's behavior is negative, it's fairly clearly framed as bad by the narrative. But... it doesn't work. Because holy shit, Oscar Wao is the literal embodiment of every sexist friendzoned nerd dude out there, and the narrative romanticizes the shit out of it. I am not saying Diaz necessarily thinks of Oscar as not being sexist, but... I can't tell. If I read this as a sexist dudebro, this would be the most validating book in the world.I have, at this point, read enough interviews with Diaz that I don't believe this was at all his intention. But the fact remains that it took me reading three separate Diaz interviews in which he praises women writers of color to decide that the dude ISN'T incredibly sexist and DOESN'T have huge problems with women. That's not good. Especially when we consider death of the author as a factor. Here's the thing: I would totally think Junot Diaz had massive issues with women, and especially women of color, from reading this book alone.Still, I keep coming back to the relative impunity with which the men in This Is How You Lose Her get to behave badly, and to the tone of the critical reception to these stories, which are not only stories but confessions, lamentations of wrongdoings. We have all been influenced by a culture where women are considered inferior to men and I would have loved to see what a writer of Diaz’s caliber might do if he allowed his character to step out of the vacuum he grew up in and that we all still live in. - Roxane Gay, How We All LoseI think Gay's essay How We All Lose really sums up my feelings on this book, despite being about one of Diaz's other works. It's not that this book portrays flawed characters; it's that this book barely narratively acknowledges their faults. // SOME FINAL THOUGHTS AND GOOD ENDINGSThis was going to be a three at most and then... the ending came. and I started physically crying. that last scene. I am a MESS. How do I recover from this. I gotta say I have problems!! but there's a part of me that loved it anyway and I'd like to physically fight Junot Diaz now because this was.... a lot. wow. VERDICT: So much symbolism that you can't enjoy it without spending a huge amount of time considering it and reading outside material on it. It may or may not be worth the time. Depends on you.

While I think Whalen Turner occasionally relies too much on not letting you into the head of a character so she can execute a plot twist, we still get an excellent look into these characters, a view that feels dimensional if perhaps not full. The other thing I liked about this book is something I knew I would — political intrigue. Whalen Turner does such a grand job with the power moves, the wars, the intrigue of it all. This one is narratively all over the place, but it is made to work. It feels like a wide story rather than an incoherent one. The plot twists and plot reveals are consistently interesting and often surprising. I also love that the two lead female characters we get in this book are both such powerhouses. And hey, maybe it’s time to talk about badass girls — Attolia and Eddis both make for such excellent political leaders, each in their own way. This book may be led by Eugenides, but I think it’s more about Attolia and Eddis and the power in different kinds of strength. Attolia has lost sight of that in her own power, her own life of ruthlessness. The Queen of Attolia is basically a takedown of the idea of petty competition between women and the idea that there’s only one way to be strong for a queen; Attolia and Eddis contrast so wonderfully. And oh my god, my favorite part of this whole book was Attolia. She is such a good antivillain. We start out seeing her as a complete and total villain, and end seeing her as a very well humanized antihero. Her redemption arc — or, to be more specific, reframing arc — is the best part of this book, and absolutely worth reading for. I mean, I like Eugenides too. He's a mess and a delight. But mostly I’d die for her. Something I did think was missing for me was my investment in the first half of the book; we’re basically thrown into a political situation we only got a glimpse of in book one, and it’s difficult to really get invested in the world and the characters. I also think a few of the plot twists are kind of easy to guess and the time between them too extended. I wished for less lagging between the big moments and big twists. But: I think the conclusion completely makes up for it. This book aged fantastically in my mind; I read this in April and it's August and I'm still thinking about how much I adore this specific book.

Trash heap that ruined the book for me.Let’s talk. The first half of this book was - honestly - excellent. You can read a thousand s talking about it, so I’ll keep it short. The writing is honestly stunning, much better - in my opinion - than Gillian Flynn or Paula Hawkins’ styles. I had no clue where the mystery was going. And the lead characters, Rob Ryan and his partner / best friend Cassie Maddox were super compelling - and no romance, bonus point! I especially adored Cassie fucking Maddox; her backstory with a friend from college honestly broke my heart. All the ingredients for a perfect book. Maybe even a five. I like the characters and I like the writing, so I should have liked this book, right?I am going to try to explain this as spoiler-free [and what spoilers exist are noted] as possible: the ending of this book is maybe one of the most unsatisfying things I have ever read in my whole life. I am not kidding when I say it was such total trash that it ruined the whole book for me. Not. One. Thing. Is. Resolved. Rob Ryan’s character arc? Flop. My wife Cassie Maddox’s character arc? Long sigh. My favorite pair of besties? I don’t want to talk about it. Mystery? Fine, sort of chilling, but also 1) not really a mindfuck and 2) has shitty connotations. The commupence? Non-ex-is-tent. And the worst part? The mystery from twenty years ago that causes this entire fucking BOOK and that was way more interesting than the normal mystery? Literally no fucking resolution. Who did it? How did they do it? What is up with that hair clip in the forest and the blood inside Rob’s shoes? NO ONE FUCKING KNOWS. I’m sure this is framed in the minds of many readers as some kind of deeper meaning about memory. You know what I thought, honestly? Tana French wrote herself into a corner with a fucking ridiculous case and then ran out of time on her deadline and decided to leave it open. How not to write a decent crime book 101. And…….. so the only actual thing that is wrapped up is the current case, which is the only thing in this entire goddamn book that wraps up and I still don’t like it. It’s tagged. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. (view spoiler)[I sort of despise the connotations of a girl pretending to be a rape victim to manipulate her boyfriend into killing someone. Like, it's creepy, but we currently live in a culture that assumes women are liars, and this just plays the fuck into it. (hide spoiler)]And also, there is so much weird misogyny. I’m chalking this up to “this was written in 2006” but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t care. Rosalind is the epitome of an I’m Not Other Girls character to the point where she actually says that line. And Cassie’s ending… is so shitty. Again, MAJOR SPOILER: (view spoiler)[she marries a man she has never shown interest in so our lead character can cry a little bit. (hide spoiler)] Because what’s the point of a female character if they’re not contributing to the manpain?The two stars rather than one is a reflection of me loving the beginning.

Out, out, brief candle!Life's but a walking shadow, a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stageAnd then is heard no more: it is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.This is a weird weird book. And maybe not in a good way. But let's be real - there are parts of this novel that I deeply powerfully loved on a level that I have not felt with 75% of literature. And I respect that. [This  took me three hours to write. Please validate me.]The Sound and the Fury is split into four sections. There’s the confusing-but-super-cool-to-analyze Benjy section, which skips time with no warning and throws you into 400 different moments that don’t really make sense and makes you really empathize with Benjy [I’m so sorry Benjy]. There’s the probably-my-favorite Quentin section, which is compelling because besides Benjy, Quentin and Caddy are the only white characters in this whole book I don’t want dead. There’s the Jason section, which I fucking hate because it’s boring and all about the two worst characters in this book and that one underdeveloped character I should like, with occasional Dilsey cameos and a couple of entertaining instances of Miss Caroline Getting Dragged [iconic]. And then there’s the still-about-the-two-assholes I-thought-it-would-be-my-favorite-and-then-it-wasn’t I-still-love-you-Dilsey Dilsey section. And then, for added bonus, the summary of all the people in this book section that ruins my until-then-valid interpretation of Caddy’s character and is really only worth reading for the one PAGE on Luster and Dilsey. I wish I had not read the second half of this book. Sighs.But okay, ignoring the confusing bits, and the fact that none of it really makes very much sense [Faulkner is a brilliant writer but also a demon] this is a really interesting and brilliant novel about the demise of the South, and especially the demise of Southern whitehood.→ Benjy and the Benjy section ←I don’t know if Faulkner intended for me to like Benjy this much but I honestly don’t care. Benjy is described as a “manchild” on a lot of descriptions for this book, as those around him believe he has the mind of a child. He doesn’t. Benjy, though he doesn’t understand much of what is going on around him, in some ways understands more than anyone gives him credit for. But no one tries to understand. No one tries to communicate. No one except for Caddy and Dilsey even makes the barest attempt to understand him. [This is why Caddy and Dilsey are the only two characters I like.]I mean, it’s a 1930s-style depiction of mental disability, don’t get me wrong. I don’t know if I like that mental illness is used as a stain on the family line [to be fair, the message is a lot more complicated and nuanced than that]. But I also... found it really interesting. Also, I hated this section upon first reading it too. You’re valid. You’re okay. Here’s the how-to: every time a time-switch occurs, draw a line across the page. Then once you finish the section, reread and try to figure out the timelines. I assigned clumsy year guesses to everything and I was right about like, half of them. And yes, I’m aware that sounds awful, but listen, that was the most fun I had in my whole annotating life. And you can also always go here for reference. Although it does spoil stuff like how the Quentin section ends, so I’d maybe wait until you at least finish that to go through this link?→ Quentin and the Quentin section ←The thing I like [/ hate / find heartbreaking] about this section is the profound tragedy in Quentin and Caddy and Benjy’s fate. These are three people who, all in their own way, are victims of the South’s obsession with appearances. Quentin is obsessed with the appearance of virtue within his family and with how Caddy has destroyed that, yet he takes all her agency in making those decisions within his inner narration. Caddy is desperate to hide her sin at all costs, even when it means ruining her life. The family is desperate to hide the shame of having Benjy. The family is desperate to hide themselves. And in the course of this, they destroy themselves.If you look at this book in a cynical light, Quentin is meant to symbolize the death of the Southern planter generation. But in a more nuanced light, he’s not - his father is. Quentin is the product of the Southern planters, the product of constant worries about time and honor and appearance and how to preserve them as they quickly disappear. He would rather die than fail to preserve this construct. He would rather die than be without his sister, who - despite some pretty twisted elements of their relationship - he genuinely loves and who genuinely loves him back. He is torn apart by losing her. Since I think she’s the most on-display here [and in the Benjy section], let’s talk about Caddy. Caddy is fantastic. An icon. An intellectual. I love her. She’s literally the only character in this book who isn’t a dick to Benjy, Quentin, OR Dilsey, and thus is automatically my favorite. She’s a character who goes through a lot of shit during this book and somehow manages to be easy to empathize with in every moment. Here's how I read her: she is doomed to rebel against the constructs of the South and she knows it and she dooms herself again to conforming of the constructs of the South, to marrying off and losing her life and dooming her brother and Benjy all at once, because she feels she has no other choice. But then she is divorced. And then she is free.[Except that one moment during the ending that I just… don’t claim, as it doesn’t make any sense. Of course, this is coming from the man who tried to interpret his book’s timeline twenty years after reading it and was literally incorrect, so why am I surprised?]→ Jason and the Jason section ←Jason’s section begins with the line “once a bitch, always a bitch, I says” which is funny because that’s exactly what I think about him. I hate this man so much. I am trying to push it down to accurately interpret and  this novel but I literally would write an AP-level analytic essay entirely to call Jason a dick and he would totally deserve it.Yeah, anyway. Jason is another archetype of Southern white manhood - he is a narcissistic, self-victimizing, and hypocriticial player of the stock market. He is a thief because he believes he deserves the money. And he is someone who, without failure, believes that he is the victim of the city people - and he might be right. Maybe? Who knows. But either way, The Dick Compson is a product of his upbringing by an awful mother and always feeling like the shafted one in comparison to older siblings Quentin and Caddy. And I hate to admit that I also didn’t care that much. Jason, you fucking asshole.Also, there’s something so hilarious to me about widely read acclaimed author William Faulkner using a daddy kink to villainize a character. Acclaimed writers: they're just like us.We’ve mentioned the awful mother, so let’s talk about one character whom I have little to no sympathy for - Ms. Caroline. Oh my god. I fucking hate this woman so much. Let’s just take a look at one specific scene in this book - a scene in chapter four, where she believes girl Quentin has committed suicide. And responds like this: ➽“At least she would have enough consideration to leave a note. Even Quentin did that.” [Because obviously, this is the response of any caring mom when they notice that their grandchild has committed suicide. Duh.]➽ “What reason did Quentin have? It can’t be simply to flout and hurt me. Whoever God is, He would not permit that. I’m a lady. You might not believe that from my offspring, but I am.” [I don’t really have to say it, do I? But this is a bit of a narcissistic response to your child being dead. Also, I support your children in all their nonexistent efforts to flout and hurt you.]Caroline is a weak-willed, selfish, emotionally manipulative, and self-victimizing person, one who I dislike with a fiery passion. Yet I'll admit that she is also emblematic of post-bellum Southern white womanhood - obsessed with appearances and caring more for the appearances of the suicides than the suicides themselves, weak-willed because she knows she has no power. She's a tragic figure and a tragically awful figure.Let’s also talk about that one character I really think I should like and I just don’t - Quentin. Yeah, no, not brother Quentin. Spoiler spoiler spoiler Quentin who confused you in section one. She is so woefully underdeveloped, guys, and it is really obvious in a book that up until now has been so nuanced in its portrayal of each character, so harsh but so understanding. It pains me to admit this, believe me, but Jason and Ms. Caroline both have a lot of depth - hateful depth, but depth nonetheless. Quentin… just doesn’t make sense. She doesn’t read real to me. I know she’s selfish, but I don’t understand it. Caddy and Dilsey are kind to her but she cares nothing for either of them - why? I found her to be an overall weak character and disappointing addition to an otherwise fantastic book. I don’t know if you can tell, but I was not a fan of this section. It’s basically three assholes being assholes to each other. Poor Benjy and Dilsey. → Dilsey and the Dilsey section ←The thing I like and appreciate about this section is that the literal thesis of it is “southern white people are awful and southern black people are going to outlive them.” Which is… really not the thesis I expected from a book written by a Southern white dude in the 1930s. But sort of the most badass thesis of all time. The thing I did not like about this section is that Dilsey is not in it enough. I kind of liked watching Jason get fucked over, but I would’ve preferred more Dilsey, ya know? The moment of this section I liked the most was that moment in which Luster basically says the 1930s version of “white people are crazy” and sums up this entire book in one sentence. Anyway, I guess the thesis of this  is I kind of like Faulkner. I like that Faulkner clearly remembers his childhood in the South fondly and also recognizes the toxicity of his society. I like that he writes both in homage and in despair. I like the nuance of thought displayed here. And I like that I cried reading this at once point. And here is what will stay with me, about this book, years from now: it is what happens to a family after a life of giving themselves away for honor, for dignity, and about the power in enduring. It is tragic and beautiful and one of the most powerful things I have ever read.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Feb 27, 2018","Mar 27, 2018","Jun 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10975.The_Sound_and_the_Fury

And I want to reread the whole duology now.So, first of all, Gentleman's Guide To Vice and Virtue was one of my favorite books of last year, and I was really worried this would not live up to it. And it… was missing some of the best qualities of book one, but then had even more new stuff that was better. I will say I think I also was not that scared that everything would turn out all right? like, you know from the beginning that Felicity will turn out all right with her dream just in a different way than expected. and that didn’t make the journey less fun but I guess... there was a lack of tension in the narrative.So no, I didn’t love this on the same level as I loved Gentleman’s Guide, but they’re both very solid books in their own right, and this one does an excellent job of not being fanfiction of the previous novel, but an excellent novel in its own right. all of these new characters have solid arcs and their own personalities and it basically reads like a stand-alone with these two random side characters, not like a direct sequel, which is lovely.]But then there’s so, so much to like about this book. Felicity Montague really did that (found fulfillment in her own life without needing a romantic relationship but with two very close gal pals she loves very much and would die for)Seriously, Felicity Montague’s character arc is so freaking exciting to me, on so many levels. Felicity being acearo and it not being questioned by the narrative at all!! And her having a goal and working so hard to achieve it, the whole book long, because girls can do anything. But she also gets the chance to grow and change and work through her own problematic mindsets.So first of all, I love the entire arc around the not-like-other-girls trope. Can I just say, it is so refreshing to see a book powered by women being friends with each other. The whole arc around Felicity getting over her not like other girls shit with Johanna is so! perfect! It is so refreshing that we get this arc – as you start the book, you sort of think you know what you expect from Johanna, especially in a comedy like this. But no, this book is more concentrated around something far more interesting: the girl gang. The girl gang dynamic at the end is so! perfect! I honestly wish there was more. In general, I really liked that Mackenzi Lee doesn’t shy away from the fact that her lead characters are of a privileged viewpoint. This comes in multiple shades. First of all, there is a lot of focus on Felicity working through her internalized homophobia, which is something that was definitely present - and highly annoying - in book one. But there’s also another shade to this: the narrative around colonialism. So I adored how this book deals with colonialism in a historical setting. It’s great to see unveil, so I’m being vague, but I really loved all the stuff about Sim and her family. They are trying to keep the natural resources of their home safe while also trying to be a part of a global economy that wants them to fail from the start. Sim’s character, by the way? A sapphic hijabi girl? Talented. Brilliant. Incredible. Amazing. Showstopping. Spectacular. In her ignorance, Johanna initially wants to take a role in the world of a colonizer. But the narrative is so quick to criticize those viewpoints, to depict them as wrong and awful [as they are]. And in the end, they have to realize that their white, European experience is not the only one in the world, and they don’t always have the answers. They are not always the saviors in their narrative, and that’s okay. Felicity and Johanna have a right to a role in the world as powerful women… but not in the capacity of colonization and appropriation. That’s Sim’s role, and she will kick ass within it.Listen, it’s just… so fucking good, like so fucking good. I enjoyed reading this so much. Love that “acearo medical student goes on journey with her sapphic hijabi pirate friend and her more-feminine botanist friend” is a thing that I can enjoy in current literature. And I don’t know why you guys have to ask this so much, but yes, there are liberal Monty and Percy cameos. [Was that a question? That shouldn’t be a question. I love them and I would die for them.] Anyway, I absolutely adored this, and I can’t wait to read more by this author.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,463,1,"Jul 14, 2018","Jul 14, 2018","Jun 13, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37880094-the-lady-s-guide-to-petticoats-and-piracy

It is a terrible thing that she loves herself.”I’m rereading this for class guys it’s totally so my writing on this series can be perfectly informed and not at all just because I feel like it. And the verdict? This is everything to me. I talked about what makes this series special thematically a lot in my  for The Fifth Season. I genuinely think the core of this series, the thing that makes it so impactful, is how it talks about oppression. The racism experienced by orogenes leads to an internalized fear of the self, an internalized desire to punish the self. As The Obelisk Gate begins, the world is continuing to end. Essun is in the comm of Castrima, one where orogenes are accepted. Nassun is journeying with her father to a town that promises to cure her. And Schaffa is falling victim to something in his head, something only Nassun can help to heal. There is such a thing as too much loss. Too much has been taken from you both - taken and taken and taken, until there's nothing left but hope, and you've given that up because it hurts too much. Until you would rather die, or kill, or avoid attachments altogether, than lose one more thing.➽Essun's combination of mental strength and occasional moments of tenderness compel me to such a degree. I love her drily sarcastic inner monologue. Something of her is warped out of true by this moment, and from now on all her acts of affection toward her father will be calculated, performative. Her childhood dies, for all intents and purposes. But that is better than all of her dying, she knows.➽Nassun, Essun’s daughter, is my favorite character from this series. Through The Obelisk Gate, she’s forced to learn to be manipulative, to play the emotions of her father and so many others. Additionally, Nassun’s relationship with her mom is something that I can only describe as deeply paining me - the depiction of passing on of generational trauma through their relationship breaks my heart, and is done with such sensitivity towards both characters. Her character development is so brilliant on so many levels. “Perhaps,” Schaffa tells her as she sobs these words. “But you are my monster.”➽Schaffa, the third and final point of view character, is a villain from the first book who is weirdly sympathetic here. There’s a lot of talent in creating a villain here who is still the villain, decidedly not an antihero, but gains sympathy and humanization through his relationship with Nassun. God, I like… despised this character in book one and now I’m out here being extremely invested, but still hating him, and it’s really great. “I want to keep telling you this as I have: in your mind, in your voice, telling you what to think and know. Do you find this rude? It is, I admit. Selfish. When I speak as just myself, it's difficult to feel like part of you. It is lonelier. Please; let me continue a bit longer.”➽Hoa is a being whose sweetness persists, even as the world has tried to rip and carve it away over years over years. “Alabaster... this has always been his way. The surprise gesture, the backhanded compliment that you could choose to take for teasing or an insult. You've hardened so much without this. Without him. You seem strong, healthy, but inside you feel like he looks: nothing but brittle stone and scars, prone to cracking if you bend too much. You try to smile, and fail. He doesn't try. You just look at each other. It's nothing and everything at once.”➽Alabaster and Essun's relationship is easily one of the most compelling aspects of a book full of aspects which make me incredibly crazy. Lovingly, I can say no more time because I will genuinely start going crazy. “Don’t rust it up, Essun. Innon and I didn’t love you for nothing.”I sort of jokingly described this book on my twitter as Essun And Her Gay Friends Try To Survive The Apocalypse They Caused, a description I stand by. Tonkee, the science nerd who loves to make bad decisions, is one of the funniest and most endearing characters in this book. Ykka, a complicated but fantastic leader. Lerna, a kinder man than he should be. And Antimony, a complex character still impossible not to let your mind follow. N.K. Jemisin is extremely talented at building a compelling world [though the extremely bare map does occasionally frustrate me] but focusing on a specific narrative in a way that makes the world feel simply like a natural part of the novel. She did a podcast interview on the Ezra Klein show where she talked about worldbuilding as an iceberg - one where 90% would never be seen. I don't think I truly understood what makes this world feel so natural until listening to that podcast. There are so many tiny details of past lives, past emperors, past Seasons, that are never explained - they serve the purpose of making this world feel lived in, a long-term entity. The empty parts of history also often fill as time passes, as a part of conveying to the audience the degree to which the history of The Stillness has been forgotten as an intentional tool of oppression. It's really quite brilliant. “The way of the world isn’t the strong devouring the weak, but the weak deceiving and poisoning and whispering in the ears of the strong until they become weak, too.”I did not totally get this book when I first read it at seventeen (I gave both The Obelisk Gate and The Stone Sky four stars). Returning to it five years later, I think it is one of my favorite books I have ever read. I really need people to start talking about The Fifth Season again, because I really need to talk about Alabaster and Essun with someone before I physically start imploding and screaming and crying. You're all ignoring this very real threat by not reading this series.

Well, I didn't love this from the very beginning. Towards the beginning, I found the formatting slightly annoying. Some poems were fantastic and new and interesting, but some almost made me snort from their cheesiness. At times I feel Amanda Lovelace got so caught up in sounding profound she forgot the true emotional core of her poems. For example, saying “we were crafted from ocean waves and starlight” looks pretty, but means nothing when you think about it.Towards the second third, though, she hit her stride. I liked her poetry far more when it felt like a coherent stretch, a long length of feeling flowing from left to right across page after page. Her three-word poems did nothing for me. But God, some of the longer poems almost made me cry. The sheer emotional weight of section II's poems is amazing.sticks and stones never brokemy bones,but wordsmade mestarve myselfuntil you couldsee all of themI also appreciated the intersectionality of the feminist themes presented here.

Let me say that first. Don't write this off because of the zombie-book think, or the dystopia thing. And don't add it because you like zombie books, either. I don't think I'd class this as a dystopia. So why should you read this? This is going to sound weird, but I think you should read this if you like And Then There Were None-esque suspenseful mysteries where you trust no one. There's the same character-driven goodness and desperate suspense, making you rush through the entire book in one sitting. I've split this into two sections, one for each strong aspect of the book. Let me know if you prefer this or my normal style!!/ OUR PROTAGONIST /I run my hands over my body, feeling out my bruises without being able to see them, and I think about what Rhys said, how we're not made of anything. I wonder if my father felt the same way about me, Lily. Maybe once he realized it the first time, he wanted to realize it over and over because it made him feel like he was made of something.Sloane is not your typical horror novel protagonist. Um. Why? you ask, shaking your heads. What is so fucking special about this random zombie book girl? Well. Sloane is depressed and wants to die. She wants to die./ WRITING, ATMOSPHERE, AND TENSION /I'm trying to find a way to articulate exactly why I wished through this so quickly. And I really can't say why. What I can say is that I read the first two hundred pages in a single sitting without even realizing how far I'd gotten. The writing here is so eerie and atmospheric. I think Courtney Summers' writing speaks to me especially because it feels very similar to how I write - the overuse of commas to add atmosphere just speaks to me on at least eighty levels and tugs at all three of my feelings. I think the other suspenseful aspect was to do with the aspect of trying-to-figure-everyone-out. This is where the book resembles And Then There Were None. This story goes far deeper and explores the reactions different characters have to trauma. I do think this story might have worked better in third person limited with multiple perspectives. I'll maybe write more on this later, but I think it would've brought up the suspense and the shock of all the plot twists. Maybe. / WAS IT ALL ENOUGH? /Maybe this is a matter of missed expectations, but I really expected more. There's value to this kind of small-scope story, but I wanted some kind of mind-blow at the end, some big twist, something different. And yet so much went unexplained. I didn't get it. If the ending had ended in a proper mindfuck of a twist explaining how the fuck the world got so bad, would this be a five star read? Probably. I also didn't find myself invested in any characters beyond Sloane. Again, this could've been helped by a longer multi-pov story. Feeling invested in only one main isn't the right scope for a horror story.I guess it just was a matter of mixed expectations. Definitely go into this for the tension and the main character, not for some kind of proper worldbuilding or a twist that mindfucks you backwards. VERDICT: Definitely a great book to pick if you're looking for a fast-paced, suspenseful read with memorable characters. I admit that I wanted a bit more, but this was a lot of fun.

A lot of the sentences are pretty awkward. This might be an unpopular opinion or something editors do, but can ya authors use contractions? When you don't use contractions, your dialog doesn't sound more sophisticated. It just sounds fake and ridiculous. Hear me out. If someone came up to me in casual conversation and said ""I am going to the park,"" I would think they were a pretentious asshole. Or possibly high. If you say ""I'm going to the park"" I wouldn't think anything beyond ""oh, you're going to the park."" Do you see what I'm saying? It's fake and it's stupid.Anyway, beyond the writing, it's fine. The characters aren't terrible, the romance is sweet, there are well-written family dynamics and all that. There's a significant lack of girl hate and slutshaming!! I have to admit that I was kind of expecting girl hate?? But no. There's actually a rich girl who becomes a true friend to Maddie. Also, there are a couple of good comments made by Maddie's love interest, the adorable Seth, about racism. I liked that!! It was a minor thing but I really liked it. And there's a popular er on this page who I finally unfollowed because she made a lowkey racist comment in her  about this, so... yay, I guess?Two things bothered me here. First of all, it's cliche. Obviously. But I really feel like this was cliche in a bad way. When I think of a good cliche story, I think of bed sharing and fake dating. Those are cliches, but they're fun cliches. This story is just... so cliche that everyone felt like a plot device.The other issue is Maddie's whole character-regression thing. I know this is a story meant to be about ambition and how wealth can corrupt you. I get that. I just don't really like how the whole plot was done. I get that she's rich now, but if you saved money your whole life, I feel like you'd think about it a little more. Fine, people are different. All I can say is Maddie's throwing-around-money started pissing me off quickly. Kasie West wrote it in a fairly realistic and sympathetic way, but I felt like the person yelling at the horror movie characters to not be idiots. Fancy dinner is one thing, but it was so obvious the car and the yacht was all going to go wrong. But I can't even really complain about this, because this book was so clearly not for me to analyze!! It's not meant to be serious or high-quality. It's a fun YA contemporary story. She churns out three per year. Hopeless romantics will enjoy it maybe more than me.

Reading it again in 2019, after readWhen I first read Binti in 2017, I enjoyed it fine, but I don’t think I understood it as being particularly Good. Reading it again in 2019, after reading far more fantasy and science fiction (and a significant amount of postcolonial literature), I think I got a lot more from these 85 pages. Binti is a young black woman on her way to the premier institution in the galaxy; her people, unlike their sometime-rivals sometime-allies the Kush, almost never leave. She has broken this tradition (an absolute first-generation college student) through being extremely smart, and she has done something perhaps more revolutionary: she has chosen to take her chance and leave home. Though her parents love her, they don’t approve of her choosing to go somewhere where she will not continue their traditions. She knows from the time she leaves that she may very well be disowned. She herself isn’t entirely confident either; she self-doubts multiple times in the first twenty pages, despite her joy. On her journey to her new university, however, her ship is attacked by a race known as the Meduse. These creatures are murderous, of course, but Binti, and the audience, eventually learn to look at them with empathy. Their stinger has been stolen and placed in a Kush museum, in something akin to the colonial appropriation perpetuated by the British museum today. The Meduse have been violated, and thus they want to recapture and reclaim their lost territory.The growth of the friendship between Okwu and Binti is at the center of Binti — and the ensuing novella series, though to a lesser degree — and though it forms due to necessity, the strength of this relationship comes in their mutual understandings of each other. Their hair, like her hair, is considered alien; their bodies, like hers, are considered other. Their friendship is always what resonates with me the most when thinking about this series. Binti’s journey, however, is what is most revolutionary about this book. Instead of following traditions, she breaks boundaries; she has a place in the universe, and yet she steps out into a whole new world. In a subversion of the typical outsider-leaves-to-find-themselves narrative, she is not in any particular way an outsider to her initial community; she is simply brilliant and quietly ambitious and brave enough to risk all she has ever known for a future she hopes will be for her. Throughout the story, as a harmonizer, she must symbolically give up pieces of her old identity, yet she keeps her old rituals as a part of herself. Her strength comes in her ability to embrace both her old identity and her new identity and build herself into a whole person, stronger than ever. A black woman, and a young black woman, is front and center, and she is front and center because of her inner strength and her empathy. And that's just really neat. I really struggled to engage with this the first time around, something that I attributed to ""not liking novellas,"" which I thought I ""struggled to be engaged in before the end"". I am no longer a boring sad person who dislikes everything she doesn't get (I was 16, let me live) and I now love novellas. However, this problem of lacking engagement persists, and it is because of the lack of description. I love this world — the ideas of sentient ships and Oomza Uni both slap so hard — but I don't feel like I have any perception of what it looks like. I believe this must have been a purposeful decision for symbolic reasons, because it feels... very conscious. However, I did really like this on reread.

Not to offend our possible future robot overlords, but robots lack the gorgeous imagery or the delightful villainy of fairies. Come on, what's a story without some morally grey leads who delight in their evil nature? But it's not just about the fairies; it's about how my robot vs. fairy preferences reflect the type of stories I enjoy. I prefer my fantasy grounded in truth, grounded in the cores of humanity. I prefer Seanan McGuire's vision of fairies as humans who don't try to hide their moral blanks (Build Me Wonderland) and Alyssa Wong's vision of robots as reflections of our inner selves (All the Time We've Left to Spend). And while this was an enjoyable read with a few - two especially - fantastic stories, I unfortunately don't know if this anthology quite delivered the depth I wanted.My advice? Skip this one and just give McGuire and Wong's stories a try. You can find Alyssa Wong writing another masterpiece here if you're interested. Anthology s are my absolute favorite to write, and this one will be no exception. Here's the system this time: ♔ stories are about fairies, while ♚ stories are about robots. 🇸🇱 will be used for queer content - which this anthology really, really fucking needed - 🌃 to denote authors known to me previously, and 🍀 for my favorites. ♔ Build Me Wonderland by Seanan McGuire - ★★★★★ 🌃🍀Aesthetic! McGuire's most recent foray into short fiction is as amazing as expected. Her writing is stellar, her concepts are intriguing, her descriptions are gorgeous, and her worlds are compelling. Most importantly, she's fantastic at a certain sense of joy and hope for the future that I'm hard-pressed to find in other fairy or robot authors. author's note: interesting♚ Quality Time by Ken Liu - ★★★☆☆I appreciated the effort put into this exploration of unintended technological consequences and ethical consumption, but this story itself honestly felt rather pat to me. I saw the ending coming miles away. author's note: hilarious, clever, and very short♔ Murmured Under the Moon by Tim Pratt - ★★★☆☆ 🇸🇱I honest to god have no idea what was happening here. I loved the thematic ideas of having books be relevant to defense, and the idea of having a literal book girlfriend is clever. But it felt as if Pratt stopped after his initial clever idea and failed to perfect it. Also, definitely not as much moral blackness as I like from fairy stories. author's note: stellar meta about fairy-vs-robot fiction♚ The Blue Fairy's Manifesto by Annalee Newitz - ★★★☆☆This novella is a clever and interesting exploration of extremism vs. choice, but I honestly thought it wasn’t anything particularly new. Maybe robots just aren’t as much for me? author's note: explains the already-obvious connotations of her story, could’ve done more♔ Bread and Milk and Salt by Sarah Gailey - ★★★★☆This one is messed up. Following the conflict between robots and fairies explicitly, rather than simply focusing on one, it manages to bring the reader deep into the mind of a fairy trapped alone. It's strangely psychological and a read I definitely enjoyed. author's note: super interesting read♚ Ironheart by Jonathan Maberry - ★★★☆☆This is a story about the renewability of robots. I cannot really tell whether it's pro or anti robot, but I think the duality is frankly the only strength of Ironheart. While I loved the themes brought up about veterans' lives, I have to admit I found most of this sort of boring. author's note: made me doubt whether I even read the story correctly♔ Just Another Love Song by Kat Howard - ★★★★☆This is a story about agency. And not to be a parody of myself, but if you know me, you know that is my absolute favorite theme to explore and discuss. As an added bonus, I loved the morally black lead character of this story.author's note: too short♚ Sound and Fury by Mary Robinette Kowal - ★★☆☆☆Listen, not to anger our future robot overlords, but robots are sort of boring. Especually when they're going on diplomatic missions to ...somewhere? and drop so many pointless titles in the first minute that the reader feels like DNFing. author's note: why was it here♔ The Bookcase Expedition by Jeffrey Ford - ★★☆☆☆Yikes. I honestly just didn't get why this story was here. It felt boring, mostly.author's note: I guess I understand why this was written now?♚ Work Shadow/Shadow Work by Madeline Ashby - ★★★★☆Now THIS is a good robot story. And, sadly, the first one I've rated a full four stars. This one follows a mystical grandmother and her robot assistant, using their friendship to contrast viewpoints. author's note: but why♔ Second to the Left by Jim C. Hines - ★★★★☆This is a Peter Pan retelling using Tinker Bell is a villain, but at its core, it's an exploration of humanity through the fairy lens. I loved this so, so much. The main character had a super strong voice and the themes brought up were everything I love from fairy fiction. Well, besides the imagery. More imagery, please! author's note: brilliant, got highlighted all the way through♚ The Buried Giant by Lavie Tidhar - ★★★★☆Another good robot story! I'm not sure I totally understand this one, but the reverse Pinocchio is interesting and the themes around civilization's continued growth is amazing. ♚ Three Robots by John Scalzi - ★★★★☆This was hilarious. I’ve never read a Scalzi before, but if this is any indication, he’s a guy I’d love to meet. ♔ Ostentation of Peacocks by Lila Bowen - ★★★☆☆This was a pretty decent fairy story! The world building is imginiative and the writing is good. Unfortunately, I just wasn’t quite invested enough.♚ All the Time We've Left to Spend by Alyssa Wong - ★★★★★ 🍀🇸🇱🌃WE GET IT, ALYSSA, YOU'RE FUCKING TALENTED. (guys, if you haven't read her work before, please give it a try. This and Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers are two of the best works I've ever read. I'm literally begging you oh my god)♔ Adriftica by Maria Dahvana Headley - ★★★☆☆ 🌃 Lovely writing, but this story itself was sort of boring, with an obvious plot reveal and not much more intrigue. Enjoyed the retelling concept - wont say what as it’s a spoiler, but more can be done with fairies. ♚ To a Cloven Pine by Max Gladstone - ★★★★☆ 🌃 This confused the shit out of me but somehow I loved it. A Tempest retelling with robots and starring Caliban. ♔ A Fall Counts Anywhere by Catherynne M. Valente - ★★★☆☆ 🌃Some great ideas and imagery here, but a plot that totally bored me. ALL IN ALL: Despite reading one a night with Melanieand Destiny, I just never really got into this one. Aside from Alyssa Wong and Seanan McGuire’s contributions, none of this struck me.

And meh. While I'll be mentioning thoughts on each story separately, I would like to say a few words about the collection as a whole. First of all, this is more speculative fiction than fantasy. Barely any of these take place in a different world, and barely any have standard plots. Instead, with a few exceptions, most are brief ruminations on a certain topic. I have to admit, I found that element fairly boring. Many of these started fantastically and ended just blah. ♔ Hungry Daughters of Starving Mothers by Alyssa Wong - ★★★★★This one is basically terrifying. A girl uses Tinder to find dates and feed off their gross thoughts about her body. Yet on one date, she feasts off a murderer and becomes addicted. There's also a maybe-romance between her and her best friend. I adored this story, although I felt that the end fizzled a little. The writing and atmosphere is pitch-perfect, I adored the characters... just great. Probably my favorite of all the stories. You can read this here. ♔ Selkie Stories are for Losers by Sofia Samatar - ★★★☆☆This follows– um, I'm not quite sure, because this really didn't feel resolved or completed. I liked the writing and the atmosphere, but the execution of the storyline was mediocre. Also appreciate that both of the first two stories were both a little gay. ♔ Tornado’s Siren by Brooke Bolander - ★★★☆☆This follows a girl in love with a tornado. It's... weird. I love the idea, but I didn't emotionally connect with anything here. The magical realism feel is nice, at least. ♔ Left the Century to Sit Unmoved by Sarah Pinsker - ★★★★☆This is a slice-of-life about people living near a pond in their small town. I LOVED the beginning. Absolutely adored the writing, loved the themes, was so excited to see what the solution is. I thought this would blow my mind. It unfortunately didn't. These open endings have got to go. ♔ A Kiss with Teeth by Max Gladstone - ★★★☆☆It's a coming of age story, but with a really old vampire instead of a teen. I was honestly kind of surprised I enjoyed this, after I found the beginning badly written and slightly stalker-ish. But this quickly turned into an interesting story about accepting faults in love. I especially loved reading about Vlad and Sarah's little family. ♔ Jackalope Wives by Ursula Vernon - ★★★★★This is a story about wanting what you can't have and having what you can't want. It's... eerie. I feel like this will be polarizing, but I loved it. And yes, it is about jackalope wives. Go figure. ♔ The Cartographer Wasps and the Anarchist Bees by E. Lily Yu - ★★★☆☆I don't think I understood this? The themes about human empowerment are clear, but there's no thesis to it, I guess. It is very well-written. ♔ The Practical Witch’s Guide to Acquiring Real Estate by A. C. Wise - ★★☆☆☆Meh. I think I have to agree with Melanie when I say this was kind of pointless. It's a guide for witches building houses. ♔ The Tallest Doll in New York City by Maria Dahvana Headley - ★★★★☆This was so weird but so creative and atmospheric. It follows a group of buildings that are dating. I said weird, don't blame me. I don't even know if I understood all of it; is it time neutral or something? Yet I ended the story with happiness rather than with a desire for more. ♔ The Haunting of Apollo A7LB by Hannu Rajaniemi - ★★★★☆The first line of this story is freaking amazing; I actually planned to take a break from this collection until I saw the first line. And thankfully I really enjoyed this!! It's a story of lost love and dreams. Be warned it's far less creepy than its blurb. ♔ Here Be Dragons by Chris Tarry - ★★☆☆☆This follows a man who is always leaving his parents to make money off townspeople via slaying fraudulent dragons. I thought this was going to be some story of redemption after being a terrible father, but it's so... ugh. There's this vibe of “women are the right parents for children and men pitching in is just a bonus” which... no. I kind of enjoyed the middle of this story, but the end ruined it for me by going back on all the potential for character development. ♔ The One They Took Before by Kelly Sandoval - ★★★☆☆Maybe more of a 2.5, because I legitimately have no fucking clue what this is about. Nice writing though. ♔ Tiger Baby by JY Yang - ★★★★★This was so weird, and yet here I am with your latest five-star . Maybe a 4.5 in reality, but this fucked with my mind. This follows a girl who believes she is truly a tiger. The ending is just as odd as the rest, but I really enjoyed something about it. I'd like to analyze this one. I feel as if it will be quite hit-or-miss. And this will sound odd, but I appreciate the amount of stories in this collection with badass gay Asian girls as protagonists. ♔ The Duck by Ben Loory - ★★★☆☆This follows a duck who falls in love with a rock. I know what you're thinking - he's weird. An odd duck, if you will. But truly, that's the point. This story is truly about accepting your friends for who they are. It's a sweet theme and a sweet story. Unfortunately, I found this a bit lacking. The themes lacked the depth of development I wanted, due to the ridiculously short length. ♔ Wing by Amal El-Mohtar - ★★★★☆This is a story about how love should be accepting. Following a girl with a book around her neck, a girl with a secret, we see how love should come about. It's quite short, but I enjoyed this a lot. There are some fabulous and quotable lines in here. ♔ The Philosophers by Adam Ehrlich Sachs - ★★★☆☆This is a series of vignettes about fathers and sons. And no, there aren't any girl characters. Go figure. The first story is about generations trying to communicate and bad translating methods. The second story is about recognizing parental faults and hats. The last story isn't about fathers at all, it's about creating paradoxes through assassinating your relatives. But it was probably my favorite of all these. ♔ My Time Among the Bridge Blowers by Eugene Fischer - ★★★★☆This is a story about colonialism. Readers will be drawn to the themes and message of this, as well as the complex and intriguing worldbuilding. Why couldn't this be a full book?♔ The Husband Stitch by Carmen Maria Machado - ★★★★★I read this earlier due to Melanie's awesome recommendation. This is a story about being consumed by men and losing your own agency. It's a story about how much you can give before you break. And that's all I'm really going to say about it. This is one you really have to experience on your own. One thing is clear, though; it's worth the read. There were a few metaphors here I only understood on the second go due to sheer exhaustion, which is really upsetting - I feel like this would be my fave rather than my second fave otherwise. You can read this story here. ♔ The Pauper Prince and the Eucalyptus Jinn by Usman T. Malik - ★☆☆☆☆I'm going to be totally honest here - I hated this. It's really well-written, and I'm sure many will appreciate it if they “get it”. But I could not get past the length. This takes up an entire 25% of the story collection. Twenty. Five. Percent. That's not short. That's a 75 page story. And it didn't need to be so long!! This easily could've been twenty pages and fantastic, if a little confusing. Confusing short stories are fun and make you think. Confusing long stories are annoying. This was the latter. It's an overwritten mess that keeps touching on cosmology but doesn't make any sense.Comment below if you had any similar thoughts on these stories, or different ones!!Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,"Jul 21, 2017","Aug 05, 2017","Jun 06, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35910450-the-new-voices-of-fantasy

While it isn't the main strength of this novel, I'm also really intrigued by this story's worldbuilding.

Inspired by the trope of Women in Refrigerators, aka Women Getting Fridged For Manpain, The Refrigerator MonologueThis book is a parody and it’s not. Inspired by the trope of Women in Refrigerators, aka Women Getting Fridged For Manpain, The Refrigerator Monologues satirizes sexist tropes within media representation. And just like the trope itself, this book is weird as hell. It’s following a bunch of women in a literal deadtown, all becoming friends with each other and telling their own stories. It’s a story of solidarity between women, but in the end, a bit of an inconsistent one - this story’s main strength is as a parody. And unfortunately, as someone with not much knowledge of the specific source material - although plenty of knowledge of these tropes - I had trouble with a few stories that had ambiguous references and therefore lost the full message. My biggest problem here was the writing style. This book is written in a manner that is way too complex for the source material, which is essentially comic books. I know Valente is known for her writing, but something about it just felt odd to me more than anything else. Still, though, this book felt as if it were missing some fundamental something. I think this excellent  offers some of my thoughts, but I might add more to this  after the book has settled in my head. → Individual Story Reviews ←♔ Paige Embry based off Spiderman’s Gwen Stacy - ★★★★☆This story is about being the equal partner to begin with, the one who tries desperately to continue a full relationship with her partner even as he becomes something greater. ♚ Julia Ash based off X Men’s Jean Grey - ★★☆☆☆She keeps popping in and out of deadtown due to retconning. The concept of this is super meta and clever, but this did not captivate me at all. ♔ Pauline Catch based off Batman’s Harley Quinn - ★★☆☆☆uh. Well, this story didn’t was by far my least favorite. First of all, this story on audiobook was incredibly grating and difficult to listen to. But perhaps more important, I felt the author simplified Harley Quinn’s character, and especially her future development, to make a point. It felt like am oversimplification of basically one of two comic book characters I actually follow and I did not like it.♚ Bayou based off Aquaman’s Mera - ★★★★☆This is a story about being demonized for your own emotions. This mainy worked for me because I loved this character. Bayou is bitter and jaded and completely aware of her flaws, yet so effortlessly sympathetic. Despite my lack of idea of the source material, the tropes being subverted here still ring true. ♔ Daisy based off Daredevil’s Karen Page - ★★★★☆This story is about becoming the secondary, the one who stays at home, and how it can cause you to lose yourself. Daisy’s character is complex and intriguing, and I adored her arc. ♚ Samantha Dane based off Green Lantern’s Alexandra Dewitt - ★★★☆☆Oddly, despite this being about the original woman in a fridge, this story is about being the progression of anti-authority work to authority and fame. Yet I found the ending somewhat unsatisfying. → overall ← a satisfying collection, but I wanted a little bit more.

I’You can justify anything, if you do it poetically enough.this is going to be one of my favorite books of the year... almost definitely. I’m saying that now on January 26th because I want you all to know. I genuinely cannot remember the last time I found myself so utterly engaged in a book. Okay, so this is a drama set at a Shakespeare theater, in which a group of theater actors accidentally kill a man and deal with the fallout. Yay! Fun happy stuff. As the plays continue, their roles within this drama shift and switch, ironically mirroring their respective development, and they accidentally get way too involved in several plays as they are occuring. Dark academia is actually such a compelling and amazing genre to me, always, but Shakespearean drama is perhaps the best dark academia pick out there. We have moral intrigue!! long soliloquys!! everyone knows who he is, but he still has plenty of speeches no one knows!! gay subtext used to its best degree!! We cracked up. But we didn't really shatter until we came back together again.The seven lead characters each fit into well-known archetypes:→Oliver - the lacking-type boy.→James - the good guy. →Alexander - the villain.→Meredith - the sexpot. →Wren - the ingenue. →Phillipa - the lacking-type girl. bi. I have no proof but definitely bi. →Richard - the dick himself. The degree to which the character dynamics affect this plot is just so so amazing. There is a genuine actual love triangle, as in every branch has some weird tension. (Actually, I don’t know how to make a love dynamic of this friend circle. Help them.)I don’t really know how to describe what made this book so completely enthralling. This isn’t a book focused on plot twists; I figured out most of the plot points here, actually, aside from a couple mini reveals. Yet every plot point, whether guessed or not, is satisfying, placed perfectly and used perfectly. This is a Shakespearean tragedy and on some level, we know how it ends. But it is completely impossible to get off the tracks.“But that is how a tragedy like ours or King Lear breaks your heart—by making you believe that the ending might still be happy, until the very last minute.”And you know what, this book would have been a five no matter how it ended, but the ending made me screech out loud. So there’s that. I want to thank Chaima, Melanie, and  Aleksandra for encouraging me to read this, because honestly... dear god.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,1,1243,1,"Nov 22, 2018","Jan 26, 2019","Jun 02, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34275217-if-we-were-villains

I think this might be a case of the movie ruining it a bit for me... but also, I doubt I would've ever loved the movie as much if I had read this first. I read this from someone who’s read the book before: do not read the 20th-anniversary introduction. As someone who read it unwittingly I can confirm it’s fifty pages long and not good. Also, and I wish I had something better to say about this--the framing device is so obsessed with the fact that his son is fat and it gets really distasteful. It’s not even funny in the first place. I feel the same way about the Buttercup's Baby outro, which just felt like it ruined my childhood a bit (it kills off a character? I think temporarily? But it still kills off a character? It's also just still not funny?)I genuinely think without the intro and outro making me feel like I wanted to kill William Goldman I probably would've liked this a lot more. As it was, they just made me feel a weird sort of animosity towards the author, not for ruining his book but for thinking he's funny enough for me to read a 50-page backstory about him finding this book and reading to his son (who is fat, I don't know if you heard. did you know that?).Here are some things I did enjoy about this book:→The timeless feeling to the story→The feeling of the story within a story, the edited version of an obsessed-with-beauty fairy tale, is fun→Inigo Montoya you killed my father prepare to die is still iconic→Fezzik’s backstory!!

I knew all the themes and the places this book would go. Do you know how I knew everything? Because it's the exact same themes as The Graveyard Book. And Coraline. And probably some of his other books too. It's about letting go of your childhood. Which is cool. It's a good theme. But I can't read an entire book with no other appeal. I can acknowledge Gaiman is a great author. His imagery is pitch-perfect. Unfortunately, I don't know if that's really a good thing. If you've read this book, you know I'm talking body horror. The whole worm thing genuinely brought me one inch from DNFing this. Or dying, whichever came first. Don't read this if you're not a fan of body horror. Genuinely, do not. The whole thing honestly just felt like a repeat of The Graveyard Book, but with less compelling characters. Yes, there were some nifty twists, but I somehow didn't care about any of it.

Every Heart A Doorway, The Devil You Know, and now this. In Ageless Sleep follows two girls on the opposite sides of a war. Mal is an agent from the Reaches on a mission to hijack a Sovereign spaceship. Aurora, or Rory, is the daughter of one of the Sovereign Kings and Mal's kidnapping target for this mission. The strength of this little book is undoubtedly the character work. Most of the chapters are narrated by Mal, who is just the right balance of badass and angsty. If her character had been written with less care, she could've come off as tropey. But no - her emotions feel completely real. Arden Ellis does an especially great job of conveying Mal's loneliness, which makes all her decisions feel understandable. Rory, too, feels relatable; she's built mostly through her differences and similarities to Mal. And here lies this book's second strength: foils. For those of you who don't know, foils are characters who contrast each other in order to highlight their mutual characteristics. I am totally obsessed with foils and especially relationship-building between two characters who act as foils. The romance between Rory and Mal really got to me and was built very well, even in so few pages. Their relationship is just that enemies-to-relucant-allies trope that I'm so obsessed with. I also really enjoyed the writing style!! There's just something I really appreciated about the atmosphere and way this was written. All the sentences feel very polished without being overdramatic. This not to say that this is a perfect novella. I thought the POV shifts felt particularly unpolished and needed to be edited. In general, I also thought this novella could've been thicker and had more scope. Arden Ellis went for a very small scope in this book, and that's fine; it just would be nice to see more out of this world. I've recently begun to appreciate novella series like Every Heart A Doorway, for example. It would be nice to see even more out of this world. Just saying, Arden Ellis, in case you're ever planning on writing more :)VERDICT: Check this out if you're a fan of character-driven scifi, novellas, and well-written f/f romance!!

First, let me give some credit: this book was really hard to put down. The first half has a fabulous mood. I distrusted everyone, including January. There was no way of knowing who was lying about what January had said. I even questioned the main narrator's motivations!! I suspected every single character in the mystery to some degree. So for the first half, I was really feeling the potential of the mystery. That aspect, unfortunately, let me down. I really love when mystery books don't rely on red herrings, but show that many different characters did many different shady things. I hate when all the villainy is on one character, and I felt that happened too much here. The ending was a little underwhelming. There are one or two interesting plot twists, but nothing that turned me into a sobbing mess at 2 am. And 2 am me turns into a sobbing mess at everything. There's nothing bad about this mystery, just nothing particularly fabulous or standout either. There's another interesting aspect of this book I wanted to talk through. This is a coming of age about sexuality as well as a mystery. I really liked the coming-age-aspect; that being said, it wasn't anything I hadn't read before. I do really appreciate the existence of lgbtq characters in genre fiction, as I'm sure none of you will be surprised by, and I enjoyed the interactions between main character Flynn and his love interest, Kaz. They made a sweet couple. VERDICT: A terrifying first half led to a lukewarm second half and ending, but this was still a ton of fun to read, incorporating both coming-of-age and mystery.

It is with gladness in my heart that I say I was very engaged with this fantasy, following a world inspired by Greco-Roman slavery and two main characters from different sides. It is with a heavier heart that I say some aspects of it really were not hitting their marks. The best thing about this book is the entire idea behind Kestral’s character. Kestral is, possibly, the most non-archetypal strong female character I think I’ve seen in popular ya lit from this time period. Kestral is actively not a fighter and can’t hold a sword for shit. She is also, however, an incredible manipulator. She does it a lot. Successfully. At one point she does it to a terrible man she is fighting and it's by far the best scene in this book. I get very into mind games and it was this that held my attention the most. Were this book in a completely different setting and nothing but Kestral playing mind games I would have been obsessed and given it five stars do not @ me. Arin was a character I wanted to like so bad but his internal narration is just… deeply frustrating. I feel like when you have a main character who makes a lot of bad decisions, it needs to be justified with strong characterization. I felt like in comparison Kestrel was so much more complex, which is hilarious, because Arin is the character whose side I was rooting for way more in this. (He did grow on me over time.) And almost all of the side characters are instantly forgettable. Sorry, Ronan, the most transparent attempt at a good guy trope I’ve seen in years. The thing that I feel complex about is the issue of slavery. Let’s go through a few points. So, first off, slavery presents a power imbalance no matter what context it appears in. Having a romance between a master and a slave, no matter what the context, presents a huge power imbalance and arguably an automatically bad one. This is very clearly an allegory for Greco-Roman slavery, rather than chattel slavery, which are admittedly very different. (Were this an allegory for chattel slavery this romance would be genuinely disgusting do not pass go do not collect $500.) I think I feel similarly about this to how I feel about parts of An Ember in the Ashes: much as I know that no character plans to/ever threatens to violate boundaries, there’s a power dynamic between the main couple that means they could, and that in and of itself makes certain scenes uncomfortable rather than romantic. The conflict between the Hermanii and the Valori is handled in a manner that is at times good and at times sort of a mess. I liked that the conquered nation was in-text the peaceful, art-loving one and the conquering nation the ‘barbaric’ one. A lot more accurate to actual histories! I appreciated that though Kestral herself is xenophobic, the book criticizes her views heavily over time. I wished this had happened before any of the romance had taken place, as I genuinely could not get invested in a romance essentially between a xenophobe and the person she’s xenophobic towards. (Since we've brought up An Ember In the Ashes, I could not help mentioning that book avoids this particular crime, which is a huge difference.)There are some redeeming qualities, however, specifically in the second half of the book. First of all: (view spoiler)[halfway through the book, the book flips on its head, and Kestral becomes the oppressed, with Arin as the member of a conquering nation (hide spoiler)]. This was handled interestingly. (view spoiler)[The idea of turning all of Kestral and Arin’s power plays on their head is a good one. However, the book then becomes far more sympathetic to the Valorian cause than I would’ve expected, given they literally conquered and enslaved an entire people. Not to be like colonists bad, but colonists bad. Also, the Herrani's motivations get mildly dubious, which I thiiink is the point? (hide spoiler)]The thing is, we live in a very different context than the Greco-Roman period, with our own histories that make certain clearly not-badly-intentioned aspects of this book uncomfortable. And due to all of those different factors, I really struggled to get invested in this romance. At this point I’m invested enough in both of these characters to care anyway, but we’ll have to see where this goes. My final note on this book is that I kind of love the ending. (view spoiler)[I absolutely love the purposeful miscommunication to save someone’s life trope. I don’t know. I love it so much. (hide spoiler)] And I have also heard many times that in comparison to the other books this book is not quite as good. So I don’t know. Maybe second book good. I’ll at least give it a shot. Amazing how this  took me four months to write. I'm on catchup mode. I promise someday soon I will no longer be on catchup mode.

The one where he’d have to play a prince in a complete crap-fest of a misogynistic Disney-wannabe movie? Or the absurdly pseudo-intellectual one that subtly advocates for eugenics?”Under the Lights surprised me. This is a definite hidden gem in the world of YA romance! It's half character-driven f/f romance and half powerful character arc for a former asshole, all set in Hollywood. Adler is talented at writing characters you can quickly get attached to; I grew attached to Vanessa's character rather quickly, with her sarcastic wit and love for her friends. Her arc around sexuality is a 10/10 effort, and one I'm definitely going to remember. One way this book really succeeded was in writing a believable asshole->good boy character arc. See, most reformed-asshole character arcs in YA occur for guys that are romantic interests, which leads to a lot of their actions being excused or ignored by their girlfriends - and by the narrative. Adler avoids this completely by separating his character arc from any romantic inklings. In fact, there's not even a romance for Josh. I spent around half the book hating Josh, yet I still empathized with his actions and wanted him to develop. And the romance is SO. SWEET. Adler had me shipping Vanessa and Brianna from their first meeting, and their romantic chemistry was written so perfectly. Van's gay crisis is written about with such honesty and empathy on the part of the author; you can definitely tell this is ownvoices. And also, kudos for not having the bi character be the questioning and unsure-about-commitment one in the relationship— that's a trope I see a lot, and while not necessarily bad, I'm glad this book subverted that expectation. What's best about this book is that you'll find it enjoyable whether you like Hollywood or not. It's not a completely romantic take on the life of a Hollywood actress, and it does a far better job acknowledging that everyone's life has problems than many Hollywood-set books I've read. The acknowledgment of racism and homophobia and the importance of representation in acting was so important to me. I also loved the representation of the protagonist's lack of agency within the narrative; it's lovely to see that side of Hollywood life explored, while not being a woe-is-me-i'm-an-actress type book.

It's also meant to be a tragedy. Normally, this type of book does not work for me. Somehow, this one did. Perhaps my biggest problem with the “classics” genre is the immense focus on metaphor and writing, rather than on characterization. This isn't a complaint I had here. Nick, Gatsby, and Daisy all have solid characterization and dimension. Yes, even Daisy, and I'll honestly fight everyone who hates on her constantly. While I did feel that the characters were more props for symbolism than real people, they did get dimension. The themes here are also far more developed and interesting to dissect than in many classics. Trying to talk about the themes of All the Pretty Horses is boring and angering. Trying to talk about the themes here is actually interesting.Unfortunately, I DO think this book fits the category of “too much symbolism, not enough plot”. There's of course the fact that it's a surprisingly boring book for being so short. Moreover, I was slightly annoyed by the message itself.

This story follows thI fear her, yes, but I’ve never been loyal.4 1/2 stars, rounded up because I know for a fact this will stay with me. This story follows the Katazyrna family and the Bhavajas, trying to conquer the Mokshi, a world-ship with the power to take their family away from the Legion, a ship system – think a solar system where all the planets are actually orb-shaped ships – in which they are trapped, where cancer eats away at the ships and people must be recycled for the ships to live at all. Jayd and Zan have a plan to escape, to reach the center of the legion. But they have yet to convince their mother, Amat, of the rightness of what they’re doing. Worse yet, Zan has lost her memory and doesn’t trust Jayd at all. But Jayd has a plan. It’s a really complex concept, I know, but I actually found myself… not very confused by this book. At least after the first 50 pages. You will be super weirded out, but I don’t think you’ll be confused. The broad concepts here are so weird and different that it’s impossible to forget them.Perhaps that’s a good summary of this book - weird and different. I mean, okay, you thought my synopsis was weird? Their world is literally a human body and it eats other human bodies. At one point someone climbs up the vein of the world. I pictured it shaped like a palm tree. I do not kid.“What is freedom?” Arankadash says. “It is control of the body, and its issue, and one's place in the world.”“See?” Camas says. “We aren't all completely dead in the head.”The characters here are so interesting and… terrible. They’re all villains and they’re all liars and they all have bad intentions, every one. But somehow, it’s hard not to see where they’re coming from, hard not to root for them [even➽Zan - has lost her memory. probably all of us if we were reading this book. disaster lesbian. pretty badass considering she doesn’t know what she’s doing. shares futch memes and is actually solidly butch, probably. chaotic neutral trying to be chaotic good.

I don’t like villains but I kinda love her delightfully evil aesthetic. she probably wears combat boots and drinks too muchThen there are the inner world characters. What I liked about these characters is that in Zan’s mind, they’re shitposting 24/7, but all of them are actually totally rational. Arankadash, Das Mudi, and Casamir - my favorite - all have their own motivations and characterization. Many of these characters [okay, okay, I mean Casamir] are fundamentally driven by a need for agency. Which is I think what this book is about at its core. In a world where everything is for your family, what does it take to make a choice you don’t know is right? And maybe more importantly, what does what you do to someone you love do to you?I don't know, man, this is a really fantastic space opera. I want to recommend this but I also feel like I am totally about to get judged for recommending this. hello to all my lovely followers, and may I just make it very clear: this book is weird as hell. you are absolute not allowed to judge me for liking it anyway because I like weird things and hey, the Hugo awards agree with me....more",Notes are private!,0,200,1,"Feb 08, 2018","Apr 19, 2018","May 22, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29090844-the-stars-are-legion

I’d pitch this book as Hogwarts for assassins and I enjoyed it so much. ♔ This is a book about becoming yourself, on more levels than one. It’s about developing an ethical code when you’ve had it trained out of you, and synthesizing your childhood self and your self after immense trauma. I love the exploration of Mia‘s faith crisis. Throughout the book, we are told that she used to be a believer and is no longer sure if she is.“This makes you who you are. She punched the slab of muscle above his heart. “This."" She slapped the top of his head. ""These.” The girl took hold of his hands not in front of him, staring into the boys eyes. “Slavemarks. Tattoos. Scars. What you look like doesn’t change who you are inside. They can give you a new face, but they can’t give you a new heart. No matter what they take from you, they can’t take that away unless you let them. That’s real strength, Tric. That’s real power.”And god, Mia has so much potential for book two. Guys, I am so excited. She’s developed so much just in this book and I can’t wait for more of her arc.“Iron or glass? they'd ask.She was neither.She was steel.”♚ If we’re talking about romance… spoilers. Please skip this paragraph. (view spoiler)[Tric is a decent romantic interest, but my spoiler-addled lesbian mind is really happy about the love interest change. I do think spoilers about later developments ruined Tric a bit for me. (hide spoiler)]♔ Nevernight is so, so hilarious. Why are murder books always so funny.“Cock is just another word for ‘fool.’ But you call someone a cunt, well…” The girl smiled. “You’re implying a sense of malice there. An intent. Malevolent and self-aware. Don’t think I name Consul Scaeva a cunt to gift him insult. Cunts have brains, Don Tric. Cunts have teeth. Someone calls you a cunt, you take it as a compliment. As a sign that folk believe you’re not to be lightly fucked with.” A shrug. “I think they call that irony.”♔ The worldbuilding here was super interesting after around page 100, but up till then I found it confusing and convoluted. I understand that thrown-in worldbuilding is a style. I enjoy thrown-in worldbuilding. Christ, guys, Six of Crows is my favorite book of all time and I STILL have yet to read the Grisha. But with Six of Crows, I felt the tension and character work even when I didn’t know what was happening. I got invested in the world from the beginning. It can be done. Jay Kristoff didn't do it for me.♚ Related to the last point - the first 100 pages are overwritten bullshit. I know you guys are going to come at me for this and I completely do not care; it needed editing. While I found parts interesting, especially the footnotes - I know people complain about those but they were the only thing I liked - on the whole, the initial section was too long, had little to no tension, was totally overwritten even compared to the rest of the book, and offered barely any character development compared to worldbuilding. ♔ After all that, I just loved it. Nevernight is so engaging and so non-boring after its beginning section. I could barely put it down.“Beauty you're born with, but brains you earn.”♔ The plot twists are just as awesome as everyone says, but I have to admit, I think you can like this novel even if you get spoiled. Proof? I got spoiled about one of the twists and still a) loved the book and b) think it’s a brilliant twist.Listen, guys, after the admittedly crappy first 100 pages, I just could not put this down. This is one of those times you just gotta defer to the wisdom of your fellow trusted gays who spoiled you for all the big plot twists and enjoy yourself. The plotline was amazing, the characters compelling, and the themes teased made me so happy. I cannot wait for book two.

If you're into verse, I think you should pick this up. Sadly, I don't think it was for me. Novels in verse just hardly ever land for me. I usually like poetry in verse, but after a few of these, I realized they all sounded exactly the same. None had depth beyond “words said in a pretty way”. I don't hate free verse poetry; in fact, I quite enjoy the hard emotions behind it. But here's the catch; it needs to have emotions. But the language here isn't poetry. I like free verse because it invites feelings in me. These words incited nothing in me; not feelings, not love for any of the characters. The main character narrating this piece is hopelessly generic. There's this trend in YA literature of writing generic characters so anyone can relate to the story. I get it. I just don't particularly like it. Characters like this end up seeming like plot devices, not people. Unfortunately, in a story depending mostly on a stylistic method to stand out, my dislike for stories told in verse poetry overtook my opinion. As an overall story, this was quite compelling. While I found the characters fairly generic, they were all likable enough. The portrayal of eating disorders is very good, going off what I've read before about portrayal. It's not a bad book.

I'm not sure if I'm being harsh or merciful with this rating; I suppose I'll let you all judge after my . Science fiction is always so convoluted. Have any of you noticed that? No matter what book you're reading, there's so much deus ex machina. It's like the one consistent feature of the genre. This book takes deus ex machina to a higher level; not only with an unprecedented reliance on it as a plot device, but also through the inclusion of literal machine gods. (That was, in fact, a joke. Please clap.)Maybe that's unfair, though: it's a constant issue with the genre. I could excuse the deus ex machina and simply praise how twisty the plot is. I could, but I don't want to. Honestly, I didn't find this one quite as addicting due to my reading slump. If I had gotten through this in a day, maybe I'd be praising the whole book right now. But to be honest, the longer I read it, the more annoyed I got.This series relies far too much on its gimmicks. Not just the formatting; the whole explaining-things-through-metaphors has honestly gotten a bit old. I still find the conversations interesting, and often amusing as well, but I have to admit they feel overdone at this point. We get it, you have a damn creative storytelling format. Let's move on. [slight spoilers for book one, broad hints for book two] I have to admit, after the cop-out deaths of book one, I found it hard to be confident in book two's major character deaths. These deaths ARE a lot more long-lasting, with less deus ex machina. An improvement. The problem is I didn't believe they WERE going to last. I totally thought the dead characters would be back immediately. As a result, the initial deaths didn't blindside me or make me feel upset. Also, because this is so stupid: why do the robots have genders? Why are the male robots “ten times more massive than the females”? They're robots. What, do they have fucking hairstyles? Do they have breasts? Would they really be different sizes? What does this even mean? THEY ARE ALIEN ROBOTS. Why the fuck would they have gender roles the same as ours? All in all: what the fuck? Since I've talked so much about my dislike for the gimmicky style, I do want to give over a brief section for what I did like about this book. First of all, I do think this series manages to be quite fast-paced, with a few twists that are particularly shocking and aren't just a blatant deus ex machina. There's something to be said for a series that keeps me reading through annoyance. I have to admit, though, this book took me far longer than book one. Second, I do really like the sarcastic narrative style of our omniscient narrator. There's a biting sarcasm to his dialogue that I really love. His sense of humor is just my style. —Is that the end? —Yes! What do you think? —I . . . I enjoy squirrel stories and found yours very entertaining. You conveyed the desperation of Little Larry really well and I was saddened by the news of his demise. With that in mind—and I hope you will not judge me too harshly for my lack of perspicacity—what could this possibly have to do with the aliens in London?Ignoring every single nitpick I've listed before, because I want to talk about the major flaw of this book. My issue with this book— no, this series— is it doesn't accomplish its purported focus on human dynamics. Neuvel is trying to convey the desperation and strength of humanity in the face of adversity. But I don't think he gets to the heart of it like I want him to. He tries to keep this story human, but the characters don't read human enough. Not only are the main characters too close to the chosen-one archetypes to be relatable, I find that due to the odd medium, the character's voices barely come through on page. I like both Vincent and Kara, but both make so many odd decisions I can't really get a handle on who they are. I do enjoy Rose; she's certainly got the best character growth, if anything. And I also like our omniscient narrator. But even these two characters just don't quite feel real. In a story about humanity's strength, this is such a major flaw. So, now that I've reached the end of the unpopular opinions train: I didn't like it that much, I considered giving it 2 stars, I think this series is incredibly overhyped, and I'm frankly a little annoyed. I'll read book three, but I don't know how to get past my annoyance....more",Notes are private!,0,98,1,"Jun 15, 2017","Jun 21, 2017","May 22, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30134847-waking-gods

We may last forever, but you bloom brighter and smell sweeter, and draw blood with your thorns.LET'S TALK FAIRIES. Because hoooooooly shit, guys, this kind of fairy aesthetic is my freaking shit. Fairies in this book cannot feel - or at least, we think they cannot. So this book becomes one about the virtue of emotion. And not emotion from romantic love - emotion in general. One of the side characters has an arc totally revolving around her own emotional heart, without even a romantic element, and it's become one of my favorites. The instalove is… real. Okay, I hate when ers lie, so I’m not going to: Rook and Isobel have some major instalove going on, and that’s the point. But to me, their actual dynamic as a couple was fantastic. Honestly, guys, ever since Laini fucking Taylor, queen of instalove that gives me feelings, I have given up on my anti-instalove crusade and joined the anti-boring-couples crusade. TLDR: Isobel and Rook were an entertaining couple. Instalove is fine as long as I’m not bored by the couple themselves. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk bye don’t @ meOkay, I’m going to make a blanket generalization and I don’t care if you liked this book or not, you have to agree with me here: the writing of this book is fucking masterful. The last time I got chills from a writing style alone was Anna-Marie McLemore’s Wild Beauty, and we all know how that turned out. Fantastic writing can fix a ton of issues, and An Enchantment of Ravens has that fantastic writing down pat.

I already talked a lot about why I loved The Cruel Prince, so I guess I’ll just give a quick summary: antiheroes, court intrigue, power plays, and a fish out of water in a world full of monsters - but this time, she’s determined to seize the same power. And it’s badass.Jude… is so great. She's seriously becoming one of my favorite fictional characters of all time, and I don't really know how? Her narrative voice is so strong, shaping and characterizing the world around her. The strength of her voice perfectly counteracts the desperation we see within her to cling to power, to not give up the few gains she has made. She's so delightfully unlikable and yet manages to gain audience sympathy at every moment. The side characters here are particularly great. I particularly like the relationship between the Bomb & the Roach; the backstory we got for them here was excellent. Vivi is as fantastic as ever, but I actually love what was done with her character [I’ll talk about this later]. The Wicked King is also pushed up by a series of interesting villains; while I am emphatically not a Locke or Nicasia fan, Taryn is intriguing and I want more of her, and Madoc is always a delight. Oh, and then there’s Cardan, the Sort Of Love Interest, who I find both incredibly compelling and very dislikable.I think what I’m most fascinated about with this book is how it plays with the dynamic of humans wresting whatever power they can. The idea of fairies not understanding the stakes of their own world on the level that human characters do. Vivi, as someone who grew up a fairy, does not understand how Jude was affected by her childhood - she was never charmed, or manipulated, or forced to play the games that Jude was. And the dynamic between Cardan and Jude is perfect; Jude clinging to the little power she has over Cardan, and Cardan being under someone’s thumb, just one more time.I’m not sure how I felt about parts of the dynamic between Cardan and Jude; there’s a continuous lack of dictated consent in their interactions, which makes sense for the situation and is still bothersome. But also, I’m kind of obsessed with their relationship. They have so much sexual tension and it kills me. I cannot wait to see where it goes. And also, guys, there were so many fucking plot twists I’m laughing. i have no idea how I even felt about the final twist but literally everything else was so fucking legit and I screamed about eight times reading this book. Basically, that was everything I liked about The Cruel Prince, but like... more. Jude is seriously one of my favorite fictional characters ever and the plot twists killed me and I'm super into the romance. And in unrelated news I’m going into a coma now [@Holly you know what you did] and I'll see you all... next year. If I'm not dead yet.

It’s a one-sitting type book, which makes it super easy to consume quickly and love. The tone is an odd combination of romantic and hyper-realistic. The characters are compelling enough to get invested enough, with their own complexities, although perhaps not what stood out about the book. The writing is quite lovely.

And that's not to say anything about thetalent of these authors; in fact, I think a lot of these stories were fabulous. But these stories aren't long enough. Most of these are story prompts meant to intrigue readers, rather than full stories of their own. If I could read full books based on these, I think many of those books could become new favorites. But in this form, I wasn't too impressed. I am not joking when I say almost all my favorites should've been full books rather than short stories. Stories I Loved On Their Own: Cat Calls, Swallow the Moon, Arctic Light, The Runners, What A Stone Can't Feel, Backstage PassStories That Were Great But Deserved To Be Longer: Little Red Suit, Cooking Time, Cast Out, Cool, Appetite, Memory Lace, Stories That Just Weren't Great: Anarkali, Weft, The Wednesday Room, Mirror Perfect, The BloomingBelow, I did a short list of my thoughts on each of these stories. You'll notice my actual rating is not an average. I rate short story collections based on my general thoughts. If I love the collection, it's a five; if I enjoy it a lot, it's a four; if I feel a little mixed with a tinge of disappointment, it's a three. I almost never rate collections with two stars. ♔ Cat Calls by Margo Lanagan - ★★★★☆ A sweet, heartwarming tale about catcalling. I really liked the language, too. ♔ Swallow the Moon by Kate Constable and Priya Kuriyan - ★★★★☆ Oh my god, the art of this is BEAUTIFUL. The plot was confusing, but in a good way. This is a story I'd definitely like to analyze. ♔ Little Red Suit by Justine Larbalestier - ★★★★☆ A dystopian retelling of Little Red Riding Hood. This had so much potential built up, to the point that I thought it would be my favorite of this book. Unfortunately, the ending was slightly anticlimactic. I really wanted this to be a full book. ♔ Cooking Time by Anita Roy - ★★★★☆ A future in which food does not exist, complete with time travel. Again, this is more of a prompt than a full story. But I REALLY want to read a full version. There's so much potential here. Please, Anita Roy. I'll pay you all my money to write a full book with this as a first chapter. ♔ Anarkali by Annie Zaidi and Mandy Orr- ★★☆☆☆A brief comic about a girl persecuted for sleeping with the emperor. Honestly, I wasn't the biggest fan of the art style, and the story felt incomplete. This was pretty meh. ♔ Cast Out by Samhita Arni - ★★★★☆ A story about a world in which girls have magic and can be destroyed for it. Again, this isn't a full story!! It feels like the beginning of a really freaking amazing book. ♔ Weft by Alyssa Brugman - ★★☆☆☆Meh. There are good points about beauty, but it's like ten pages of inner meditation. ♔ The Wednesday Room by Kuzhali Manickavel and Lily Mae Martin - ★☆☆☆☆Bad art, nonsensical story. Meh. ♔ Cool by Manjula Padmanabahn - ★★★★☆ Again, good first chapter, introduces you to conflict and world, ends. Why did it have to end? ♔ Appetite by Amruta Patil - ★★★★☆ A short comic that makes you think. I wanted more, but this was fairly good and coherent as a full story. ♔ Mirror Perfect by Kirsty Murray - ★☆☆☆☆A story about seeing yourself as perfect. Point one, the writing here felt very low-quality. Point two, this one veers into the territory of “conventionally attractive people are evil”. Also, her dad is an asshole. I'm sorry, if you leave two twins with your fifteen-year-old for a whole hour because you want to go shopping, you're an asshole. ♔ Arctic Light by Vandana Singh - ★★★★☆ I liked this one! It's a short story about climate change. ♔ The Runners by Isobelle Carmody and Prahba Mallya - ★★★★☆ A world run by women. This comic is so SAD. I liked it. ♔ The Blooming by Manjula Padmanabahn and Kirsty Murray - ★☆☆☆☆Tentacled beings in a stage play. I'm sorry, suspension of belief and all that, but this is just too freaking weird. And the dialogue is terrible. I think that's the point, but I can't be sure. And either way, do I want to read it? Nope. ♔ What A Stone Can't Feel by Penni Russon - ★★★☆☆A person who can turn into inanimate objects. It's weird but written very nicely. ♔ Memory Lace by Payal Dhar - ★★★☆☆A world where men are slaves. I actually liked this a decent amount; there's a ton of emotionality and it ends on a hopeful note. ♔ Backstage Pass by Nicki Greenberg - ★★★☆☆The art style sucks, just to get that out of the way. But I really like the theme of this story; it's about unspeaking women in writing. VERDICT: While most of the stories are too short and deserved a full book, there's enough good content in here to warrant a read.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"May 20, 2017","May 20, 2017","May 20, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30295497-eat-the-sky-drink-the-ocean

This is that book for me. The Wicker King iHave you ever read a book that you love, but also feel as if you'd be judged by everyone for recommending? This is that book for me. The Wicker King is a weird, weird book, and one I'm sure will be polarizing. But the immersive atmosphere and developed characters absolutely saved this one for me.Let's talk atmosphere. The Wicker King is told with gradually darkening pages, beginning white and slowly getting darker and darker, and with incredibly short chapters. I found it very hard to put down and utterly engaging. I mean, what do I even say? I could not put it down. The writing is so utterly enthralling. The pacing is so quick, with each page so short that it’s easy to consume. And now let's talk characters. August and Jack are two of the most TragicTM characters I have ever read about and I sort of love them. August’s character voice is so incredibly well-done, and his love for Jack and Rina is written very well. I’ve seen plenty of accusations of queerbaiting as to this book, and while I understand the point of view, I disagree. The Wicker King follows a lead character who is written as questioning and a relationship that is somewhere between friends and lovers - until the end. The relationship does actually explicitly become canon towards the end, something that was true for the arc as well but done with much more subtlety. I loved what the author had to say here.I don’t know. I wasn’t even liking this until the end, but towards the end, I got so deeply emotional. I think Ancrum’s vision for this book is brilliant and I’m so glad I got a chance to read it. I feel like so much of this book was messed up. The two lead characters are… sort of obsessed with each other, and K. Ancrum strays so far from narratively supporting or decrying some of the actions taken by characters in this book that I almost didn’t know how to feel about anything. But I think K. Ancrum strays away from making this story feel like a romanticizing of mental illness by showing the gritty realism of it all. All in all, I thought this was brilliant. You'll either think it's weird or think it's just as brilliant as I did, and you know what? I think it's a chance you should take.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,306,1,"Nov 22, 2017","Nov 22, 2017","May 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33158541-the-wicker-king

I'm a nerd and I did a full run-through, in case you're interested, so check out down below. → Head Scales Tongue Tail by Leigh Bardugo ← ★★★★★This is the most adorable and pure?? I loved the banter between Gracie and Eli, I loved the atmosphere... yup. Just everything I wanted out of this collection in one story. → The End of Love by Nina Lacour ← ★★★★☆THIS ONE IS SO CUTE. It's a story about love after a change in your life. Mimi and Flora were seriously so pure. It's got that kind of Gay Aesthetic vibe to it, same as all her other stuff. If you like her writing at all, you'll love this. → Last Stand At The Cinegore by Libba Bray ← ★★★☆☆I don't know what this was or what I just read, but... I think I liked it? Dani and Kevin were just fine as a couple. → Sick Pleasure by Francesca Lia Block ← ★★☆☆☆This was way too depressing for this collection, first of all. Second of all, what even. Third of all, why the lack of names? A and I, really? → In Ninety Minutes, Turn North by Stephanie Perkins ← ★★★★★Most of this was just okay fluff, but AAAAAH THAT SECTION ON THE TRAIN!!

I enjoyed it fine, Matty and Kieth were cute enough, the ending was nice, just didn't make much of an impact on me. → Inertia by Veronica Roth ← ★★★★★I love the concept of this so much, and I really liked the themes about medication. Matt and Claire made for a really compelling couple too - friends to lovers for the win!! Even his mistakes, even his darkness, had been taking him toward her.→ Love is the Last Resort by Jon Skovron ← ★★★★☆This one is a ton of different viewpoints at a romantic resort. Lena and Arlo are adorable, but really, I loved every single couple here!! It's a little confusing towards the beginning, but once you get the names, it's awesome. The ending scene made me laugh so hard. → Good Luck and Farewell by Brandy Colbert ← ★★★☆☆This is a sweet story about family, but to be honest, I found it a little boring. Pierre and Rashida were fairly sweet. And okay, I know this is a nitpick, but I really don't think any self-professed Shakespeare nerd would consider that Hamlet quote their favorite quote. It's literally meant to be ironic and to mean something totally different from what everyone thinks it means. Not to call someone a fake fan, but really?→ Brand New Attraction by Cassandra Clare ← ★★★☆☆A love story I went in with really low expectations - like, I expected to give this two stars at most - but actually really enjoyed it!! The concept of Lulu and Luca dating honestly kind of grossed me out. I have stepcousins. I don't want to think about lusting after them. But I liked Mephit a lot, the plot was far more interesting than expected, and the carnival lore was super creative. → A Thousand Ways This Could All Go Wrong by Jennifer E. Smith ← ★★★★☆First dates and being a camp counselor. I love how awkwardly cute Griffin and Annie are!! And okay, having a love interest with autism where it wasn't his entire character, just a fact about him that affected his personality, was awesome. This was really just so pure. Read it. → The Map of Tiny Perfect Things by Lev Grossman ← ★★★★★This was just perfect. And caused me an existential crisis.COVERPORN BULLSHIT♔ IN THE POOL: Pierre and Rashida (9) are the two people swimming at the top. Matty and Keith (6) are the two boys, one with pizza and one with a mike, which is so adorable. Obviously Dani and Kevin (3) are the 3D glasses people having a chicken fight. A and I (4) are the two people chickenfighting with them, because mohawk. Claire and Matt (7) I believe are the people backfloating holding hands and Mimi and Flora (2) are the two girls splashing themselves on the right, both of which I only know because this anthology needed way more diversity. ♔ OUT OF THE POOL: Lulu and Lucas (10) are the two people by the tree, because rainbow hair!! Griffin and Annie (11) are the people playing checkers, and I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY GOT GRIFF'S EXACT OUTFIT. Is that not pure. Is that not perfect. Gracie and Eli (1) are the two people with bikes, which is pure. Lena and Arlo (8) are the pool boy and girl. Mark and Margaret (12) I think are the swing set people; they had basically no on page description, but this feels like them to me and it does fit Margaret's outfit minus the hat. Marigold and North (5) I think are the people in the chairs, but this could switch with Mark & Margaret.

Some of them execute this message well, keeping it subtle but intriguing. Sometimes, books such as this throw everything that makes a book good away in favor of symbolism. (Wow, I am really enjoying these cheesy openers nowadays. Great.)Yes, I'm on a tangent right now. Bear with me. What I'm getting at is that there's a wide spectrum being meaning and being generally interesting. And I think at places, this book just wanted to get a message across.Don't get me wrong - it's a great message. Immigration rights are important and the amount of xenophobia around our world right now is fucking horrifying. But if you're writing a book about immigration rights, you need to make me feel for the characters. Because at its core, immigration is a human issue, an issue not of statistics on a page but of individuals going through a terrible situation. I believe that focusing on a few specific characters was Sedgewick's intention, but honestly, I found myself pretty underwhelmed by his execution. While I didn't hate either main character, I find myself hard-pressed to name any of their personality traits. The thing about Sedgewick is that he's fantastic at fast-paced, tension-driven, and occasionally emotional books. His books are strongest when taking quick journeys with many twists, such as in Ghosts of Heaven and Midwinterblood. However, he is not so fantastic at characters. That hasn't been a huge detriment to either of his other books, but I don't think this is a story he was willing to take on. So why is this still getting a four? My manic desperation to finish. I don't know what it is about Sedgewick's writing that makes me so engrossed, but man, I want what he's having. I couldn't fucking breathe while I was reading this book. I had to put it down at one point because I was breathing so fast. And despite some of what I said earlier, I do think this book was powerful. It definitely made me feel, even though I don't love the characters that much. Sedgewick is just so, so fucking engaging. It actually angers me how effortlessly good he is. So I think I would recommend this, though not to quite the same degree as some of Marcus Sedgewick's books.

So this was my last read of 2017, and also my first one star since fucking MARCH. MARCH. I read two hundred and fifty fucking books this year, and I one starred three of them. AND THIS WAS ONE. JESUS. There is something utterly repulsive about this book. It’s a book of violence that feels pointless, for shock value before anything else. All the characters in this book are horrible people, all the stories feel underdeveloped, and the plot is just… a shitpost. Listen, guys, I am not one to complain about weird books. I love weird books. Or to complain about too much violence. I love violence. (Yes, this is irony.) Or unlikable characters. I love unlikable and morally grey characters. But what, pray tell, am I supposed to get out of a book that is 100% brutality and 0% interesting? Not to be a broken record, but I do not understand the appeal of torture porn. Find the meaning. Find the character development. The plot - oh my god, the fucking plot - feels so undriven. Character objectives are so inconsistent and change so quickly that half the plot - including several deaths - feel completely pointless. And yeah, okay, biggest pet peeve: every single character lacks any fucking semblance of common sense. And I wish I could say this was used to some greater effect, because I think Kuehn knows these tropes exist. She just… doesn’t try to subvert them. I am not joking when I say that this situation only occurred because of around twenty different bad decisions. And to be quite honest, a half-decent moral might not have turned me away from how repulsive this was to read. And what kind of ending is this, anyway? Like, guys, four people die because of stupidity. It’s brutal and absolutely not fun at all to read. Okay, literally the only thing that I liked about this book was the shattered semblance of character development given to Ben. Guys, I am so pissed off. Ben and Rose are set up to be such complex characters, but I guess someone forgot the memo that actually interesting characters need development. You know, growth and change? I forgot what that is, sorry.In all seriousness, there’s something so strangely uncomfortable about a book that ends up essentially using a black woman to further the character development of the white boy protagonist. I get the feeling this isn't the intent and it's meant to be commentary, but there isn't actually any commentary and so it's just sort of... a weird, vaguely tropey element of the book.Please someone tell me what the meaning of this book was? Because I see the slight buildup to some kind of meaning, but I don’t see the actual thoughts. And I didn’t even not get the ending - I get it, I see what's being said - I just don’t think it’s that impressive. And I certainly did not want to read this 300-page trashheap to get to it. IN CONCLUSION: Stephanie Kuehn is so talented so why did she write this. I literally despised every single lead of this book, found the plot repulsive, and was overall disappointed. (Which you hopefully understood.) It's a no from me.

This is an incredibly creative and interesting concept for a novel - a 1920s Much Ado About Nothing retelling set in prohibition era? count me in. And I enjoyed this fine upon first reading, but I don't know... I think as time as has gone on, I've realized I found some of this sort of boring. This is definitely a character-driven novel; in fact, it follows seven lead young characters, not even including the adults - the flirty and worldly Hero, my aspiring-doctor icon Beatrice, aspiring writer and asshole Benedick, professional annoying rich kid Claude, dorky and sweet Prince, less-villainous-than-usual John, and my favorite singer, Maggie. All that being said, aside from Maggie, Ben, and Bea, I found myself slightly disappointed on the character aspect. I liked Hero, but I definitely thought she could’ve gotten a more clear character arc; here, I feels a bit muddled at points, even getting into some implied slut-shaming that is only somewhat condemned.There's one thing here I'm entirely confident in loving: the retelling aspect. This is one of the most fantastic retellings I have ever read - keeping all the good aspects of the original, and fixing the things that suck. Anyone who's read Much Ado About Nothing probably has a couple of complaints. First of all, why do Claudio and Hero end up together, and second of all, what the fuck is up with John? This novel solves them both. I also appreciated the expansion on characters who don't feature in the original much - using Maggie and Prince was an inspired decision. Maggie's struggle as a 1920s black jazz singer especially was so well-written that it quickly became my favorite arc of the book.Unfortunately, it's not all good. The main issue here? Boredom. This comes from the fact that sideplots weren't established very well towards the beginning, leading to lack of tension and confusion in the latter half. And to be quite honest, the whole book felt sort of pat - I never truly worried whether it would hold up in the end. That could, perhaps, work if the book were just a bit funnier. But aside from a few humorous sections, I really didn't think this was all that funny. All that being said, though, the setting was lovely, the characters were good, the romantic relationships were sweet, the dialogue was funny, and the retelling aspect is perfectly done - you'll definitely love this if you're a fan of Shakespeare's original play.

While she’s living a life she thinks of as simple, her sister is a famous and talented teacher. It is a murder mystery wrapped up in an interesting commentary on chosen one tropes and sibling rivalry, and it had me engrossed from start to finish. The thing I find the most entertaining about this book, in a nutshell, is how it plays with established fantasy tropes. Ivy is a Petunia-Dursley type character, in that she is the sister to a girl with magic, who was the favorite of the family. I really enjoyed how that dynamic was explored and tackled, especially as it is mirrored by others. The sibling dynamic, actually, is a huge focus of this book. The relationship between her and Tabitha reaches a level of complexity I was not expecting. There is a chosen one, too, and his sister, whose relationship with him is a neat parallel to our two sisters. As the book progresses, Ivy has to ask herself: is her sister’s world really quite as blissful as she thinks?Ivy is a mess of character whose sense of self is in heavy disrepair, much as she’d like not to admit it. She’s been given the chance to be on equal with her sister, and even to be a different person, and she desperately wants this. Several ers on this page seem to have found her whiny, which I frankly do not agree with. Her romantic subplot with Rahul is not so much a romance as a part of her character arc; a chance for her to grow and learn. It seems like several ers on this page really didn’t vibe with the writing style here, which is interesting to me, because I really really did. I struggled to put this one down. (If you’ve read this definitely let me know how you felt, as I’m interested by it being polarizing!) I also liked elements of the setting; the opening being set in the Bay Area was fun. The ending of Magic for Liars was, in all honesty, not what I expected; I was expecting some kind of heart-thrilling reveal, some kind of ridiculous plot twist, and what I got was a sort of faster-paced reveal that focused more on the why than on the who. But I felt this worked for the book. The ending left me thinking, doubting, wondering, unsatisfied but not upset with the book.

Anna-Marie McLemore is one of the most talented authors on any market right now. They are consistently fantastic at creating compelling characters, beautiful sentences, and Super Good Romances, all wrapped up in narratives of generational trauma, colonialism, & queerness.➽W H Y T H I S W A S A M A Z I N GThis book is about a few things: internalized colorism, systematic transphobia & homophobia, and most importantly of all, stealing back your story from those who wish to make it theirs. In a world that wants to steal your words, to put you into a story of sister vs. sister and family vs. family, it is so difficult to find your own way and force your way out of a colonial narrative. As always, McLemore’s writing is so beautiful and lyrical. I really do find it hard to tear myself away from these works; I never binge them, but whenever I read them I am so in them. For those of you who found Wild Beauty a bit much, I will say I found this slightly easier to read quickly; however, I will say that Wild Beauty was my favorite book of two years ago, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. ➽C H A R A C T E R SThese characters are just,,, so so good. →Blanca Del Cisne has been trying to fit an archetypal role, a role she has been allowed to partake in due to her lighter skin. So throughout the story, she must find that she does not belong in that role, and that she can find love as a queer girl, and have her own life. →Roja Del Cisne projects manipulation and lack of caring, but underneath that layer, she is a deeply loving girl, made fierce by love and by resentment of her mother’s dislike. (One of my only complaints about this was that I really wished that element specifically had been resolved with slightly more buildup.) →Page Ashby is a nonbinary trans boy trying to discover his identity in a world where he is put into boxes. There's a really good discussion of gender ≠ pronouns incroporated here, as Page uses both he and she pronouns. →Barclay Holt, or Yearling, is the story’s blue-eyed boy, a boy from an abusive family. His arc involves resolving his feelings around his past and adjusting to his disability. He is also sadly the only character I do not love; his arc felt sort of dissonant compared to the other three character’s arcs. He is fine and he exists and he is good. →Also, Tess Holt and Grandma Ashby are the best. That is all. ➽R E L A T I O N S H I P SThere are two romantic couples in this book. Roja and Yearling’s romance is sweet. Blanca and Page’s is indescribably good. It’s sensual, but built on such an incredible base of trust, and their tension is just um… a lot? There is something so delicate and emotional to me about queer people finding themselves in loving each other, and I honestly wonder if there’s any personal element to how beautifully this romance is rendered. They are amazing, my favorite couple, 30/10. But the main relationship in this book is between the two sisters. Blanca & Roja’s relationship is incredibly complex; each has problems with herself, and each often projects these problems on her sister. It is so easy, in a sibling relationship, to see your sister as something she is not — to allow the image of someone you love to twist and distort. Seeing that bond break, and then come back, was so cathartic. ➽I N C O N C L U S I O NI remember about a week before I read this book, I saw this thread by Anna-Marie, and it was so amazing, and the fact that the reality of this book was even better is a real statement on how amazing this story was. I know I won’t forget about this story anytime soon.

But I think these are better than we give them credit for. Not to show up and act like J.R.R. Tolkein was some misunderstood genius. But it’s fascinating to me that this book was foundational to modern high fantasy, a genre which I think plays a lot with cruelty: the brutal world, the betrayal of friends. Tolkein’s novels do not revolve around complex moral codes; they do not question whether there is good and evil, or who is who. The fundamental hero of this story is love. It's no accident that the hero of this series is the most underestimated of all people: a Hobbit. There are the godly elves, but this series focuses on men's capacity to fail and triumph. The outsiders save the world. I think, all the time, about the fact that were it not for one moment of pity Frodo takes, on someone who he knows will try to hurt him, this entire story would have been different—would have ended on a far, far darker note. (On weekends, I also take time to think very deeply about Sam’s role in the series, and the fact that his love and loyalty saves Frodo and, by extent, the world. Within this narrative love saves the world.) The biggest flaw is that Tolkein could not edit to save his life. I will not elaborate on that beyond to say he would dedicate at least five pages to explaining the concept. I’m going to keep it very, very real: my love for this comes partially from just how much I adore the movie adaptations. This is genuinely the #1 series in the world where I think the movie adaptation is superior in quality to the books. I’ve watched them so many times. I think every time I watch them I end up adding a few sentences to this  because I’m full of Thoughts and Tenderness.

The problem is that all the stories are only around ten pages. Ten pages is just not enough to come up with a coherent plot and character development, no matter the talent of the author. At some point I decided I didn't want to keep going with this; it was clear that though many were very talented, almost none of the authors were given appropriate pagetime. I'll be coming back to the other stories over time, but before I put this on hold, I did want to check out a few stories by authors I love. I know this means I may have missed a hidden gem or two, and trust me, I don't want to miss those. But I really can't go read and  this many stories right now. I'm sorry. It seems that the best stories were left for last, • Carlos and the Fifteen-Year-Old-Heart by Adi Alsaid: 2 stars. Meant to show the divide between adopted parents and kids, the concept and intent of this story were interesting. Unfortunately, this just felt really fake deep to me, and the romance was instalove 101. • Strong Enough by Karin Atkins: 3 stars. Adopted superhero kid and very sweet. Unfortunately, it's only around five pages long. Boo. • The Sign by Erica M. Chapman: 4 stars. Follows a girl who goes to meet her biological father, only to realize he's dying. This was really sad in a good way. Unfortunately, it was also really not long enough. • Up By A Million by Caela Carter: 4 stars. This one follows a girl whose mother is in prison. It's heartbreaking in just the right way. • Mama's Eyes by Libby Cudmore: 3 stars. A suspense story about a girl who loses her adoptive mother. This was fine. I just don't feel like it offered anything new, and the writing seemed slightly melodramatic. • A Kingdom Bright and Burning by Dave Connis: 4 stars. Slight magical realism!! Again, too short to have the full impact. But I liked this. From here, I stopped reading fully and started reading stories exclusively from authors I've had interest in the past. I will come back to the others, don't worry!!• Upon the Horizon's Verge by Sangu Mandanna: 4 stars. I've never read anything by this author, but her books have always seemed intriguing to me, so I wanted to give this a try. This is a nice and creative story, maybe one of my favorites in the collection. The theme of trying to connect with your former family is well-done. • Census Man by Mindy McGinnis: 4 stars. This follows a girl in foster care wishing for a family that wants her. McGinnis is a great writer, and this short story is no exception. Again, really too short to have much impact. • Peace of Paper by Courtney C Stevens: 4.5 stars. This has one of the best sections in the entire book about how orphaned people are perceived. It's really emotionally in-touch. Definitely worth the read. I've never read any of Steven's books, but I'm interested, so we'll see how I do in the future. • Happy Beginning by Nic Stone: This was the only story I gave 5 stars. Following best friends / girlfriends Jenna and Nyara, who has just run away from home. Ny is black and has been adopted by white parents, but doesn't feel at home with them. There's so much I loved about this. I read Stone's Dear Martin earlier this year and noticed that she's very good at getting emotion out of her readership. This book is told in second person in reverse chronological order, which was a creative choice I loved. And oh man, Jenna and Ny kinda killed me?? The purest, healthiest relationship. I can't believe Nic Stone saved 2017 with this ten-page story. I'll be in back crying. • The Take-Back by Kate Watson: 4.5 stars. I wasn't actually planning to read this, but the opening grabbed me so I stuck with it. This follows a boy whose newly adopted sister has just been taken back by her mom. It's heartbreaking. And great. Go read it. • Jar of Broken Wishes by Tristina Wright: 4 stars. This is a story about a foster cared girl wishing and getting the wrong results. I liked it. I felt that this ended on a slightly meh note, but I liked it a lot. I'll be reading Wright's debut 27 Hours this fall (it looks so cool!!) so this made me feel even more optimistic.Blog | Goodreads| Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 15, 2017","Jul 18, 2017","May 16, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28902446-welcome-home

The seven pies that my grandma used to make? You know what I mean. In all seriousness, I think this world [especially having read SoC] has a lot of potential for political intrigue, but I don’t yet know to what degree this series will go there. I hope it goes there. I hope everything is morally ambiguous as hell. I’m here for it. → plot and all that crap ←The first 2/3 of this book is so boring and I will never forgive it for that. Alina goes to school. She trains! The beginning of the book - you know, the thing that we know happens from the blurb? - takes two hours into the audiobook. There is very little rising action [if we’re going to be all literary about it]. It is overall a mess. Until the end. AND THEN THE END GETS COOL AND ACTION-PACKED. Okay, I have more written in this  about how freaking badass the ending is, but a lot of shit goes down and a lot of reveals get dropped and I did not expect any of them.→ cliches and tropes ←Oh my god. I hate saying this about Leigh fucking Bardugo, queen of subverting everything, but the beginning of this book… was so tropey. Our main character. Not very pretty. In love with her best friend. Every girl in sight is attracted to him. He is everyone’s type. And then she meets the Darkling. He broods! She was always beautiful underneath. But she’s also not like Mean Pretty Girl. Something something best friend vs. bad boy. Something something court politics. Like, come on. → character development ←And noooooow I have to go back on what I just said, because yeah, the tropes are annoying, but some tropes exist for a reason - namely, the whole beauty thing. Because despite my annoyance at Leigh Bardugo’s reliance on the beautiful-bitchy-girl-trope [Zoya.] I actually think she plays with Alina’s insecurity pretty well. Whether she knows she’s doing it is anyone’s guess. But Alina’s insecurity actually feels like a super authentic character trait. AND THE BIG REASON I’M UP ON ALINA IS BECAUSE… SHE GETS SO COOL. Because Alina fucking Starkov had the greatest antihero moment at the end of this book after being sort of boring for half the book. I’m so proud of her. I hope she spends two books fucking shit up and murdering people and she and the Darkling become mortal enemies. I am a very normal person. → romantic development ←I DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY Y’ALL REVIEW THIS BOOK THE WAY YOU DO. Because the Darkling… is not… sexy. He’s a really interesting and compelling character but the fact that this is this a popular ship actually makes me want to cry and throw things. And Mal was waaaaaayy less annoying than y’all made him out to be. I am actually legitimately confused as to why he’s so hated because he’s… fine? He says one paragraph of shitty things to Alina and then apologizes to her and recognizes that he was wrong? Which, if that’s annoying, absolutely fine and understandable, but you have to know on some level that saying he’s abusive but the Darkling is “sexy” is ridiculous. We have to know this. Please tell me we know this. → authorial development ←This series… is definitely not as good as Six of Crows. They’re on entirely different planes and that is okay and valid. But it’s actually hilarious how many SoC vibes this had. Genya is literally early-version-Nina and the Darkling is early-version-Kaz, except I don’t like either of them as much. [okay, fine, I do like Genya.] Mal is kind of bland. [Somewhat bland love interest who possibly might be working through prejudice… hm I feel like that sounds familiar] Alina had the greatest antihero moment at the end of this book after being sort of boring for half the book. Anyway. I like antiheroes. I do not like 400 pages of nothing happening. I don’t really like tropey writing. I don’t know how I feel about this book. someone please send help?overall: I’m glad I’m finally completing the Leigh Bardugo writing train so I can continue with all her future releases in the Grisha world. I wish this book were better. I am still glad I read it. This  was a mess. I thank you for your time.

More than amulets, more than clean living. Talking. Finding others like me.”A story about the realization that a “cure” does not always exist, and that is okay. This is a clever one, using what others call “bad fate” to represent the treatment of mental illness by both socities and ourselves (I believe bipolar disorder, which the author also has). It’s a very brief story with a fairly simple growth element but is powerful nonetheless. And the writing, in places, is absolutely gorgeous; Heidi Heilig has fantastic style, and this actually may have persuaded me to give For A Muse of Fire another try. → Britt And The Bike God by Kody Keplinger← ★★★☆☆ ✔blind MC (#ownvoices) Britt, who is blind and suffers from retinitis pigmentosa, pedals at the back of a tandem bicycle. This is a really short one and involves a somewhat cute love match. I think this just... didn’t have a ton going on given the length?

I think the best thing about this series is the developed character work. This is a series that has defined characters who you can root for or dislike, which is awesome. I actually think the characters improve throughout the series. In series one, Fireclaw is kind of a typical boring do-gooder. Brambleclaw, Leafpool, and Squirrelflight, the main characters in series two, are far more interesting and defined, with clear motivations beyond ""do the right thing."" This trend continues in series three and four. I also really appreciate the occasional morally grey or morally black characters. Yes, many characters are a bit ""I do good things and I'm amazing!!"" but characters like Ivypool, in the fourth series, were so influential to my childhood. Yeah, the plot is a little weird and far-fetched, and the writing is pretty terrible now that I've grown up enough to see it, but this series is definitely good for anyone who likes middle grade fiction.

This is such a deeply cute book that I screamed for 300 hours. Theater romance ft. cute play tropes ft. great characters ft. being totally, utterly bingeable, but also a really nice dissection of the feeling of being totally in the background. Megan is the forgotten supporting character in her life, the Rosalind to everyone else’s Romeo and Juliet. Instead of romance, she focuses on directing theatre. But her plans quickly crumble when she’s cast as Juliet in her high school’s production - even though she's never acted before. And maybe also meets a boy.What I really loved about this book was the subversion of the slut trope and also, basically Megan’s entire fucking character. Megan is, essentially, the school slut. But she doesn’t fit that mold. The authors are very clear not to slutshame her or indicate she should narratively pay for having dated so many guys. Megan is a character who believes she is not worthy of a permanent relationship and has trouble being confident in her relationships continuing. But she also faces the negative beliefs of those around her, who aren’t willing to consider that perhaps she truly cares about each relationship.The other great thing was the truly adorable romance. Owen and Megan are best friends who... maybe flirt with each other. But Megan has seen so many breakups that she's putting on a show, wanting to push everyone away. But their dynamic is so... sweet? They flirt with each other in the sweetest way possible. It helps that Owen is a genuinely really good guy, not the bad boy trope I'm not a fan of. When you add this character strength and adorable romance with Owen together with some truly fantastic writing, this book is one of the strongest contemporary romances I’ve ever read. I know I never read romance but I'm such a slut for drama-program-focused stories and I just... fucking love everything about Megan’s character. also, this makes the greatest slump read! I binged this whole thing in two sittings and I think my slump might have just broken.

But knowing all the while that you can’t put it down, that you’re totally engaged in the writing and the narrative. The compelling thing about this story is that it is about a girl who has lied to an entire family, saying she’s their long-lost child, but you still can’t help but hope she won’t be caught.

The very title we're given suggests that we are blank, waiting to be filled. But what the Demon King and his court do not understand is that paper is flammable.And there is a fire catching among us.I mean, I think I knew this had My Exact Vibes from the first time I heard of it. so perhaps it’s not the biggest shock in the world that I really, really liked this, but still - this book deserves the world, and you should DEFINITELY read it. Mayand Juand I kept calling this the angsty gaysians book, but I feel like I should give a proper blurb. Girls of Paper and Fire follows two Chinese-Malaysian girls, Lei and Wren, who meet and fall in love while essentially working as sex slaves under a demon king.Something that really stands out to me about this is the gorgeous setting depictions and, in general, sensuous writing. This is shockingly gorgeous. And though Girls of Paper and Fire did have occasional issues with off pacing - like there was a little more time spent on a generic Getting To The Palace beginning than I wanted - I think this book thrives so well off tension that in general it’s fairly unputdownable. With a starkly horrifying environment, it’s hard not to connect with Lei.I like, by the way, how this book uses the existence of homophobia and misogyny as tools for developing its characters and narrative, rather than as plot devices. The focus here is on two queer women, rather than on the characters perpetrating or benefiting from this discrimination. The main problem I’d mention for this book is that for much of the story, Lei doesn’t have a perceptible goal - she is trying to survive, but she doesn’t feel as motivated as she should. This is perhaps why the last hundred pages are so good; once that one tiny issue is fixed, the entire book gains initiative and becomes what Natasha Ngan has the talent to write - a fantastic, gripping, gorgeously written, and emotional dark fairy tale. But then again… it’s so good. So completely badass and gorgeous.The characters are so great!! I love Lei as a heroine - she’s struggling so much but such a good soul. I love that she’s allowed to be terrified, and desperate for escape, and desperate to do something more but also unsure if she can actually fight. And Wren is such a good love interest, supportive and caring but with her own shit to deal with. I also loved several side characters - Blue and Aiko are both excellent, and I can’t wait to see more out of them.Oh, and the romance. Oh my god, the romance here is so delightfully angsty. No one's paying attention to us, their focus all on the stage, and I need her right now, need the familiar warmth of her hands to ground me, to calm my already frantic heart from spiraling so far out of control that it breaks free - and me with it.I came for a slow-burn, two girls against the world type story, and for once in my damn life I got it. There is so much tension, so much of a slow burn between these two characters, and I was living for it.So, here we are, and I loved this, and I can’t wait for book two. I hope it’s just as starkly horrifying and beautiful.

Among the number are several shady individuals. For example, there's General Armitage, who sent his wife's lover to his grave. And there's always Vera Claythorne, who may have contributed to the death of a young boy to help her lover. Everyone is shady, everyone is suspicious, and no one is totally innocent.

Heart of Iron is basically Anastasia, in space, with lots of extra plotlines. And full disclosure: it’s basically entertaining fluff. But, you know, good entertaining fluff. With messy bits.[This took me a weird amount of time to finish considering how much I liked reading it?]This book follows a world in which the imperial families rule over everyone. In this world, robots were created to treat those infected with plague, but after a rebellion, most robots have had their minds erased and controlled. There are four lead characters, each with their own point of view. ➽Ana - our Anastasia character, sort of reckless and honestly… has a weaker sarcasm game than original Anastasia. But she’s also pretty badass. And also brown-skinned!➽D09 - our Dimitri character and also a robot, which is… kind of awesome. But also totally could have been handled better. We’ll talk. ➽Robb - a spoiled Ironblood boy trying to escape his mother. A very lazy tragic backstory but a lot of potential for Character DevelopmentTM. Probably the most sympathetic character in this whole book. ➽Jax - probably the character that needed to be in this book the least in terms of actual plot and I’m mad about it. Buuuuut he was really funny and good. Give him his own subplots. Or explain what the hell is going on with his people being able to read the stars, because I swear to god it is never explained. → let’s discuss why this was kind of trashy ←The beginning of this book was, for lack of a better word, weird, and I think I know what the problem was. First of all, the worldbuilding, which is that flavor of let’s-just-throw-worldbuilding-at-them-and-hope-they-don’t-notice-it’s-bullshit. [I noticed.] I think Poston wanted to avoid an infodump, which is a noble goal, but the result is that I actually don’t have a fucking clue what’s happening. I prefer infodumps. [I actually am not joking about this, I totally prefer infodumps to bullshit.] Second and perhaps most typical, we have the famous Zenith problem: too many pov switches. You know what the problem is with too many pov switches? It feels messy, first of all. The book feels as if it’s jumping from place to place at breakneck speed. And worse, it impedes the actual feeling of connection with the characters. I somehow managed to like the characters anyway, but listen, I could have liked them more and Ashley Poston knows it.Another kind of messy thing: rapidly changing goals. This book is fucking all over the place. It does not have an overarching plot. This leads to a very fast pace and a sense of not knowing what will happen, which is good. This also leads to several issues that destroy Heart of Iron’s overall quality. There is so much filler as characters wait around to be useful for the plot. This is a subset of the rapidly changing goals and all-over-the-place plot. This is made even worse by obvious villain reveals. Listen, anyone who has seen the widely popular movie Anastasia or knows Literally Anything About Anastasia knows perfectly well that Dude Whose Name Sounds Like Rasputin is a villain. And even worse, you could know that from page two without any knowledge of Anastasia or basic Romanov history. It is just that fucking obvious. We do not care. Skip to the end.AND THEN there is that stupid trope with Di developing feelings because he Meets A GirlTM. Listen. This trope is getting so old. We get it, robots falling in love and developing feelings is something you like, but it’s sort of boring when the falling-in-love part is the main part of that storyline. You could, I don’t know, show friendship or shit like that and do something new for once. [Revolutionary concept, right?] Personally, I think this would have been way better if Di felt things from the beginning and we just couldn’t see it. Can you imagine the amazing buildup? The tension?→ let’s discuss why this was actually fun ←I know I’ve complained a lot, but it’s worth noting that I did enjoy this. Even when plot twists were obvious, I found myself turning pages pretty quickly and enjoying the buildup to said plot twists. And wanting to find out what happened with these characters. Maybe there’s something to be said for being so fast-paced the reader doesn’t notice the crap?Honestly, the main reason I liked this book was because I got fairly invested these characters and their relationships. The dynamic between Ana and Di didn’t do anything for me at the beginning of the book, but I ended up shipping them a lot - their dynamic is just inherently compelling in its broad concept, okay? [Also, fun fact, I just sort of am obsessed with the idea of touching foreheads.] Ana, as a character, is somehow really lovable despite being kind of whiny. And Robb and Jax have some major instalove, but they’re really cute. I admit it. Bottom line: if you like the book you will like it for the characters.Really major bonus points for Going There with the ending. I'm actually kind of shocked at how Not Okay I was with that. BONUS ROUND OF POSITIVES: Found family. Space pirate ship run by Ana's adoptive mom and her wife. [I think her wife might be an alien.] Literally half the characters are queer and/or people of color. This  was a mess. Thank you for listening. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube✨fun fact: I don't even like the movie version of Anastasia. however I personally feel that the broadway musical is brilliant and one of my favorite musicals ever and should 20/10 be listened to asap.

But this sequel definitely did succeed, and I'm so glad I gave it the chance. I don't even know if this necessarily needs to be a duology. Somehow, this story of the time after is the more meaningful one.I remember having trouble with If I Stay because Mia was so out of touch with her emotions. At the time I read If I Stay, I thought that Mia's coldness was a function of Forman's writing. But after reading this, I realized I was wrong. There's a lot to respect about an author who can change her narrative style based on the characters. Adam and Mia are such opposing people, and I love how their narratives convey it. The fact of Adam and Mia being opposing people is maybe what I loved so much about their romance and relationship. They're very different people, yet I ended up wanting them together. They're both written so well. They felt like real people and I got to the point where I wanted them to just... get together. Please.I also loved that the narrative of this book acknowledged that both of them have pain. Mia had pain that had nothing to do with Adam, and the narrative doesn't judge her for it. I almost expected her pain to be shot down in favor of Adam's but it wasn't. Gayle Forman's treatment of their separate grief was excellent. I think what made this book stand apart from the typical YA contemporary for me was the focus on music. There's even an album at the end, complete with lyrics that touch on Adam and Mia's relationship and what Adam's life has been like. VERDICT: One of the best contemporaries I've read this year, and one I'd really recommend.

I have read a lot of YA graphic novels with fairly half-assed art styles, or styles I found too colorful and cheesy. There's a line, you know? After a while, all those colors get annoying. But this one is nothing of that sort. The plot here is ridiculous. It's graphic novel fodder. But sometimes, you just need to turn your brain off.

Forbidden is contemporary fiction about a brother and a sister who fall in love. Before you say ew, I will note that it is trying to talk about the dangers of neglect by parents. Maybe. This relationship occurs between a sixteen and seventeen-year-old, one year apart, who have essentially grown up as the ""parents"" of their household. And indeed, it is, in some ways, a deeply heartbreaking story. The ending is actually AWFUL; you’re disgusted, but still, you find yourself thinking that they deserved more. Unfortunately, very little about the story conveys this same heartbreaking effect.Of course this story is not meant to be comfortable. And of course, it is deeply uncomfortable to read about two siblings — they're BIOLOGICALLY RELATED, too, like not even adopted, and that would STILL be fucked up — having sex. (They quite literally have sex. on page.) But the existence of this relationship is not the problem, not really. Well, it’s certainly awful, but it’s not the main problem with this narrative as a whole. The problem is that I felt the narrative romanticized this codependent, unhealthy relationship to a frankly insane degree. The book goes so far as to make this a forbidden, star-crossed lovers tale in structure and form, and worse, strongly suggest consensual incest is morally okay. This is a discussion I’m not going to get into because I just frankly know what the comment section is going to look like, but I think the message “trauma can breed codependent and incestuous relationships” is close to completely ruined by the implication that incest is fine, actually.The book also fails to properly address the trauma of either of these characters. Lochen is essentially no longer speaking due to trauma; the narrative fails to actually address this, or the rather more disturbing fact that he is essentially physically abusive to his little brother. This is resolved, actually, in a way I found rather disturbing; he almost kills his brother at one point, which is not normal even under heavy pressure. Maya is portrayed as being fairly well-adjusted, which is a choice that strikes me as simply odd, given that 1) she clearly would have trauma given her circumstances and 2) is in a codependent incestuous relationship. Another issue is that their mother is clearly written as an alcoholic, but the narrative makes it more about her being a slut who wears low cut clothing. This is a fucking disaster of a narrative choice. One of my main problems with this is honestly just that it's… kinda terribly written. The actual writing quality is almost hilariously bad, to the point where I cringed at much of the dialogue. I think this poor quality contributes to the confusing narrative around incest and their mother, though I do want to draw a fine line here - narrative is not writing quality, and a fantastically-written book can still have shitty messages. This just managed to hit shitty messages and shitty prose. What’s odd is I almost understand why this received so much cult popularity a few years ago. I think we need to remember the early 2010s YA market for a minute, and the popularity of books such as Ellen Hopkins’ Crank and Thirteen Reasons Why. Not to say that either of those books are completely without merit, but the reason these books received hype was not just for reasons of quality: it was for the fact that they portrayed teenagers as deeply flawed and human. In a world where YA books dealing with intense topics were not so common, where teens were often written as more superficial, I can understand why books that seemed to be willing to go darker would gain popularity. It’s just that this does not hold up.I don't know if I liked or appreciated this. I don't think it’s worth your time.

This is an incredibly dark book that, ironically, I think I would’ve enjoyed a lot more three years ago. There is a lot to like about this book. It is very well-written. The depictions of gaslighting, force-feeding, lack of belief, and racially-charged abuse, in particular, are horrifying but incredibly accurate to real-life abuse. The main character, a young black & biracial girl named June, has a realistic inner monologue for a child. For these exact reasons, I found the first 10% or so incredibly promising, and indeed basically read this whole book in a day. I think this works as (view spoiler)[a takedown of the death penalty (hide spoiler)] and as a story imitating real life that perhaps parallells (view spoiler)[the Gypsy Rose Blanchard case. (hide spoiler)] I actually think this book could have been a four-star read for me — it’s not my personal thing, but I would’ve appreciated it more — had it revealed the main character’s current situation at the beginning of the book, rather than at the end. At that point, it would’ve become an interesting book about learning the truth, and developing empathy for the lead. I understand why this choice was not made — (view spoiler)[opening without revealing the ending spurs instant empathy from the audience, while revealing the ending could’ve ruined this (hide spoiler)]. However, the result is that this book is marketed as a narrative about abuse, and that was my expectation going in. The real point of the story is not clear until the 90% mark, quite literally. Personally, I don’t think Paper Butterflies works as a narrative about abuse. It’s a narrative around abuse that is, as expected, incredibly brutal. Unfortunately, I think it doesn’t counter that brutality with a lot of hope, or self-actualization for the lead, or dimension. Scenes tend towards the gratuitous to a point where I genuinely felt like vomiting. Towards the beginning of the book, I was turning pages quickly, waiting for the point in which June could finally get out and begin her journey towards a future. I kept turning pages and waiting for this until the very end. The only moments of hope within this book, in fact, come from her relationship with a boy (of course) down the street. I’ve talked before about the ways in which the trend of using romance as the way to spur a character’s self-actualization is harmful and creates stagnant narratives (although apparently, not in a full blog post that I can helpfully link to?). The problem with using a romance to spur self-actualization for a child or teen is that relationships in which one person is incredibly isolated from others, especially family members, can very easily turn abusive without any oversight. This is not to say that abuse survivors should not date, but that to a teenager without a support system, reading YA, the idea of a romantic relationship being the only good thing in your life can seem very easy and very appealing, and thus it can be very easy to ignore warning signs. Utilizing romance as the main source of light in a dark book also, frankly, leads to very stagnant narratives, and has also been done before about ten thousand times. (I’m bored.)Though this book successfully crafted a relationship in which the love interest is kind, caring, and not at all a source of drama, I did crave more. The scenes with the priest, in particular, bothered me a lot. I have read the narrative that abusers were probably abused themselves and thus we should forgive them before. I find it to be a very tasteless and useless phrase in actually interacting with abuse survivors, and as JA points out, this statement (in many cases) erases accountability. Children can receive some pass for making awful decisions while living in an abusive household. Adults, however, should not. What genuinely upset me about these scenes, however, is that the priest does not once use validation techniques. In peer counseling training I did my senior year of high school, one of the first things we were taught was to validate the feelings of those experiencing hard times. Even in situations where no actual wrong is happening, it is important to feel as if your feelings are heard. The priest does not do this for June, ever. No one does this for June. This would not bother me as the attitude presented by a character. However, the priest is very clearly framed as the most correct character in this book. This is the attitude presented by the book towards forgiveness. I don't think it's a good one. The thing about this book is that I would recommend this much more to adults who need to develop empathy than to kids actually in this situation, or those who have experienced it themselves. And that’s… fine, I guess? The popularity of A Little Life should indicate that this is something that resonates with people. Personally, however, this brought me very very low levels of catharsis or joy or anything I really read for. If I’m going to read a narrative about the impacts of abuse, I suppose I’d rather read one that focuses on the self-actualization and healthy growth of the protagonist, not one that simply tortures her for 300 pages with occasional bits of a romance. I do want to point out, as I think ers in other countries have been shocked by this: (view spoiler)[yes, execution of minors is actually an issue in the United States. It has been banned for those under 18 since 2005; however, minors can still be sentenced to life in prison. The United States also has a huge problem with racial disparity in incarceration rates. This is worth reading more about: black people in the US statistically receive longer sentences, are more likely to receive the death penalty, and are more likely to be incarcerated for nonviolent crimes. (hide spoiler)]The point is that I understand why this was written. I just didn't personally get very much out of it.

Maybe this is a natural consequence of living in a world where being careful is a necessary survival trait, where logic wears away the potential for something bigger and better than the obvious.”This is seriously one of the best worlds I've ever come across in YA and I want 10,000 more of these novellas. But wow, let me just gush about this series for a little while. Maybe my favorite thing is how expansive the worldbuilding has gotten. We've explored so many worlds and so many different people, and I just keep getting more interested. I am rarely this invested in a certain world, but I am so invested in this world. This book actually taught even more about the Worlds. For example, now we know it's not just nonsense and logic. There's also confection, which is nonsense with rules. I don't even want to know what nonsense will be like. And of course, there's the loose underworld / higher world binary. It's all just really interesting. I'm also really loving the themes presented here. Book one talks about women in society, being trans, and being ace. Book two talks about gender roles with the added addition of a lesbian character. Now we're in book three and we're talking about disabilities and how society treats fat people. Early on I wished this series could be a more racially diverse, but this novella improved a lot on that aspect. Her third mother had been the first to fit her with a prosthetic hand, which had pinched and dug into her skin and done nothing to improve her quality of life. The only things she hadn’t been perfectly capable of doing with one hand were things the prosthetic didn’t help her do anyway, lacking the fine motor control necessary to apply nail polish or thread a needle. If she’d been younger, maybe, or if she’d wanted it more, but the way it had been presented, like it was a great gift she wasn’t allowed to refuse, had only served to remind her that in the eyes of her adoptive family, she would always be the poor, pitiful orphan girl with a missing hand, the one they needed to help. She had never wanted that kind of help. She had only wanted to be loved. I think we might get a few more of these novellas, actually, considering how open that ending was. So, quick recap of everything in this book and all the last for the next time I read one of these. MAJOR SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH.(view spoiler)[Nancy's back in the halls of the dead.

While the characters aren’t my favorite ever, a few have serious potential. Sophos is a really sweet character I wanted the best for. (Am I the only one who spent around eight pages thinking him and Gen would be a thing?) The magus is a character I started out hating and ended up sort of liking. Gen, our lead character, has a sarcastic sense of humor and a somewhat duplicitous narrative that made him easy to love. Something that stood out to me here was the subtle discussion around classism, the mage’s belief that Gen is lesser because he is an immigrant. Some of the things he said about Gen’s culture – the comments about how he knows Gen’s culture better than Gen’s mother did.My biggest thesis statement about this book - my most overreaching opinion, if you will - is that this book is an extended prequel to what promises to be an intriguing series. And not to offend anyone, but honestly: isn’t that every first book in every good series I’ve read in my life? I’ve heard a lot that the sequels to this get better, and I totally believe it — the worldbuilding here is so complex, so intricate, that a mediocre first book is almost needed to build it up.

But unfortunately it’s also – and don’t kill me, I’m going to explain why I feel this way – not very good. This is a book about a stalker, with one interesting twist: he narrates. Which is horrifying and... kind of interesting, and Santino Fontana deserves an award for his audiobook narration. I will fully admit that this book does one thing really well: it makes you feel as if it could happen to you, to anyone. There’s something really scary about a thriller in which the villain is so outwardly nice, even believing within his mind that he IS kind. You can completely see why someone like Beck (who never goes beyond the outline of a person) likes Joe. The issue is that the ENTIRE BOOK is based off this gimmick, and it is four hundred twenty pages, and very little is done with the premise. I feel the need to explain how minimal the plot is: (view spoiler)[this book felt, to me, like it was building up to a revelation in which the girl Joe is stalking is actually going to try and kill him, which would’ve been so fucking badass. and then... He kills her and meets a new victim and that’s basically... it (hide spoiler)]. It's just... um, can't you can get the entire plot of this book from the blurb?My other problem with this book is that the narrative uses a purposeful failure to develop side characters to manipulate the audience. The narrative gains empathy for Joe by making you feel like you should feel empathy for Joe, and does it via what I think is a very boring path: i.e. by villainizing all the side characters and forgoing character depth entirely. Benjy and Peach are both awful and annoying and I don’t have any sympathy for either one of these characters. But… that’s because Caroline Kepnes doesn’t want me to. These two characters are villainized, with every moment of depth to their character taken away, so the narrative can find Joe— remember, the stalker, the dude who watches a girl masturbate and kidnaps and murders her?— the more sympathetic character. See, Kepnes sometimes does this thing with Beck where Beck will do something, Joe will think a thing about her motivations, and the audience can see on some level that he’s wrong, but... we wonder. THAT is a solid unreliable narrator—the lack of ability to figure out what’s real and what’s fake. But that delightful ambiguity is missing from most of the narrative. There is something so lazy and frustrating about caricaturizing the people around a stalker so you can gain audience sympathy for said stalker. Peach, specifically, is an example of both the predatory lesbian trope and also the bury your gays trope. Peach, on-page, masturbates to naked photos of her best friend that her best friend does not know she has. This is messed up behavior. Though of course he exaggerates this, Joe is proven right that Peach is, on some level, dangerous, and the audience feels no grief at her death. Love the only gay character in the book being a borderline sexual predator. It's not at all done before and absolutely was not mandated by law in the us to show how horrible and creepy gay people were. Oh no, really.I also found the running joke about chronic illnesses sort of strange. Joe keeps believing that everyone he knows is faking both their food allergies and chronic illnesses and in at least one circumstance, he’s proven right (Peach, again), thus proving “everyone in New York is faking illnesses” as right. Joe also does incredibly relatable customer service rants and both things are written in the same tone, set up in connection to Joe's annoyance with political correctness and elitism. Comments about People With Chronic Illnesses are framed in the same light as jokes about annoying Brooklyn hipsters, and I question the point of this. I get that to some readers, morality codes don’t apply because this book is ~edgy~ and ~dark~. And I enjoy compelling moral darkness. I just also know that implying people make up food allergies for fun isn’t compelling moral darkness, and playing into old tropes about lesbians isn't compelling moral darkness either. Playing into social norms isn't actually edgy at all. It's just kind of... boring. A derisive rant about Brooklyn hipsters is fun for a while, but not for 60% of a thriller. Glad you want to be edgy. Wish you could do it in a way that actually transgresses societal norms rather than enforcing them. I would love to think this book is being 'meta', sure, but I don't see a reason to think it is. And frankly, I wouldn't have liked it anyway. EDIT #1: Based on the incredible amount of angry comments on this , I think it's very important that we, as a society, google the Hays Code, or watch the Celluloid Closet, or even, very quickly, attempt to read the wikipedia article about the history of representation of gay, bi, and trans people in cinema. No, actually, it is not ever necessary to add a predatory lesbian who dies at the end to your book that contains no gay people. No, it is not subversive, and no, it is not new. It is important, in media literacy, to consider the impacts of the portrayals of gay and bi women. Please think critically. Overall: I’m just not impressed. yes, Kepnes can write, and yes, the concept is excellent. but there's nothing interesting being done with said premise. I’m annoyed that with such an interesting premise and with such wonderful writing, this felt so lazy.

I'm joining the ranks of almost every er on the page - the ending reveal is horribly anticlimactic, and I'd argue that element should've been changed. Yet aside from that one element, and just being overall kind of underwhelmed, I did really really like this? I've listened to a full five hours of this audiobook today and I think that formatting was a major misstep. The male narrator's character voicing is horrible; his Maya only has one tone, that of annoyance, and lacks the depth she's given in her own swaths of narration. And that's a shame, because I LOVED Maya. She's a very complex character; one who's hard to figure out, and one who's not entirely pure at all times. Or maybe not at all. In fact, she's quite hard to figure out; empathizing with the other girls one moment, but keeping to herself the next. I did want a bit more out of her in the antihero department, but as a character separated from my expectations, I adored her.At night the Garden was a place of shadows and moonlight, where you could more clearly hear all the illusions that went into making it what it was.The amazing thing about this book is its tone; even in moments where everything is hell, the book manages to keep things rather tonally flat, giving the book its signature creepiness. It executes perfect tonal shifts and never falters with its delicious horror. And while The Butterfly Garden never went the full distance I wanted, I do think this story is suspenseful and Maya's character is quite compelling. It came so close to being one of my new favorite books; just not quite there. I wanted more.Trigger warnings for abuse, rape, and a lot of generally messed-up content. I'd recommend this as a creepy read, although not as a mind-blowing one.

Milk and Honey is a collection full of emotion and meaning, but all the poems felt, to me, like unfinished pieces. Each little section of words could have been an amazing, cathartic experience... and yet, it just didn't go to that place for me. My favorite poems were the extended ones. For example, the poem on pages 140-141 was absolutely fantastic. I could read it over and over again. The rest, though? Nope. One good note, though: section four, the healing, was by far my favorite.

Honestly, I don't see the poetry her as being that similar to Nayyirah Waheed's, and that a lot of the concerns are simply about the fact that Kaur is bestselling while other poets are not, which isn't something she, personally, can control.

It is a book about how despising all communists and all British is always the wrong idea; people are people above all else. It's an important message and important story, but somehow, I just ended underwhelmed. Let's talk about why. Perhaps my biggest problem is missed expectations; the creativity and pull of the story is just not on par. Sedgwick's books get their power from being different; from being non-linear and focusing on subversive or different elements. But this book... focuses on a reporter working and loving in communist Russia. With linear storytelling. And that's essentially all there is to it. It starts off with a great fairytale element, but that storytelling element quickly disappears, leaving a somewhat lukewarm story. Sedgwick is just better when he's weirder.In terms of storytelling, there's some I liked and some I disliked. The reliance on instalove was a terrible decision, first of all. You can't care about a relationship you barely understand. I found myself pulled along by the story, but I was just not that invested. There is something to be said for just being really compelling. I had not read more than thirty pages of anything at once in a week before I picked this up. I read this in two sittings. Sedgwick is just that readable.VERDICT: Just as compelling as the rest of Sedgwick's work, but the story was far less creative than his better works. A decent book, but not a fantastic one.

Post my old thinkpiece on mental illness tropes in YA, and then proceed to go into how this book smacks it all down. Let's just call this a 5000 word essay on Why Francesca Zappia Is the Only YA Author I Trust With Mental Illness Narrative Framing Anymore. Seriously. ♔  MENTAL ILLNESS IS EXACTLY THIS.You know what trope I hate? The curing trope. You know what trope I'm tired of? The everything's-fine-until-I-go-off-meds trope. This book smacks both of those tropes down into the abyss. Alex is not cured. She starts the book with schizophrenia, and she ends the book with schizophrenia. You know what else I loved? The acknowledgement of Alex's agency. So many books about mentally ill people take away all their agency, turning the book into a parents-are-always-right extravaganza that feels disrespectful to mentally ill people themselves, especially those who are victims of parental abuse. I love that this book treats Alex like a fucking human being. I love that she's a reasonable person who happens to sometimes be unsure of what's real and not real. You know what makes me want to cry? The fact that y'all cannot get the balance right between mental-illness-makes-you-quirky and mental-illness-makes-you-evil. And yet Zappia gets it so right. Alex and Miles are so human. They're not some goddamn props for a thinly veiled romance that's supposed to be more emo because mental illness!! real problems!! but really just feels disrespectful and gross. But they're also not these especially evil people. They feel like human fucking beings and I love that. Seriously, I love it and I have so much respect for Zappia for handling this well. Obviously, I can't speak for the representation of schizophrenia being accurate. But I can definitely guarantee that it's empathetic. I would feel comfortable recommending this to any mentally ill person, and that's more than I can say for a lot of the books in this genre. ♔ THE BOOK ITSELF ROCKS Aside from mental health handling, this is really just a fantastic book. First of all, the character work is fabulous. Alex is one of the greatest characters ever. She's so strong. I love that she's so aware of herself and constantly questioning what's real and what's fake. I love that she's not your typical written-by-gross-tropes mentally ill protagonist. I just love her. And I loved the romance!! Miles, too, is a fantastically developed character. He's so weirdly dorky and offbeat. But he's also not the fake-quirky love interest you see in mental illness books sometimes. Zappia's plotting is also quite well-handled. Made You Up is fairly exciting and twisty for a typical contemporary book. I really didn't expect many of the twists - a few didn't even pop into my mind as possibilities. ♔ THE ENDING FALLS..........flat. I did have mixed feelings on the ending. I don't think it's terrible - I just feel it's not built up well. Spoilers ahead, by the way. Alex checks herself into a mental health facility. Now this isn't a bad ending - I actually think it's a good thing for her future. I just don't think this is built up well. Because the book portraying the mental health center as bad the whole way through - Alex's mindset - and then switching at the last minute - the real truth - Alex's final decision feels quite false and almost like a bad thing. I also think we don't get the sense that Alex is getting worse until the very end. She has some quote about “not being able to tell anymore” but she hasn't been able to tell in years. It felt a bit half-assed.I like that the narrative emphasizes how this was her choice, something she did to combat her own issues. Yay for emphasis on the agency of mentally ill people!! What I didn't like was the implication of “her mom was right all along.” Yes, her mom was right about her mental illness. Her mom was not right about forcing her into an psychiatric hospital. Whether that was a good decision or not, it felt to me that her mother was trying to control her, not help her get better. Part of this is coming from my heavy dislike for Alex's mom; hence my dissatisfaction with how ending treats her character. Alex's mom is a trash person, and the book knows this. I love that the book knows this. Unfortunately, I don't think the book was willing to stick with it. I think Zappia didn't want to ruffle feathers, so she decided to go with “she had Alex's best intentions at heart.” Here's the thing: I don't think she did. And even if she did, I don't think it justifies her actions. I think she's an abusive parent looking for control. and I really wish Alex had gotten to tell her off more at the end as well. But I honestly love this book with so much of my heart that I really want to just give it a five. It's just too good. This was a BR with Romie, and again, I am SO SORRY for reading these last 170 pages without you. It was so great.

I realized this was going to be a mixed-feelings book from the beginning and I thought that all the way through. So here I am with an exact middle-of-the-road rating. TW: self-harm, sexual content, violent illness, pretty much everything imaginable? (this does not impact my rating)Flynn is known for her intense psychology and her keen understanding of people. I don't deny those things are somewhat true. What I don't get is how you can take such a fabulous mystery idea and make the ending so obvious. Admittedly, I didn't totally anticipate the final twist. But it was my second choice for a solution. This book really failed to shock me, even with its eerie atmosphere. I do have to give some props to Flynn for her character work. Our lead character, Camille, is definitely compelling; if I hadn't hated the writing so much, I'm sure I would've been even more invested in her. She's effortlessly interesting even when she's a terrible person. Perhaps it's just that this is a debut novel, but I found Flynn's style extremely messy and disjointed. There's no denying she's talented; her descriptions are almost viscerally terrifying. But this 250-page book put me in a reading slump. I can't forgive that. I can't. I found this actively painful to read. The final 150 pages of Sharp Objects quite literally took me three hours to read. That's my average reading speed cut in half. I call bullshit. There's one more issue picking at my brain: Gillian Flynn has a weird relationship with other women. I appreciate her dedication to terrifying lady villains. I don't disagree with her claim that we need good ones. I also don't think the fact that her female characters are all terrible should have bearing; all her characters are terrible people. It's a function of her work and her beliefs about humanity. (Different topic I'd also like to address.) However, this book has a defined misogynistic tone to it; in fact, every girl is either a villain or a bimbo. Or both. The only possible exceptions to this are Camille and Amma, and even Amma fits this trope; she's just got some development on top of it. I think my problem with this book is that I can't tell what moral Flynn is going for: are women objects that get consumed, that love the attention of being ill? Or was that comment the work of an unreliable narrator? The protagonist, Camille, is certainly not the most reliable of mouthpieces. We know that what she says about her experience with the football team towards the beginning isn't entirely true. You've all seen the quote; in one scene, a man says a 13-year-old girl being passed around to have sex with four senior boys is rape, and Camille calls his claim sexist. Camille later on says she had “never realized until now how young that is.” It's not a reach to say Camille was guarding herself by faking apathy. But was that Flynn's intention? I don't know. Not sure I want to, either. VERDICT: Clunky writing killed an otherwise pretty good book. Even that ending wouldn't have really bothered me without that freaking writing. I'd recommend testing out her writing in this book before picking this up. I've heard from a few ers she improves, so don't judge off her other books.

They’re just not all that well developed. Part of this is the odd formatting. I’m sorry, but you can’t develop characters all that well with this format. They have no strong narrative voices because they can’t have narrative voices. I have to admit, there is one major expection to my “these characters are mediocre” rule. I love me some omniscient, mysterious narrators. Don’t want to give anything away, but the interviewer is far more interesting than that funny IT guy from Illuminae. I want to see more in the sequel for sure. This is my biggest problem with Illuminae as well, but that book at least inspired emotion out of me. There's one major difference in quality, and it is simply screaming. Illuminae doesn't have such a stupid love triangle. The love triangle here is… well, it’s idiotic. I hated the drama between these three so much. I honestly hated it so much that I began to hate these two male characters in general. Who fucking cares about who ends up with who?

The entire plotline of a child Nazi falling in love with a Jewish reporter is clever, sure, but I really don't know if I like how it's being handled. I dislike this whole trope of “bigoted person falls in love with member of oppressed group they hate.” There are two things I don't love about this storyline. First, I really feel like... stories of overcoming bigotry are important and can be amazing, obviously, but a lot of the romantic ones make it all about the bigot and not at all about the oppressed person. Why the fuck does Daniel, a Jewish man, care about Gretchen, who's being raised by Nazis? I understand that Gretchen saves a Jewish man in the first few chapters of this book, and Daniel sees this, but Gretchen also says several terrible things to Daniel in the first half. Yet we, the audience, are meant to take it for granted that he cares about her anyway. It doesn't quite make sense. Second, I feel like an evolution from bigotry to acceptance, coming from a romance, just does not work. Or, okay, I suppose it could, with some really pitch-perfect execution. But it's very easy to fall into that you're-the-only-good-one narrative. To be fair, I think Anna Blankman is really trying to execute this element well. But unfortunately, the romance feels really weak and just doesn't work.In other areas, this book felt a bit weak - it had a lot of typical 2012 YA issues. But those could easily gave been remedied later on.

In fact, there are not a ton of shocking plot reveals, which we all know are my favorite thriller things. But nonetheless, this keeps you engaged because of the supremely good ghost stories. The thing with ghost stories is they have to get the atmosphere down, and I think this book did. The Vermont boarding school has the perfect creepy and beautiful vibe to bring out the fear, and the writing is so engaging that it makes it impossible to put down. But it’s not just the atmosphere; this has some of the best theme work I’ve seen in a thriller. I mean, it’s essentially a book about four girls at a boarding school where they’ve been forgotten all coming together and becoming close friends. The other theme here is a spoiler, but I loved it: (view spoiler)[murdering Nazis. (hide spoiler)]The Broken Girls is told via dual story lines, past and present, with one following friends Katie, Roberta, Cece, and Sonia in 1950 and one following journalist Fiona in 2014. The past timeline… is way more interesting. I’m sorry, but we know it’s true. Perhaps it’s because the past chapters, despite less ghost activity, are the scariest. Seriously, did I mention: the past chapters are deeply terrifying on both a simple and existential level. The author plays up the feeling of being trapped that our leads are going through, the feeling of being unbelieved as their friends are threatened. Perhaps even more interesting, this book plays off the feat of being forgotten and uncared for perfectly. It’s incredibly difficult to put the book down, but it’s also so difficult to keep reading. overall this book was a fantastic read, eerie and interesting and with excellent characters. exactly what I wanted out of thriller.

I've actually never read anything by her before, but I saw her speak at my local bookstore recently and absolutOkay, first of all: I love Roxane Gay. I've actually never read anything by her before, but I saw her speak at my local bookstore recently and absolutely loved it. She was one of the funniest speakers we've ever had, I think. I also love that she's a famous feminist who isn't a skinny straight white woman. Nothing against skinny straight white woman; it's just great to see famous feminists who have different marginalized identities, too. Unfortunately, as much as I respect her, I'm not sure how much I liked this book. I really can't even remember the last time I felt so mixed about a story collection. First of all, it's more about relationships between men and women than anything else. I just tried to find a counterexample to prove the rule and realized there isn't one. Every single one of these focuses on the relationships between men and women. That's fine, it's just something I think you should know going in. And unfortunately, many of these stories didn't feel all that new or different to me. For example, at least a few of these are love stories in which the main character deals with hate of some kind. And possibly the most troubling to me - at least ten of these stories have protagonists who are turned on at some point by men being sexist or generally shitty. I'm not joking. That's not necessarily a bad story; I know Roxane Gay herself has talked about feeling this way due to her own experiences. It just felt very repetitive. It's also completely unrelatable for me personally. I'm gay, turned on exclusively by kindness, and also a very non-sexual person in general, so basically nothing about that was relatable to me. And unfortunately, these stories rely on you relating. Honestly, the only two stories with protagonists I found at all relatable were How and La Negra Blanca. Guess which my two faves were. I have to admit that this pattern of storytelling felt kind of alienating to me as a gay woman. There's so much here about the girl being turned on because the guy doesn't treat her like she's made of glass. My dude, that is the bare fucking minimum. I've also seen this marketed a lot as being very intersectional, and though Roxane Gay definitely has a lot of intersectional identities, I felt this collection used stereotypes far more than it deconstructed them. There's the getting-turned-on-by-men-being-terrible thing, of course. But there are also a few characters in here who seemed to me like stereotypical predatory lesbians - a trope which, by the way, I have never seen occur in reality. With only one story here, How, that contains a love story between two women, this felt a little eh to me. What made this even weirder to me is that Roxane Gay is openly bi (also this tweet is so funny?? what an icon). I think she may have been trying to deconstruct stereotypes, but to me, some of these characters felt like enforcing stereotypes more than deconstructing. Of course, there's nothing wrong with being stereotypical as a real person. But these aren't real people. They're characters in stories. One more thing you should know going in: there's no thesis to many of these. These stories are explorations, not thesis papers. It's also interesting to note that these stories are interesting to be looked at as a whole, rather than separately. Reviewing all of them may even have been a bad choice on my part, but it took around twenty stories for me to realize that, so you got full s too!! REVIEWS I'M SUPER INTO♔ I Will Always Follow You - ★★★★☆ Two sisters remember their kidnapping as children. It's good, well-written with good characters. I just wanted a little more, to be honest. ♚ Water, All Its Weight - ★★☆☆☆A woman causes stains to form on her bedroom ceiling throughout her life. It's a metaphor for feminism, probably. What was this? ♔ The Mark of Cain - ★★★☆☆A woman married to a man with an identical twin. This is another of those metaphorical stories, but for some reason I enjoyed this. Unfortunately, just like the other metaphor stories, it had the biggest non-ending I've ever read. Yes, I'm aware that was the point. But it kind of fizzled for me. ♚ Difficult Women - ★★★☆☆ Thoughts about different kinds of women.  I have slightly mixed thoughts on this. It's powerful in a way, but it really does more stereotyping than exploring those stereotypes.♔ FLORIDA - ★★★☆☆ Snapshots of life at a Florida gated community. This was really too short. It's a study of race, class, and gender in rich areas, and it really doesn't offer any new insight. I wanted more. ♚ La Negra Blanca - ★★★★★This shattered me in the best way. It feels a lot more like the traditional slice-of-life I expected, just like I Will Always Follow You, and it's very powerful. I think I liked the slice-of-lifes best. This is one of the few stories where the main character isn't turned on by Men Being Shitty. Sarah is turned on by having a healthy relationship with her neighbor Alvarez. They're the only couple in this collection I truly stan for. ♔ Baby Arm - ★★☆☆☆Yet another metaphorical story. There's a fight club and a glass baby arm and some really odd threesome dirty talk. Don't ask. ♚ North Country - ★★★☆☆ This is... also very metaphorical. By this point I'd begun to realize this collection is more about relationships between men and women than anything else. For example, this is a love story in which the main character deals with hate from a lot of different sources. That's what the last two stories were about, too. I didn't hate this and I don't think stories like this have no place - experiences like this are important. But these experiences are all so similar as to the recovery part of things. This pattern honestly felt kind of alienating to me. Can't a few of these women not end up with a guy? ♔ How - ★★★★★I liked this one a lot!! It's the story of an escape, following Hanna, her twin sister Anna, and her friend Laura. I loved the characters and the romantic relationship. ♚ Requiem for a Glass Heart - ★★★☆☆ Wow, this was pointless and fake-deep. Men cheat on their wives because... they think their wives are too delicate? Alright, I guess so? At least the writing is good, I guess. ♔ In the Event of my Father's Death - ★★★☆☆This follows a girl whose cheating father has just died. I enjoyed this, but... I didn't love it. Why? Because this is four pages long. Literally. Look at the story. It's four fucking pages. ♚ Break All the Way Down - ★★★★★This is about a woman trying to punish herself and trying to find her way home. It's one of those stories that hits you in the chest. ♔ Bad Priest - ★★★☆☆ Again, this seemed kind of pointless. There's no thesis; it's more an exploration of faith and selfishness. That being said, it's written very well and the characters felt real. ♚ Open Marriage - ★★☆☆☆I can't even  this. It's two fucking pages. A man suggests an open marriage to his wife and she's okay with it, because metaphor. It got two stars for being well-written and short enough to get that shit over with. ♔ A Pat - ★★☆☆☆Again, two pages is not a story. I guess it didn't annoy me enough to give it a lower rating. Her writing is really good. ♚ Best Features - ★★★☆☆Exploration of misogyny experienced when being fat. Fits the collection well, but individually it felt just okay. ♔ Bone Density - ★★☆☆☆Dissecting affairs. Again, I really can't imagine anyone reacting like this to an affair. Why are all of these women turned on by men being disappointments? Not to be shady @ men right now, but wouldn't that just lead to constantly being turned on? ♚ I Am a Knife - ★★★☆☆It's all a metaphor. For something. The writing of this is stunning, though, maybe the best in the whole collection. ♔ The Sacrifice of Darkness - ★★★★☆This was really weird, but the quotes? And what it has to say about greed? Stunning. I felt like I got what Roxane Gay meant here, what she wanted to convey, everything. ♚ Noble Things - ★★★★☆This is an interesting story. It's about politics and war, set in a future dystopian world. It would be fun to get a whole book out of this one short story. One thing, though: can't authors realize the far west coast has water? Given what's said about water production, I'm assuming Roxane Gay meant for Washington and Oregon to be included in the northern colonies with California. They have too much water to be dry. ♔ Strange Gods - ★★★☆☆This is Gay's personal story, so I feel weird rating it lower. But honestly, I didn't enjoy this much. VERDICT: Gay didn't put a thesis on most of these stories, so guess what? I don't have to have a thesis for this . Make your own decision based on my  and others. I think this will be a polarizing collection.Blog | Goodreads| Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Jun 26, 2017","Jul 17, 2017","May 05, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28818921-difficult-women

When her asylum request gets turned down, she's given an opportunity to stay in the U.S.: to literally take on the grief of another girl about her age. The girl, Ray, isn't aware of what's happening; she's only aware that they're both going through a treatment together. It's a really complicated narrative about how immigrants are devalued and pushed into negative jobs. The only reason Marisol can be offered this job is because no one else would be willing to take it: she's in a desperate position, and because she's in a desperate position, she's essentially preyed upon for this job. Marisol, as a lead, is a character who could so easily be meek or boring: for a lot of the book, she’s unwilling to speak up. But her strength comes out in other ways. She's willing to do anything to protect her sister and her loved ones, even if she's not always willing to do everything to stick up for herself. She also, throughout the book, falls in love with Ray, the girl who she's taking the grief away from. The romance between them is written in such an interesting and respectful way. I ended up really getting invested despite, when I first was coming across the premise of this relationship, feeling a little skeeved out. This would be such an easy narrative to get wrong, to make feel disrespectful to Marisol or one-sided. But it's just tender, and it's just sweet. The narrative doesn’t prioritize romance only, either: it allows Marisol to find some kind of family with Olga, for example, who's a really interesting side character.In general, the narrative is respectful and handles complex topics with a deft hand. There are a few characters in here that could very easily be villainized, both of whom are treated with more nuance. This book was wonderfully well-done, and well-written, and I know it’ll stick with me for a long time.

A tree could be so alive it felt like a challenge. It could turn sunlight into long knives and stab them right through you.4 1/2 stars. The Lost Coast follows Danny, a girl who moves to a small California town and joins a group of witches searching for their lost member, Imogen, after her new friend Sebastian dies. Amongst the Grays, as they call themselves, there are four remaining: →June, Filipina lesbian with chronic pain and knife magic. I loved this character and wanted more from her. →Leila, ace-spec and non-binary and coded as aro though the word is not used, which is weird). Her friendship with June was so excellent and I wanted 100% more. Tree magic. →Hawthorn, black and bisexual and raised by a chaotic mother named Ora. At once quiet and a force.→Rush, queer and fat, ex-girlfriend to Imogen. Has sound-taste synesthesia and uses music to make magic. My favorite character.This is a book that depends, primarily, on a feeling of wrongness, a feeling of some imperceptible something having broken in the world. Amy Rose Capetta’s writing is absolutely magical as usual, immediately getting the audience immersed in the atmospheric world of the novel. I was joking about the raven cycle but sapphic thing, but let’s be real — that is kind of what is so great about this. The Lost Coast is interesting in that it uses a similar aesthetic and mood to that series, but at once feels totally distinct. The Pacific coast vibe is very different from nowhere, Virginia, for one; in what is probably a coincidence, several character elements feel almost like a direct response to that series in a way I really liked. Yet most importantly are the themes. Would my entire life have been easier if I’d known about that word? Would I have figured it out on my own, or would I have pushed through without it?Witchery in this book functions as somewhat of a metaphor for identity and it’s very subtle and very beautifully done. These six are outsiders, people who have not found their home in the mainstream and so have created a community of their own. I’ve found the heart of another secret: the Grays are always touching and kissing each other because so many before us couldn’t. Each kiss carries the weight of so many kisses that never were. Every touch is an invisible battle won.I think as queer people — and also as marginalized people in general — we are often very alone. Being queer is an experience, in a lot of ways, of being the outsider; you grow up seeing everyone around you be one way and feel, fundamentally, like an outsider. This is something I’ve written about recently but it’s something this book explicitly tackles. It’s about community as something radical, about love between people – and specifically between queer people, specifically women and nonbinary queer people – as something that can save and heal. In this book, magic functions best in a group built on mutual trust; the love between the five (six) witches is what saves and heals. I think the only reason this is a 4½ and not a five is because I honestly… wanted more? I think this book would have worked really nicely as a series — there are actually seven separate characters to explore here, and we only got four arcs. That’s an absolutely fine number for a single book; it’s just that I closed the book wanting to get that much deeper both into the existing characters and into new characters. Petition for a sequel that deals with June and Lelia’s friendship and also Hawthorne and also the ending dynamic. Oh. For another positive, the ending goes in a direction that I absolutely love. It is one of the more ambiguous endings I’ve read in recent memory but I think it’s going polyamory. That is absolutely what I wanted from The Raven Cycle sapphic thanks for that !!!!Also, Amy Rose Capetta’s dedication to her partner, author Cori McCarthy, was really wonderful: I’ll always remember that long night drive to the Lost Coast. We found the town that became Tempest, and the entire story spilled out from there. We found each other, and everything changed. You are what I was searching for.Like god anyone else crying? The point is that between Spellbook of the Lost and Found, Wild Beauty, Toil and Trouble, and this, I'm just going to call magic gay now and have it done with. And also push this book on anyone who wants The Raven Cycle sapphic (we’re not going to talk about how many times that phrase has come up in my tweets).

There’s honestly not much else to say about this book. Despite being incredibly short, I think Dear Martin speaks for itself about racism and hatred and prejudice. It’s hard to write a book that makes a reader feel, but reading this book just made me feel like I was being punched in the gut, over and over. This was just so emotionally real. While the characters may not get many specific traits, they all feel so much like real people. It takes a lot of talent to make characters feel so true in so few pages. Where this book truly exceeds, though, is the thematics. I'd utterly second my friend Destiny's words as to the themes of internalized racism. What I specifically loved about this book, and something I'm not sure you'll get from any other book, is the emphasis on Justyce's feeling like a political debate rather than a person. Holy shit, this is the realest feeling as marginalized person. It's like your personhood is being taken away. You are nothing but the thing that cuts you off, not to your friends, to your enemies, to your teachers. You are there to be a political pawn. You are there to be a counterexample. None of your opinions are your own - they are your group's opinions, because god forbid we think of marginalized people as anything but a monolith. There is so much about this here, done in a way that's sensitive and kind. I think no one put it better than Adriana @PerpetualPages in  their  - this book asks, and better yet, doesn't try to perfectly answer, whether the time for respectability politics is over. I feel like people are going to ignore this because of The Hate U Give, an equally important and fantastic book: and can I just say: you shouldn't. Yes, they're both kind of about #blacklivesmatter, but they deal with different facets of racism and in completely different ways. The Hate U Give deals with cop violence and racial profiling, yes, but I'd argue that its focus lies on how to stand up in a society filled with systematic racism. Meanwhile, Dear Martin focuses on toxic masculinity and the socialization of black boys in our society, the way in which they are taught they are more criminal than everyone else in some indefinable way. Both have slightly different focuses when discussing racism, both are very different books, and both are totally worth reading.It wasn't quite a five star book for me; the beginning felt a little rough, in particular. After a heartbreaking and near-perfect first couple chapters, the middle section is meditative and dialogue-full with a romance that feels somewhat bland. But in the end, it all works to the book's advantage. The second half of this book makes everything worth it. I truly felt so much towards the end. And in fact, the ending of this book is one of the best book endings I have ever read. It is so full of hope - hope for change, hope for continued life, hope for us to continue growing as people and as nations. A lot of the changes we can make in the future need to be guided along by people in positions of privilege. We need to be here. It's our responsibility to support fantastic books like this that speak to the importance of ending racism.

I only wish the other characters had fit in. CONS— This entire thing is like bad fanfiction. I'm sorry, it really is. The villain especially is laughably non-scary.

(hide spoiler)]— There was so much queerbaiting oh my god... we could've had canonical gay characters, right? But nooooooooooo. Let's just play around with this mess of queerbaiting. — Everything about the golden trio's characterization is false. This play continues all the movie version's bad trends. We all remember that in the movies, Ron’s best lines are often given to Hermoine, like “if you're going to kill him, you’ll have to go through us!!” Ron is used as a comedic plot device here. Harry is also characterized as a borderline abusive parent, which is just so messed up. None of it seems to fit Harry's character in the book series. The characters just don't come through well.— The next generation is totally underutilized. Albus is the only child of the Golden Trio who even gets a solid characterization. The one other relevant character, Rose, is used entirely as a love interest. She's portrayed as prejudiced and annoying and never gets any arc related to it.

Everything about this book depends on your emotional connection to this story - primarily, your ability to connect with narrative around having a useless parent. And… I did. Guys, I’m going to have a hard time ing this objectively: this book was almost overwhelmingly emotional for me. This is yet another book that drew me in so much that I basically had to let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding when I finally put the freaking book down. Y’all have got to stop complaining about that because I have started doing it constantly. Bear with me for this next weird sentence: Grace’s mother is one of the most well-written shitty parents of all time. I feel like a lot of depictions of shitty parents in YA literature have to depict the abusive parent as the Shitstain Of The Earth and it feels so erasive of the fact that, well, most parents are in shades of grey. The implication seems to be that parents need to be totally gross 100% of the time to be True AbusersTM, which feels so toxic and gross and weird and I hate it. But Grace’s mom? She is not that. She is a shitty parent who has humanity but whose humanity does not negate her horrible treatment of Grace. That is so important to me. And Grace’s character arc is so freaking perfect. I honestly found myself connecting so, so much to her within her story of learning to trust and overcome some of the effects of her mother’s abuse. As the lovely Sana put it, this is a book about learning you’re not okay, and more importantly, that it’s okay to not be okay.Quick Other Things Ya Girl Loved So Much♔ Grace and Ella are my kids. They are so cute and adorable and sweet and great!! And I love their pure relationship!! I love my children!! but also - there's angst between them that isn't drama.♚ The diversity is awesome? okay, it's a romance between a traumatized bi lead who says the fucking word bi (ONE GODDAMN TIME) and a biracial lesbian and it was SO NICE bye I loved this♔ the platonic!! relationship!! between a guy and a girl!! that never gets romantic!!♚ I love all the characters so so much thank you for coming to my ted talkANYWAY.

Sometimes you have to live I shrug. “My momma always said the best way to get what you want from people is to give them what they think they want. Sometimes you have to live down to people’s expectations, Kate. If you can do that, you’ll get much further in life.”Honestly, black zombie hunters in the Reconstruction era is definitely the best historical fiction concept of all time. And the fact that this totally, completely lived up to my hopes? Even better. I think this is a book action fans are going to enjoy. Dread Nation may be a full 450 pages, but I felt like this book never stopped moving. I even felt - and I never say this about 500 page books, because come on - that I could've broken a reading slump with this. I solidly enjoyed every moment I spent reading. Beyond the nonstop action, I adored our two lead characters. Yes, I said two lead characters, but for once the other lead isn't our badass girl lead's love interest - she's her girl best friend. THANK GOD. ➽ Jane, our lead, is a fantastic actress, fantastic liar, and even, at times, a slightly unreliable narrator. And she loves dragging people. And she is the bi icon we all need in our lives. While I somewhat wished she has a more solid character arc - you all know me and my character arcs - her character has such a strong voice that I ended up loving her anyway. ➽ Katherine, a character so developed I'd almost consider her a protagonist, is so good. She's black, but light skinned enough to pass as white, something that leads to resentment from her fellow trainees. Also, she's established quite clearly as ace-aro without the terminology being used, which: A+.Besides the nonstop action and the character work, the best thing about this book is probably the theme work.  Jane and Katherine's friendships originates from a plotline involving slut-shaming, girl competition, and Jane's own internalized dislike for lighter-skinned black people being majorly subverted. And given that there's no romance, the friendship between Jane and Katherine serves as the centerpiece of the book. And the themes around racism are so well-done - this is an ownvoices book and it definitely shows. Okay, and also, a rant: hooooooo boy, I am such a slut for history. This is un-boring historical fiction that still keeps all the nerdy references.  The worldbuilding is full of nods to history. The use of terms like the Five Civilized Tribes, “War Between The States,” and “War Of Northern Aggression.” The entire thematic point of the combat schools for black and indigenous people. Deep South States are now called Lost States of the South due to lack of patrols and lack of winter during which dead lie down, the mention of germs as a controversial idea and idea of an original Gettysburg strain and a transferable Custer strain, the scientific racism developing around “coloreds,” the conflict of party-based Survivalists vs the Egalitarians, and the little details of the worldbuilding, like the fact that carriages are called ponies because all the horses have all been eaten - it's all there and it's all brilliant. YES, I AM A NERD. LEAVE ME ALONE. While there's a cast of intriguing side characters, something I really enjoyed here is that for the most part, the characters facing oppression are the focus. While characters like Professor Ghering and Miss Duncan are given dimension, the lens of the book falls mainly on characters like Red Jack, who are actually dealing with the problems caused by slavery. It's both a realistic aspect, considering Jane narrates, and an aspect that I really appreciate and haven't seen in enough books thus far. As several comments on negative or mediocre s of this book seem to imply that people only like this book because they respect the author, I want to clarify that at least for me, this is a  of the book, not the author. I have had no trouble in the past giving negative s to people I respect, and frankly, it seems disrespectful to both Ireland herself and to the positive ers on this page to imply that people only liked the book because they like the author. Like, dude, if you don't like this book that's fine, but don't get offended by the fact that other people did like this book? Maybe they just disagreed with you. Come on.Listen, diverse YA historical fiction is really bringing back literature right now. It's not a coincidence that all three of the BR Squad - Melanie, Destiny, and I - gave this a full five. Not only is this book relevant, especially now, it's also just one of the most enjoyable books I've read recently. I can hardly wait for Dread Nation to release. I don't even know how I'm going to wait for the sequel - reread, maybe? But either way, you are all going to love this.**I actually do want to note that the author tweeted something recently that seemed to imply Asian people are white, which was very odd, and then didn't really clarify and instead doubled down?? So idk how we're feeling about that. I would definitely recommend this book [I love this book].

That is where our power resides.”In the town of Three Graces, no one is ever injured or killed. To achieve this, the town must sacrifice a boy every seven years — but this year, the sacrifice comes early. Following an angry boy, a saint, and a witch, this book is a weird and magical journey.→the good stuff←I memed in thisFirst of all, god, you guys, the body horror. The tone that feels like a blend of 1300s witchcraft and modern-day horror movies. I absolutely adored how the creepiness of this situation was played up. I also adored the writing. I feel like this would be great for fans of The Raven Cycle, with its weird magical tone. Perhaps more importantly, the three leads are great.✔Arthur – constantly in gender questioning hell. retweets memes about mean costumers. is the mean costumer.✔Rhun – the nicest person in the whole fucking world and I love him. said something bitter once and Mair and Arthur both keep the receipts in their phone. not all men? you’re right. Rhun Sayer would never do this✔Mairwen – a witch. probably runs one of those your-fave-is-a-witch blogs. hates her emotions but hates terrible men more. proud thirsty bitchThe story focuses, in a big part, on the poly relationship between the three of them, and I really really liked that [although I did want more; I talked about this down below]. Also, an iconic queer trio; Rhun is black and bi/pan, Arthur is also bi/pan and probably nonbinary, Mair is also implied to be bi/pan.→the bad stuff←oh boy.The worldbuilding around homophobia was a bit confusing? So, this world comes off as non-homophobic… most of the time. There are several explicitly bi/pan side and main characters, including Arthur, Rhun, and Mairwen’s mother; both Mairwen and Haf read as sapphic; the narrative seemingly treats it as a very normalized thing. But this society also has incredibly strict gender roles and a lot of transphobia, and moreover, the characters react as if this world is at the very least transphobic. (view spoiler)[[There’s a very well-written scene near the beginning in which Rhun attempts to kiss Arthur, and Arthur pushes him away because he’s “not a girl” and seems confused that Rhun wants to kiss him anyway.] (hide spoiler)] As none of the characters seem to explicitly align themselves with queer identity in any way, and the world seemingly treats it as normal most of the time, it feels… idk, as if the author didn’t want a homophobic world, but didn’t know how to write a non-homophobic world? Which then reads like simple lack of acknowledgement.A major plot point of this story is that Arthur, who is AMAB, was forced to dress as a girl as a kid, and then it was realized that “he was a boy” via him stripping when he was about eight. He reads as being nonbinary, at least to me, but as this isn’t explicit text, it could very easily read as a book about a cis boy suffering from transphobia. I felt this was well handled for what it was, but… I don’t know.SPOILER ALERT: I really wish I had known going in that the only major sapphic relationship ends in death. The bury your gays trope, a trope I have discussed at length on my blog, is very prominent in both current literature and current television. And killing off one member of a happy relationship between women is the #1 iteration in current tv. So despite the fact that there’s a lot of queer rep in this story, this didn’t sit right with me at all.The main problem I had is the structure. Moreover, the first act of the story is really, really long, extending 40% into the book, and is framed like a buildup to a climax - but then we see nothing of the climax. There’s just a time-jump, and suddenly we’re past the forest. It’s an odd instance of a buildup with no release and it was frustrating.The plot, in general, goes a little all over the place? There are a couple instances of side characters having one pov chapter that doesn’t say very much, and then never having a pov chapter again. Several side plot threads seem like they go nowhere, or maybe they're not meant to be plot threads? Several very unnecessary and/or underutilized side characters. Oh, another thing is that all of the interesting stuff in this story is told in subtext, which means none of the characters really ever come to terms with their own problems or more importantly, the reality of their three-person relationship. There are literally multiple moments that go like this:✔Rhun: I kissed Arthur✔Mair: silence ft. barely any fucking internal monologue Like, I’m sorry, but where. are. these. characters. mentally. You can’t just tell me they’re all in love and have that be the end, I have to know how their actual dynamic works!! Three people being in love does not an actually healthy relationship make. And the moment where they discuss this, the release of tension, again, does not ever come.I will also fully admit to having the most emotions about Rhun and Arthur’s relationship. I really liked the dynamic between Rhun and Mairwen; however, they’re an established relationship, and I never really got a sense of tension between them? And I’m just going to be honest, the relationship between Mairwen and Arthur was half-assed. They talked, like, once.And as the relationship between the three characters really has no ending, I really struggled with the seemingly lacking connection between the plot and the characters. the most interesting elements of this novel feel pushed to the side by a plot I really struggled to care about. It’s a decent plot for a novel, don’t get me wrong, but when the main arc of the novel — the three of them forming a relationship — does not tie into the main plot at all, the book feels incoherent.So… overall, I guess you could say I had mixed feelings. Considering I just shouted for three pages on this google doc.➽further reading:Marija's relatable three-star Melanie's fantastic five-star ✨Arc received from the publisher via Edelweiss for an honest .

How falling in love with your secretary can change the course of someone’s life forever. How swerving in a car can get two teens together. How calling a security officer can save her life. It sort of tore my heart into a million pieces.Fuck, okay. I don’t know how to explain how much I feel about this book. “You were expecting something...”More poetic,” she says.“Are you kidding? Most poems are about sex.”She's skeptical. “Do you have actual data to back that up? I wanna see some numbers.”“Scientist!” I accuse. “Poet!” she retorts.Let's start here. Before I lose all my credibility: yes, this book is about instalove, and yes, I ended up absolutely loving the relationship. I will say two things. First, that they don’t really fall in love - they see the possibility that they could. And personally, I think seeing the possibility of a future is a very real thing. There’s a Japanese phrase that I like: koi no yokan. It doesn’t mean love at first sight. It’s closer to love at second sight. It’s the feeling when you meet someone that you’re going to fall in love with them. Maybe you don’t love them right away, but it’s inevitable that you will.And second… it’s written really well. Their relationship is just... so soft? It's sweet, in that way first love is, and it's supportive, in that way good love is. And they call each other out on their shit.Because you don't love me, Daniel. You're just looking for someone to save you. Save yourself.I will also fully admit that I didn’t really connect with Natasha and Daniel’s relationship in the first hundred pages - not until I connected with their characters. But holy shit, towards the end? There is a REASON I sobbed REAL TEARS while reading this book. You know I’m discerning about my romantic couples and I have chosen well.But... the romance is not all this book is about. The real focus of the book, instead, is on the issues faced by immigrants. On one hand, we have Natasha, a science girl, complete icon, and illegal immigrant from Jamaica who is being deported at the end of the day after her father has been picked up. On the other hand, we have Daniel, a child of South Korean immigrants whose family wants him to become a doctor but who wants his own life as poet. There’s just… oh my god, there’s so much here?If people who were actually born here had to prove they were worthy enough to live in America, this would be a much less populated country.What is happening to Natasha is horrible, and Yoon does not shy away from its horror. Natasha has lived here, in America, her whole life. She has been picked up due to a mistake made by her father. It is not her fault she has been picked up. It is not her fault she illegally immigrated in the first place. She cannot change it. And yet here she is, being forced to uproot her whole life for another’s mistake. There is something so honest about how this is written, about the way Natasha’s pain is conveyed here.But that’s not all. There is a discussion here about the social stigma against “bad hair” - i.e. black hair - and how that is perpetrated by black hair care places, like the one owned by Daniel’s parents. There is honest discussion of the contrast between emotions and science, whether you can quantify fate or put a box around love. There is honest discussion of parent-child relationships, in many flavors; of evil, of fate, of suicide. And the characters. Okay, I’m going to say something weird and reference high school English: Natasha and Daniel form perfect narrative foils to each other. They each have super distinct voices and personalities. Also, apparently this is an unpopular opinion [what can I say? stanning underrated lady characters is my brand] but I love Natasha so much I might start crying!! The way she is written is just… she conveys so many emotions I have felt in my past, even though we’re in totally different situations. There’s honestly a lot of talent in making the audience relate on such a personal level to a character I share no situation in common with.Listen, I know I’ve said a lot, but I don’t think I have said enough. This book deeply affected me. I don’t think I have ever read a book crying so hard I couldn’t turn pages. I can tell you to please, please read this - even if you think you won't like it. Literally, this was my first note about this book:me, performing self sabotage by reading a romantic contemporary when I know I dislike romantic contemporary? it’s more likely than you think[do you remember what a fetus I was just a mere month ago, thinking I would hate this book... who was she....]The Sun Is Also a Star was such a fantastic read and I know it will stay with me forever - I’m getting chills just thinking about it, and I have a feeling I always will. I just remember finishing this book and wanting to cry because I love human beings, and even when the world is unfair, it gives us what we deserve in the end.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,569,1,"Jan 14, 2018","Jan 14, 2018","May 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28763485-the-sun-is-also-a-star

I, however, really enjoyed my experience reading this, and sped through it quickly. So let's just sum it up - this will be fun if:1) you genuinely enjoy reading fast-paced heist urban fantasy.Who doesn’t enjoy campy fantasy sometimes? Okay, yeah, maybe I need to be in a specific mood to enjoy this specific category. But I tend to really enjoy the fast, slump-breaking reading experience this type of book offers. A+ for that. 2) you have spent a lot of time poking fun at cliche fantasy books that you really liked.This book spends a decent amount of its time poking fun at itself. And guess what? It is fucking hilarious. The main character’s voice, in particular, is just glorious and sardonic and fun, and I absolutely love it. 3) you enjoy pulpy you-kind-of-know-what's-happening but-you're-still-along-for-the-ride kind of books where all the characters are pretty likable.You know Cassandra Clare? She’s popular because she gets you invested in the characters and then you’re so invested that you just enjoy the ride. There’s a cool lady friendship to root for feat. a total nerd girl and absolutely no dumb miscommunication. An exes plotline that you totally know the direction of but enjoy nonetheless. A strong family dynamic that is so easy to root for. I am not going to pretend this will be a book I find extremely memorable; however, I am going to totally lean into how much fun I had reading it and recommend it to anyone who finds the prior description somewhat intriguing. I laughed reading it!! It broke through my slump!! So I would recommend.

If we bring up anything, people say we're bitches who can't just drop it. This book changed me as a person.Still Life With Tornado is about a lot of things, but most of all, it's about how teenagers are discounted - especially teenage girls. Teens are vehicles for drama rather than being real people. Our feelings aren't feelings - they're drama. And this becomes even worse in cases of abuse, in relationships with parents, because no one will listen. It's easy to pat the kid on the head and say it's okay, you imagined it, everything will be fine. But does that even matter? Your kid is there now, they're being screwed up now. God, maybe it's hard to convey how much this book meant to me. Even these words are coming off as teen angst to half my readership, aren't they? Maybe it's worth considering: why is it teen angst when it's a sixteen-year-old and real emotions when it's a forty-year-old? What's the real difference when both of us are people, humans with emotions and feelings and moods and anger?I don't know why I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm scared to make my mother angry. My emotions are smaller than they should be. I'm the one who should be angry, but I'm cranky or upset. As if a sixteen-year-old can't be angry for real.Okay. Let's talk about why this book Sarah's voice especially stands out here. She's a very different person from me, but her voice felt so incredibly authentic to me. She speaks in absolutes, all-or-nothings. I just felt as if I could dissect her voice, dissect every thing she said, and get to the heart of her character. This book is also about another topic, and I think it'll be quite easy to guess if you check a few s. And maybe it’s best to go in cold and not knowing what this book is about, but as it might be triggering for readers: this book deals primarily with abuse. And I absolutely adored how this topic was dealt with.Hitting a person is the same as screaming at a person, is the same as head hands and traps and bait and all that hard-to-define emotional abuse. This is why I never said anything about Miss Smith. It's why I never took my headpiece seriously. It's sneaky. It hides under other words and other actions. That's all abuse ever is. That sliver of tissue is power.A quick note about the topic for those who have read this book: (view spoiler)[What I liked about this is the handling of emotional abuse on the part of the lead also character’s father directed at her older sibling. It is something the main character has severely repressed, which is a topic I haven’t seen handled before. Which I think is ultimately why I connected with it so much? This just felt so new, and so different, but so relatable. (hide spoiler)]This is a very odd book and one that might not be for everyone. But if you connect with this story emotionally to the same degree I did, I'm 200% sure you will adore it. This story felt so real and so vivid and so relatable to me, and there's no way to quantify that, no way to  it.

It would be one thing if this were some books, but I literally see this trope constantly. It's like we can't have a girl character be a rape victim unless she has a boyfriend. Yes, it's nice to see rape victims can still date and have lives, but it's not nice to see that rape victims aren't important without boyfriends. The prevalence of this trope is honestly pretty fucked up. I also just wasn't very thrilled by this book. The pacing isn't even remotely on the side of okay. I hated every boring minute of section two. Just as it would get good, I would find myself bored again. // RANT OVER; WHY NOT ONE STAR?Section three did somewhat redeem this book for me. While the twist was nothing particularly shocking, it still made me flinch. I liked seeing Carey pick herself back up. I also liked that Delaney was redeemed. Unfortunately, this friendship was executed so messily that I don't know whether to give the book credit for ending the book-long girl hate. I mean, I guess that's an improvement. I did like Carey's relationships with her family. It's so rare to see non-terrible stepmothers in YA lit. Really, it's ridiculous how rare this is. Points for that. And obviously, points for the strong sibling relationship, which I truly loved so much. Nessa and Carey are so compelling together. VERDICT: I had a lot of issues with the romance and girl hate in this, so despite a good family theme, I really wouldn't recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"May 19, 2017","May 25, 2017","Apr 28, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15793231-if-you-find-me

I’ve managed to stop blaming myself over the years. I hope you will too.”3 1/2 stars. The Last To Let Go is a book about letting go of an idea of a perfect life, letting go of the idea that somehow everything will be okay, and learning to make the life you have better, to make it yours. This is also one of the few books about abuse I have read recently that I have not hated, and for that it deserves some praise. [I am totally serious. It’s like a disease.] But… listen, this was not really that great. It was a quick read for me and had several good points, but I think I was disappointed.I want to shout out a few things first. First of all, Brooke!! I really liked her and found her story – though I have a lot of bones to pick – super compelling. As an added benefit – I sort of binged this. And yeah, I definitely appreciated the rep in her being a lesbian, and her girlfriend Dany is so great. I wanted more pagetime for their relationship, but a solid dynamic. 10/10. Unfortunately… the book just doesn’t really go to the depth I wanted from it. And I think the problem is one of character. Brooke’s character is so closed off that nothing progresses until near the end. And as a result, basically nothing gets discussed until the last thirty pages.The issue is that Brooke is a somewhat developed character, and an interesting lead as a character desperately struggling to hold on to her family, her voice is not quite strong enough to hold up the story. While I thought initially that her cold, emotionless narrative was a result of her personality or her trauma, it began to bother me quickly when I realized that 1) the telling and not showing did not work for the story and 2) the story stayed on that flat note the whole time.And holy shit, this flat note and th resulting lack of substance is noticeable in a lot of elements. ✔ The treatment of parental abuse here did not bother me partially because I don’t think it’s really handled that much at all. The main discussion of abuse offered by this book is a secondhand discussion of spousal abuse that I didn’t think did anything new. I really wish we’d gotten more from Amber about how she reacted to her treatment by her dad, because it felt as if that wasn’t actually explored on page. Subtextually? Maybe. On page? No.✔ And the side characters in this book… also get very little depth. I think Amber Smith tried, but the reality is that we don’t see much actual motivation for most of these characters because Brooke is so focused on herself. And we also don’t see the subtleties of their trauma being shown because the narrative is so cold and tell-tell-tell-tell. ✔ And… then there’s Brooke. See, Brooke felt like a really compelling character, which is why I am so disappointed that we never really saw her. In books like this, there has to be some kind of moment where she drops the armor and you see who she as a person, right? A moment where the audience can see themselves in a mirror, in a different situation or maybe not even that. But The Last To Let Go just never got to that moment of connection with Brooke.It was just… frustrating. I kept feeling as if the story were on the verge of going there, of giving me everything I wanted and more out of a book… but it just didn’t quite make it there. Oh well. Maybe next time.

These plays deserve to be seen, with acting and dramatic scenes. This play especially is one that thrives off the acting; having a fantastic and compelling Macbeth and especially Lady Macbeth is central. On stage, though, this play can be fabulous and compelling. Ignoring the need for performance, I think this is a solid tragedy, if not my favorite one. Seeing that this is Shakespeare, the language is of course gorgeous. But as is usual, the real power of this show comes through the characters and the themes. Below this, you'll find some random thoughts and feelings. ➽ I think it's interesting that this is one of the least tragic of Shakespeare’s tragedies. Macbeth is destroyed by his ambition, as many of Shakespeare’s other characters are, but he’s evil from the beginning. This reads as more of an odd version of a cautionary tale than a true tragedy; if you think about it, the ending is a win for the heroes. ➽ Yet we also feel as if it's a tragedy because we see it from the points of view of the villains. Lady Macbeth and Macbeth are not good people, and never were - yet we see their struggles, rather than the struggles of those they oppress. ➽ LADY M. I love that she starts off as the ambitious one, yet is also the one we see the most humanity out of; she has the capacity to do evil, yet she's also the one who feels the most remorse. Especially when well-acted. ➽ I'm not a fan of the conclusion. I think everything builds up to a fantastic conclusion, and then the book stutters to an end. Lady Macbeth dies offscreen, rather than onscreen. Despite their good soliloquys towards the end, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's actual deaths didn't work for me.➽ If you're looking for more thoughts and enthusiasm, check out Emma and Jason's s.

But the more I think about this book and all it entails, the more confidWhen I first read A Very, Very Bad Thing, I thought I should have enjoyed it. But the more I think about this book and all it entails, the more confident I become that this is something a little worse – it is one of those lgbtq books that is not written for queer teens, but for those looking for a little Suffer Porn. [I’m tired.]I’m going to try to explain this as best I can. When a book starts out as a somewhat-romcom with no substance [i mean...], it does not end in a tragic ending. Right? Unless it’s a book about queer people, and then it always seems to end in someone dying or being violently outed. In this case both. My issues with the execution of this utterly tragic awful book can be summed up in two points: 1) this book has a tone problem, and 2) it’s way too short and not nuanced or developed enough. In terms of the first complaint: the book takes too long being a sappy romance without a hint of darkness. Around page 150, the book takes a really dark turn with barely any buildup. If more suspense and tension were built up in the first act, the transition could’ve at least been powerful [if tropey and overdone]. As is, the twist makes the book feel messy and disjointed. In terms of my second issue: this book does not develop its characters or its romance plot. None of the characters have depth. The message of this book is important in theory, and I wish I had enjoyed it. But books — especially bury-your-gay trope books — cannot stand on the facade of being important when the execution falls flat. Maybe with some more editing, I'd enjoy this more.

And that is exactly what this book is: Forgive Me Leonard Peacock avoids moralizing, but also doesn't shy away from the harsh reality of what Leonard plans to do. And all this is to say that I have seen so many people say that they hate everyone who enjoyed this book. Notwithstanding the fact that I kind of despise that statement, inherently, I completely disagree. There's so much homophobia here. There's so much misogyny. How dare you excuse it. Here's the thing: this book doesn't excuse any of it. Despite several things I'd usually DNF for— the misogyny and homophobia of the protagonist, namely— this convinced me. How? By narratively showing that all of those things are negative, rather than some accepted behavior. And none of this is to diss the idea that this book goes to far, or doesn't explore Leonard's issues enough. You know what? In terms of the misogyny, I have to agree. I wanted quite a bit more out of Lauren's character; her lack of agency within the narrative is a blatant weak spot. If a stronger character had been given to her, the scenes in which Leonard ignored consent in his interactions with her would've felt like far more of a purposeful decision. This is as many-layered a book as you can get, but first and foremost, it is a character study of a deeply traumatized teenager. And it's a very, very good one. Leonard Peacock has one of the most distinctive voices and personalities I've ever seen in YA. Even though he does a lot of crap wrong - a lot, a lot of crap - I adored his character. The writing is lovely, with a quality that brings you straight into Leonard's mind. His thoughts about the world almost reminded me of A Catcher in the Rye in their matter-of-fact quality. Basically, I have met my match in book form. I read this entire book - yes, the whole damn thing - in an hour and a half without ever breaking, not even to use the bathroom.

This is an 80-page long Cinderella retelling, yet it manages to have more dimension and creativity than most retellings get in a few hundred. Man, I’m so glad I’ve picked up some Rosamund Hodge recently. [image](source)Rosamund Hodge’s talent for character arcs amazes me. Her characters are so distinct, with their own hopes and dreams. They're all so effortlessly relatable, even with different personalities than mine. I particularly liked Maia. She believes that love is a toxic thing, something which can hurt or destroy. Her arc revolves around her discovery that love can be beautiful.Don’t worry, though; the book doesn’t only focus on romantic love. The complex relationship between Maia and her sisters really stands out here. Kore especially is an incredibly complex character who I empathized with quickly. Maia also gets a developed relationship with her dead mother. That's not to say the romance plot isn't lovely, though. Both Maia and her partner develop so much in this short story. Their relationship has buildup; perhaps not as drawn-out as I would've liked, but given that this story is only 80 pages long, I'm pretty shocked it was built up this well. It was a solid five-star until the weirdly anticlimactic ending. I guess I just ended the story slightly underwhelmed. I know this book has references to Cruel Beauty, so perhaps I would've understood it further if I had read that book first. Either way, I felt very let down after planning on giving this a solid five stars. VERDICT: If it weren't for one singular issue, the anticlimactic ending, this would've been a solid five. Highly recommended, even to those who haven't enjoyed some of Hodge's other books.

I think I might've even liked this more if not for the hype. ¥ | PLOT —> cliche but entertainingSometimes I read books that feel like action movies. And that's fine. Those are perfectly entertaining, if not necessarily the most meaningful. Maybe you'll enjoy this more if you're a big fan of action movies, but man, this was not for me. But here's my real question: why was this so cliche? This book focuses on Zhou, a revolutionary who's trying to take down a powerful corporation's head. How will he do that? Oh yes, by seducing the man's daughter, Daiyu. Take a wild guess as to what will happen next. Will he fall in love with her? Will they have... an angsty romance? Well, yes. Want is a bit of a cliche book. It's a fun book, but i felt as if I'd read the whole thing before. In Fox Forever by Mary E. Pearson. And Daughter of Deep Silence by Carrie Ryan. And a lot of other books. I'm reading Now I Rise by Kiersten White right now, and even that book skirts this trope. This really isn't a new trope. I almost want to quibble with this being a series. Really, I don't usually like plot-driven series. This was mostly plot driven, and I just don't know how this is going to continue in a narratively satisfying way. This almost could've stood alone - the conclusion is fairly satisfying, although it doesn't wrap up the world. I'm just worried as to how Cindy Pon will follow this up. That being said, there was a lot I liked about the plot. It's super fast-paced, first of all. I felt more entertained than annoyed with the plot, even despite the cliches. This is a trope for a reason, after all - it leads to a lot of entertainment. ¥ | WORLDBUILDING —> has potentialI've seen this book recommended a lot for worldbuilding, so I'm going to talk a little about this!! I'd probably compare the level of worldbuilding complexity to that of The Abyss Surrounds Us by Emily Skrutskie. There are a lot of things about the worldbuilding that are intriguing, but there's really not much there on page. That being said, I do love the themes of environmentalism. This book focuses on corporate greed and poverty in an interesting way, if a little heavy-handed. I also appreciated that this isn't set in the US. All that being said, I'm not necessarily in love with the worldbuilding here. It was fine, it was intriguing, I wanted more. Same as every other category. ¥ | CHARACTERS —> lukewarmWell, it is an action movie. These characters aren't terrible, I didn't dislike them, they were fine. They were just so lukewarm. Where are the personalities? Can y'all name a single one of Zhou's character traits beyond brooding? I actually think this book would've been better if it had been told in dual point of view between Daiyu and Zhou. Daiyu, the love interest, was probably my favorite character - she's funny and sweet and badass without being a jerk. I'm really interested in seeing more about her. And since I've talked about the love interest, maybe I should talk about the romance. It was... cute. It was fine. Can I be honest and say there should've been more angst? This should be full of tension, and somehow it wasn't. Aside from her, however, I liked but didn't love the rest. I did like Zhou's squad dynamic and several of those side characters. Iris and Lingyi are a cute side couple and a great addition to the batch, and Arun, Dr. Nataraj's son, was a sweet nerdy character. Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of Lingyi's ex Victor. He was literally just there to be angsty over the fact that his ex was dating someone else. Should I care? I don't.¥ | CONCLUSION —> fine, but I expected moreThis wasn't by any means a bad book - it was just aggressively not for me. If you're a fan of action books, this one is fine.

Overall, if I had to summarize my thoughts on this book, I would give it a solid mixed bag. There are some aspects of this that I adored, and a few that I found fairly forgettable. Cat Winters is a good writer; the pacing is at times a bit odd in the first hundred pages, but quickly picks up. One of the strongest choices of this book is that the main relationship building isn’t a romance: It’s Hanalee and Joe’s enemies to unlikely besties plotline. Though their arc forms that of a romance, their roles to each other are those of best friends, and I genuinely adored that. The reader is more invested in their friendship by the end than we ever would be in any love story. If I had to question elements of this book, I think certain elements struck me as slightly defanged. Some of this is probably generic—I’m a bit older in 2021 than when I was really into YA, and 2016 was a very different time for YA as a genre—but Hanalee and Joe are, for example, WAY too shocked by the existence of eugenics. (view spoiler)[They are a black woman and a gay man in 1920s Oregon. I think they’d know. (hide spoiler)] This defanging dilutes the punch that aspects of this novel should carry. I will also say, as someone with numerous Hamlet opinions, it’s a fairly loose Hamlet retelling. I like that the Claudius—Uncle Clyde—is sympathetic, as he is in the play. Joe ending up becoming the Horatio character is an excellent choice. On other matters, I was slightly less convinced. The selection of Hanalee’s best friend, Fluer, as the Ophelia character, works fine, though I’m absolutely going to choose to read them as a couple given that she’s the Ophelia character. Her brother Laurence as Laertes also works fine, though his character is quite far from the original Laertes. Her mother makes for a deeply forgettable Gertrude. There’s another character, Mildred, who’s genuinely difficult to pinpoint as a Hamlet character. Tonewise, this novel is just not very near to Hamlet. If you’re looking for a Hamlet-style tragedy I would probably shy away. SPOILER: (view spoiler)[I will also say that though it’s not a very Hamlet ending, I did enjoy the final twists. It’s not Hamlet, but it did compel me. (hide spoiler)] In another way, though, I think this a perfect Hamlet retelling. To me, Hamlet is a play about the horror that comes from not being believed—from being perceived as insane, even as you are the only one who can see the truth. Incorporating forces of systematic racism and homophobia to the horrific, claustrophobic lack-of-belief that defines Hamlet is a fascinating take; so much of discrimination is in the fact that you cannot express what has happened to you, because no one will listen. Winters’s pinpointing of that is consistently the strongest and most compelling element of this novel, and what I know will stick with me about The Steep and Thorny Way: both as a Hamlet retelling, and as a novel.

I must be a man’s servant and a mare for his pleasure, or I must hide myself behind walls and surrender my flesh to a cold, silent god. I would walk into the jaws of hell itself, if it were a path of my own choosing. I would rather die tomorrow in the forest than live a hundred years of the life appointed me.” So this was... unexpectedly amazing. Somehow, I went into this thinking it was a slow-paced, long-developing high fantasy novel, which is just completely untrue. The Bear and the Nightingale, instead, is a compulsively bingeable, gorgeously written, and ridiculously compelling dark fairytale. Thinking back on this book, there are three things that stand out to me. ➽ a e s t h e t i c Okay, first of all, this book has completely stunning writing. I can’t believe this is a debut, because the words just feel like they fly off the pages. But also, this is one of the most aestheticy books I have ever read and I love it. It’s just all so intriguing and so atmospheric Wintrey setting. Magical forest. Fairy tale elements. Folklore gone right. Folklore gone wrong. Demons and dark creatures. Creatures somewhere in between.➽ c h a r a c t e r s There’s an excellent cast of side characters; I’m a huge fan of Vasilisa’s sister and brother. Even the villains of the book, especially her stepmother, gained my sympathy; she is a fantastically compelling villain, so well-written that she becomes all the more sympathetic. But my favorite part of this whole book was Vasilisa and her character arc. She starts out a more naive character, young and treated well by her father, yet driven by her desire to be free and one with nature. But as the mistreatment by her stepmother grows, she becomes more and more determined to be free, which I found made for a very compelling character arc. Thus, even when she’s not driving the plot, she feels like a major force in the book.➽ t h e m e s The Bear and the Nightingale is a dark fairytale, and like any good dark fairytale, it has a lot of meaning beneath the surface. This book deals primarily with religious oppression, and the way religion can be used for destruction. But it also deals with the specificity of the destruction of nature. Vasilisa's world is crumbling around her, and it's so difficult to witness. She loves this world so deeply. And just like our natural world, it is beginning to crumble.I don’t know how I’ll feel about book two, but I’m super excited based off where this ended. There’s a nice setup for some moral greyness, maybe, and I really like that the love interest is a death frost demon. No, really. Beautiful and terrifying, and with the vibe of every dark fairytale, I cannot recommend this enough.

It's deep and meaningful in all the right ways that can touch your soul. It's also still an arc version, and with a few aspects improved, I have no doubt many will fall in love. It just wasn't for me. The book suffers here from an issue I like to call TMHTLD: too much happening, too little development. For example, one theme in this book is Julian's relationship with his father. Unfortunately, they only have one two-page scene and then one scene right before he dies. Most of their relationship is built through exposition. Tom and Julian's relationship needed to be built up more earlier and with less exposition. Same with Harlow and Tal's relationship; we see so little that it's hard to actually care. In general, I liked the ideas more than the execution. In contemporaries, my main desire is to find characters I connect to. It doesn't matter how deep the book is; if I can't connect, I can't fall in love. I didn't fall in love with the characters here, sadly. Talliah isn't interesting. She's just ordinary.That's... kind of how I felt about her. She's got some development and some character, but she was hard to emotionally connect to for me. I can't blame the author for this at all; she's a very different person than I am, far more dependent on others. Her guarded nature, however, is a trait I should've related to. I'd have liked her trust issues to be expanded on, rather than mentioned once and not again. Her character suffers from her traits not being expanded on.These two issues sort of bled into my biggest issue of all: even though there were parts I really liked, I was just really freaking bored. However, there were enough good parts that this was by no means a total waste, and I'm sure it'll work pretty well for some readers. Let's go into some individual likes and dislikes here. MINOR DISLIKES AND NITPICKSI think with some people you can just tell you're going to have a history with them. Even if that history hasn't happened yet.This is another book in which the author makes a slight case for why instalove is okay, and it works... surprisingly well. I didn't roll my eyes when usually I would, so... success. The romance itself, though, is so flat that I couldn't even bring myself to smile when they got together. I'm sorry, but it doesn't belong here. The romance should've been cut to give more pagetime for Julian, Lena, and Tal's family issues to get sorted out.The writing was good, but had a few issues. These are all fairly minor and nitpicky - Jasmine Warga, if you're reading this, I'm really sorry - but did impact my reading of the story. They are as follows. 1) Sometimes the story will skip forward a day and Tal will tell us what happened yesterday in her internal narration. This style didn't totally work for me. 2) The writing in Lena's story, which was done in third person past tense, felt oddly stilted. The language used in Tal's story didn't bother me at all, but there was something off about Lena's first few chapters. The author hit her speed fairly quickly and from then on it was fine. Again, nitpick, doesn't impact much. 3) The romantic writing is not good. Jasmine Warga has a nice writing style, but some of the romantic lines dropped in this book are more cheesy than romantic. There's a “since you walked in, I've looked at no one but you” dropped on page 219 of my arc edition. It's just cringeworthy to read, and that's disapppointing, because Lena and Julian are a decent ex-couple - it's just that the romance is so, so cheesy that I kept feeling disengaged. Take out a few more cheesy lines and they're a couple I definitely root for.Lena's story should have been amazing, because she was a character I found easy to connect to. Unfortunately, it ended up seeming out of place. The problem is that Lena's story is meant to build into Tal's - yet her story doesn't flesh out Tal's story, it is firmly her own story. Lena has too little pagetime and development to be a protagonist, but far too little information on Tal to be a side character. She either should've gotten protagonist treatment or not been included at all. Given the interesting themes in her story of immigration, and how much I genuinely liked her, I definitely think she should've been a protagonist. Multigenerational stories are awesome! THINGS I LOVED• The characters, despite my complaints, weren't terrible by any means. I've already mentioned previously that Lena was easy to connect to, and I have to admit, while I didn't connect to Tal, she was still a fairly good main character. I love reading family drama stories, and the issues between Julian and Lena seem genuine. • Everything was heartwarming. This is a quiet little story, and everything is very subtle, but it's all very sweet. • I liked the ending a lot! It could've been a total cop-out, but instead it was perfect - clever and a little meta and I respected it so much. Honestly, the ending was half the reason this got three stars instead of two.• The diversity was awesome! I liked the background gay girls not being a big thing, and I liked the subtle themes about immigration and interracial relationships. The latter could've been expanded on a little more, but the development those issues got was perfect for Warga's subtle story. • The writing. I know I mentioned a few nitpicky issues with the writing, but there was a lot to love about the writing too. There's a simple beauty to the quotes. The romance writing is cheesy, but everything else is really nice. I might do a quick listing of quotes after the book comes out to end this  on a nice note. IN GENERAL: A great book for hopeless romantics, especially fans of Nicola Yoon. This will be perfect for serious fans of The Sun Is Also A Star (a book I actually did really love after reading this). Just not necessarily for me.

And if you point the peoples' eyes to the future, they might not see Forgiveness was an act done after the fact, a piece of the bad deed's future. And if you point the peoples' eyes to the future, they might not see what is being done to hurt him in the present.This is far more than a story about intermixing cultures. Homegoing is an ambitious family saga, following two branches of the same family. Effia is a member of the Fante, while Esi is an enslaved member of the Asante. While each story works on its own, this is best read as a collection. It's cohesive, yet with unique characters. Definitely recommended for anyone remotely interested in the blurb. A QUICK RUNDOWN OF THE STORIESGeneration OneSometime after 1775Effia: A story about abuse and growing into something more, Effia's story leads neatly into the Fante lineage of the Gold Coast. Esi: Effia's Asante half-sister, who is kidnapped and shipped to America. This story didn't impress me much; it's very meh. Generation TwoEra of Fante tribe's first slave-stealing deals with the British; American slaveryQuey: Effia's son with James. This story is about being trapped. Query has grown up in relative peace at the Castle, but he's still trapped in having to solve the problems of the tribes. His friendship / relationship with Cudjo shattered my heart. Ness: Essie's daughter, she marries a woman named Sam and has a son and daughter with him. While she and her husband run, only their children manage to escape to freedom. This story follows her strong character through adopting a girl named Pinky. She was one of my favorites. Generation ThreeSometime after 1807 banning of slave imports in America; 1850 passage of Fugitive Slave ActJames: Quey's son with the Asante Chief's daughter. This story establishes the conflict between the Asante, including James' mother and his love interest Akosua, and the Fante, including himself. It was so sweet and heartfelt. We avenge lost lives by taking more? It doesn't make sense to me. Kojo: Ness and Sam's son. When the 1850 fugitive slave act is passed, his life changes for the worse. This one is relevant historically but sort of... meh on its own. Generation Fourera of cocoa industrialization in Ghana beginning in 1879; Jim Crow south around 1880Abena: Growing up in Asante land with James and Akosua, Abena learns of her father's secret upbringing. This story establishes the cocoa market in colonialist Ghana. H: Jo and Anna's son, who was stolen away while still in Anna's belly. From 1880-1889, H is imprisoned and enslaved in a coal mine for a crime he did not commit. He wasn't my favorite character, but his story and arc is very compelling. Generation FiveThe Asante's integration into British empire and the 1900 War of the Golden Stool; early 1900s HarlemAkua: Abena's child out of wedlock by Ohene Nyarko, she was born in 1879 and has moved to Edweso. This story is nonsensical in a very unsettling way. I liked Akua a lot, but I have to admit I'm mostly just confused. Willie: H and Ethe's daughter living in Harlem, this story is about forgiveness. I enjoyed this story, though I have to admit her story with Eli could've been developed more. Generation SixGhanan independence; American Civil Rights movement Yaw: Akua's one surviving child, he works as a teacher in Takoradi and fights for Ghanan independence. This story is packed with meaning about labels and their accuracy. I loved Yaw's character; he's 50 years old and still full of passion. This is the problem of history. We cannot know that which we were not there to see and hear and experience for ourselves. We must rely upon the words of others.Sonny: Originally named Carson (nice continuity, by the way), he is Willie's son by her first husband Robert. This was one of my favorite stories; it's got a compelling character arc in only a few pages. We can't go back to something we ain't never been to in the first place. It ain't ours anymore. This is.Generation Seven1980-presentMarjorie: Yaw and Esther's child, living in America. I liked Akua and Yaw's roles in this, but the story itself wasn't anything particularly new.  Home, they had a different word for African-Americans. Akata. Akata people were different from Ghanaians, too long gone from the mother continent to continue calling it the mother continent. She wanted to tell Mrs. Pinkston that she could feel her self being pulled away, almost akata, too long gone from Ghana to be Ghanaian. Marcus: Sonny's son with the absentee Amani. This story is mostly meant to close off the book, but it's an excellent sendoff. I loved the symbolism with the family in Ghana afraid of fire and the family in America afraid of water. Truly brilliant. It was the way most people lived their lives, on upper levels, not stopping to peer underneath.

While the ending was worth it, this is definitely a drop in quality. I liked book one a lot, but I think this one feels like the same thing repeated and I'm not into superhero novels enough to really care. Pointless sequels are honestly an epidemic that needs to stop. Yes, there were a few loose threads after book one, but Danny had a great character arc and got some good friends. Here, it's as if she barely developed in book one. The entire arc is sort of new, but it all feels like a bit of a rehash. The only “new” thing in this book was the romantic arc. No one is more shocked than I am, but I found Sara and Danny weirdly underwhelming here. While they made for a shippable dynamic in book one, I found their romantic buildup here so instantaneous. One minute they're fighting, next they're together. It was so disappointing. I really wanted the tension to be drawn out in a better way, even with just one more angsty scene before they got together, because their getting together was so anticlimactic and boring. They are still cute, and I have to admit, it was awesome to see Danny get a gf. There are SO few trans wlw in media. I think Nomi and Amanita from the Netflix show Sense8 are the only other example I can think of; I can't think of any in YA lit. Okay, we need to talk about Graywytch's entire character and inclusion. Graywytch is a transphobe and a villain. The fact that she's a villain does not bother me at all; I totally understand and appreciate her being villainized by the narrative. My issue is that this very human, true-to-life villain talks like a comic. She comes off as a plot device rather than a very real threat to trans people, but somehow also says things that are... honestly incredibly horrifying? Using transphobia as a plot device just really rubs me the wrong way. I don't know how to word this, exactly, but I really dislike the fact that a real threat talks like a comic book villain. I feel like she's in here to tell cisgender people “hey, Danny's life sucks” and I appreciate that, but I don't think it's executed well. I feel like she'd be more terrifying and educational to cis people if she felt real, and right now, she feels like someone's parody of a comic book novel. I also really wonder if the point here should be to inform cis readers of Danny's life sucking. Like, yes, it's great to do that, but... I feel like 100 pages of a novel being taken up by a TERF. Is not a decision I would make when writing what comes very close to being wish fulfillment for trans teens (in a good way). Because that's the intent, right? Most of this story — Danny finding acceptance, Danny finding a girlfriend, Danny managing to let go of her parents' opinions — would be validating as a trans teen, right? This is not my lane, but. I think the way Graywytch is used in this narrative crosses a line from empowering to torturous. It's not really bad; Danny's still funny, the concept is still great, the action scenes are still pretty well-written, I loved the inclusion of an nb character. And the ending was fantastic; in fact, I think the ending may have been worth the rest of the book's existence. All in all, the book was still good. But until the last 15%, I couldn't shake the feeling that book one should've been a standalone. Get Danny and Sara tentatively together at the end of book one, leave it there. Perfect. This lukewarm sequel isn't doing anyone favors.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,62,1,"May 09, 2017","May 18, 2017","Apr 19, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32565582-sovereign

Never did I expect this book to get a DNF from me at only 126 pages. One of my favorite coworkers obsessed over this to the point where my expectations may have been too high. To me, the characters here felt more comical than interesting. Arianwyn has two character traits: she's clumsy and she puts her foot in her mouth constantly. Plot points are based entirely around her putting her foot in her mouth. I truly wish authors could care enough for their main girl characters to give them negative traits beyond “clumsy”. Using clumsy as a personality trait feels lazy; “incompetent” is not a personality trait. Not a single side character is developed even a hair's breath. The townspeople especially are cardboard cutouts put on earth to hate Arianwyn. The dialogue here is... not great. It's some of the fakest dialogue I've read in my life. The writing style is marketed as being somewhat reminiscent of Harry Potter, but Nichols' overuse of exclamation points throws that comparison down the gutter quickly. There's nothing shown in this story, everything is told, and it gets tiring fast. The story is actually fairly decent. This is definitely a book you can fly through. The worldbuilding also seems to have some potential. Magic with runes, some wars in far-off nations... it's all fairly potential-filled. A map of the world would help, as the descriptions of the other five nations are incredibly hard to follow. In general, this was fairly disappointing.

There's a crisp quality to the prose that fits Sasha's voice perfectly. I don't even know how to explain how this book fucked with my mind. The blurb is telling you antihero, but I don't know if that's an accurate description of Sasha. Sasha is a terrible person. But she's a very well-written terrible person. She has this odd blend of sarcasm and genuine evil - I'd love her at one minute for her delicious inner monologue, then hate myself for ever enjoying such a terrible person as a character. It was really an experience.I think what's interesting about this book is how it echoes all those old classics about Some Privileged Asshole Acting Out. You know that genre? The one about really rich privileged men being asshats that somehow reads like tragedy porn and escapism at the same exact time? This Darkness Mine is like a more self-aware version of that genre. And I kind of love it. I think Mindy McGinnis is one of the most self-aware authors I've ever read - this book knows it's unrealistic and makes up for it by being believable as fuck. We've all met people like Sasha, much as we'd like to pretend we haven't. I think that's what I'm going to take away from this book, in a way - the intense feeling of realism that somehow stayed around even when I tried to escape this book.

I have to admit, I was expecting something far less heartfelt and well-written. But I’m so glad I picked this up.This is a great book on most levels; it contains prime characterization, a sweet romance, and well-developed themes. But it does bear mentioning: it was so. boring. For the first half, I didn’t connect to the story much, despite my enjoyment of the characters. That being said, everything else about this story was so perfect that I can’t not give it four stars, and I’m sure many won’t suffer from my issues. ”Your mom was terrified to end up like our mother, to live and die in the same place without seeing the world… so she left.” It’s odd, the more I think about it. My mom was terrified of ending up like her mom, so she left home, and I’m terrified of ending up like my mom, so I was scared to leave home.This book is about leaving home and growing up, but it’s first and foremost about how we reflect our parents' mistakes. This wasn’t a theme I expected, but it was definitely a theme I loved. It’s clear Laura Silverman knows what she’s doing with the themes here. ""Don’t you understand that the fact you’re asking these questions means you actually give a shit and are nothing like your mom at all?""I also admired the descriptions of Santa Cruz. Anise’s love for her home comes through in every description. This expert description made her love for Santa Cruz and desire to go home so real and so tangible. As the book developed, her love for home got more and more complex, which was awesome. I love home. But it’ll be here when I get back.Anise isn’t the shrinking violet of many contemporary novels; no, she’s far more confident. She’s got a complex relationship with self-esteem that I instantly connected to. So many authors feel the need to make self-esteem either/or, and it was lovely to see a character break that mold. I understood her character on a deep level. None of the side characters felt throwaway, which was great. We meet six members of Anise’s family, a few members of Lincoln’s crowd, and several of Anise’s friends, yet all of them feel real. Silverman definitely deserves a shoutout for the casual diversity here: Anise's love interest, Lincoln, is disabled without it being a huge part of his character; Anise herself is Jewish; many of the main characters are mixed race; there’s also casual lesbian rep in the form of Anise’s friends. VERDICT: A slightly slow but still well-written contemporary coming-of-age with very well-developed characters and well-incorporated themes.

If I struggled to push through a book, can I even say I enjoyed it? I've had the same experience with books like Maggie Stiefvater's The Scorpio Races and Moira Fowley-Doyle's The Accident Season. and I think I've come to the conclusion that this genre requires a certain mood out of its readers. While you can appreciate the strong character growth and quality writing, magical realism is all about connecting with the reader, in some undefinable way. He and Lace were sewn of similar fabric, the raw edges of their families' cloth.The Weight of Feathers follows the children of two competing families who fall in love. It's a bit of a Romeo-and-Juliet dynamic. But without all the death. And with far more character complexity. The characters are clearly the star of this book. Lace Paloma and Cluck Corbeau are both complicated. At times they're both full of anger and hard to like. Their relationship almost demands your interest with its slow development. Even the side characters are instantly believable with strong voices. Some are despicable, some hard not to hate, but all feel real and rounded. I also appreciated the writing and atmosphere. Anna-Maire McLemore does such a good job bringing the town to life that the odd storylines of the book somehow feel normal. This is how these characters live. Essentially my only complaint is that this book takes too long to get going. Yes, I love slow-build plots as much as the next person, and the slow-build plot works to its best here. But I still spent around half the book wanting things to just get going. Adjust your expectations— this story is a slow build to an interesting conclusion, not a fast-paced ride. VERDICT: If you can tolerate the slow pace and adjust your expectations, this is a fabulous book and absolutely worth reading. I'll be checking out McLemore's other books for sure. (For some reason I read their only not-gay one first, which just seems out of character for me??) Honestly, if you want more positive thoughts, check out Cait @ Paper Fury's .

I know, I know. That premise sounds like a weird romantic drama. It sounds like instalove waiting to happen. It sounds like yet another book about love curing illnesses, because that's totally a thing that happens. And at first, I believed that too. For quite a bit of the book, Flora believed she was falling in love with Drake, and it was incredibly boring and problematic. And yet this book narrowly avoids romanticization with a good ending. For quite a bit of the book, I was worried this would stray into “love cures illness” territory. But... love doesn't cure Flora's illness. Thank god. SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL BOOKThe plotting is a major strength of this book. It's not particularly fast-paced, yet the book flies by in a breeze. Barr fills the book with dramatic tension. Some of the reveals are slightly predictable, but some are brilliant. A few twists towards the end absolutely blew me away. There are hints and clues along the way building up to reveals, and it was wonderful to follow Flora's journey. Flora's character got my sympathy from the start. She's an unreliable narrator to some degree, but she's also telling us everything she knows, so she's not really unreliable. Her decisions and motivations seem surprisingly well-informed. She's not an annoying character with her forgetfulness, which frankly surprised me. Emily Barr's disjointed writing style also made this story special. It's perfect for this kind of story, where we keep changing time and place. It enables you to get a good feel for Flora's head from the beginning. It's also particularly easy to read. Honestly, without my worries over romanticization, this book is an easy four star. I do wish Barr had picked a different memory for Flora to catch on to, but I understand why she chose this one. div17: mc w invisible disabilityMy Blog | My GR AccountBRIEF SPOILER SECTION• From what I've heard, the twist kind of reminds me of Everything Everything's twist, except less offensive and less romancey. • Anyone else a little annoyed about Jacob dying?

I knew going into this that I was going to enjoy it. But I was not actually really expecting this to be one of my favorite YA suspense novels of all time. But I swear to god Dana Mele could have been looking into my brain’s idea of a perfect YA thriller and STILL would have nailed it. ya girl just read and adored an arc of the fucked up sapphic mean girls book and is officially living life to the fullest. People Like Us is a thriller driven first and foremost by character dynamics. Most of which are either vaguely twisted and/or vaguely gay. It’s almost a love triangle, but it’s also… not. It’s more like a twisted web of character dynamics that just got me more and more enthralled. It’s a book where everyone is holding secrets, everyone has something up their sleeve. And thankfully, that is exactly my genre of thriller.While the characters felt occasionally hard to keep track of at the beginning of the book, it’s hard to overstate how much the character focus helped my reading experience – there were so many possible suspects and motives that I had no clue who it could be. And even better, literally no character in this book feels totally flat; even very minor side characters are given sympathetic moments that they wouldn’t get in any other book. I’ve seen several s criticizing the fact that all of these characters are pretty awful people, and... well, they’re not wrong. But for me, these characters were interesting and sympathetic, despite some of their awful deeds.Something I definitely noticed was just how well Kay’s narration fit her characterization. Kay’s voice is very engaged with the situation, yet she is strangely cold and undramatic in her telling. No moment was given more drama than it warranted, creating a situation in which the audience simply must process the sheer gravity of what is occurring. And it completely fits Kay’s personality - I don’t even know how to explain it, but her narration fit her so perfectly. I got so attached to her by the end.Something I really liked about this is that it’s essentially set in a world where being sapphic is totally normalized - there’s not even any angst over unrequited crush on a straight best friend. I’m sure someone will be upset by the lack of labels, but for me the book felt like a breath of fresh air. I loved that Kay’s crush on Bri isn’t the main plot point, but is still a major factor. Even that love-triangle-with-boy-and-girl thing couldn’t bother me in the totally normative space of this book - it is written so perfectly and not at all as a sexuality crisis. No character is bothered by Kay or Bri or any other character being sapphic. This is everything I’ve ever wanted: a queer girl thriller where the drama isn’t that they’re queer. Come on, you have to admit that’s awesome. You have to. Something that struck me a lot about this book is that there’s no red herring; it’s just a slow buildup to a final reveal. And while the reveal isn’t actually the most shocking thing I’ve read in my whole life, it still surprised me. Which is a really hard to do after a long life reading thrillers, but just to reiterate: this really was not your typical YA thriller on a lot of levels. And even if it had been, it’s not the who that impressed me - it’s the why. I didn’t guess the who, either - couldn’t pin my guess down - but I really did not guess the why. I’ve been thinking about why the reveal stayed with me so well, and I think it’s because I genuinely didn’t want any of these characters to be the killer. I knew one had to be. Of course. But I felt genuinely attached to these awful, terrible characters. That’s another thing sticking with me as I finish this book – People Like Us could have survived off its reveal alone or its characters alone, but Dana Mele chose to go further, to pull off both. It's an achievement worth reading this book for.→ elise nitpicks her faves ←Very minor spoiler, but tagged anyway: (view spoiler)[Nola’s wish to join the soccer team felt vaguely like a random plot point, especially with her lack of talent (hide spoiler)].

At some point, we all began to stumble into the in-betweens, the murky colors made dark and complicated by resentment and quiet anger. At some point, my mother slid so off track she sank into hues of gray, a world drawn only in shadows.This deserved its spot on the NYT bestsellers list. Actually, it deserved higher and to stay longer.First of all, the writing is the best. This is contemporary fabulism, and in the typical fashion of that genre, it is weird as hell – but gorgeous. Emily X. R. Pan is really out here being more talented an author in her debut than most authors ever become after years of practice? I know this one is a bit long in terms of pagecount, but it’s actually a shockingly fast read. There’s an extremely natural quality to every word. It flows.And second of all, I really think this is one of the most thematically strong books I’ve read this year. As you probably know because this book has been everywhere this year, it follows a girl whose mother has died by suicide. So it’s a book about the way both Asian and American cultures often don’t respect victims of depression the way they should. It’s a book about finding family across the world, family despite a language barrier.Thirdly, and this is something that tends to really enhance my love of books - I would give my life for the lead. Leigh is a girl going through hell, and not really knowing how to deal with it. I love how the book doesn’t frame this as a maturity issue on any level - Leigh is dealing with something almost impossible to handle, and no matter how hard she tries, it is going to be hard. Leigh is also biracial and Taiwanese, and the way the narrative adresses both of these facts is lovely; I felt so connected to her despite being neither.The only reason it’s not getting a five is because it lacked that special something for me personally. But 1) I still almost cried, and 2) I absolutely think this will be a new favorite for anyone with personal experience with suicide in the family [a tragedy that has never occured in my life]. Cathartic, emotive, and gorgeously written, with a lead protagonist I absolutely adore, this book is going to make it straight to the top of all the best-of-2018 lists.

This was not the most well-written thing I have ever read but I really really enjoyed my time reading it. This is a deeply fucked up book, in a good way. You know how sometimes, you read YA fantasy and you just feel like it could have gone darker and it doesn’t? Not Even Bones just keeps Going There.Not Even Bones follows Nita, a girl who dissects other supernatural beings for the black market - until she’s sold into the black market herself. So first of all, this book is impossible to put down and so addicting. It's almost a thriller and almost an urban fantasy book and either way, it's so fun to read. I never knew what was coming next - all I knew was that I was desperate to find out. And better yet, this book features some seriously cool worldbuilding. Nita lives in a world where supernatural beings are prized for their parts but despised for their being, but also look exactly like other humans.Something I liked here is there is some seriously biting social commentary slipped in there? Set in Peru and following American characters, this book doesn’t shy away from the obvious discussion of colonialism and privilege in America. With a lead cast of almost entirely characters of color, it’s a very interesting read. There’s also some discussion of eugenics-ish politics, which as some of you may know is something I’m super passionate about. Okay, I’ve enthused a lot about the worldbuilding and all that, but I really think what made this book for me was the character work. All these lead characters are so awful and I love them. This is one of those books where the leads toe the line between villain and hero. Also, if you don’t like villain leads, you should probably not read this. Lol.One of the things I really liked about this book is that the lead character doesn’t prioritize the survival of other people over herself. In a lot of fiction I’ve read with these vibes, the leads are something I’d like to call Unrealistically Good. Not to shit on unrealistically self-sacrificing people, but people do not tend to be willing to risk their lives for others at the drop of a hat. Nita, by contrast, is out for herself. And it’s not even what makes her an antihero!! She’s a total antihero, don’t get me wrong, but I think this book really understands the general human impulse to save your own skin [haha. Skin.]. Instead of prioritizing normal morals, this book puts the emphasis on a personal moral code, and the lines we refuse to cross so we do not lose our humanity. Nita is willing to kill and dismember and dissect, but she has lines. Oh, and Nita? I love Nita. I would die for Nita. Her character development is incredibly excellent. And also Kovit is… a character. I can’t spoil shit but I love them and I also really like a certain side character and I am so here for it.Oh, and this book in general was pretty twisty, but there was also this one twist in this book that I think might have been the end of my brain. I guess plot twists a lot but this was just… fucking wild, I feel like I should have guessed it and I did not at all. I need the second book immediately. @Rebecca Schaeffer where are you give me the fucking second book I need thisI guess if I were to critique this, I would say that the writing is a bit… fanfictiony? I don’t know, man, it’s a debut and it happens. Did I care? Nope.Anyway, you should read this. It is so fucked up and the lead and love interest are both so terrible and it scared me shitless and it is the BEST.TW: so much body horror, sadism.

Not in a not-good way. Little to no character development, mostly just meditation on the character's former life and there is actually no plot. I don't think I can remember the last time I read something with so little plot 38% in. There is nothing keeping me here except voyeurism, and my guess is the author hoped the beginning of the novel would thrive off this alone. This is not the stellar takedown of rape culture I wanted or needed, and it is nothing I want to read. I Stop Somewhere’s lead character is very quiet and dependent, meant to be related to for her lack of self-confidence and need to be validated by a boy. This is a very true-to-life experience and one I’m glad is being represented and also one which I find really really hard to connect to. A lot of this is personal, for sure, but I’m not connecting to the lead character at all and I tend to find it really easy to connect to characters who are nothing like me. In terms of plot… well, nothing really happens. There was one plot reveal I sort of thought was interesting for about ten seconds and then realized it made the story even less likely to conclude on a hopeful note. Fun fact: I only like torture porn when it ends on a hopeful note. There’s also a sort-of mystery set up about a side character named Kate’s secret. I am willing to bet at least thirty bucks it’s that she’s gay, and if so I sort of want to mention that using she’s-gay as a plot twist is pretty lazy in the year of our lord 2018. Again, no proof for this theory, but it uh… seems pretty obvious to me, a lesbian, based on her reaction to every mention of men 👀👀I did really enjoy the potential for an exploration of gentrification, which is a topic I almost never see in YA lit, but this idea didn’t really go anywhere. Again, I’m having a lot of trouble ing this or wrapping up my thoughts. The issue with this book is that it is brutal and nothing else. Nothing was really done with the first 40% of this book besides torture porn and one singular reveal.

Over the course of twenty-four hours, she goes back through her relationship with her firefighter boyfriend, Brooks, and everything that has gotten her to this hill, waiting for her home to burn. All fires start small. This is a gorgeously written book and I flew through it. Actually, flew through it in one sitting. I was so invested in both the characters and the story of this novel that I genuinely struggled to put it down. The discomfort of Audrey’s relationship with Brooks serves as a major focal point of this book. The way this is played is really interesting; at first, he actually doesn’t come off as all that bad. His desire to not be around her friends at first feels almost excusable; after all, he’s been through trauma, is cripplingly shy, etc. It’s only as the red flags start piling up that he becomes someone else. It’s this nuance that I enjoyed so much about the book. It would have been so easy to make Brooke caricaturally awful, and I loved that the book always strayed away from this. Audrey is not always particularly likeable, but I got her. To her as a younger person, her older boyfriend’s interest in her is validation, exactly what she wants. And as the relationship is so at-times normal, it’s hard for her to identify what is happening. It is a first relationship, and though Audrey is not stupid, she doesn't see the signs. Or she ignores them. As girls, we're often taught a very romantic image of 'saving' our heroic, traumatized boyfriends. And when we read these stories, we internalize that message for ourselves. So when a heroic, traumatized boy comes along for us to love, who are we to ask for more, to put up boundaries, to ask for what we need? The fire, by the way, is the most claustrophobic a symbol has ever made me feel. I also liked that Audrey had a support system: her best friend, Grace, and Grace’s girlfriend, Quinn, are both really wonderful. I especially appreciated their attempts to get her away, and seeing those attempts fail; I think we’ve all seen friends go down that road for relationships, and felt concerned as we saw the fallout. I liked the little spots of brightness. This was a really excellent book, a great binge-read, and an author I will absolutely be following from now on.

I don't know how you take such an original premise and execute it in such an unmemorable, emotionless way. Tease executes a similar premise in a far better way, making you sympathize with the main character. Again, the main character here is rude and a terrible person; it just doesn't work. Usually her bad actions would simply make her complicated, but she's neither; she's just completely flat. She's seriously one of the flattest characters I've ever had the displeasure of reading about. Mean and flat is a terrible combination, and I could barely stand to be in her head. The plotting is nothing special. The author seemed to focus on cheap scare tactics and reveals rather than the creeping horror of more talented and better-written suspense books. A suspense novel should never be this boring and flat. To be fair, it's a fairly fast-paced and easy to read book. But all the fear was very surface and superficial. I never really felt unsettled by the book.And what about that grand concept? Well. You'd think the poignant topics would improve the book, but... nope. No depth was presented to the problem of bullying. It also felt as if the author was exploiting the important topic of homophobic bullying for a suspense novel. The main character's homophobia towards her former best friend wasn't explored well. I felt totally underwhelmed by the execution of every topic in this story. VERDICT: There are far better suspense books. For a better book on bullying, look to Tease, which executes a similar problem in a far better way.

People hate having to change the way they see things. So instead of admitting the world is ugly, they shit on the messenger for telling them about it.”The Nowhere Girls is not your average feminist contemporary. There are several awesome feminist books from this year: I’ve been seeing people hype Moxie by Jen Matieu a ton this year. And while I did like that book a lot — it’s a great contemporary journey — this book goes far deeper. While books like Moxie offer feminism from the point of view of privileged cishet white women, Nowhere Girls wants you to see deeper than that. This book focuses on three Nowhere Girls.🌺 Grace → self-proclaimed fat girl and the more idealistic of the trio🍀 Erin → smart and sarcastic Aspergers girl who I LOVE🌺 Rosina → a latinx queer girl and literally the Most important to meBut the aspect of this book that stands out to me is the fact that this isn't about these three girls: it is about all the girls. Short ""US"" chapters give insight into so many different girls - a conservative girl, a closeted trans girl, a cheerleader unsure whether to believe the allegations, two girls kissing, a black girl finding no value in the white-centric feminism of her classmates. It is so, so powerful.It is so, so powerful. Amy Reed does not pull her punches at. all. This is one of those books that made me feel claustrophobic reading it. The author makes her fucking points. She does not shy away from the full truth of rape culture or try to hide things under a veneer of a cute contemporary. And she definitely doesn't erase the fact that not every woman is white and cishet. It's overall a fantastic experience - horrifying, enrapturing, and beautiful. What I loved about this book was the sympathy given to every girl in every point of view. These girls are coming from different backgrounds. These girls are coming from different points of view. They are multifaceted and flawed and none of them have a totally objective view point of view. But that doesn't mean their viewpoints aren't important. It doesn't mean we, as girls, are any less important. The chapter in which Elise and Trista rebel, and face different consequences for it, was so powerful.But there's nothing she can do. She's a kid. She has no rights. Her parents get to decide what's right and wrong for her, even if they're wrong. We are worth it. We are important. All of us. Literally the only thing I didn't like about this book was one line not being explicitly decried: a line about a character's trans sister that seemed to imply trans people choose to be trans. That was literally it. The feminism is so intersectional and the characters are so developed and this book is so fucking powerful.

Bone Gap is about the burden of the past, and the roles we have to take on to escape that past. Bone Gap is a magical realism retelling of the Hades and Persephone myth, sort of combined with the Orpheus and Eurydice myth, and though at times slow, it is exceptionally worth your time. Trust me. Here are three reasons for why it is worth your time:“Why do you want to see the beast?”“Because he is just as pretty as I feel.”Petey has some of the most interesting character development in the whole novel. She is the town’s ugly girl, liked by one boy, who the rest of the town seems to think is only dating her because she’ll put out. And by the time she figures out what’s really happening with Finn, it is impossible not to sympathize with her insecurity. “What have you got against people?”Finn hated crowds. Thousands of people bumping and churning. “Too many opinions.”Finn is a character who took a little longer to grow on me, but who I eventually fell in love with. His relationship with his brother Sean, and his gentle kindness towards everyone around me, were both so compelling to me, and I loved the direction the author took his arc. This is sort of a spoiler within the text of the book, but I'm not sure it should be, so I'm going to talk about it: (view spoiler)[Finn has facial blindness, which is plot-relevant, and though I generally don't like disability being used as a plot twist, I thought the narrative around difference was really respectful and relevant. (hide spoiler)]“You said you wouldn’t touch me until I wanted this.”“I don’t want this.” “You do.”On another note of amazing women, Roza is such an incredible character, with one of the best-written arcs of the book. The sections of this book dealing with Roza’s kidnapping are genuinely terrifying, playing off the silent fear I think a lot of women and women-aligned people in America face: the fear of an unnamed stranger who wants us and is not bothered by whether we want them back. This is boosted along by a detailed backstory of life with her boyfriend, who physically hurts her (and - it is implied - sexually violates her). Listen, I know I’ve talked a lot about the characters in this book, but they really are the focus. I found this book so, so cathartic. Even with such dark content, it's a fundamentally hopeful book, and I am so so glad I took a chance on it.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,85,1,"Mar 05, 2019","Mar 27, 2019","Apr 06, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31683270-bone-gap

""I loved her fire,"" he said from far away. ""I didn't know I would burn.""It has been a month since I read this book and I still have no freaking clue what to say about this. There is something very deeply twisted about this book, and Elliot Wake owns it. Black Iris follows Laney, a revenge-focused college freshman, and her two newest friends, Blythe and Armin. All three of them are terrible people and all three of them know it and all three of them are sort of in love with each other. But little do they know [dramatic intro] that Laney is about to involve them in her revenge plot. Listen, with a summary like that, I think this book could have really easily been kind of overdramatic and forgettable. But it is so not. The reasons are as follows: Elliot Wake’s writing is so freaking amazing, and more importantly, this book feels so real. This whole book is so incredibly engaging, so hard to get out of your head. You never feel like you can trust Laney, the narrator, or Blythe, or anyone else. They’re all unreliable and they’re all doing their best. Better yet, this whole book is kind of a mindfuck. I never wanted to be saved. I wanted someone to follow me down into the darkness.And then… there’s this kind of twisted and somehow-still-my-favorite-ever romance. Blythe and Laney have this super angsty dynamic that I… love. And maybe that will make a nice segue into the topic of the amazing fucking rep. This story is one about outing, and homophobia, and so many other topics, and it is genuinely done as close to perfect as can be. I honestly don't know what more I can say about it without spoilers, but watching Laney's journey was so compelling and perfect. The other thing about this book that I find really really brilliant is it occasionally doesn’t take itself too seriously and breaks the fourth wall to lowkey make fun of romance tropes. It gives the whole book this meta feel, as if you’re maybe not even reading the correct story. And better yet, there's a story hidden beneath this.In a typical college romance novel, he'd be a gorgeous but troubled sex god who'd cure all my deep-seated psych issues with a good hard fuck. I'd smell his misogyny and abusive tendencies from miles off but my brain would turn to hormone soup because abs. That's the formula. Broken girl + bad boy = sexual healing. All you need to fix that tragic past is a six-pack. More problems? Add abs.It's Magic Dick Lit.[THIS SOUNDS LIKE DRUNK ME.] Or there’s this iconic tidbit of true literature:I was staring at that rose-lipped mouth, then up at his eyes, a clear reddish-brown like carnelian, speckled with tiny flaws of amber and copper where the light caught.Fuck. They're brown. His eyes are fucking brown, okay? Stop being a terrible writer, Laney.Listen, all funny quotes aside, this book is really twisted, and I want to make that clear that y’all should be fully prepared to read this. Trigger warnings for sexual assault, bipolar, suicide, a lot of drug use, homophobic bullying, outing, and other things I’m probably forgetting. But I think this was so worth reading. This book gives off total Elle vibes and I love it. And also, this is the wildest fucking ending. Like, you know, this whole book, that some shit has to go down, but the actual twist is AMAZING. I am in shock over the sheer power of this twist and what it means for the themes of the novel.

Dao knew what she was DOING with that character. “But in weakness, you find your strength. You leave pieces of yourself in everyone you love. Is that not the greatest power, to endure in that way?”“I don’t know,” Xifeng said in a low voice. “I may never know.”Xifeng has this wonderful selfishness to her that I think authors often shy away from. Moral greyness is always fantastic, but I love how completely unlikable Xifeng is at times here; she does not have anything but selfish intent, and the narrative does not pretend otherwise. I don’t know how it works, but I am incredibly impressed by the fact that it does.Unfortunately I felt this just lacked a little uhhhhh... plot. The first 40% is deadass one of the worst beginnings to a book that is trying to be this dark and twisted; it is boring, lacks plot, lacks any sort of intrigue, and could be split by half in length with no change to the overall plot and honestly, I wish it were split into a third of its current length. Even when we get to the palace, the book really lacks plot, honestly - it simply makes up for it all with Xifeng’s wonderful moral ambiguity.I will also admit I did not like Guma’s characterization at all. She’s an abusive parent figure to Xifeng, both physically and mentally, and it does that whole arc where it’s revealed that there were extenuating circumstances. However, I found these reasons really flimsy… or maybe I was just annoyed at the implication that Xifeng’s darkness is caused by the fact that she won’t forgive her abusive parental figure. That's... something that pops up a lot in literature, and it consistently bothers me. I will say that this complaints felt like slightly less of a problem while I was reading the book - the narrative feels, in some ways, far more nuanced than simple abusive-mom-forgiven and so I think I usually would have been waaaaaaay more mad. I will also say I was really not invested in the romance. It’s supposed to make you sad because it’s lowkey tragic but it’s just so deeply unromantic on every level? I didn’t like Wei very much and I can’t tell if you’re supposed to – he’s incredibly possessive in the first half and I was not a fan. The girl hate plotline admittedly does feel a bit subversive because Xifeng learns from Lady Sun, but it doesn’t work because Lady Sun is so flat-villain in characterization - although yes, she is a damn cool villain. You can probably tell I was not invested in or interested in any character relationships except one, Xifeng’s with the Empress. And I really wish that relationship got more pagetime. What we do get is great, but it lacks a lot of depth. Maybe I just love Xifeng too much because she’s the power hungry bitch Lady Macbeth & Evil Queen amalgamation of my heart. I'm not sure if I'll be reading the sequel to this, but I'll pick up other works by Julie C. Dao. I have a feeling she's going to pull a Leigh Bardugo on us all and write my favorite book of all time in three years.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,142,1,"Aug 06, 2018","Sep 14, 2018","Apr 04, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40204841-forest-of-a-thousand-lanterns

And every single tiI keep seeing s of this book criticizing the child in this book – calling her a bitch, annoying, difficult, dumb, misguided. And every single time I read them I get more upset. I don’t think most of you are aware of this, apparently, but children having crushes on adults = okay. They’re kids. They’re crushing on older people. It feels weird but it’s normal. The natural, normal reaction for an adult in that situation would be to not even be tempted. Because why, in any situation, would a grown man be tempted to date and be in a relationship with a twelve-year-old girl?The power imbalance of a twelve-year-old dating an eighteen-year-old is not healthy.When a friend of mine went through this her reading of this event, on first glance, was that it was romantic. Maybe in a few years, when parental disapproval wasn’t an issue, they’d fall in love. And I watched her realize the reality of her situation, something I’m insanely proud of her for doing, with a mix of happiness and sadness. He told her that she was just beautiful and he couldn’t resist talking to her. She was fourteen. He was twenty.And no matter what I do, I can’t read the description of this book without thinking about her, and without thinking about the fact that she, too, was caught up in the idea of a forbidden romance. Because she was fourteen and she didn’t know the repercussions, the power dynamic, the trauma, and because she was fourteen and the best way of processing a grown man abusing you was as a romance. I cannot fathom how anyone would look at that and have the nerve to insult the fourteen year old. And you can defend this book all you want, say it’s one love story, say you felt everything because you get the sides of both. But if you think about the real world for even one minute, you know that this is morally appalling.

If I cannot be better than them, I will be so much worse.God, this book killed me. The Cruel Prince has just about what you’d expect from Black: court intrigue, an atmosphere of terror, vaguely dark romance, and a main character who is a terrible person, but is also so interesting. Plus some interesting dynamics and setup for an even better sequel. Needless to say, I found it delightful.I think Black’s tendency is to start a story with a badass opening, then spend 200 pages on slow buildup. At first I thought it was just because this is a series beginner, but the more I think about it, the more I realize her stories never have a typical growth and climax. Instead, she slowly escalates tension until suddenly the situation is horrible and you’re left wondering how these characters even got there. It’s an odd style, and one that will be divisive among readers, but it works for me.The plot here is just as slow-burning as usual, perhaps even more so. I personally thought it suited the story quite well. Even when I was slumping, this book was easy to come back to and enjoy. I have to admit, at spots the court intrigue got confusing. Main characters were easy to remember, but I couldn’t tell most of the Elder King’s children apart.Maybe my favorite part of this book was the character work. Holly Black is very talented at getting side characters to read real, even without much focus on them. But the real strength of this book is Jude’s flawed, morally grey character. I fucking loved her. She’s not the greatest person, but she’s so incredibly aware of it that I found it hard not to love her.I also wanted to spare a paragraph for the romance. There is a sort-of romance in the first half, and it is honestly the weakest part of the first three-quarters. (See my updates for this book.)Thankfully, this thrown-in and tensionless romance is improved upon further into the book. I’m not going to spoil it, exactly, but we all know Black loves her Hades/Persephone-esque dynamics. The dynamic between the two characters who I think will get together really turned me off in the first half; I was looking out for some kind of lacking-in-consent bad-boys-are-hawt type thing. That’s not what you’ll find here. This is much more of a genuine Hades/Persephone dynamic than a bad-boys-are-hot romance. I’ve written about the difference before on my blog, but this is one of the better handlings of it I’ve seen. There was one scene in this book between them that… well, I think my brain just screamed “holy shit” for a minute straight. One of those scenes I’m going to bookmark and reread over and over again.Anyway, I definitely loved this. When is book two coming out again?Brief note before I finish this , and this doesn’t need much commentary: Ben and Severin had a cameo in this. I almost cried, embarrassingly enough. The Darkest Part of the Forest is one of my favorite books ever. According to a couple other s, some of the side characters are also cameos from her first fae series, if you’re at all interested! I didn’t notice because I’ve never read it. But I do like that she’s built a whole world, without requiring you to read every book for comprehension.

My faith in humanity and my love for found family has been absolutely restored.There's so much I loved about this book, I really don't know where to start. # SO CLOSE YOU CAN TASTE IT: SETTING AND WRITINGThe setting developed here is just as awesome. Yes, I'm a little biased, because I've been in love with the idea of Alaska since I was really little. But this book made me feel like I was there. I felt as if I were in that snowy, isolated area. I could feel the loneliness, feel the isolation, feel the lack of human contact. The writing is also a strength. It's lyrical and subtly gorgeous. It's not showy, but it's gorgeous. This book is appropriately titled, for the author's writing is sensory in the perfect way. # CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IN SHORT TIME: A HOW-TOThe characters here are amazing. We have Ruth, with possibly the most emotionally cathartic teen pregnancy story ever written; Dora, who's full of anger and wants to find a forever home after her abuse; Alyce, who wants to pursue her dreams without forgetting her family; and Hank, who just wants to run away. I can't begin to express how much I loved all four narrators. Each one has their own story and journey, and all four stories are fleshed out, despite how short the book is. Alyce, Ruth, and Dora's points of view resonated with me the most, but Hank's was well-developed too. This is the type of book where your favorite character here will depend entirely on your own experiences, because all four are well-written enough to be a favorite character. All the side characters are just as developed, just as brilliantly written. I was shocked by how many memorable side characters managed to fit into this epic.# SYMBOLISM AND THEMATICSHonestly, the thematic arc of this book probably stood out most to me. Each of these characters' journeys revolves around one thing: the family you choose. These characters get to choose their families. Sometimes their chosen families involve their parents, and sometimes not. That's not the point. It's more important to surround ourselves with people we love, even if they aren't our parents. VERDICT: I honestly can't think of any negatives. There are so few books I can't complain about, but I really can't complain about this book. It was a lovely journey.

This is a story collection that I have very mixed feelings on, so I'll be color-coding my thoughts. ♔ will be for praise, ♚ will be for criticism. GENERAL REVIEW♔ The writing is luscious and beautiful, with great atmosphere and tone. Maybe not quite as spectacular as her later writing, but she's definitely showing a great beginning here. And I love the addition of artwork!! I mean, just look at this. [image]♚ In general, this is a really great piece of 2000s YA. Unfortunately... it is also a piece of 2000s YA. I'm sure this could be considered awesome feminist lit back in 2009, but between some of the fatshaming, I'm-not-like-other-girls mentality, and weird exoticism / appropriation of Indian mythology - we'll discuss this a bit later - I found myself getting just a bit annoyed. Or maybe a little more than a bit. ♔ Taylor's characterization is good. She's great at conveying entire swaths of characterization in just one or two lines, which is an excellent trait for a short story collection and one I think I noticed more.♚ It's just not quite as good. The characterization shown here would've stood out in the 2009 YA world; I don't think it does anymore, whether because of short form or because of overall quality. I think she's quite improved on characterization and writing as she's grown; this book just doesn't deliver to the same degree as her later Strange the Dreamer. STORY REVIEWS# Goblin Fruit: This is a story you have to read to the end, because 98% of my enjoyment of this came from the final page. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the dialogue - it felt quite cheesy compared to some of the Zuzana / Karou dialogue in Taylor's later Daughter of Smoke and Bone trilogy. I also wasn't a fan of some of the borderline fatshaming and definite vibe of I'm-not-like-other-girls. # Spicy Little Curses Such as These: I have... very mixed feelings on this. I liked the writing more than I did for Goblin Fruit, as it fell closer to Taylor's later prose, and I thought the character work was great. The ending was especially fabulous.And yet... holy shit, the cultural stuff is bad. I'm sorry, but setting your story in India for the mythology - not only that, fucking colonial India - and having your entire cast be white European colonists? Not a good look. Not a good look at all. It made me super uncomfortable to even read this. You can tell from the title that this is going to be a oh-India-is-so-exotic circlejerk, and it completely lives up to that.# Hatchling: This was probably my favorite; it's the one where the writing and character work is strongest and closest to her later works. The only thing is, um... this basically feels like softcore DoSaB. The plot and character concepts are in some ways so similar to her later books that I don't think this felt new to me. VERDICT: Some good thoughts, and I definitely understand the hype, but too many issues for me to really love this. It was definitely interesting to see how Laini Taylor has evolved as an author; you can see that it's the same author, yet her later books just have another level of depth that isn't so present here.

There is only what you’ve done and what you are going to do. And if you can own up to every moment and take responsibility for your life and shape it into something beautiful and kind and generous - if you can do that, you’ve discovered what it means to be strong.This is the funniest book about depression I have ever read. And it is also one of the most authentic. This is a YA contemporary about Jane Sinner [obviously], a girl who drops out of high school to attend community college and gain her independence. And it is like nothing I have read before. One thing I appreciated about Nice Try Jane Sinner is just how different it was. This book is like a blend of a heartwrenchingly relatable character study and a hilarious reality show comedy. And both succeed, so well.I knew I was clinically depressed, but I never thought I was actually suicidal. I didn't look forward to death, and I didn't hate life either, though I wanted to. Hatred or love - either would have been enough to keep me going. But the slushy indifference I felt for everything and everyone wasn't on the hate-love spectrum. The indifference is what I couldn't stand. And buried somewhere in all that indifference was a tiny black crevice I could never bring myself to look at, because I knew if I did, I'd get sucked down into an infinite void and never find my way out. I told myself life was all or nothing. At the time it made sense.Books about characters with mental illnesses always seem to be About Curing The Thing, and it frankly sort of bothers me. I think, frankly, I really needed a funny book about a character with depression, a character I could relate to. And beyond that, Jane’s character is so well-developed and I ended up empathizing with her so much. She isn’t feeling sad sad, she’s feeling nothing, something I hardly see in YA.Are you in a relationship? How long? noDescribe your current relationship: noDescribe your relationship with your family: noDo you have any singing, acting, or performing aspirations? god noWhat is your greatest strength? brevityWhat is your greatest weakness? noThis book is also just freaking hilarious. Jane’s casual sarcasm and hilarious takes on the world are exactly my niche of humor, and the shenanigans of a reality show are fun to see as well. Listen, I don’t really have a good explanation for how hard I related to this book.

This wasn't necessarily the best thing I've ever read, but it was definitely fun. I have to admit, the humor style didn't totally work for me. There were funny moments and I was definitely entertained, but I wasn't cracking up every ten seconds like I was when reading No Good Deed or Beauty Queens. There's a nice parody here of fandom culture. Angel Wars is a combination of the Hunger Games and any typical paranormal romance. It's a loving parody and definitely an entertaining one. This was actually the funniest part of the book for me. Thank goodness this story had something more than just humor. The relationship between Caitlin and Heller is sweet and heartfelt. Caitlin's character arc, while suitably messy for a comedic contemporary book, is executed fairly well. There's no annoying romance here; there's a brief love triangle parody, but it's not the focus at all. It's All Your Fault is not a must-read, but it's definitely an entertaining and enjoyable read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Apr 04, 2017","Apr 05, 2017","Apr 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25664996-it-s-all-your-fault

I can’t tell you how much I adored this. A recap of Strange the Dreamer: Lazlo Strange, the Dreamer of the last book, is not a stranger - he is the son of a god with the power to control mesarthium and thus move the citadel. Minya has Sarai’s soul under control after her bodily death, while Ruby, Sparrow, and Feral stand by her side. Down below, Thyon Nero, Ruza, Calixte, and Tzara are attempting to study the history of Weep and establish how it got to where it is now. And meanwhile, a prologue follows the tale of Korako and Nova, which will intertwine as the story continues. Muse of Nightmares is something beyond book one — it is a book about healing from generational trauma on a massive scale, where all the culprits are dead and gone but blame can be found everywhere. Minya wants to punish Eril-Fane and all of Weep for killing her siblings, for murdering those she tried to save. While Sarai wishes to move past the legacies of the past, Minya remembers the deaths of the many. She cannot forget and she cannot repair. The humans have seen horrors beyond comprehension, too. Eril-fane, the Godslayer, is a victim of Isagol, goddess of despair. His wife Azareen was a victim to Skathis, the Weaver, her diabolical counterpart. His mother Suheyla is just trying to hold it all together, as the world falls apart. The storyline between Eril-fane and Azareen is heartbreaking and beautiful, an incredible exploration of love in the aftermath of a horrific trauma. It will never fail to impress me how deftly Laini Taylor can juggle a large cast and make them all make me crazy. In particular, Sparrow is an utterly wonderful character. And Thyon Nero's arc through this book is just a delight. And as to the end [SPOILER]: (view spoiler)[It utterly delighted me. The addition of Rook, Kiska, and Werran to the traveling crew, in addition to the Weep four and the crew of Godspawn, was so fun—and also Suheyla on the trip!!! Grandma!! I am just absolutely in shock over how much I love this crew. I would write silly wish-fulfillment fanfiction about this. Also big fan of giving Thyon Nero a gay lover. Incredible choice! No notes. (hide spoiler)]To be honest I wanted more of the world lore, though I do love this Laini Taylor Multiverse being created. The conceptualized Neru, where portals allow travel between other worlds, is fantastic. Side note, here is a Laini Taylor interview confirming that this series was set in the universe of Daughter of Smoke and Bone. (The gods are descended from the six angels who went off in the other direction and were NOT consumed by the monsters in the worlds when they went too far. Yay for them! Congratulations.) But overall? This book is thematically gorgeous, gorgeously written, and full of a deep love that I think I'll keep with me for a long, long time.

Thousands of different world myths and world historical facts are integrated into one clever world.

There's the wise old mentor, who happens to be incredibly unlikable here, and if course the Chosen One trope. But in general, the myths used are creative enough to hold up the story.

Dreams of Gods and Monsters is a war epic, not just the story of a demon and angel's forbidden love. Everything lovely about the first book is simply one part of a whole story. There's so much nuance to both the themes and the characters. This is a series you could analyze for hours. The writing is still unspeakably beautiful, simple yet gorgeous. Laini Taylor's writing flows across the page to the point where instead of skipping across paragraphs as I usually do, I was hanging on her every word. I'd read her grocery lists. In terms of plot, though, this disappointed me slightly. For the first 500 pages, the plot is near-perfect, with brilliant twists and reveals. Yet my largest issue lies in the final hundred pages. The plot thread of the stelians needed far more buildup. It's great to see worldbuilding get even more fleshed-out, but when the first two books were so vague about worldbuilding, the focus on multiple universes seems completely out of the blue. It's an extra hundred pages spent on a plotline that has nothing to do with anything else in the story. The plotline should've been integrated more into the full story previously in the book, at the very least. EXTENDED YELLING ABOUT THE CHARACTER WORK Karou and Akiva's character arcs in this book were frankly a bit underwhelming. After the growth and change they went through in book two, much of this book is plot-driven. They're both compelling characters and I absolutely loved seeing them finally get together, but they didn't grow quite enough for me. Most of their growth comes through their relationship, so thank god that Karou and Akiva are still a great couple. Their scenes in the first half were few and far between, which served only to make them more tear-worthy. The touch of instalove from book one has become a complex relationship full of moments that touch my heart. I'm going to dedicate an entire paragraph to my two favorite characters: Liraz and Ziri. These two have each developed so much since book one. Ziri's goodness and sense of duty towards Karou both saddened me and gave me hope for humanity. His new form allowed the narrative to explore his character even more. Liraz's brutality and desire to be more than a machine mix to form an extremely compelling character. And their relationship delighted me. I know Liraz and Ziri being in a relationship is slightly convenient, and I don't care because they fit. Their personalities are so opposite yet so similar, and it's lovely. I'm unspeakably happy about them. Of course, Zuzana and Mik are delightful. The addition of Eliza's narrative voice surprisingly helped too. These three add a touch of humor to an otherwise disturbing story. Also LOVIN THE IMPLIED LESBIANS AT THE END.

But this sequel is even better. In terms of character work and romantic arcs, I'm amazed at how far Laini Taylor has come. HOW THIS BOOK LIVES UP TO BOOK ONE• The writing here is possibly even more beautiful. Laini Taylor's writing flows across the page to the point where instead of skipping across paragraphs as I usually do, I was hanging on her every word. It's so simple and yet so gorgeous. I'd read her grocery lists. • This book is a complete mindfuck. Most of the twists towards the end are sheer brilliance. Taylor draws so many tiny threads into one beautiful big picture. This book makes it so you can guess all the twists, but you probably won't because they're never-before seen. • This isn't your typical angels vs. demons story; angels aren't all good and demons aren't all bad. I loved the nuance of their conflict. There's something to be said for taking an old story and making it something new, and I loved Laini Taylor's execution of this story. HOW THIS SEQUEL IMPROVES ON BOOK ONE The worldbuilding here is just awesome. It's even more complex than it was in book one, with a detailed world map and more complexity. I am shocked at how many side characters I fell in love with here. Karou's bravery and loneliness still shine brightly as ever. Her inner conflict over the Chimaera war stands out here; it's handled with nuance and grace. Liraz surprised me with her character development and nuance. Her brutality and desire to be more than a machine mix to form an extremely compelling character. Ziri's character surprised me as well; his conflict between ingrained prejudice and caring for others is very well-executed. Side characters like Hazael and Issa return, more fleshed out than ever, but possibly my favorite part was seeing little flashes from chimaera and angels caught up in a war beyond their control. Sarazal, Sveva, and Rath managed to touch my heart in the space of a few pages. Most changed award has to go to Akiva. He's changed so much since book one, where I liked but didn't love him. Here, he's an incredibly compelling character; a character who's made huge mistakes and owns up to them.Improbable as their relationship is, Karou and Akiva are such a compelling couple. Their scenes here were few and far between, which served only to make them more tear-worthy. The touch of instalove from book one has become a complex relationship full of moments that touch your heart. They're seriously on the track towards becoming one of my top six couples. And of course, Zuzana and Mik are still delightful. I'm really glad Karou has girl friends and the book isn't a mess of slutshaming. These two also add a touch of humor to an otherwise disturbing story. “What is it about you?” she had asked him recently. “I almost never like people, even in tiny doses. But I never get tired of being with you.”“It's my superpower,” he had said. “Extreme be-with-able-ness.”This book is far darker, thematically, than DoSaB. Days of Blood and Starlight is a war epic, not just the story of a demon and angel's forbidden love. Everything lovely about the first book is simply one part of a whole story. There's so much nuance to both the themes and the characters; this is a book you could analyze for hours. Honestly, I think my feelings are best summed up my initial  being “I'm dead inside??” This book absolutely killed me, and I can't wait for book three. I know everyone has read this series already, but if you haven't, PLEASE pick it up. This is so much more than a cliche love story; it's about tragedy and war and prejudice and oh my god, please read it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,97,1,"Apr 07, 2017","Apr 14, 2017","Mar 30, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12812550-days-of-blood-starlight

That being said, here's an actual  that's NOT just me crying! Amazing!Daughter of Smoke and Bone follows a demon's assistant, Karou, who helps to collect teeth for the family of her youth. It's a creative story that pulled me in from the beginning. Before we were 40 pages in, I knew I had found a favorite. THE WRITINGJust as beautiful as everyone says. Laini Taylor's writing flows across the page to the point where instead of skipping across paragraphs as I usually do, I was hanging on her every word.Like a shadow that coasts over the moon.Is the word choice there not brilliant? It's such a subtle difference than “a shadow that covers the moon,” but it changes everything somehow. The writing is also rich with emotional content. I just really, really loved it.Wishes are false. Hope is true. Hope is its own magic.THE CHARACTERSI absolutely love Karou. Laini Taylor infuses her with a quiet inner strength, yet also a loneliness and a desire for love. I also loved the strong friendship between girls here. Zuzana is a dynamic, funny side character. “This morning you hate men in hats, wiener dogs–”“Weiner-dog owners,” Zuzana corrected. “You'd have to have, like, a lentil for a soul to hate wringer dogs.”She's a sweet, believable character. I only wish she were in the second half more. Akiva is a good character, although he isn't a strong love for me yet. He's a good character with a good personality and some moral ambiguity, but he's not as developed as I want him to be. I'm hoping he gets expanded more in the sequel. THE ROMANCEI feel like I should give this book four stars. I SHOULD. The romance is full of instalove. Yes, it's kind of explained, but it's still full of instalove. That should be enough for me to take off a star! But I can't, because I loved the romance. There's something about the idea of star-crossed lovers, maybe. Or maybe it's just Laini Taylor's writing, or the strength of Akiva and Karou's characters. Whatever it is, I found myself totally invested in the romance after just a few pages. By the time we got to the twist, I was hooked. THE PLOTThis book is a complete mindfuck, and I adored it. Although one of the major twists is easy to guess, most of the twists are sheer brilliance. Towards the end, plot points you've forgotten about are explained. Even little details of the first half are mentioned. And that ending was just cruel. THE WORLDBUILDINGThe worldbuilding here is just awesome. Again, I can't expand upon that, because the worldbuilding isn't revealed until later in the book. You've just got to read it. This isn't your typical angels vs. demons story; angels aren't all good and demons aren't all bad. I loved the nuance of their conflict. There's something to be said for taking an old story and making it something new, and I loved Laini Taylor's execution of this story.

All you know are stories, Enne toldit is with a heavy heart I must announce that I just don’t care about anything that happened in this book. All you know are stories, Enne told herself. And not all stories are true.I should start this off by acknowledging that this book is built on a lot of good ideas. Ace of Shades takes place in what is described as a city of sin, a sort of Old Vegas meets Venice. There’s enemies to lovers, a very diverse cast (the book’s romantic interest is black & bisexual), an intriguing magic system, and the broad outline of the two lead characters is quite good. The issue is that nothing about this book ever really feels like it gels. This book, feels, to me, like a lot of good ideas cobbled into something that just never really goes beyond its elements. Perhaps the main problem here is I never felt any investment in 1) the characters or 2) the overarching plot. In terms of the characters, I had a very simple issue: Levi and Enne genuinely bored me. Levi is fairly likable and has the broad outline of a character arc revolving around personal agency. Enne is honestly… incompetent, and has a character arc revolving around finding her role in the world. I tend to struggle with less competent characters.In terms of the plot, I was equally disappointed — the arc of the book has very little thematic weight. And I just genuinely thought that while the outline had a lot of potential, there is a whole lot of nothing happening here. The plot twists get wilder and wilder and the actual details of the story simply build and build, but I never found a reason to care, so I stopped remembering the details. I think this author will probably write something I enjoy far more in a few years. But for now? I’m not into this.

It's rare to find a book that's happy and hilarious while also being meaningful. A&B is both a fun romance between two very different girls and a story about letting go of your bitterness. When are you all going to stop sleeping on this hilarious, adorable, and meaningful book?As always, J.C. Lillis nails character work. Over the course of the story, these two characters were developed far more than I expected. Barrie's character, with her bitterness and her contrasting desire to be good, was so relatable. Her character arc was solid as well. It astounds me how much she developed from her beginning. This story manages to be so meaningful without getting bogged down by pretentious language or depressing conversations. This is a book about letting ourselves be happy. This is a book about not killing ourselves for our art. Okay, okay, now we get to talk about my favorite part: the romance. That's probably the first time that sentence has EVER popped up in one of my s. Barrie and Ava had such amazing banter and such beautiful buildup. Their dynamic is infinitely entertaining and adorable. Brandon and Abel's side plot was great as well. They were cute and it made me happy. I'd read How To Repair A Mechanical Heart before this one just to understand their side plot, but it's not totally necessary. It'll definitely add to your enjoyment, though. “It's not what you think! It's not a religious thing– he's an atheist, actually. Former chef at Crux in San Francisco.”“So it's like Eat Don't Pray Don't Love?”The humor in this book is so A+. I don't even know how to pick a favorite quote. J.C. Lillis is STILL a master at snappy dialogue, believable yet entertaining.

It was absolutely a wild ride and I read it in, literally, two sittings within the same day. S0 let’s scream!➽G O D, T H A T ’ S G O O DI think Schwab’s writing style for Vicious is the best of every talent she has in the writing department; she’s abstract, a wide world without clear boundaries, but with enough detail that it’s hard not to be enthralled. The ease with which I visualized scenes was just incredible; in this series especially, I think she does a really good job conveying the image of a scene without being too specific. SPOILER: The Syd/Victor scene on the balcony, the tea shop scene with Syd & June, and the scene in which a brick almost falls on Marcella all stuck out in my head in different ways.VENGEFUL's three female leads are a woman who can ruin anything--and anyone--she touches, a living voodoo doll, and a girl who can resurrect the dead. This book was made for 2018.-V.E. Schwab via TwitterThe power of women in this book is just so, so real. Schwab plays around with terrifying yet strangely compelling female villains, and sympathetic female villains, and complex female leads, and it’s just all gorgeous. All that is fantastic, but besides my absolute love for the writing, why did I read this so quickly and become so enthralled? The characters. God I fucking love how she makes every character dynamic and interesting through just a few words, just a little hint of knowledge about them conveyed so beautifully and immediately you feel that you understand this character and that you root for this character. Okay, so, here’s a quick rundown of all the sides and characters: ➽V I C T O R, M I T C H, S Y D N E Y →Victor Vale - one of the best well-intentioned villain-from-one-point-of-view characters of all time. →Sydney - a slow-aging teenager who can bring back the dead. a legend and a queen and i love her. →Mitch - Victor’s sidekick, with no powers. the purest person in this book by all measures.→Dol - the ever-resurrecting dog. the only other pure being.→Dom - a far more unwilling sidekick who can step outside time and is Done With This Shit. I actually love Dom. ➽E L I E V E R→Eli Ever - is immortal and has also been through some shit, and he is ready to kill.Everyone said I would learn to sympathize with Eli this book, and you know what, you were all correct. I've always thought Eli made a fantastic villain, but his character writing here really hit a STRIDE.➽M A R C E L L A & J U N E →Marcella - former wife of a gangster who can quite literally erode people.→June - a human voodoo doll. I have no idea what to make of her but I know I love her.→Jonathan - a strangely forgettable character but oh well - that’s the point. I loved the presence of such complexity in the villains here, and how well these three sides were integrated into the broader plot. The sheer character juggling here is really is impressive. Between Vicious and this, I really, really am in love with this series - it's my favorite by her without competition. ✨ buddyread with most of goodreads, probablyBlog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,376,1,"Oct 07, 2018","Oct 07, 2018","Mar 28, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37534835-vengeful

But god, it stands out so far from just that. Okay, to get started, I’m just going to say it: Madeline Miller is one of the best writers of our time. She has such a way with words that it is absolutely impossible not to be engaged in her storytelling. The thing that brings this whole novel together is Circe’s character. She is a woman who has done awful, evil things, and yet remains unfailingly human. She is lonely, and harsh, and hiding herself in sarcasm much of the time. And there is not a moment in this novel in which I didn’t adore her. Madeline Miller does such an amazing job developing this character, weaving her thoughts into the narrative without manipulating you into feeling a certain way, keeping the narrative wide yet keeping it focused around Circe. Throughout this novel I developed such a deep level of admiration for both this author and this character, this character I’m sure will stay with me forever.This novel is so interesting because at its core, it is an exploration of the voice of women in Greek mythology. Circe is a character we see nothing of in the narrative of Greek mythology, a character with seemingly evil intentions and little motivation – and all this despite showing up in several different stories. There’s something supremely excellent about seeing a character like this who is essentially a plot device be given a story. I know I have a tendency to repeat the term “narrative agency” but it beats repeating—I absolutely love giving characters who have been given no agency the agency they deserve.I mean, everything about this book was just brilliant. I loved the myth interpretation: Penelope and Odysseus are both written perfectly, and seeing Jason basically get called an asshole while Medea stood on being young and morally grey and in love was so fantastic. And the exploration of gods vs. mortals is just brilliant: You cannot know how frightened gods are of pain. There is nothing more foreign to them, and so nothing they ache more deeply to see.I loved the relationships — just as a special note, the relationship between Circe and Telegonus made me want to cry. I basically loved everything. I mean, I think you guys have gotten pretty easily why I liked this so much — a morally-grey-character-driven retelling revolving around agency is basically my entire what-I-like bio. This did all the things I like and I want to reread it daily and hourly. I very well might.

I don't even think most tv shows are worth that much of my time. “The storm was not his father. It owed him nothing.”Everyone on Innis Lear is deeply connected to the stars. Some, including the King, Lear, have begun to be ruled by them. This King Lear retelling explores his three daughters, as they fight for the crown. That isn’t the full extent of what this book encompasses, though. Queens of Innis Lear boasts an impressively large cast of characters:→Gaela, the Goneril character, eldest and most ambitious. Aroace (word not used but definitely canonical) and there’s a lot done with her gender. Married to the Albany character; theirs is a marriage founded on ambition, but it is not uncomplicated. →Regan, the middle, yearning to be a mother. Married to the Duke of Conley, the Cornwall character; there is genuine love between them. My personal favorite. →Elia, the Cordelia character, youngest, dutiful and in love with her island. I found her… frustrating and decidedly the least dynamic of these characters. →Ban, the Fox, the Edmund character: a wizard and the banished bastard of Lear’s ally, Earl Erigal (the Gloucester character). Brother to Rory, the Edgar character and rightful heir. Has a… possibly polyamorous dynamic with Regan and Conley? →Morimaros, a nearby king of Aremoria and a beefed-up version of the king of France character. Ambitious but not unsympathetic. There’s also Brona, the witch and lover to Earl Erigal; Kayo the Oak Earl, the princesses’ foreign-born adopted uncle; and Aefa, servant to Elia. Brona and Aefa each have points of view, and at times, I felt each of these points of view could have been left out in their role as more tangential characters. Brona is at least interesting, and relevant in her role; Aefa is not. Almost all of her point of view chapters, actually, are her observations of Elia, and though she’s not an awful character she just plays no role in the story. I frankly have no idea how this made it through editing rounds. It is excess that does not add.This general theme of excess is exactly what I disliked about this novel. There is so much here that does not add to the novel, that distracts from solid characterization and interesting dynamics. Not every subplot needs the same detail and attention as the main conflict between the sisters. And not everything needs to be repeated three times. Also, in terms of character writing, it’s possible I just don’t vibe with Tessa Gratton, but I find her character voices often start driving me up a wall. Specifically, Ban the Fox. He started so compelling. But his writing seems more and more as if it’s just… attempting to get us to sympathize with him. I sympathized with him. The attempts to constantly convince me made me do so less. An added romance between Ban and Elia is actually not a horrific concept, but it does not need the pagetime it gets of the two yearning after each other. It’s lovely for a time, but quickly shifts to dead boring. I think what resonated with me the most about this book is the complexity put into the sibling dynamic between Gaela, Regan, and Elia. To Gaela and Regan, Elia was the favorite of an awful man, a murderer; they were the big sisters who stuck together, and she was the one who betrayed them in favor of their torturer. In essence, the war between them is not just about their father, but about their entire approach to life. Gaela and Regan fight against fate, hide from fate, attempt to subvert and overturn it; Elia believes in fate, worships it, attempts to work within it. At its best, it is a book about flawed, tragic women driving themselves to ruin over a father figure who is complex at best and actively emotionally abusive at worst. At its worst, it is a 600-page monster that just got tiring. “I don’t want to be chosen above all things, one thing most of all. I want to be a part of someone’s whole.”Overall: This was interesting, with some sections and character things that I loved a lot. But overall, I am so tired. And maybe audiobook wasn’t the best vibe for this story, either. CW for the general murder/war themes that come along with political fantasy along with miscarriage, suicide & suicidal ideation, and domestic abuse.

She writes these brutal yet beautiful descriptions that feel as if they’re hitting me in the chest. She writes these characters I hate and want to hug at the same time, these horrible human beings somehow right on the page. The Fever is a claustrophobic read, a book about the dynamic of small towns and the dynamic between parents and children. And it is a book about teenage girls, in all their flaws. This entire concept succeeds because the characters here are immensely flawed, yet somehow they draw your empathy. Deenie, the lead, is a character stuck somewhere between naivete and adulthood. Her friends Gaby and Lise were both written excellently. And Mr. Nash got my empathy despite my hatred for him in the beginning.I didn’t guess the answer to the mystery, but I honestly think it doesn’t matter if you do.

They became their own kind of monster.my heart actually still exists but I'm going to sell it to a demon because I no longer truly have it. this was SO. CATHARTIC. There are books that make you cry of sadness, and then there are books that make you cry with a sense of beauty. A sense that no matter how terrible things get, everything will eventually get better. Books that you emotionally connect to. And this book... wow. The Hearts We Sold is one of the best explorations of abuse and self-hate I've ever had the pleasure of reading.Our lead, Dee, is a biracial Latina abuse survivor trying to hang on to college, and a life away from home, when she finds out she's lost her scholarship. It is this ultimatum that leads her to sell her soul to a demon. Which is one of the coolest concepts ever, first of all. But it also really nails this concept. This book is weird, and whimsical, and so great.Dee is... such a fantastically done character. Her arc primarily focuses around her history of abuse and her self-hatred: her feeling that everything is her fault, and that she deserves nothing. The thesis of the importance of finding family beyond your blood, and not putting up with blood when they'll give you nothing - it's so important to me. And wow, Lloyd-Jones captured how it feels to come from a bad household really, really well; the only other book I've read that captured this topic so well was Heather Demetrios' Bad Romance. While I definitely think this one could be triggering, it's definitely not torture porn about how much abuse sucks meant to cause tears. This book is a totally different beast. Something that also really struck me about this book was how well adjusted Dee projects herself to be; from interacting with her once, you would never guess at her past, and that is exactly what she wants. She has found herself in stories, hidden her pain under miles and miles of homework and schoolwork and recovery. But as much as she's gotten through her childhood, as much as she's made herself stable, she has not recovered. It is never that easy, and it is a process, and the end doesn't ever come — it's about improving over time. “This must be why the demon took their hearts. Because it was the only way a human might survive this—by hollowing themselves out.”What struck me about this book was the sympathy given to every character’s struggle within the narrative. Lloyd-Jones strays very far from making moral judgments about character action, even when certain side characters do things that are undeniably terrible, leading to a sense of amorality for every character. The side characters are each given their own narrative agency and development, and while some might not be likeable - Cora especially is not a character I'd consider likable - all are developed enough that they become hard to hate. Also, found family trope. So much found family trope. Oh, and speaking of side characters, I adored the queer rep in here. This is one of the only YA books I've ever read with a relationship between a lesbian, the iconic Gemma, and a trans girl, my new book girlfriend Riley. And that's really sad. While I'm not trans, I personally thought Riley's character was really well-written - she's not a tragic trope and she's not written in a fetishistic way at all. I also liked that several of the characters were people of color and a few had chronic illnesses or disabilities; the casual diversity is lovely to see. While there is a romance here, there are two points in its favor: 1) it's not the focus, and 2) James is so fleshed-out and well-written that it is impossible not to love him. The relationship between Dee and James is built so well, without too much focus towards the beginning and a focus on a slow-burn instead. I adored it, and you all know how picky I am with my book couples. They are just so completely believable and I love them.In terms of plot, I think some readers may be disappointed, and at the same time I am so satisfied. This is primarily a subtle story, rather than one full of action, and your enjoyment will primarily depend on how much you connect to these characters. While I adore the worldbuilding - come on, a widespread industry of demons making deals? - I think this story could've had a much smaller amount of worldbuilding and I still would've loved it just as much. The demon vibe is amazing, but the plot isn't always the focus. And I do feel quite a bit of this book was mostly buildup. It's one of those books that's more of a beautiful buildup to a stunning final conclusion than an I-loved-this-from-page-one-couldn't-put-it-down story. But for me, this really worked. Because speaking of endings— that ending. This story's ending was one of my favorite things I've read this year. It's two pages of solid crying. It's a perfect balance of sad and happy. It's exactly why I LOVE emotional catharsis so much. Basically, this is a really impactful emotional arc I'm sure will be a new fave for many. I can't even put my finger on exactly what about it hit me so much, but this book came very, very close to making me cry. This was a buddyread with the buddyread-luck squad Melanie and Destiny, and considering we all gave it a three or above, we'll all hopefully be looking out for more by this author. I know I plan to follow Lloyd-Jones in the future and probably reread this a thousand more times.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,310,1,"Oct 22, 2017","Oct 30, 2017","Mar 21, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26309792-the-hearts-we-sold

She's got a strong writing voice, fantastic concepts, and a great commitment to casual diversity. Her debut was a romance-free book about a Deaf street artist and the friendship she forms with a girl at her school. Her second novel is about a nerd girl who dresses as a boy to avoid harassment. I have to say, I don't think I loved this quite as much as her debut. While our heroine, Cameron, is feisty and real, she doesn't have the snarky whit of Julia from You're Welcome Universe. Given that the humor was maybe my favorite part of that book, the lack of strong voice really disappointed me. Don't worry, though; the nerdy bent of this novel made up for it. Chaotic Good is a book about being a girl and trying to interact with nerd guys, and oh man, is it unfortunately relatable. The portrayal of sexism felt so real and tangible.I do have to say, in a book all about dressing up as a boy, I kinda wish there had been a mention of gender not being binary. You know, even a single mention. It's fairly easy to mention that kind of thing; Noteworthy by Riley Redgate did this very well just last year. But that's a fairly minor complaint. This book was most enjoyable to me during the geeky D&D sections as all the characters hung out together. I liked seeing all the characters play off each other, and I also LOVED the D&D stories. The mixed media is really special. In fact, the comic pages brought this story from “fairly okay” to “really fun”. That's pretty much all I have to say about this.

It’s a moment that is horrible and beautiful all at oA Girl Like That begins as we see Zarin and Porus holding hands and walking off to their deaths. It’s a moment that is horrible and beautiful all at once, and the book never quite stops being that. So first of all, this is one of the most intense & heartbreaking books I have read, ever, and I think that's worth knowing going in. But at the same time, it’s an incredibly important book about how the culture of Saudi Arabia is tailor-made to alienate its people; how it teaches boy that sexual assault is right, just as in America; how it teaches girls that their only power is in backstabbing; how it doesn’t give others the money to make a living; how it forces girls into the role of victim and outsider. There are four narrators to this book, and then several important side characters - one of the narrators, if I’m being honest, made literally no impact on me and could have been replaced by a different side character and I would have liked it far more. But I’m going to be honest, I was most compelled by two narrators. Zarin’s arc is a gorgeous story about how we can internalize our own belief that we are lesser, that we are not worth love, because we don't fit cultural norms or we don't keep our mouths quiet as women or because we are simply outsiders in a country with a different majority. As a Zoroastrian victim of abuse, there is a suffocated & claustrophobic quality to her writing, as she feels herself drowning in an environment where she cannot be herself. I… love Zarin. Like, I would give my life for Zarin. She’s such a fantastic character and I adore her. She has a moment where she gets to stand up, and it is everything. It is worth the entire book. Mishal’s arc is far more complex, and I really think I would need to reread this to analyze the whole thing because it took me a while to love her. But by the end of this book, I was… incredibly invested in Mishal. She’s a Muslim girl who has internalized a belief in her own lack of power, so she uses her power in subversive ways - she runs a tumblr blog for school gossip @blueniqab, and she gossips, and she tries to wield power in all the subtle ways, but she is struggling and I love it. Her story is far less of a tragedy than perhaps any other character within this book and I sort of… love that. I love that Tanaz Bhathena is so willing to look at her actions and realize they were bad but also understand them and not make her suffer more. Because I love Mishal. I do want to note that at least one Muslim er has pointed out her dislike of the portrayal of Islam and Saudi Arabia by an author who is Zoroastrian, not Muslim. Which I… both get and don’t get. There’s an implication in one of these s that the author knows nothing about Saudi Arabia, which is incorrect - Tanez Bhathena actually grew up in Saudi Arabia, as stated in her author bio. This  also states that there are no sympathetic Muslim characters, which is somehow both a fair reading and absolutely not my personal experience with the book. None of these characters, besides maybe Porus, are actually good people. But Mishal is Muslim and an incredibly sympathetic character - I think you might be able to tell she was my favorite? (Her brother, Abdhullah, was also a character I found a lot of sympathy for.)I will also say that the romance between Zarin and Porus, though really, really sweet, went too close [for me] to the love-cures-abuse trope. This is a really big and recurring problem in YA and I really want it to stop. And as my trusted er friend Ilsa pointed out, there are literally no positive relationships in this book besides one m/f ship, which did bother me. But for me personally, this was an intense, heartbreaking book about rape culture and cultural alienation and internalization of a belief that we are lesser, that we are undeserving, and I adored it. Mishal and Zarin especially will stay with me for a very, very long time. A Girl Like That is an absolutely horrifying book and I am so glad I read it.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,-1,181,1,"Jun 10, 2018","Jun 13, 2018","Mar 19, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29451548-a-girl-like-that

This book doesn't take itself too seriously, making jokes out of major hero and villain tropes. I always love books that subvert tropes; there's something so enthralling about seeing the model you've always seen before slightly different. Nimona is cute and funny, for sure, but it really succeeds from its great characters. We have the main character, anti-villain Ballister Blackheart, who's actually trying to take down a major dystopian organization. We have the hero, Ambrosius Goldstein, the anti-villain's ex-best-friend (or possibly just his ex-boyfriend), who's being duped himself. And we have Nimona, a villain's sidekick who's far more evil than the villain himself. Nimona and Blackheart's dynamic is awesome. He treats her like a little sister as the book goes on, and their relationship really warmed my heart. Ballister and Ambrosius also have a great dynamic and I'm guessing we can call them a canon couple? I mean, this author wrote Lumberjanes, which has major hat characters, so I'm thinking yes. The art style is really nice; polished but still looking like a graphic novel. The color palettes here are especially nice.

The Forbidden Wish is a romantic Aladdin retelling with added romance, yes, but it's also a story about women and their power in the world. Talk about passing the Bechdel test - this absolutely killed it with badass girl leads. I'm tired of living for the dead. I want to live for you.There is a major romance here, but it's one I enjoyed far more than usual. I really loved the developing romance between Zhara and Aladdin. Not only is their relationship building slow and high-quality; they're also just very good for each other. I felt invested in their relationship just by the virtue of how sweet they are. I could spend the rest of my life discovering you.I also really loved Zhara's character arc. She's a girl who believes she's a monster and hates herself for it. I know this kind of character is bit of a archetype, but it's an archetype I personally love when done well. This book definitely did the archetype well. I really loved the way Zhara was written and developed. You can't choose what happens to you but you can choose who you come because of it.I have to admit, though, this whole thing felt a little insubstantial. But I can't even really complain about this, because that was the intention!! It's a romantic fantasy. This book was so clearly not for me to analyze!! It's not necessarily meant to be serious. It's a romantic fantasy, and it's a good one at that. I rushed through this and absolutely enjoyed it. That should be enough for me. Hopeless romantics will enjoy it maybe more than me, but this is was certainly very high quality as these books go and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who feels interested.

(It's September 8th, why are all of my books still in California.)The fact that this series won the Hugo award three years running should very quickly establish its degree of quality but I'm going to quickly point out the things that Wowed Me anyway. The writing of this book is glorious — there’s a sardonic and a crisp tone to it, without any wasted words. The worldbuilding is wonderful and involved. (However, I admit that I tend to be really intimidated by worldbuilding-heavy books, so can I just say — this should not intimidate. Despite the level of detail and complexity, the broad plot is not too convoluted.)This book contains several plot twists that remain some of the wildest and most incredible in literature, including one that literally caused me to scream out loud. (This is partially because the last 150 pages of this book gave me so much anxiety that I think my brain short-circuited.) While there’s not necessarily always something going on, there’s always lingering tension; this world is dangerous, and we feel that, in every beat of the book. Oh, and the characters are just the best. There are three POVs within this book: ➽Essun — an older Orogene whose husband has killed their young son after he showed signs of power. Her story is told in second-person narration. She falls in with two mysterious people, Hoa and Tonkee, while looking for her daughter Nassun. ➽Demaya — a child Orogene taken from her parents to the Fulcrum, a training ground for Orogenes. Her plotline is horrifying. (That hand scene absolutely haunts me, as in it's been a year since I first read this and I still vividly remember it.)➽Syenite — a young Orogene who has grown up at the Fulcrum. Syenite's storyline is my favorite. Also, her dynamic with Alabaster honest to god kills me. I was just thinking this recently after reading This Savage Song, but it bears repeating: a book using enemies-to-best-friends as its key dynamic is everything I have ever wanted and I am blessed. Alabaster and Syenite, y’all. Holy fuck. I want to read 300000000 pages of them being deep-level best friends with a romantically-overtoned but still deeply platonic bond. I would die for them. (As I've now finished this series, I'm going to say it: I really wish they interacted more in the following books.)Putting aside the fact that this book consumed my waking hours and the fact that Syenite could kill me and I would thank her. The thing that resonates with me about this book and this series in general is that its central question is this: in a world that barely thinks of you as human, in a world where you have to fight for the respect others receive without prompting, in a world where you are told from the beginning of your inherent inferiority, how can you find a sense of being? The answer, if there is one, is through love. The Fifth Season is a book of brutal acts of oppression, but love — between lead character Syenite and her friend (it’s complicated) Alabaster, or between Syenite and her daughter Nassun — is the driving force of the book, the thing that characters risk their lives for.As a story about how human beings can be taught to believe in themselves only as cogs in a great wheel, it is utterly gut-wrenching. And in a book driven by an all-black cast, and several queer leads — the most prominent three side characters are a gay man, a bi man, and a sapphic trans woman — this feels especially significant. The fantasy setting trope of a minority culture heavily coded as being some other race is nothing new; what is new, however, is the fact that Orogenes are, in most cases, the point-of-view characters, and the lens through which we see this new world.

It’s got a lot of series potential, but a lot of it is very Bland Fantasy™. If you want random countries we’re not invested in, and characters you'd like to love but truly don’t, you'll probably like this. Mostly, I just felt this was super narratively all over the place because it’s trying so hard to be A Cool Fantasy Book – it expects you to enjoy the journey of several characters with several different countries but also doesn’t really make you care about this world or, more importantly, any of those characters or relationships. The lack of connection to the characters means this doesn’t feel grounded. It is a dry and lacking-in-humanity read. And the all-over-the-place feel is fine, but it also feels manufactured. One of the biggest problems in YA right now is too-many-side-characters syndrome, and holy shit, does this book suffer. And I’m not complaining about the side characters themselves; the issue is how they contribute to a larger narrative problem. This hurts the narrative in that many of the actions of the side characters and villains feel engineered for conflict. It’s an annoying read because on an objective level, the whole thing feels like something I should like... but the attachment just isn’t there.Okay, just so this doesn’t feel unbacked, let’s talk about the characters and why I was not attached. ➽Safi - I am so disappointed by this character. Her emotional arc is super shallow and she just fundamentally... doesn’t feel very real?➽Merek - the YA equivalent of white bread. I could not get attached to him at all.➽Iseult - deliciousfinallysomegoodfuckingfood.gif. Yes, as expected, Iseult was my favorite. She’s the character who reads the most complex. I will say that I was expecting her to be my New Favorite Character Ever and I only Vaguely Like her and that. is disappointing.➽Aeduan - I don’t understand this man. Like, I think he has potential, but he currently feels like he’s being engineered to scare the shit out of me, and he honestly doesn’t because Safi spends so much of her time lacking any fucking common sense and not getting away from him.I also want to talk about the relationship focus in this, because I feel like that aspect was really disappointing? I do love the lack of love triangles and the strong focus on female friendship. Cool. But y’all, the female friendship often feels shoved to the side by the romance. Like, it’s better than a lot of books in the YA fantasy genre, but if you’re marketing something off the girl friendship I want 400 pages of them fighting through hell for each other, not driven-by-romance-but-then-sometimes-they-care-about-each-other.And then maybe let’s talk about the romance itself, because guys, it's soooooooooo boring. Here’s the thing about Safi and Merek: we know they’re going to be a thing ten seconds in, and though they don’t get together for another 300 pages, we are never given any reason to doubt they will. And also, come on, they do not banter enough. That’s my main thought, and like… yeah, I know this is my constant thing, but this is how I get invested in couples and it is Not There. There’s a budding romance I’m maybe more intrigued by, but honestly... eh. →overall← I was just sort of eh on this. I have heard book two has better character dynamics, so I hope I'll enjoy book two more? Watch this space.

It's annoying, yeah, but as long as the characters and romance are good, I can handle a not-that-scary dystopia. My issue is that the characters and romance in “dystoromances” are usually terrible; flat and barely worth mentioning, let alone reading. Bowen and Fiona don't even have much chemistry. Their relationship is angsty and cheesy and completely boring. Their relationship was yet another bastardization of the enemies-to-lovers trope. By that, I mean a submissive girl and a hot alpha male type guy and from the beginning the heroine cannot shut up about how amazingly hot he is. We GET it, authors, you are so amazing for having two characters go from hating each other to loving each other. Remember when that trope was actually used in a meaningful way? Not only is Fiona seriously flat, she has a severe case of idiot syndrome. I recognized this even as a seventh grader. She's both cardboard and so stupid that she's actively annoying. It would be one thing if her stupidity were a result of her odd situation and trauma. Nope, that would require character development. She's stupid for plot reasons. This has some good moments, to be fair. The beginning is especially enticing and creepy. It's clear that the author could've made this whole thing a suspenseful and heart-pounding adventure. She just chose to focus on romance, leaving us with underdeveloped worldbuilding and a badly paced plot. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,Jul 2012,Jul 2012,"Mar 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13517444-stung

Despite its short length, I found myself bored for most of the first half. However, my disapointment at the plot was outshined by my love for pretty much everything else. The character work here is sublime. Juliet is a funny and believable protagonist. Her emotional journey was easy to connect with, and I’m sure it will be for anyone who feels disenfranchised in society. This is Juliet's specific journey as a lesbian woman of color, and the author makes that very clear. Yet I was constantly impressed that Rivera managed to make this journey so specific yet so universal.The side characters shined here too. All were complex and developed, even in very little page time. I feel like I know these women. I feel like Gabby Rivera knows these women. I was just incredibly impressed by the amount I connected to this story. The integration of social issues here was also amazing. I’ve never read a book that represented so many issues so well. There’s a focus on lgbt issues, on women’s issues, on how women’s issues and trans issues need to be connected, and on racism issues. It’s revolutionary that this book got published by an agency. Juliet would be proud. I almost wish Juliet’s brave women heroes had been integrated more into the latter half of the book. It seemed like an amazing concept that almost got abandoned. I understand why it happened, though; there was a lot to resolve in the latter half. Again, the pacing needed a little editing.

Man, what do I even say about pages 1-300? Terrill's style is truly so compelling and unputdownable. I don't know how she does it, but I was hooked. I feel suspense is the best when it causes me an emotional reaction. This book certainly fits that criteria. So many scenes went so far as to viscerally horrify me. I was so involved in the characters and their moments of moral disgust. Speaking of which, I loved these characters! Nicholas was my favorite. Definitely. Lexi is cool too; she's very complicated. I do take issue with the forced romance plot, but I liked the love interest's character a fair amount. What I don't get is how you can take such a fabulous suspense novel and make the ending so obvious. Admittedly, I didn't totally anticipate one of the final twists. I felt Terrill showed her hand too early and too far from the end; by 85%, we have a fairly close picture to what happens. Yes, there is a final twist of sorts, but that twist didn't have the impact it needed. Let's discuss the final twist's problems. I will still avoid explicit spoilers, but if you want to go in knowing nothing, move forward. First of all, I just feel it didn't have much shock value. The way the twist plays out, it's more a cheap explanation of whose idea the murder was, rather than a real change in what happened. If that first point were acting alone, the book would've been fine. Unfortunately, I found the twist laughably easy to guess. I had that twist in my head as a batshit absurd possible solution idea at the 70% mark. And then I turned out to be correct. Disappointing. I do have to give props for a perfect open ending, though. That last line gave me the creeps. VERDICT: while the ending isn't amazing, this was truly a great book. Can't wait to read more by Terrill.

Not only is it very meh, the characters actively make me want to stab things. BRIEF OUTLINE OF SOME THINGS I HATE—> It's really dull. The action scenes are written badly. There's have been two death scenes already and both of them were incredibly anticlimactic. —> The amount of plot points Falling Kingdoms copies from Game of Thrones is... ridiculous. I happen to think GoT is somewhat overrated too, but this is definitely worse. —> I don't have a feel for the world. There's a map here that doesn't have a single city or detail on it. What's the point of a map if there's no detail? I can't picture a single environment here; the setting description is flat-out nonexistent. It's a fantasy novel! I want cool settings! Not only that, but the few bits we have gotten have been complete exposition. There's a hint of conflict between the countries, but the actual culture is nowhere. —> All of these characters strike me as relatively underdeveloped, although I haven't read enough to comment definitively. Maybe all of them suddenly get development, but for now, we're in a world of instalove. So far, every single character's voice sounds exactly the same. —> That would be tolerable, if not for the fact that the characters are actively annoying. They are completely self-absorbed and idiotic. And one of them is a creep. There are a lot of character tropes that I can tolerate; I can tolerate assholes and unlikable narrators. But I can't tolerate self-absorbed, arrogant characters. I cannot deal with creepy guys who are written to be tortured and angsty. And I especially cannot suffer through a jaunt with such idiotic characters.[image]I mean, I honestly don't have a single good point I can think of. Usually I'd hang on longer, but this is a six-book series; if I don't like it now, I'm not hanging on. Sorry, fantasy league, but I think this isn't for me.

All Our Yesterdays opens with Em and Finn in a research studio, living in cells right next to each other, before they break out and pop into a time machine bound for a day four years ago. Don't read s of this book and get spoiled, because you WILL regret it. Cristin Terrill incorporates so many twists and turns, which I truly was not expecting. Just when you think you have everything figured out, there's a twist. Multiple times my expectations got flipped within a page. In terms of relationship building and character work, this book absolutely rocked. Em and Marina are complex, interesting narrators, and I grew to love them both. Em especially stands out; she's resourceful and clever, but so full of love and caring beneath the surface. Marina's character development was amazing, and I went from disliking her to feeling immense sympathy her. James is one of the most complex characters I've read about in a while, and needless to say, he broke my heart. You know how I have very few book ships and am very picky about romance? Terrill managed to make me love her couples anyway. Em and Finn were just... perfect. They work so well together and are so honest with each other. I want my relationship to be that healthy and loving. James and Marina broke my heart too, despite how much they bored me at the beginning. I basically only have one complaint, and that is the first 100 pages. Em's opening moments are awesome, but Marina's chapters are superficial and annoying. Trust me, that goes away with a bang; a twist that left me desperate to keep reading. Not only did this book manage to make me fall in love with its characters, it also was a major mindfuck.

People forget you within days, they take new pictures to put on Facebook and they don't read your messages. They keep on moving forward and shove you to the side because you make more mistakes than you should.”There’s something so authentically millennial about this book. It’s in the sense of loss. The exploration of detachment from parents and of abuse. The music choices - London Grammar and The 1975’s Chocolate are mentioned on the same page. The diverse cast of characters and fact that literally every lead character is queer. The mention of memes. The exploration of the college experience. Or maybe it’s simply in the mood of the book, the desperate plea, throughout every page, to have someone listen. Maybe some will argue this dates the book, but I think it’s exactly the power of Radio Silence - that it feels real to the teen experience, both its themes and its current moments. I think everyone's a bit bored with boy-girl romances anyway. I think the world's had enouh of those, to be honest.🌺 If you’re looking for a book about platonic friendship, you should read this. Frances and Aled have the best-written, most compelling friendship. And I love that every single driving relationship in this book is either platonic or queer. Like, guys, this is incredible. This book invented mlm and wlw solidarity and also platonic love. 🌺 While the focus of the book is Aled and his podcast, the amount of real depth put into these characters and the amount of thought put into their emotional journies is so fucking incredible. Frances' arc around wanting to be seen and her journey into university is amazing. And though he’s not even the narrator, Abel’s paralell journey around his own abuse is equally amazing. “When you get to this age, you realized that you’re not anyone special after all. It's like... this is all there is. This is the only special thing about me.”🌺 The exploration of college pressures felt so authentic. And awesome. And raw. I loved how pro-living-your-life this book was!!🌺 The fucking diversity. When was the last time you read a book with a biracial bisexual lead featuring her gay demi bestie, his Asian maybe-boyfriend, and her found family of basically entirely queer characters? Because I know I never have. I think everyone's a bit bored with boy-girl romances anyway. I think the world's had enouh of those, to be honest.🌺 Above all else, this is a book about a group of characters learning to love each other and themselves. There’s so much found family and the Skwad of five formed at the end of the book is literally?? amazing.I wish I could be as subtle and beautiful. All I know how to do is scream.I think the thing I loved so much about this book is how timely it feels. I know that’s a complaint many will have about it, and I appreciate that books with this many current references date quickly. But maybe that’s for the best. This is a book that’s going to speak to a lot of people. This is also a book that a lot of thirty-year-olds are fundamentally not going to understand. This is also a book that teens will not be talking about in ten years because none of it is of their time. But this is also the kind of novel I can picture being analyzed by some college class a hundred years from now discussing teenage society in the 2010s - a stunningly specific yet strangely universal story. It is one of the only books I have ever read that truly captures what it is like to be a young adult in this generation.

I certainly did not!It might be sort of horribly ironic that I rated almost half these stories a very mixed and very mediocre three stars. BUT there were some super great standouts, hm? Some that might… I don’t know… warrant buying this entire collection?Okay. Somewhere That’s Green by Meredith Russo was fantastic and important and so worth the read. Oomph by Emery Lord is the Cutest thing I have ever read. The Unlikely Likelihood Falling In Love by Jocelyn Davies was sort of shockingly adorable. And The Department of Dead Love by Nicola Yoon was so thoughtful and creative, I never wanted it to end. If you’re looking for some other clever stories, look to Nina LaCour’s aestheticy Print Shop, Dhonielle Clayton’s different The Way We Love Here, or Julie Murphy’s sweet Something Real.But first, let me be totally honest: I only gave half these stories over three stars. Four five stars, two four stars, six three stars, one two, one one, for an average raiting of - get this - exactly a 3.5 star. So overall a pretty decent anthology? I wish a few of the threes had been edited just a bit more, because I think a bunch of them could have been so great! But oh well. Let’s get into the stories!Also, because Apple hates me, I'll be using this flag 🇸🇱 to denote lead sapphic characters - that is basically the only sort of lgbtq diversity we got in this anthology, aside from literally One sapphic trans girl, which is kind of sad - and ☀️ to denote lead characters of color!! thank you for reading My In Depth Opinions and not allowing me to just yell into the interwebs, without further ado:→ Siege Etiquette by Katie Cotugno← ★★★☆☆Slightly unlikeable narrator who I ended up empathizing with. Clever reveal halfway through the story that I didn’t see coming. Unfortunately, a completely forgettable meet-cute involving cheating. → Print Shop by Nina LaCour← ★★★★☆ 🇸🇱☀️This was so soft! Beautiful intro and outro really elevate this story. Evie and Lauren’s interactions are brief, but so freaking adorable.→ Hourglass by Ibi Zoboi← ★★★☆☆ ☀️Dark-skinned and large-bodied lead character Cherish has a freaking awesome character arc, but the meet cute itself here is basically the last page of the story. Best friend Stacy is just… such an asshole, which is hard to handle when their drama is played off. And perhaps worst of all, the writing is just not good. → Click by Katharine McGee← ★★★☆☆Alexa and Raden meet on a date where they’ve been perfectly matched. Maybe more of a 3 1/2! This was sweet but nothing that actually stood out? Also, I think my utter hatred for something this author once wrote has kind of ruined her for me. Whoops. → The Intern by Sara Shepard← ★★☆☆☆Intern Clara meets pop star Phineas and has a weird and not-built-up date with him. Well, okay, first of all, none of the emotional punches the story goes for are actually earned so it just feels… random. Did anyone notice of the first FIVE stories, THREE are about the death of a family member? And jesus, this celebrity x intern thing is really so boring now.→ Somewhere That’s Green by Meredith Russo← ★★★★★ 🇸🇱Out trans girl Nia has been awarded a petition to use the correct bathroom. Closeted Lexie petitions the school to take it back… and then realizes she’s doing it for her parents. Listen, this would’ve been so easy a concept to fuck up, but this story gets it right, never excusing Lexie’s actions but also giving her a decent amount of narrative sympathy. Nia is written fantastically – this is actually #ownvoices for trans rep! – and was such a compelling and awesome character. Also the ending of this was so fucking iconic!! This was basically perfect and I’m reading everything this author ever writes now. → The Way We Love Here by Dhonielle Clayton← ★★★☆☆ ☀️Probably the most positive of all my three-star ratings. Scared-of-love Viola meets cute guy Sebastian on an island where everyone has soulmate bands. Viola’s character totally made this story for me – she’s such a compelling protagonist. And I’m always a slut for good fate stories. Biggest problem: I love the Twelfth Night reference, but why did it have to be the two siblings from that play? Why would you do this @ Dhonielle Clayton I need an answer→ Oomph by Emery Lord← ★★★★★ 🇸🇱Peggy Carter and Natasha Romanoff meet in an airport and flirt their way through a flight delay. This is literally the purest thing I’ve read in my fucking life? Hilarious banter + compelling characters = happy me. I literally want to read a full novel about these two girls. They’re SO CUTE. AND PERFECT. This feels like a Hayley Kiyoko song. → The Dictionary of You and Me by Jennifer L. Armentrout← ★★★☆☆Library volunteer Moss tries to get a boy to return an overdue dictionary. I thought this was sort of sweet, but I really cannot deny that it the banter is truly badly written. Good flirting is really hard to write, but here’s a tip - don’t mention your characters laughing at things that are not really that funny. IT’S FUNNIER WHEN THEY DON’T LAUGH. I actually think this might’ve been higher if not for how fantastic Oomph’s banter was, but my standards were moved too high? Yikes?→ The Unlikely Likelihood Falling In Love by Jocelyn Davies← ★★★★★ ☀️Logic girl Sam tries to calculate the possibility of seeing a boy on the passing train again. IM GOING TO SCREAM AT HOW CUTE THIS WAS. None of you can ever understand how fucking cute? And sweet? And Good? This was? And it was so well-written! The author really knows how to drop in humor and leave it there rather than trying to force laughs. → 259 Million Miles by Kass Morgan← ★★★☆☆Oh wow, I was sort of expecting this to be shit? This follows Philip and Blythe, a boy and a girl stuck in a locked room for 24 hours to evaluate personality. Okay, this story works because the 1) the concept is great, 2) the stakes are really high, and 3) the dialogue is actually sort of decent. The lead female character is a total manic pixie dream girl, because we only have two male protagonists in this whole damn book, so at least one of the female romantic interests has to lack personality! But I weirdly got vaguely invested in the couple, which… wow? And yes, it was a little bittersweet, but I actually ended up liking how this story ended. → Something Real by Julie Murphy← ★★★★☆ 🇸🇱☀️I LOVE LOVE. This has basically the best concept ever, in which two girls competing for a dating show end up falling in love, and I totally wish it had been a full-length novel. I would read 2000 more pages of June and Martha going on dates. And I laughed out loud multiple times.→ Say Everything by Huntley Fitzpatrick← ★☆☆☆☆A guy asks a girl out at a diner while she is working as a waitress for his table. What an asshole, right? There is so much that is terrible about this story. The meet-cute is so woefully unromantic. The dialogue is so embarrassingly generic. The portrayal of sudden poverty is so completely tropey and overblown and just… no. The second person is awkward. And our big, fucking romantic hero reads as pretty creepy.→ The Department of Dead Love by Nicola Yoon← ★★★★★ ☀️This story made me feel like the most fake-deep person in the whole world. But in a good way? A recent breakup victim tries to go through love departments to do over his relationship... until he meets a girl working at one of the departments. The worldbuilding of this one is definitely the focus, but honestly, I am occasionally a sucker for brilliant concept work. I really wish this could be a full book. and this story also contains my favorite quote from the anthology:“Some people you want to get to know and some people you want to know you. I think that's the difference.”Yeah. In case you didn't notice, I really liked this collection.

Today, an anonymous article was published by my school in which this was mentioned and discussed, under a pseudonym. And in a lot of ways I think I got off lucky, but seeing that article today felt like a punch in the gut or maybe like flying, I don't know which one right now. And it's interesting because I've read a lot of books that touch on the experience of sexual assault and sexual harassment but this is the one that has come closest to capturing the feeling of taking back your body, and the experience of crying with your best friend who's been through something just as bad, and I read and ed this book before my experience but it still rings so so true. Original ReviewThis is not a book I am worthy of ing. This is a masterpiece of human emotion, of writing, of character development. So Girl Made of Stars follows Mara, whose twin brother Owen has been accused of rape by Mara’s best friend. But it's... so much more than that. There is something about this book that just hit me. I mean, it's kind of just perfect? The characters feel like completely real people, to a degree that is almost terrifying. The themes are perfectly handled. But most of all, this book just has a degree of emotional authenticity I have almost never seen in literature.There is a love triangle here with a bi lead, but it is handled so well. I think I might literally be known for hating this trope but this is the Most honest and open dynamic with a love triangle I have ever read. Mara’s dynamic with Charlie, her ex, is one of learning - they are two people who were best friends and then who fell in love and then who fell apart. And now Mara has to figure out why. Mara also has a relationship with a guy named Alex, one of Owen’s best friends - or maybe ex-best friends. Mara’s relationship with Alex is - vague spoilers - not the primary relationship of this book. But it’s also a fundamental part of Mara’s character development that I really like. And Alex is a very good person. I trust him.You know what I really love, though? MARA’S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHARLIE. Charlie is nonbinary [yes, she uses she/her pronouns] and is an incredibly complex character. But her relationship with Mara is the most top tier ting I’ve ever read. These two characters are both flawed, dealing with their own problems and desperately trying to figure themselves out. Their relationship makes me so happy and gives me so much hope. For me, the most important aspect of this book was the narrative around Mara’s own trauma. While this book is blurbed and described as a book about Hannah’s rape, it is also a story about the unspoken trauma so many young people face - the trauma of having someone you trust violate you in a society that refuses to believe you. The narrative treatment of rape is so fantastically done and important too, with so much weight given to Hannah's accusation yet so much nuance given to every character's feelings on what has gone down. Mara, Charlie, Hannah, Alex, and Mara's family have all lost someone they trusted, all in their own way, and Girl Made of Stars knows this. While Girl Made of Stars is not the most smoothly flowing, I somehow felt it actually made the book better? Yes, this book is messy and complicated, but the world is messy and complicated too. I think the nuanced characters and messy plot give this book its real feeling. I could not be happier to have read this book.I have... so much positive to say about this and literally nothing negative. I don’t think I’ve comprehensively explained why. I don’t think I am capable of that at this point in my life. But this book will be in my top five of the year. This is one of the best books I have read in my entire godforsaken life and I'm having one of my THIS I S SO B E A U T I F U L crises and. I don’t even know. None of you are allowed to publish books anymore, this book just killed all of them.

When you look at the papers on your desk and circle something, are you really reading from them? Don’t you read from a teleprompter? When you go to commercial, you shuffle those papers, too. Seriously, is there anything even written on them?”This book, following a young lesbian writing letters to known lesbian legend Rachel Maddow and while trying to win a school election for the Real Students, has a lot going for it. It missed the mark on a few aspects? But overall, this was really good.✔ P R O S→So first of all, this book is fast-paced, and the voice is super super strong, and the book is genuinely funny in places despite being really dark. Brynn’s voice… genuinely reads like that of a high schooler, albeit a younger one. “Nevertheless, they persist. I guess that means I fucking have to, too.”→A really strong main character, who is flawed and dimensional and compelling and easy to root for. Brynn is going through awful things at home, and with family, and has not become sad: she has become righteously angry. That is something I did when I was younger and I don’t think I’ve seen it represented so accurately in a book before. Brynn is like freshman year me and I love it. The discussion of depression, and of her home life is subtle, intertwining throughout the book, but gets darker and darker.“People call me ‘brave’ all the time, and it annoys me. As if my mere existence is some sort of war. It’s not. I don’t think I’m any braver than another person just trying to live life. I just can’t do stairs.”→Young Adult literature has a tendency to forget about side characters! This book did not forget about side characters! Lacey, who uses a wheelchair and a keyboard to speak, is one of the book’s funniest and best-developed characters. Michaela, Brynn’s secondary love interest, was a great character as well: I absolutely love her development. Justin! Leigh! Erin!→This book is a fucking scree against ableism and voting suppression laws. Brynn is! a journalist! And as she attempts to challenge a policy only allowing honors students to vote, the book ends up strongly discussing voting rights: how a literacy test of any kind is an unfair limitation. (This probably would've worked better if more characters were people of color; only Michaela is.) There's an excellent discussion here of how ableism affects the general school's perception of people like Brynn and Lacey's intelligence. ✔ …A N D Y E T→At times I did think the dialogue writing was… messy. Most of the writing is voicey and snappy and fun, but the dialogue just didn’t do it for me. →There’s a bit where one character sort of cheats on her girlfriend, and… allows herself to be kissed by her ex, and I couldn’t tell if it was meant to be nonconsensual, but it bugged me that it was never discussed. Its inclusion felt really pointless. →I really like epistolatory novels. However, I also think making epistolatory format hold a book on its own is really difficult. Brynn’s letters, understandably, are a projection of who she is, not a full confession. As a result, Dear Rachel Maddow often struggles with its more emotional moments because Brynn buries her own tragedy in humor. I think this is an understandable and solid character decision; it’s just that the format is so distancing we don’t really see her catharsis. →And the other problem is that… she doesn’t get catharsis. I’ve been pouring through the s trying to figure out why this didn’t fully work for me, and I just have to quote this amazing :There's no catharsis. There's no fucking accountability. The book is crying out for a scene where Brynn looks her mother in the eyes and says, ""Part of the reason I am in so broken is because you've been a shit mother."" Where she snaps and busses to her father's house and demands to know why he abandoned here. Where some adult steps in and says to her stepfather he's an abusive jerk and the way he treats Brynn is wrong. (And where someone just fucking holds Brynn and promises she'll be okay.)Brynn’s character arc is so good, so good, so good, until the end of the book when it completely drops the ball on her confronting her parents. As someone who has had a very complicated home life, I desperately needed her to confront her mom and take even one step herself towards recovery. Without that, this book reads a little bit like one long breakdown.Perhaps it’s a statement of goodness that despite all that, I was a fan of this book. The story is clear and there are a lot of creative things being done here. And not to make this weird, but does Rachel Maddow know this book is being published? Is she proud?TW: minor suicidal ideation; challenged homophobia, a lot of discussions of challenged ableism, severe child abuse, drug overdose, and family death.

Evan doesn’t have an arc in this book beyond the messily written one he has because of Henry. And obviously, that’s an annoyance in any book, right? It’s a little boring. But in a book about a suicidal boy trying to recover from abuse, it’s downright bad. The most important thing in getting out of an abusive environment is a strong support system. A romantic relationship itself isn't bad, but it is never a good cure for abuse. A relationship is not a truly healthy endeavor until some degree of inner mental recovery is already occurring. Evan is not in a good place to proceed in a serious relationship when his relationship with Henry begins - he is unsure of his sexuality, suicidal, and essentially hanging on to life by a thread. He has not at all begun a recovery process, even an inner one, and the narrative of this book is not, in my opinion, cognizant of the delicacy of his situation with Harry: What a person in his situation needs is a support system of people who want what is best for him and are willing to step away when he needs them to. Henry is not that, nor can any teenager - or any one person - be that. This message is one not of empowerment, but of romance being the cure for an abusive situation. As is touched on in books like Heather Demetrios’ Bad Romance, turning to romance as a cure for abuse can be a really simple transition to further abuse: abuse survivors sometimes lack support systems necessary to leave future bad relationships (true for Evan) or the type of self-esteem they need (also very true for Evan.) I definitely have a penchant for getting slightly annoyed at the prevalence of cure-romance tropes in books about abuse. But I want to make it really clear I think romances can be done well, and handled respectfully. Obviously Evan, were he a real life person (which he is not), would be in his own situation that might not conform to easy standards of healthiness. And it’s this fact, above any other, that makes this specific romance so completely disturbing.→why this romance feels toxic: a discussion←Evan is a teenager dealing with severe abuse who is still struggling with his sexuality and most importantly, has no support system beyond Henry. ...more",Notes are private!,0,263,1,"Jan 07, 2018","Jan 08, 2018","Mar 12, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32797600-the-dangerous-art-of-blending-in

A story following a genderqueer narrator who can turn people into boxes, and her love interest who can literally magically switch sexes, all set in a 19th-century-Italian-inspired world by an Italian-American author. Like, come on, how can I even resist that?The Brilliant Death follows Teo, who, after her father is murdered, is forced to journey to the capital of her state to attempt to save his life. Along the way, a form-changing witch joins her. She also turns several terrible men into inanimate objects, which is something I am always here for. Fundamental to this book is a discussion of denial of identity. Lead character Teodora has both denied her identity as a witch and denied her complicated relationship with her gender. I absolutely loved the coherency with which her arc around discovering herself tied together - her character journey is one of my favorite aspects of this book. And with this, the book becomes a journey about hiding places, and the way we can hide love and hide queerness in plain sight. There’s a clear avoidance of the inevitable outing, which I almost expected throughout the book, and I was incredibly impressed by how well Capetta handled this. There is also a romance, and it is fairly shockingly good. Cielo, the love interest, is a bit of the Rogue Hero trope in the best way. They sometimes appear as a boy and sometimes as a girl, but are never quite either. Sort of related - the book’s utter refusal of gender is too powerful. This is #ownvoices for both nonbinary characters and it is just so excellent. Unfortunately, there are also some cliche moments. A death I didn’t like. Some villain monologuing. Plot is often forgotten for the (admittedly, very good) romance. Though the villains do have shades of well-intentioned extremist, they aren’t very memorable - sisters Azzura and Delfina are the only exceptions. I could have had more of Teo’s love for her family. And I did not vibe with some of the writing. It's mostly really good, and then sometimes sentences just feel weird. I have to be honest though and say that my #1 favorite moment of this book was when Amy Rose Capetta called her partner Cori “my very own sexy magic tutor” in the acknowledgments. I, personally, love romance. ✨Arc received via my local bookstore for an honest . releases: 8 October 2018.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,229,1,"Sep 07, 2018","Oct 07, 2018","Mar 12, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34198648-the-brilliant-death

It’s easy for them to dismiss the warnings from the Undying, the stories of their own civilization’s downfall. But the human race has been dismissing the decline of our planet and the destruction of its resources for centuries now. We’ve gotten pretty good at it.This book is entertaining and nothing more. Honestly, my feelings here were basically a more extreme version of my feelings on Warcross earlier this year - good potential, entertaining story, not much more than that.Okay, first off, and my most basic solid complaint: the first person pov does not work here. I remember thinking the same thing with An Ember in the Ashes - first person pov just does not work when you have two characters. Also, that blurb is misleading. The traps and tricks in this book are not that unsolvable, and frankly, I found them only a bit interesting - it was the obvious potential of the story’s first half that kept me going, and not the actual payoff. And okay, let’s throw in our first solid compliment! While Unearthed didn’t focus on this theme as much as I would’ve preferred, I appreciated that this book very much does try to question elitism, and moreover, questions the judgement we place on others. Mia’s assumptions that Jules’ father was simply an academic who cared nothing for the people, and more importantly, Jules’ judgement about Mia’s smuggling as completely immoral and flies in the face of academia. The two lead characters here are both fairly compelling:🌺 Mia - a smuggler and a desperate soul trying to save her sister (a trope, but whatever)🍀 Jules - a clever linguist who still has common senseWhile I did think this relationship developed overly quickly, it was offset by a few dynamics that worked for me. First of all, the two lead characters here have a good dynamic for the most part. There’s a touch of good banter towards the beginning - though I would’ve preferred way more - and their relationship wasn’t so committed as to be unbelievable. And second, I liked that Jules and Mia don’t fit your typical bad-boy-good-girl YA couple dichotomies. Jules’ characterization avoids much of the toxic masculinity common in YA books - he’s probably the more emotional and less physical of the pair. And I loved that Mia, despite being a very physical person, is more STEM-oriented: Jules is more of a linguist, while Mia is a self-proclaimed math lover.Listen, guys, I’m not going to pretend this book is anything that it wasn’t. My enjoyment of this book, though substantial, was not because of some deeper message I found. But with an interesting ending and a romance that I know the target audience will appreciate, I think this will be a super succesful release.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,93,1,"Jan 02, 2018","Jan 04, 2018","Mar 12, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32941343-unearthed

Yes, there's symbolism, but it's all about the rugged west and the resilience of the masculine spirit. Original. I won't deny the prose is decent.

There's plenty of hurr-durr-Mexico-is-full-of-terrible-brown-people, but at least Alejandra's a somewhat 3d character. Still racist though.

This isn't necessarily the creepy horror novel that I expected - it's more of a character-driven romp. My biggest issue with this book was the plot taking so long to start. Due to the alternating plot threads, it takes around 70% of the book for things to really get started. I felt as if I wanted more from the plot development, to see more of this world and the worldbuilding. Why such an easy solution to the mystery? Why not more struggle? That being said, I was still intrigued the whole way through.What made this book so great for me was the character development and relationship between the sisters. This book very much focuses on the relationship between the two sisters, Od and Tru. They're two very different girls, but their bond was so effortlessly compelling to me. I also loved the casual disability representation feeling both realistic and healthy. Tru does need a brace, and it does restrain parts of her life, but the narrative emphasizes that she's not a lesser person because of it. There's a moment where Tru writes a letter to a younger disabled girl telling the girl how she'll grow up to succeed. I loved this moment; it's so small, but it made me so happy.

While I thought book one had the same amazing atmosphere and a fantastic concept, this book had far more solid character work.If any of you remember my  of Every Heart a Doorway, you'll remember that Jack was by far my favorite character. While I wanted to love Nancy, I found her a fairly bland character with not much of an arc. I also felt that Every Heart A Doorway had no middle. But this book has both a middle section and significant character work. Seanan McGuire has definitely ironed out the kinks in her novella-writing talent. With another sigh, Alexis took it and slid off the bed. “Those ‘village oafs,’ as you like to call them, will have houses and trades of their own one day. You’ll have a windmill.” “A very clean windmill,” said Jack. “They’d be able to give me children. That’s what Mother says.” “I could give you children,” said Jack, sounding faintly affronted. “You’d have to tell me how many heads you wanted them to have, and what species you’d like them to be, but what’s the point of having all these graveyards if I can’t give you children when you ask for them?”Jack is probably my favorite thing about this tiny book. She's a mad scientist and she's brave and she's hilarious. I could read eight books about her. The relationships of this tiny book were all so intriguing. I absolutely loved the banter between Alexis and Jack. I also really enjoyed the relationship between Jack and Jill; their character clash is perfectly written. “Oh, I’m sorry.” Jack raised her head, reaching up to adjust her glasses as she did. “I thought it was a stray dog knocking the door open. Where I come from, people knock.” “You come from the same place I do,” said Jill. “Yes, and people knocked.”This book is a lot darker than Every Heart A Doorway. The Moors are not on the same level as Nancy's odd but lovable world. Jack and Jill are in a dangerous, scary world, but they're owning it. I loved the eerie atmosphere to this story; I found this book incredibly unputdownable. I also just really love how feminist this book is. The discussion on how forced gender roles fail is one of the best I've ever seen. “The concept that perhaps biology was not destiny, and that not all little girls would be pretty princesses, and not all little boys would be brave soldiers.”One final note before I go: I really desperately need answers on that ending. Answer my questions, Seanan McGuire. Please.

This book especially, however, lacks a middle.// POSITIVESSo many books have talked about the secret doorway into the unknown, the passage through an unknown door. Every Heart A Doorway is about what happens to those kids when they come back to the “real world”. Sounds like an awesome concept? It totally is. And to some degree, I think it's executed well. Seanan Mcguire’s language is gorgeous. Her dialogue is snappy and fun, but the narrative language is beautiful - the perfect balance. “Hope is a knife that can cut through the foundations of the world... Hope hurts. That's what you need to learn, and fast, if you don't want it to cut you open from the inside out.”This book does nail diversity. There’s an ace main character and a trans side character, which was awesome. The ace character was definitely represented well; I especially liked that the book separated asexuality and aromanticism, because oh dang, some people do not seem to understand they're different. I did think the initial description seemed almost... cheesy? It's good rep, I just thought the page on which Nancy explains asexuality was written a little clunkily. She spends around a page thinking about it, probably as a way to educate readers who don't know what asexuality is; I suppose I just found it too ""now I'm explaining things"" infodumpy. I did also like that all the diversity was incidental, while not being tokenistic. This is a hard balance to get right, but I thought it was done perfectly. Not a single character is defined by being lgbt, but it's ALSO not simply thrown in with. I think I missed something because I didn’t notice the existence of a gay character and I keep seeing s mentioning her. Was it Jack or is that my wishful lesbian brain?There's some interesting thematic work around PSTD and mental illness, which was nice. I also loved the subtle feminism woven throughout the book. Because ‘boys will be boys’ is a self-fulfilling prophecy,” said Lundy. “They’re too loud, on the whole, to be easily misplaced or overlooked; when they disappear from the home, parents send search parties to dredge them out of swamps and drag them away from frog ponds. It’s not innate. It’s learned. But it protects them from the doors, keeps them safe at home. Call it irony, if you like, but we spend so much time waiting for our boys to stray that they never have the opportunity. We notice the silence of men. We depend upon the silence of women.”The characters here are fleshed-out and interesting. I was a big fan of Jack, who’s morally ambiguous and funny. Corpses are incapable of offering informed consent, and are hence no better than vibrators.And of course, there's the witty, entertaining dialogue. // NEGATIVESNancy, unfortunately, didn’t leave much of a mark on me. She’s not a bad character; she never annoyed me. But she didn’t have a character arc. Why did she not have a character arc? Because Every Heart A Doorway was not nearly long enough (shocking, right?), and therein lies my main problem with this book; this book is just not fleshed out enough. Every Heart A Doorway is the first 100 pages and the last 70 pages of an incredible book. It feels like there was something missing. I felt the need to try and frame this book with the three-act structure, but I couldn’t, because there is literally no middle section. In general, the book feels rushed and underdone. Which sucks, because with a middle section added, this could have been one of the best books ever written. VERDICT: This book needed more of a middle, but I'd still recommend this as a series for the scope of the story.

Not that Séverin was complaining. It was just that, like other wolves, he wanted his share.I have a story. I guess. In mid-2016, I read this book called Six Of Crows, a frequent comp to this book. I had just started a Goodreads account at this point and wrote brief s only; I was reading a couple hours a week, maybe. But that book... I fell in love. I still vividly remember the details of my reading experience. On a more visceral level, it made me fall in love all over again with reading; I basically doubled how much I was reading overnight. In the three years since I first read that book, I have experienced that sensation of falling in love with reading all over again very, very rarely — I think I can name approximately ten books that have made me feel that way. This book is the closest I’ve come to replicating that feeling, in three years.So, why was I so obsessed with this?First of all, The Gilded Wolves a heist fantasy about a group of criminals in 1890s Paris, which is just a concept I was put on this planet to enjoy. This heist involves a lot of puzzles, including a golden ratio puzzle. I am a nerd and I found this really delightful. The plot is intriguing, drawing you along carefully, and though there aren’t any twists that blew my mind, there were quite a few that surprised me (which is hard! at this point! I’ve read so many heist books!) This genre is so wonderful because it is so very satisfying seeing puzzle pieces come together to a twist or reveal or even just a solution. I’m a really big fan of the fact that the main plot of this book is a metaphor for colonialism’s erasure of culture, but the characters are also dealing with the real-life effects of colonialism (because it’s still 1889 Paris?) The Order of Babel, formerly four houses, has been taken over by two, who have erased the legacies of the old. I don’t think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out the metaphor here and hence Chokshi doesn’t try to make it any more obvious. It’s just there! Being the main plot of the book! I liked this.The dynamics between the group are so good, and so entertaining but full of so much genuine love and care. There’s a moment where Severin asks for Laila’s report and Hypnos answers him, in detail, and then Severin just replies “are you Laila?” I loved that. These characters are really compelling, as well. Severin is deeply ambitious but also concerned for those around him, a combination I really like and think deserves more pagetime in literature. Laila could kick my ass any day and also should do so (I’m available every Thursday afternoon, hit me up). Anxiety legend. Deserves the world. Enrique is a very entertaining character and also a future historian. I loved him. Hypnos is a character I loved seeing grow: he’s a sometimes manipulative but sometimes genuinely loving character, and (view spoiler)[I’m really excited to see more of him in book two, he’s such a villain-turned-hero trope and I am such a sucker for that trope. (hide spoiler)] Tristan is a gardening nerd and deserves to be protected (but also was the character I found myself the least personally invested in). Zofia, though, was by far my favorite character in this book. Yes, I’m picking favorites, and yes, she is the best character in this book, do not @ me. Zofia is a magic forger who has autism and thus, her brain works in slightly different ways. She has been kicked out of a school, an event that was almost certainly influenced by antisemitism. She is also not totally on the understanding-that-people-are-flirting-with-her kick. She loves numbers and also people not messing with her area (a mood). I like that she’s written with clear differences in how she interacts with the world, but is never put in situations where she’s villainized for it, or where other characters act as if she’s being manipulative. Her sense of humor is so dry. Did I mention that I’d absolutely die for her. (Something I kind of love about these characters is that all of them have somewhat dark backstories, but none of them have lost their love and kindness. We’re all just in this world with dark pasts attempting to find tenderness and that is how it is.)I should also mention that of these main characters:→One is biracial (Algerian and French). Colonialism is discussed. →One is Indian and has anxiety. →One is Jewish and autistic. Bigotry is discussed. →One is black and biracial and queer. Slavery is discussed. Also, the gender of it all. →One is both biracial (Filipino and Spanish) and queer. It was honestly so hilarious seeing a  pretty low down on the page lambasting the fact that these characters are almost all people of color, because forced diversity or something. It’s a novel about colonialism in the 1890s. You realize that’s the point, right?There are multiple romances-maybe going on in this book and I support them all. One of them is a slow-burn occurring between two characters who may or may not have history, which is a weirdly rare trope considering how instantly compelling it is. The other is… oh god, I guess this is a spoiler but I didn’t specify characters if you want to click it — (view spoiler)[a very subtle love triangle that I’m like 80% sure is going to end in polyamory. (Chaima and I are hardcore rooting for this outcome and that is just how it is.) (hide spoiler)]I absolutely loved the setting of this. I am not typically a worldbuilding hoe but I am such a fan of fantastical cities with gorgeous exteriors hiding very dark interiors. The intrigue of it all! There’s something Chokshi said in the author’s note that really resonated with me:➽I couldn’t reconcile the horrors of that era with the glamour of it, which, up until then, was what had stood out in my imagination of the 19th century: courtesans and the Moulin Rouge, glittering parties and champagne… History is a myth shaped by the tongues of conquerors. I wanted to write this trilogy not to instruct or condemn, but to question. [...] Question what is gold and what glitters. This book is truly a love letter to remembering both the good and the bad of your past, and recognizing that even in the midst of beauty and innovation, there is horror and depravity. I’m really interested to see where the politics of colonialism go in the sequels, especially. The only reason I haven’t been yelling more about this is that I have to say: this wasn’t perfect. My main actual issues with this book come primarily from areas in which I felt editing could have been improved. There’s somewhat of an overuse of ellipses that should have been edited out; for the most part the setting descriptions are incredible but there are like two places where they’re sort of confusing; the running flashbacks to Severin’s parents are just honestly kind of overdramatic and don’t really add that much; the time jumps towards the end feel just a little fast and should’ve been maneuvered into better pacing. But none of these issues ever, on a personal level, took me particularly far out of the story. I am always in critic brain mode, but it didn’t hurt my enjoyment of the story at all. (Rereading this , I'm struck by the realization that I do not remember a single one of these complaints.) I also have a question about some of the s on this page: “Diversity is not a substitute for personality” is certainly a take, but why can’t we just… say we found the characters flat, or not compelling? I personally didn’t find these characters flat, but finding them flat is a perfectly reasonable view; different strokes for different folks. It’s just… why is it, exactly, that we’ve connected “the characters are diverse” with “the characters have no personality?”Because personally, the trend I’m seeing is that YA fantasy books have been dealing in flat characters for years (I love young adult literature as a genre but let us be very honest about a good 75% of the dystopian fiction trend), and it is only now that the YA market has like, anyone other than straight white people in it that ers are somehow connecting flat characters with diversity.I don’t know. I just think it’s funny. Anyway. The point is, I really really loved this book, and I think you will also like it if you enjoy a) heist fantasy with puzzles, b) rooting for an entire cast of characters, c) romances with historyTM and/or fantasy polyamoryTM, d) cities with dark underbellies, and e) discussing the historical weight that colonialism has left on us all. I can't wait for book two.

First things first: this is hands down the weirdest book I have ever read. You thought We Were Liars and The Accident Season were weird? Wink Poppy Midnight is far, far weirder, and it's more because of the ending than anything else. Most books at least give you the luxury of a sensical ending. This book does not.Wink Poppy Midnight follows two girls, Wink and Poppy, and one boy, Midnight. There's an odd sort of love triangle, not like any you're used to. And that's pretty much all I can say about the plot. Yep, this one relies on surprising you. First things first: I loved the subverting of tropes here. Tucholke subverts the typical Betty-and-Veronica dynamic of a love triangle, as well as playing around with the hero-and-villain dynamic. I appreciated that! I liked the writing style, too. At times it began to annoy me slightly, but I can't deny that it made this story incredibly atmospheric.Unfortunately, the plot felt a little messy. This happens all the time in magical realism novels; the author is trying to keep things ambiguous, and you end up with a book that's confusing instead. There were moments where I felt like the author succeeded in having something ambiguous yet interesting, and moments where the book wasn't ambiguous, just confusing.I've said it before and I'll say it again: it takes a very talented author to keep everything ambiguous but still develop characters well. April Genevieve Tucholke... kind of succeeded. Her characters are as developed as they can be considering the odd style, I guess. Their arcs had wasted potential. The ending underwhelmed me just a bit in terms of character work. I still don't know how I felt about this book, but I recommend giving it a try. It's worth reading if only to have your brain screwed with. Spoiler-Y Notes (skip these!!)• I honestly thought at one point the author would have the two girls get together. They literally make out twice in this book. • Everyone says they hated Poppy but I actually kinda liked her in the second half!!• Wink calls herself the hero towards the end, but she's also the liar.

We Set the Dark on Fire follows Dani, a girl being trained in the art of being a wife. In the inside of the wall, men each have two wives: Primeras run the house, while Segundas are the childbearers. On the outside, people live in poverty. Dani is an interloper, and when a resistance fighter threatens her with this information, she’s forced to use her primera status to spy. All the while, though, she is falling for her home’s segunda, her school enemy Carmen. The novel serves as a fascinating exploration of immigration politics: despite the desperation of those outside the walls to break through, those on the inside see them as beggars, beneath them in some cosmic framework. It’s hard not to draw parallels with America in this era. The novel doesn’t want you not to. The dynamics of classism, racism, sexism, and homophobia are all carefully examined, then carefully subverted. The scene where Mateo harasses Dani is specifically resonant. Men in power can always abuse that power. No matter the intent behind this society, no matter the goals, those in power may always abuse it. The arc between Dani and Carmen is the heart of this book, and it is WONDERFUL For the first 30% of the book or so, the tension between Dani and Carmen almost reads as subtext; there are moments where Dani’s relationship with La Vos member Sota feels as if in any other ya novel, it would be the main pairing. (Meanwhile, Dani is experiencing gay jealousy towards Carmen.) But this relationship build… floored me. The trope of falling for an ex-friend you had a falling out with is an excellent way to build character development, and here is no exception. The tension between them is so vivid and excellent. Dani has to learn to not be alone, to trust Carmen; Carmen has to learn to do the same. Through the ensuing story, they serve as excellent narrative foils to each other. I’ve seen some really excellent discussion of the pervasiveness of the trope of forced marriage, or forced heteronormativity within a society, in f/f romances. This trope is definitely notable and one worth considering when ing what f/f gets published. However, on a personal level, I think this book does a good job of expressing and unpacking homophobia, while also focusing on Dani and Carmen as a couple. Dani’s character growth also really worked for me. Dani is at times somewhat of a passive heroine, but she never feels like one: seeing her grow from her passivity, in fact, is at the heart of the story. Also, THE ENDING. When I say I was on the verge of wailing in real life… am I ashamed? Yes. Am I being honest? Also yes. How did you all wait a year? I checked out the sequel and started it twenty minutes after finishing this. I think this is the most upset I’ve been by a book ending all year. The only complaint I had about this novel was an occasional reliance on telling-not-showing, and some overly flowery writing. I… am really really sad to say that in the sequel which I started twenty minutes after finishing this, this seems to have worsened significantly, if only because there was less about the book that I actually liked. I was really disappointed by book two, personally. I have no idea if that’s a popular opinion but I’m putting it out there. But I still do adore this book, and would read it again. We Set the Dark on Fire is a great story and a fantastically compelling romance.

It tasted like rBreaths, as a rule, are warm, airy things, but his death rattle was frigid and thick, like icy porridge slithering down my throat. It tasted like raw meat and pennies. This is one of those s where I feel like I should clarify that three stars is a positive rating. The Hollow Girl tells the story of a Romani girl who decides to extract body parts from a gang of boys who were involved in her rape, sometimes when they are alive... and sometimes when they are not. And yeah, it is fucking creepy and awesome - buuuuuuut there are a few issues. Let's discuss. Faults come first. 🌺 THINGS THIS NOVEL FAILS AT→ the writing styleOkay, writing style here really bothered me. There is too much fucking telling and not nearly enough showing. It's not just the lack of showing, though; the author is far too concerned with pointing out how clever her writing is. There's a moment where Gran tells a long story that's clearly meant to parallel Bethan's life, which would be awesome, but then the narrative outright states “this parallels my life.” This is a recurring pattern; the author will use a literary device well, and then call it out specifically as if it was hard to catch, taking away the emotional impact and makes the book feel more amateurish than it actually is.→ the tone / pacing problemsGuys, this book is a tonal fucking mess. The first 100 pages are not remotely brutal and frankly, they don't have enough dramatic tension to lessen their sedentary nature - so a slight pacing issue but mostly tone. The pacing faults occur later on as the book actually gets brutal. There's blood and rape and a thousand different plot points occurring and yet... the plot didn't feel driven. Bethan needs to extract five body parts in three days and yet she spends so much time sitting at home that this conflict starts losing its tension and you start screaming ""GET ON WITH IT!!""→ the plot contrivancesIt is so hard to feel worried about how fast Bethan needs to get this killing done when Bethan has literally wasted three days waiting at home. Making timing a conflict here is completely empty and contrived, an easy way to manipulate the audience. And even worse, Bethan has an opportunity to kill Silas, the main perpetrator, earlier in the book. When the protagonist is trying to achieve something she decided not to achieve just a few chapters ago, the final conflict misses a lot of tension. → the lackluster endingFor me, personally, the ending was not nearly as much of a gut punch as I'd hoped. I had hoped for Bethan to have a big emotional moment to end the book with a bang, easily shooting this to a four star - after all, she was the best part of this whole book. Unfortunately, the ending was plot-heavy rather than character-heavy, paying less attention to Bethan's internal conflict than it does to flimsy plot conflicts. You guys know I'm a sucker for an emotionally cathartic and character-focused ending, and I think with more focus on Bethan's emotional issues, the ending could've been a tearjerker. But... no. 🌺 THINGS THIS NOVEL NAILS ON THE HEAD→ the portrayal of rapeI literally adore the narrative around rape culture here. Rape here is treated as a mortal sin, not because of the sexual element, but because of the violation it entails. The author treats this subject with care, and writes in an emotive way. Also, putting a trigger warning for rape in the author's note was fantastic. → the Romani repHillary Monahan infuses this story with good rep of Romani culture. I really appreciated the note at the front of the book to clarify her heritage. (It was just a really good note, okay?? I'll move on to the actual book soon.) It's clear that she knows what she's talking about with her representation. → the commitment to the premiseListen, not to sound like a terrible human being, but this book is really unapologetically dark and I love it. The genre of women murdering their abusers is a genre I happen to love, a lot, and I really liked that this book didn't try to whitewash the dark reality of what is happening in this book. It's very avenging-angel-y and I love it. → the lack of curing romanceThere's a fairly major romance here and while it didn't do that much for me, it's not a bad romance by any means. The Hollow Girl doesn't use the romance as a way to cure Bethan of her trauma, but also doesn't ignore the progression of a relationship after rape. Which... was kind of amazing, to be honest.→ and the best... the fucking badass leadListen, guys, I LOVE Bethan. She's a rich antihero who always manages to gain your sympathy, even while she's literally in the process of tearing out someone's eye. me, in the background, whispering: you're doing amazing sweetieShe brings a new name to morally ambiguous and I love it. And her character arc around trauma is a fucking masterpiece - her touch-averseness and need to close herself off are written beautifully. Do I recommend this? If you like suspense or horror, this book is a pretty damn solid read. While The Hollow Girl had its issues - for me, anyway - Bethan's character is a fucking achievement and basically made this book for me. It's clear that a lot of thought went into this novel and I'm excited to see what Monahan comes up with next.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,52,1,"Mar 08, 2017","Mar 10, 2017","Mar 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28936314-the-hollow-girl

This was absolutely one of the wildest I honestly feel like every time I read a Parker Peevyhouse book, my mind just gets thrown into a timewarp. This was absolutely one of the wildest rides of my life and it totally broke through my reading slump. I really do not think this is something I can quickly summarize for you, as every element of this book is a mystery from the beginning, and becomes revealed over time. There are two lead characters here, Bryn and Rett, and though Rett is the narrator, each is quite interesting. I found learning more and more about Bryn over time to be an especially entertaining experience; I was not sure whether to trust her or not, for a long time. The plot essentially repeats, but picking up on details bit by bit was an exceptionally interesting experience. My overwhelming feeling reading this book was fear: fear about what on earth was going to happen next. Between the eerie writing and the repetition of the plot, you get a slow, sinister feeling of something being deeply wrong. And it is that sense of wrongness that makes this book such an enticing experience.The Echo Room also does a fantastic job fitting in a point about our society - this entire sequence of events is essentially happening because a corporation has prioritized their profit over human lives, something that, in our current society, is worth worrying about. I find myself just slightly in fear not of if this occurs, but of when the reality of this book will show up. I actually added this book to my Goodreads WHILE I was meeting this author and getting my copy of her Very Weird and Fucking Awesome debut Where Futures End signed, so I guess we've come a bit full circle. release date: 13 Nov 2018✨Arc received from the publisher via Edelweiss for an honest .

The second half is 2 stars.The first half of this book is a claustrophobic, well-written, suspenseful tale of witches in the Middle Ages, with magical realism thrown in. The plotting is a bit slow, but there's a bite of tension in the air, just enough dramatic tension interwoven that it is impossible to look away. This sort of fantasy-suspense combination is honestly my favorite genre and if you're looking for that please look no further. I appreciated the portrayal of how religion can be co-opted into hate. This is a recurring theme throughout the book; how a combination of religion and self-righteousness lead to destruction. Alys was a believable, likable heroine in the first half. She's desperately afraid of becoming a monster, and her arc seems to glow with potential. Perhaps this was one of the things that had made her so different all along– that she saw the truth of things. That beauty could sometimes be ugly, and that you didn't always find good and evil where you expected to– or where you'd been told to find them.Unfortunately, quite a lot went downhill in the second half.This book tossed me straight into instalove hell. Cian isn't a bad romantic interest. As a couple, their relationship was perfectly fine and healthy. It would've been fine had Cian only shown up earlier in the book. And had he not overwhelmed the plot towards the end. This should be Alys' story, not Cian's. That's what the book has been since the beginning. I also didn't love how the romance was the only source of character development. Alys' character arc in the second half revolves around her romance. It's subtle, but it really irked me. When you mix these character worries with a slightly anti-climactic end, I ended up really disappointed. I don't not recommend this, but I'm honestly not sure I'd highly recommend it either.

He's the type of person who asks questions about the world, thinks through what ifs instead of passing them off. And instead of trying to find a neat answer, he writes complicated, well-plotted books about it. Shusterman really does explore what-ifs so well here. The interim chapters were probably my favorite part of this book. To be quite honest, I wished for more focus on morality conflicts. This book seemed to fall into villain vs. hero dynamics more than I wanted. Yes, the heroes are flawed and complicated, but the villains aren't.Scythe is quite fast-paced for its length; I actually read all of this except for the first 50 pages in one day, despite a massive reading slump. Shusterman gives up information too fast to have a lot of plot reveals. There's one character's motivation that I especially think would've worked better if the answer had not been divulged halfway through. [For you spoilery folk: I'm talking about the head scythe.] I have to say, though, that this book had probably the best ending to a book I've ever read. Full stop. I have to say, of the characters, Scythe Faraday and Scythe Curie were probably my favorites. These two are some of the most compelling characters I've ever come across. Citran and Rowan are both decent characters, although I admit I wanted a little more from them at points. Now, we need to talk about this romance plot. Because don't get me wrong, Rowan and Citra are both very compelling and I even ended up shipping them just because I was so invested in them separately. But their relationship building leaves a little to be desired. It's not instalovey, exactly– they clearly don't develop feelings instantly and state as much– but I didn't feel the development from friends to lovers much either. This could've been fixed if they'd had more scenes in the middle half of the book. Just a couple more tension-filled scenes could have made a difference. Here's a random concern from a rabid Shusterman fan: could we have one character who isn't straight in this series? Please, I just want one. One. It's not that hard.

This is a superhero novel for those who don’t get to be a part of superhero novels.I seriously loved the characters here. Danny is just amazing. She’s so angry that if written with less skill, she would come off whiny, but here her abrupt anger is consistent, and comes off as a genuine character trait rather than a plot convenience. April Daniels develops Danny’s motivations for becoming a superhero so well. I love that she’s not good just for the purpose of being good. Danny's dynamics with Doc Impossible and Calamity stand out as well. Calamity is fairly compelling all on her own. The relationship building between her and Danny is great. I’m rooting for them to get together officially in book two, and a scene towards the end of the book gave me some serious hope. Possibly my least favorite parts of the book are Dany’s conversations with villains. The villains of this book, Utopia and Graywytch, come off fairly comical. I get it; it's a superhero story and they're villains. But I wanted more. Utopia is actually given motivation, but her solution to the problem is still so unbelievable and she’s too obviously meant to be the villain, not a morally ambiguous character. It’s wasted potential. Graywytch… huh. I have fairly mixed opinions on her being in this book. She’s clearly meant to be a serious demon for Danny, but while her opinions on trans people are sadly realistic, she's just so freaking comical. I honestly kind of wish she was left out. We already have Danny’s father’s transphobia, but his character feels far more realistic and villainous. Graywytch just seems like a plot device. The plot in general hits on every trope of a typical superhero novel, but executes all of them very well. While the twists are fairly easy to guess, the character dynamics and Danny’s character make the story compelling anyway. April Daniels also has a talent for compelling action scenes; out of around five, there was only one that even somewhat confused me, and it was entirely my fault for being overtired. The worldbuilding could’ve been fleshed out a bit more, but it was seriously cool.

There were several very tropey things. But guys, the message around religion is so important.Okay, so cheesy romance, but a cheesy romance with some freaking awesome messages. This book perfectly gets across the feelings of claustrophobia of being judged and always being looked at. ”McAsher can PDA it all over campus, and, outside of a little eye rolling, no one cares. They’re both Mormon, by the way, and if I’m not mistaken, shouldn’t be engaging in this kind of behavior anywhere, let alone in the middle of school, but will they be ridiculed or shunned or threatened? No. No one is going to report them to their bishop. They can’t get kicked out of school. I’m willing to bet that McAsher has had sex, and yet Asher will still go on his mission and come home and marry a good Mormon girl – maybe even McKenna – and be as self-righteous about LDS values as any of the rest of them. Meanwhile, Sebastian can’t even look at me in class, probably because he’s beating himself up over our innocent touches on Saturday.”Sebastian’s character arc especially was one of my favorite parts of this book. Uh, personal shame based on religion is. A little too relatable. And made this book worth reading. and listen, I know this book had some instalove - I KNOW - but i think that works. It’s a story about teenagers being teenagers in a world that looks down on them for liking each other. I think there's something to be said for a book that manages to be so compelling despite the flaws. So though I found some aspects of this underwritten, on the whole, I really enjoyed this book. TW: internalized religious homophobia, biphobia.

She just keeps crying and crying. And I think a lot of ers might have thought of that as her being whiny but that was me. That was me so many times. Because it's not that one thing, it's everything, piles and piles, shrinking you into nothing but a vehicle for the anger of others.Each lie is something that's mine, that my mom and The Giant can't take away from me. Each lie reminds me I'm an actual person with rights and desires and the ability to make choices on my own. Each lie is power- control over my life.This book is incredibly triggering. I'm going to say that first, because it's both the worst and best part of the book. Bad Romance brought back Real Things for me. It was actually incredibly difficult to read some of the scenes because I knew those feelings. It was just... it was a lot, and I don't want to downplay that. But the way this book treats abuse literally means so much to me, and I cannot even explain how deeply I relate to Grace.Bad Romance is so incredibly real and realistic. I almost wish it hadn't been so realistic, but god, you guys, reading this book was such an emotionally cathartic experience. I cried, like, eight times. But not because it was sad. And I think it will be if you've ever been through abuse, parental or spousal or otherwise. This is a story about getting out.I guess I'm going to talk now about why this book is one of my favorite representations of abuse of all time.It's not bad one hundred percent of the time, but if anything good happens, there are always strings attached.➽I loved that positive girl friendship is what pulls Grace out of her tailspin. Nat and Lys were seriously the greatest characters, both hilarious and kind and funny but also complicated. The support group they formed was so good. ➽Adding on to that, I'm happy the book wasn't about a romance pulling her out and Curing Love. There is a sort-of-positive-future-romance which was sweet, but it was more playing into Grace's character development than anything else. Which is exactly how I think romance should be used in books like these.➽Okay, I absolutely adored that emotional abuse was given the same weight as physical abuse. Because abuse is not not about the actual physical acts - it's about the fear, the feeling of pain and worry and like only one person in the world loves you but do they? do they really? can anyone? Gavin is physically aggressive, but does not hit Grace - and the relationship is still qualified as abusive. ➽I loved the way Grace's treatment by her parents played into her later relationship. And, um, I loved the portrayal of her mother as both a sympathetic figure and an abusive mother. I loved how nuanced her character was without being forgiven by her daughter. Usually, books either want to make the abuser full-on terrible or full-on redeemable and I hate that trend. Grace's mother isn't a mindless creep. And yet she is still not redeemable or forgivable to Grace - I honestly don't think Grace will ever see her as either - and that is okay. More nuance without forgiving abuse because they had your best interests at hearts, please. ➽Grace's inner monologue. Okay. So this is the thing about this book that I genuinely think is unbeatable. Demetrios' author note is very clear that she experienced something like this, and y'all, it totally shows. It was me and she wasn't the villain and she wasn't the whiny girl who would get put in her place by her well-intentioned parents at the end. ➽I think that more recently, I've been feeling this lack of internal criticism of relationships. You become so grateful to just be tolerated that you'll put up with anything, because hurting is ungrateful, and you blame everyone a little bit, but deep down you sympathize with everyone but yourself. I don't know how to end this. There's nothing I can say to sum up how meaningful a read this book was for me. I think my reaction to this one was a deeply personal one - not everyone is going to love this as deeply as I did, and I think some might even find it too personal. It might end on one of the most hopeful and cathartic notes of any book ever, but it hits really close to home. But, yeah, for me personally, this one was fucking soul destroying in a good way.

Francesca Zappia: you're doing amazing, sweetie.♔ THEMES AND MENTAL ILLNESSWhat good is a career that makes you money if you hate yourself every day you do it?This book is about how teenagers get dismissed. Let me explain. Teens are vehicles for drama rather than being real people. Our feelings aren't feelings - they're drama, or teen angst. But what's the real difference when both of us are people, humans with emotions and feelings and moods and lives? It's rare to see the feelings of teenagers validated to this degree, explicitly treated as relevant by the narrative. If I have my phone out talking to you or my online friends, they think I'm ignoring them, or being disrespectful, or whatever. And it's like, no, I'm in the middle of a conversation. If you saw people talking to each other face to face, you wouldn't interrupt them and call it disrespectful, would you? The other thing I really loved thematically was the emphasis on online life as being a positive thing for some teens. See, here's the thing - having a community online has had a positive impact on my life. I mean, before I started using the internet in maybe 2014, I was pretty much the most antisocial kid ever. I had approximately three friends and two feelings. And then came the discourse, the banter, the memes, and the friends. And I got life experiences. All jokes aside, my real life is much more engaging, humorous, and brave because of experiences I've had on the internet. And I've yet to see that acknowledged in any YA books I've read thus far. I think this is a book I would recommend to parents as much as teenagers, just for how immersed I was in Eliza's experiences. “Worth as a person is not based on any tangible evidence. There's no test for it, no scale.”This is just... so important.♔ WHY THIS IS A FANTASTIC CONTEMPORARYAside from mental health handling, this is really just a fantastic book. First of all, there's the mixed media. I loved the little posts spread throughout the book of Eliza's comic - I'm super interested in seeing the full thing now. If you liked those too, you can find a full written version of the webcomic here! I also thought the text-speak was way more realistic than usual. What's most important in a good contemporary for me is having interesting, well-developed characters. And here, I can definitely say that the character work is fabulous. Eliza's perspective as a girl with anxiety was superbly realistic and enjoyable. She's fantastically developed and her character arc felt especially real to me.And I loved the romance!! The love interest, Wallace, is super cute, and I loved their relationship development. It felt authentic and honest and romantic all at the same time. It's hard to write a romance so honestly, but this is just one of the better YA contemporary romances I've ever read. VERDICT: One of the best contemporaries I've read this year, with fantastic themes and characters. Oh god, I just want everyone to read it? please. read this.

All the characters are the best, basically. ★☆☆☆☆: 0★★☆☆☆: 1★★★☆☆: 2★★★★☆: 5★★★★★: 4My average rating for this anthology was a surprisingly high... 4.0. Did you expect that? Because I totally did not. Halfway through this anthology, I was prepared to give it a big old three, and then I hit three five stars in a row and this happens. Okay, so here’s my really big gripe with this anthology. It is marketed as being about radical girls, which at least some of the anthology editors have implied means more marginalized girls, and that is really untrue. There has still been no Native American MC in twenty-five stories that are about American history, which is honestly pretty disappointing. It also feels at times a little lacking in intersectionality—a bunch of the stories have MCs of Exactly One Marginalization and it feels vaguely weird. And in this whole book, none of the stories are sapphic; only four even have queer characters, two of whom are side characters and two of whom have it mentioned once. Not to be this person, but I’m gonna say it: this could have been gayer. But I also love the focus on girl power, the diverse characters [there’s a lot of diversity in representation for girls of color], and a bunch of these stories were just really good. Let’s get started! → Daughter of the Book by Dahlia Adler ←★★★☆☆✔ 1838 Savannah, GA | Jewish MCCan’t decide on a three or a four, but I think this one was overall quite solid. It’s a story of being a Jewish woman in an era where society rejects both, and wanting to fit into your strongest faith. I guess I just felt it was a bit tell-not-show and didn’t do much until the ending? → You're a Stranger Here by Mackenzi Lee ←★★★★☆✔ 1844 Nouvoo, Illinois | Mormon MCTaking place just after Mormon prophet Joseph Smith is killed, this one focuses on the idea of persecution of faith and the different outlets we find, be they positive or negative. I just really liked how faith was talked about in this story. A very strong four.→ The Magician by Erin Bowman ←★★★★☆✔ 1858 Colorado River, NM | nonbinary MCA story of a trip up the river into Utah and Mormon territory [the placement directly after Mackenzi’s story fits perfectly.] Dressed as a boy, Ray is on a mission. I thought the ending of this one was lovely, going in a direction I did not expect and also making it pretty clear that Ray actually would ID as nonbinary today. → Lady Firebrand by Megan Shepherd ←★★★★☆✔ 1863 Charleston, SC | disabled MC and black girl sideA solid story about a pro-union spy team of girls, one in a wheelchair and one her black maid. I support them and would die for them. → Step Right Up by Jessica Spotswood ←★★★☆☆✔ 1905 Tulsa, Indian Territory | sapphic abuse survivor MCThis one was a lot of fun, but again, not amazing. It’s a very self-contained character piece without really having anything special, and I admit I didn’t really love the main character? I don’t tend to be attracted to wild child leads, I guess. But certainly not bad.→ Glamour by Anna-Marie McLemore ←★★★★★✔ 1923 Central Valley, CA | brown Mexican MC, disabled trans boy LII think McLemore just has very consistent quality writing and characters and very consistently plays with themes I LOVE. Here, it’s about the masks we put on to hide things we may not be ashamed of, but others will be, and how that affects us. The best one in the first half of the collection, honestly. → Better For All The World by Marieke Nijkamp ←★★★★★✔ 1927 Washington, DC | autistic MCTHERE WAS A STORY THAT WAS EXPLICITLY ANTI EUGENICS. Okay, so I got really passionate about this historical era this year because I did a paper on post-World-War-II eugenics. So this story and its discussion of the way society treated “different” people was so amazing. The main character, Carrie, is very clearly autistic and written so well and I basically adore her [an icon!!!!!] I hope she gets the lawyer job she deserves. Spoilery note: I kind of wished in the first half that the love interest had figured out that he was wrong, if only so the lead could get a happy relationship? But the way the story actually went was better on another level by validating the lead’s need for someone who actually treated her well, so I guess that wish was pretty irrational. → When the Moonlight Isn't Enough by Dhonielle Clayton ←★★★★★✔ 1943 Oak Bluffs, MA | black MCUh, wow, three fives in a row just as I was readying to write this collection off as good-but-not-standout? Lead character Emma has been alive for 200 years and is just now deciding whether to break free. This story is primarily focused on the continuity between earlier black history and later black history. The other main concept explored here is the question of how black people can be patriotic in a culture that has offered them so little, and how they can find their own communities. It’s just an excellent story with very sound writing.  → The Belle of the Ball by Sarvenaz Tash ←★★★★☆✔ 1952 Brooklyn, NY | Latino LIRosemary wants to write comedy, her friend Sandra wants to be the next Lucille Ball, and there’s a cute boy, Tomás, on her street. This was really sweet and felt very ‘50s — love the side friendship and the ending is perfect. → Land of the Sweet, Home of the Brave by Stacey Lee ←★★★★★✔ 1955 Oakland, CA | multiracial Chinese, Japanese, and Hawaiian MCA story about Lana Lau dragging everyone to hell and back. Every line of this was the most savage thing I’d ever read and I love it. Also love the mentions of American imperialism in Hawaii and the taking-back of that narrative. And I know I've said it, but I truly love the lead. → The Birth of Susi Go-Go by Meg Medina ←★★☆☆☆✔ 1972 Queens, NY | Cuban MCThis was… really disappointing? I don’t know. It’s really long and doesn’t really have an ending. I liked the bits about being an immigrant from Cuba, but they felt crammed into something quite long and rambly for a short story. And the lead had a very lacking voice. → Take Me with U by Sara Farizan ←★★★★☆✔ 1984 Boston, MA | Iranian MC, sapphic Japanese side charOoooh, this was amazing. A story of an Iranian immigrant in a girl band, and a story deeply entrenched in ‘80s vibes. As Sara Farizan says in her final note, the ‘80s was the decade that began to give us today — the cell phone, the computer, many of today’s global conflicts, the end of the Cold War, and above all, a feeling of change. The perfect ending for this collection and very very close to a five. all in all: despite an underwhelming first half, this got really excellent and was a worthwhile read. I would definitely recommend Land of the Sweet, Home of the Brave by Stacey Lee, When the Moonlight Isn't Enough by Dhonielle Clayton, Glamour by Anna-Marie McLemore, and my absolute favorite, Better For All The World by Marieke Nijkamp.

Alison Cherry manages to incorporate BOTH major bi stereotypes here, because apparently one just wasn't enough. The love interest is sleeping with a girl and a guy at the same time and the protagonist is ""just experimenting"". “Bi girls sleep around” is a terrible trope that's already showed up in enough media. “Bi girls are just experimenting” is even worse. But nooooooooo!! Isn't it important to see girls realizing they were Truly Straight All Along??. First of all, no. Bi people already get the message from society that they need to pick a side (in the case of bi girls, usually the straight side). There is no reason to publish a book about it if you're not even going to TRY to deconstruct stereotypes. Second of all, this author wanted to tell a story about finding yourself, maybe the marketing team should've done their fucking job! Publishing a book with this blurb and this cover and this title and ending with a protagonist realizing she's straight is queerbaiting. Isn't that creative? Isn't that original? Can you tell how bitter I am? Mainly though, I'm seriously confused as to why the author decided to write this and market it in this way. Who on earth does this? What was the intention behind this book? Look Both Ways promises a story with girls kissing and good bi rep and then precedes to spend 300 pages giving the message that bisexuality is either disgusting or fake. Beyond the obvious biphobia, that's an idiotic marketing decision. Are you TRYING to make your main audience demographic hate you and your book?

Yes, there is a romantic element, but it's definitely not the whole book. The main characters have a very slow buildup to romance, and it never overtook the book. I'm not much of a romance fan myself, but this book was so much more than that. Give it a try even if you're worried. This book is inevitably going to be compared to every sci-fi book published in the past five years. So here, I did it for you! If you liked any of these books, Defy the Stars is probably a good pick for your next sci-fi. — It's a little like Empress of a Thousand Skies in the interesting thematics, multiple planetary sites, and fast-paced plot, although I think this one is a little more high-quality with less debut-novel issues.  — It's also a little like Illuminae because of the super-fast plot, romance from both points of view, and readability, but it lacks the weird formatting and has more character work. — No, it's really not like the Lunar Chronicles. It's got way less of a “happy ever after” feel. There's a hint that a great squad dynamic might pop up in book two, but... this book is really just a bit too dark to get compared to TLC.  — It's ALSO a little like The Abyss Surrounds Us for the fast-paced plot, badass mc, banter / humor, and good romance. Except without the wlw, sadly. Btw, if you haven't heard of this one, you should definitely check it out.  — I think the closest comparison is probably All Our Yesterdays by Cristin Terril for the fast-paced plot, good characters (although this one has more specific development), and romantic element (although there's no love triangle!)PACING, PLOTTING, WORLDBUILDINGThe plot here is super fast-paced and addictive. Defy the Stars is definitely a book that requires bingeing. Ignore the time it took me to read this; I rushed through it. If not for my buddyread pacing and the fact that I forgot it at my mother's house for a week, I would've finished this in two days at most. I totally loved the worldbuilding. This book is filled with moral conflicts and nuanced discussions of violence and rebellion. Moral issues are completely my thing, y'all. If you like moral issues at all, you should DEFINITELY pick this up. THE CHARACTERSNoemi is a total badass with a slow journey from prejudice to trust. She's a bit outwardly unemotional (way to break archetypes!!) and stays steadfast to her ideals. Her character development here was executed SO well. Her opinion on Abel doesn't change because of love; it changes because of her realization that he has a soul. I also loved that she was religious but the book didn't push religion. Do you know how rare it is for books to take a neutral stance on religion? I was so impressed with this. I loved Abel. “Robot who slowly develops emotion” is apparently a character archetype I am interested in. His character development is slow and feels incredibly realistic. I loved him from the beginning. Better to be hated by Noemi than to be irrelevant to her. That reaction seems irrational—emotional—and yet Abel knows it to be true. Or maybe he's malfunctioning more badly than he realized.My one complaint could be the book's emphasis on love as a vehicle for humanity. Here's the good news: his character development is not about him falling in love. Here's the bad news: his falling in love is portrayed as “him becoming more human“ and I... could've done without that, I guess. You're not required to fall in love to have a soul. I would've preferred if that notion had not even been implied. Next we're going to talk about the romance, and here's the section where I always lose people. But for once I'm not losing followers, because I loved the romance. It's a slow-burn enemies-to-friends-to-dating relationship. I loved that Claudia Gray doesn't rush this relationship! She takes a while to build it all up, and nothing remotely romantic even happens until page 400/500. We all know that I really love couples with great dialogue and banter going on. Abel and Noemi have some of the best. “What's the first thing I said to you?”Abel cocks his head, and finally he looks like himself again. “I remember it perfectly, but you almost certainly don't. Therefore, reciting the words cannot serve as a viable test.”The side characters made an impression on me as well. Mansfield is an effortlessly compelling villain; the conflict between him and Abel's personal agency was written perfectly. I loved the dynamic between Riko and Ephraim. They're two idealists, part of the same sect, trying to find a way to solve Earth's problems. And Virginia is SO AWESOME. She's fucking hilarious even at dark moments. And I'm so glad Harriet and Zayan came back, too. Honestly, I just love every side character. I want them to become a badass squad.A FEW DISLIKESSo this book wasn't totally faultless. While the plot was fast-paced and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole book, there were a few plot conveniences that left me annoyed. For example, at one point Abel and Noemi happen to form the same plan for different reasons and manage to meet up on accident. That's overly convenient, and we all know it. But on the other hand, I'm beginning to think this is just a fault of space-opera lit in general. I'm not sure I've ever read a sci-fi book where there wasn't a convenient moment. All in all, if you typically enjoy space opera, this shouldn't bother you. VERDICT: I definitely have to recommend this to anyone who enjoys scifi. Put this on your tbr even if you're not usually a fan of romance. Trust me, it's not just a romance. Spoiler-Filled Notes — That moment where Virginia flipped off Mansfield was GOLD— and the moment where she was like “stop hugging we have a war to fight”— I just really fucking love her— I love the main couple here so much I actually love them— the moment with Mansfield? byePre-ReadMy second buddy read with the person who keeps deleting Sana and my first buddy read with the person who keeps spilling tea and Maggie, the non-dramatic one!

Historical fiction feminist anthology sounds amazing, and it's certainly not bad, but as a whole this was sort of disappointing. Funny story: my cousin owned a copy of this ages ago and at the time I was desperate to know all the dates, which I'm still desperate to do. I think we had some kind of Google doc? Don't ask me why that happened. Anyway, this story collection was pretty awesome. → Mother Carey's Journey by J. Anderson - ★★☆☆☆ ←In the 1710 Caribbean, during the golden age of pirating, Joe disguises herself as a boy to keep her and her father safe. This story took a weird turn around halfway through, which I'd normally love, but it somehow didn't work here. It would've been better if Anderson had built up more suspense previous to the twist, and if the story had been far, far longer. The twist just seems weird, not interesting, in this short a story. → The Journey by Marie Lu - ★★★★☆ ←In 1723 Alaska, Yakone flees her village after it is attacked. Marie Lu's writing style shines here, and her heroine is strong and likable. The Alaskan wilderness almost could've been described more; that being said, I had a perfect mental picture of everything in my head. Anyone who loves dogsledding and survival stories will enjoy this. → Madeline's Choice by Jessica Spotswood - ★★☆☆☆ ←A girl in 1826 New Orleans is caught between two boys. I liked the culture of New Orleans incorporated, but that was about it. It's not bad, just not great. → Los Destinos by Leslye Walton - ★★★☆☆ ←In 1848 Southwest Texas, the three fates live out one incarnation. I liked the concept and writing of this, but it's overly romantic and far too short. → High Stakes by Andrea Cremer - ★★★★☆ ←A murderess in 1861 Boston. This one is more fantasy than historical fiction, but man, is it fun. It's so well-plotted and the heroine, Klio, is cool. There's a death in here which seemed to me like burying a character for the sake of plot, which I didn't love? But everything else was perfect.→ The Red Raven Ball by Caroline Tung Richmond - ★★★★☆ ←In 1862 D.C., Lizzie attempts to catch a confederate spy. This story has an enticing plot, it's true, but mostly I just loved Lizzie's character. She's strong with good conflict. This story is paced perfectly and incorporates great historical context; I had a great picture in my head. → Pearls by Beth Revis - ★★★★★ ←Helen Davies flees her rapist fiancé in 1876 Chicago for a small schoolhouse near Cheyenne. This story is BADASS and the heroine is awesome. The ending was just flat-out perfect. → Gold in the Roots of the Grass by Marissa Meyer - ★★★★★ ←In the Dakota Territory of 1877, Sun Fei-Yen helps out a boy named James. It's one of the cutest, best things I've ever read. That ending was so great!! I love happy takes on depressing plotlines. → The Legendary Garrett Girls by Y.S. Lee - ★★★★☆ ←In 1898 Skagway, Alaska, Lily and Clara Garrett run their mother's bar– until they're confronted by legendary bandit Soapy Smith. This story is badass as hell and I liked that. I just felt the ending was a bit confusing - what does that even mean. → The Color of the Sky by Elizabeth Wein - ★★☆☆☆ ←Tony, a young black girl, sees Bessie Coleman's death in 1926 Jackson, Florida. And it's honestly completely boring. I just didn't connect with anything here, and I get the feeling the author didn't either. → Bonnie and Clyde by Saundra Mitchell - ★★★☆☆ ←In 1934 Indiana, a girl dresses as a boy to rob banks undercover. This one is a fun ride, but nothing all that special. → Hard Times by Katherine Longshore - ★★★☆☆ ←Rosie rides the rails from a 1934 hobo jungle to Washington State. This was sweet and I liked the characters and story arc, but it was far too rushed. → City of Angels by Lindsay Smith - ★★★☆☆ ←While working at a factory in 1945, a riveter discovers her sexuality. This was sweet at parts, but it's mostly a love story, and the love story ends unhappily as usual. I would've loved to see a happier ending for Frankie and Evie. → Pulse of the Panthers by Kekla Magoon - ★★☆☆☆ ←In 1967 California, a girl meets members of the black panther party. And that's essentially all that happened, which was incredibly disappointing. I liked the multifaceted portrayal of the Panthers, but there's just nothing else of note here. → The Whole World Is Watching by Robin Talley - ★★★★☆ ←At the Michigan Avenue protests in 1968 Chicago, a girl decides whether or not to come out with her sexuality. This one is both sweet and powerful.[image]VERDICT: In general, this is a pretty good story collection; I just didn't feel it went quite far enough.

They're not particularly well-written and the entire plot concept is kind of absurd. But this one somehow managed to get me to literally actually cry. I'm STILL kind of shocked that this made me cry. The character work here has stepped up its game. Every side character feels so real and developed, even with very little pagetime. These characters are great. Many of them are pretty morally black, and yet they're all so interesting and have solid motivations and I feel really bad for all of them. Okay, let's talk about the relationship building. Again, I love how they're both such bad people but they still care about each other. (view spoiler)[I kind of started crying around “thank you, you were amazing.” And the scene where they were reunited was the most painful thing I've read this entire year.

An Ember in the Ashes is not all bad: this book does have decent plotting, and it's certainly engaging enough that I understand the hype. But oh wow, there is so much here that just turned me off completely. I think we've addressed this probably but we need to talk about it: Rape and constant misogyny is used as a plot device quite a bit. The misogyny is honestly not critiqued very much, either. I kept hoping for the misogyny to lead to some kind of social commentary. It never did. In fact, I finally DNFed specifically because of the misogyny. “Helene is a girl, so her brain works differently and she's more romantic than you”– really?? Seriously. For me, characters are what make a book. Without solid characterization, there's nothing for me to enjoy. And unfortunately, the characters here aren't even close to my standards for decent characters. Not only are the characters flat vehicles for the terrible love square ( / diamond / crisscross thingy), they are also actively annoying. —+ Laia... is disappointing. Here's the thing: I should love Laia. She's got badass heroine potential I'd love to see explored and there were moments in which I thought she was about to grow on me. But she is so naive, and I just cannot live in the heads of characters with this little cynicism. Maybe some readers will be able to handle this, but I can't stand the fact that she lives in such a brutal world and still manages to completely lack common sense. I am Laia's age (I was at the time of ing this initially) and I don't live in a brutal world where rape is around every corner, so how, exactly, is she more naive than I am? This just feels like bad writing. —+ Sort of the same thing with Elias - he has potential. But just like Laia, he is written as incredibly naive when convenient to the plot, and not-naive when inconvenient. And again, his naivety is so inauthentic. Refusing to state his loyalty to the empire at a dinner table despite the fact that he could be killed for acting traitorous is admirable, sure, but it's also... not smart. He also treats Helene like crap, constantly, despite them being best friends since they were six. At one point, Helene risks her life to save someone she considers a romantic rival, someone who she barely knows, and someone who the bigotry of her society would indicate she should despise. He responds to this by pushing her away and treating her terribly, assuming that she's done nothing to help Laia live. And like... I just. I think the book leans too far into miscommunication between the two, which is strange: he has very real reasons to be suspicious of her, and I think the narrative doesn't lean into the character conflict enough and leans too far into the romance conflict. —+ On the topic of Helene deserving better. She's super flawed, but she's actually got very interesting characterization, despite not being a POV character (I know she's a POV character in book two and develops). Helene and Elias' friendship / possible relationship is written surprisingly well - as I believe Sabaa Tahir intended, I felt sad for both of their roles in this, though I primarily wanted them to be friends. Unfortunately, it's on the losing side of a love triangle and as mentioned before, Elias is a dick. I have, in the past couple years, begun to suspect that the only reason I liked this character was because I did not get her point of view. All of these characters are, in bare outline, very likable and compelling. It's the presumed naivety of the writing that lets them down.—+ The love square is a Mess. As stated, Helene and Elias are the only two characters with any good reason to care about each other whatsoever. Keenan is essentially an obstacle for Elias and Laia's true wuv. Elias and Laia... have a serious case of instalove. Or maybe just instalust; their relationship seems entirely built on sexual attraction. Their dynamic also - and I completely do not think this is the intent - has a touch of a master/slave relationship dynamic that I find very offputting; Elias is literally the child of Laia's slaveowner. And he starts the book not agreeing with this, it's starcrossed lovers, I get that. But there's just... there's a scene in this book where the male romantic lead pretends that he's been raping the female romantic lead to avoid them being caught. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. I will, however, state on main that I think the new covers of this series are so much better than these originals. The book two cover? Laia's pose in that is a classic. That cover change was a good decision do not @ meThis had and has a lot of potential, but this book ended up being a rather large disappointment for me.

I read Midwinterblood in one sitting, I still can't think of a single thing I didn't like, and it kind of changed my life. This deserves a full five and a place on my favorites list. Marcus Sedgwick is such an odd writer. His books don't quite have a genre. Are they sci-fi? Are they magical realism? Are they suspense? Maybe. Partially. But those genre labels don't come close to describing his books. The only other book I can even compare to the two of his books that I've read might be Where Futures End by Parker Peevyhouse, another one that I loved. I feel like I need to establish a new genre for his works alone. I can't recommend this to you by genre; I can only say “read this if you like books where you won't fully get it until the end and you don't see anything coming”.One thing is certain— Sedgwick has a talent for dramatic tension This book was just so twisty and fascinating that I couldn't put it down. And not only could I not put it down, I felt so engaged constantly. I even had visceral reactions to all the twists. For example, there's a bit right at the end of part four that kind of changed me as a person?? Just... the symbolism. I legitimately had to take a few deep breaths because I felt so fucked up. It was really unsettling. There's a line at the end of section six that also fucked me up. I don't know why I didn't see it coming, but I didn't at all and I almost choked when I read it. This book made me pretty emotional too. The end of part five actually made me cry a little. I just... I didn't see it coming, but it changed me. I am shooketh. I don't even particularly know why - the characters are fine, but nothing very special. It was the humanity and eerie nature of this story that I loved so much. And again, I can't spoil what made me emotional. I can't spoil what made me happy and unhappy. I was just so, so engaged in all of this. All I can say is please put this on your tbr. Please.

Of these fifteen stories, not a single one got lower than three, and only two got that rating; nine received a four. This means I found four new favorite stories, not as many, as I’d hoped for a collection with so many authors I love. But with all these ratings, I still had a really high average rating of 4.13 stars.This collection is full of stories of women taking back agency, of queer people taking back agency, of finding love in fate or in taking back your world from fate. I absolutely adored it. The other thing is that repeatedly reading these anthologies is making me notice the degree to which… some of these ya authors write transcendently good short fiction? The authors of my faves in here — Tehlor Kay Mejia, Tess Sharpe, and Anna-Marie McLemore — have all been authors to consistently wow me with their short fiction. The only exception was Elizabeth May, a new to me author who I’ll certainly be following from now on (her debut, Seven Devils, is coming out in 2020!). And I’m sad that YA short fiction isn’t an area with critical awards because god, some of these people really deserve to be nominated. Someone paints a picture of you. It’s not a photo. Your hair is more blue than black, your eyes more gold, but does that mean it can’t tell you anything about yourself?Starsong by Tehlor Kay Mejia ★★★★★Luna Mendoza ponders magic and decides to strike outside of her comfort zone. Mejia’s writing style is honestly magical, first of all, but what struck me the most about this story was Luna’s arc: she develops subtly, but we as the audience are able to invest in it quickly. I honestly just loved this as I have all of Mejia’s short fiction thus far, and WOW I really need to read her book. Afterbirth by Andrea Cremer ★★★★☆A birth doctor is put on trial after a strange birth. I like that this story combines the idea of actual witchery with the idea of women doing simple science; in this story, “witchcraft” is something done for good and healing, and the strange happenings that lead to the trial are simply scientific issues. I loved the ending of this. A person can tell you anything, but bones – those tell the truth.The Heart in Her Hands by Tess Sharpe ★★★★★This is a story about a girl who receives a soulmate and does not want one. I really thought I knew where this was going and I was really really incorrect. I like. started choking crying at the ending of this, which is, by the way, one of the most satisfying and subversive short story endings I’ve ever read. Tess Sharpe could write short fiction for the rest of her life and I’d read all of it just for her. Death in the Sawtooths by Lindsay Smith ★★★★☆A story about a server of death as she grapples with her own dark impulses and attempts to save the world on a small level. I agree with others that this could’ve made very good f/f; however, I was definitely satisfied in a different way by the friendship development! Nice solid arc and good writing. The Truth About Queenie by Brandy Colbert ★★★☆☆A story about a witch who has been in love with the same boy for years, after he brings home his new girlfriend. I like Brandy Colbert’s writing a lot. However, she tends to interact with a romantic tropes in a way that is somewhat subversive on paper and that I still don’t particularly gel with. They’re often switched out at the last second for character development, but in a way I think this makes her stories occasionally feel… tonally dissonant more than subversive, for me. However, I absolutely loved the themes of shame here, and I think others will gel with this a lot more. The Moonapple Menagerie by Shveta Thakrar ★★★★☆A very meta story about a coven of witches and the lead’s struggle to find her play’s end. Sweet and interesting and discusses ideas of storytelling in a simple but compelling way. The Legend of Stone Mary by Robin Talley ★★★★☆A story about a girl in the 70s whose family is rumored to be cursed, maybe. I really loved this; it came close to a five for me. Plays with ideas of historical queerness with a deft hand.The One Who Stayed by Nova Ren Suma ★★★★☆Follows a group of witches who are all rape victims in various ways. I loved the writing of this a lot. Found the story as a whole somewhat… not memorable in actual content?Divine Are the Stars by Zoraida Córdova ★★★★☆Follows Marimar, a girl who goes back to her old family estate to claim their legacy, and her grandmother. I loved the writing of this a lot; again, found the story as a whole not incredibly memorable. Still definitely worth my time. Daughters of Baba Yaga by Brenna Yovanoff ★★★☆☆Plays with a group of witches of Russian descent. Really loved the concept and the writing. Brenna Yovanoff is a true talent (Places No One Knows is one of my favorite books). It’s just that this honestly feels like the first chapter to a very good book rather than an entire story with a standalone plot; it just doesn’t feel like a full arc yet. Still, enjoyed my time reading this. Adored the ending lines. The Well Witch by Kate Hart ★★★★☆This almost made a five for me. Following a witch who can sense water and the three men who invade her cottage, it You cannot survive together, Mam had said. But it’s not so easy surviving apart, either.Beware of Girls with Crooked Mouths by Jessica Spotswood ★★★★☆This follows a group of sisters who are cursed to have one go mad and kill the others. I instantly believed in these sisters and loved how their bond was prioritized by the narrative; even romantic interests are given general good intent, but the sisters still choose each other. Grapples with faith and consequence in a way I found so deeply resonant. I really loved this one. The idea that he cared what a Bruja thought of him was like the brush of his fingers against my lips. It was the whisper of the pear tree’s leaves the first season it flowered and greened.Love Spell by Anna-Marie McLemore ★★★★★Am I ever going to give anything by this author less than five stars? Statistics say no. I absolutely loved the writing and the humanistic nature of this story. The story’s idea of witches as the Other and the Other as marginalized people is one I find particularly prescient and compelling. No one except for Anna-Marie McLemore truly understands how to write tender literature. The Gherin Girls by Emery Lord ★★★★☆A very good story about a trio of sisters, Rosie, Nova, and Willa, exploring themes of abuse. I really really loved this one; I simply felt it went a little longer than it needed to and could’ve been edited down in places. I understand now that magic is not for wickedness, not for the devil, not for those with cruel nights. It’s for hope.Why They Watch Us Burn by Elizabeth May ★★★★★Has gotten hyped as one of the highlights of this collection and I completely agree. This story, following a group of convicted witches, is an absolute poetic masterpiece, and the perfect conclusion to this collection. Anyway, I absolutely loved this collection, and I’m very very glad I gave it a try.

Something I loved about this book was the extensive and interesting cast of side characters. →Brooke, a good friend and ally. →Will, Harley’s childhood friend and perhaps something more→Cooper, member of Harley’s group→Mo, protector of the Rubies→Bennet, a more ambiguous member of the Springfields→Molly, a girl Harley saved. →Jessa, member of the Rubies. →Frankie, a local non-corrupt cop with an interesting arc of her ownMy favorite thing about this book, however, was the duplicitousness. Honestly, I really just love scheme books. The setup, the waiting for the payoff to come, and then finally the seeing it come… we love to see it and we definitely love to read it. Seeing Harley’s plot come together keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know both whether her con will work out and how exactly it will work, and seeing things work and not work is so satisfying. I loved seeing the pieces come together and watching her grow and change through it.Barbed Wire Heart is a very excellent book about schemes, moral greyness, and the ways in which an entire town can struggle - in different ways - and I’m very very glad I read it.

So this is... how can I put it... an emotional suspense novel that is not very emotional or suspenseful. Or tense. And sort of boring. And there was a love triangle between two guys who were into the lead's dead sister. It was a mess. Let's talk. I think the lack of suspense is partially the writing style - which is somewhat dull and turns otherwise creepy scenes dull and boring - but also just the complete lack of interesting horror. The book mentions dead horse bones and snake skins and whispering names but that... isn't really creepy, on its own. At least not to me. A not-very-creepy book can always be remedied with good characters, but none of the characters here are morally ambiguous - okay, yeah, that's just me - or intriguing. Not to be harsh, but honestly, not a single character in this book is compelling. Most don't even have personalities. I'm not sure I can name a single one of Mae's solid traits. And then there is - yeah, I know - the love triangle. And it is a bad one. Dead sister's ex-boyfriend who probably murdered her vs. a guy who had a crush on her sister. Just to make this clear: both of the guys were into the protagonist's dead sister. Fucking Cage is attracted to Mae because she looks like her dead sister. Listen, I think this is maybe supposed to be some deep message about loss, but in reality, it's fucking creepy. Why did no editor read that and cross it off with the annotation ""what the fuck""?Besides all the structural issues, there are some general tonal issues; for example, those changing tenses changing tenses are probably supposed to be a literary device, but it honestly just feels sloppy. The author uses present tense for flashbacks and past tense for what's happening right now, and it sounds like a cool idea, but on page, it comes off dissonant and annoying. Dissonant tone and a book that just doesn't seem to fit together is the result. There was also a major issue I had with Magical Creepy Voodoo characters that I read as really badly stereotyped slaves in the 1860s and a full year later, I am exceptionally confused as to what the canon of the book actually is. Perhaps I misread the book, and I've been informed that things may have changed from the arc version? Nonetheless, however, the book:✔ takes place on a Southern plantation✔ has an editor's note focusing a lot on celebrating heritage, but seemed to me to be celebrating... plantation heritage? ✔ has very little diversity✔ made me feel really, really uncomfortableCalling out a book I literally did not finish strikes me as vaguely slimy, and yeah, this could have been totally remedied and subverted in the second half of this book, but it's worth the consideration if you have read this.An all-around badly executed and uncomfortable book.

This was the book where I finally started to care for these characters in more than a “this book is weirdly addicting” kind of way. Every side character feels so real and developed, even with very little pagetime. These characters are great. Many of them are pretty morally black, and yet they're all interesting and have solid motivations. The relationships between these ten misfits are interesting and dynamic. I was really worried the book was going to use rape trauma as a plot device, but it was handled decently well here. I still think this series overuses horrifying things for shock, but sexual trauma DID NOT get that treatment. The one character who was a victim of rape had actual character-building around that experience. To be quite honest, the best parts of this book were the dragging sessions.

With less humor, more character development, and more intrigue (definitely more intrigue) this barely compares. The only thing they have in common is being awesome// CHARACTER WORKThis book is about two girls, Lexie and Erin, competing for the crown of prom queen. Lexie, being the incredibly devious girl that she is (God, I love her), decides to introduce a new competitor. But this book is so much more involved than a typical Mean Girls ripoff: none of the characters are the typical good girls. Alexandra is a great antihero, who inspires sympathy despite being such a jerk. She's got a tragic backstory, and all her motivations are so sensical. Sam (my personal favorite) was so great because she was so morally ambiguous. She doesn't make the plans, she executes them. Ivy was really fun to read about as well, and I liked her character. Sloane was a bit more cardboard, frankly, but that's okay. She was still enjoyable. This book does a great job drawing from Mean Girls and others like it without copying them. Often, books like Mean Girls have a “good” main character take down the Mean Evil Clique. Here, Lara Deloza adds much more nuance to the typical Mean Girls story. (view spoiler)[two popular girls take part in Lexie's downfall. They team up because they start a relationship.  (hide spoiler)] I liked that the author didn't use the good/evil dichotomy, and instead really entrenched us in the world of high school politics. // SCHEMING AND PLOTTINGI loved how devious this was. The plot twists and turns, yet it's is never boring. There's enough scheming in this book to outpace all of Mean Girls. Needless to say, I totally loved it. I do have one complaint here— the ending was a bit anticlimactic. It was a good ending, but it felt a bit rushed in the final scene. VERDICT: Highly recommended for fans of scheming antiheroes, even if the framing might be odd. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jan 20, 2017","Jan 23, 2017","Feb 21, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/29099971-winning

But somehow, a storyline about a team playing a random, made-up-sport works here.

The actual plot, which has surprisingly little to do with sports, is... really confusing, but in a good way. It's confusing in the “you know there's some kind of twist in the future” way, which I actually love. The ending was incredibly intriguing. Don't read this if you're not into plot ambiguity, but if you can handle an entire book of questions, the plot will be your speed. The strength here is the character work. All the characters are incredibly intriguing. The book compells you to keep reading just to find out who these people really are. They're all terrible people but they all have hidden depths and it's really awesome. The protagonist, Neil, is especially well-developed. Also, this book has an unprecedented amount of savagery. Almost every single character is a master at Calling People Out and it's fucking awesome. The writing style is kind of an issue. It flows nicely, but there's a lot of telling, not showing.

There's no way to perfectly  one of the most complex, meditative books I've ever read. This is not a book for those who like action-packed scifi. Rather, it's for those who enjoy meditative stories. Chambers has written far more thoughtful scifi than most authors attempt. This is such a thoughtfully built world, incorporating themes we can recognize from our own world. Nothing here is underdeveloped; there are so many details in every bit of the worldbuilding. Becky Chambers integrates stories about colonialism, war, and xenophobia into this story. I can't imagine the dedication it takes to build such an interesting, thoughtful world. Perhaps this all sounds overwhelming, but this story stays so grounded in our human experiences that it doesn't feel too fantastical. Chambers is always careful to bring herself back to humanity. You are capable of anything, Rosemary, good or bad.I loved these characters so much. Rosemary is framed as the protagonist— she's a new clerk with a secret past. Sissix is the second-in-command, an affectionate reptilian life form. Kizzy is the mechanic, a spastic human disaster but definitely a funny one. Jenks is the other mechanic, far more down-to-earth despite being Kizzy's partner in crime. Lovey is the Wayfarer's lovable and funny AI. Ashby is the captain of this entire mess, a caring but tired guy who just wants his crew to be happy. There's the ironically named Dr. Chef, a caretaker whose species is going extinct. There's Ohan, a Sianat Pair, who believe themselves connected to a vast network and able to see the cosmos. And there's Corbin, a xenophobic grump with a surprisingly interesting character. I really want to recommend this for fans of Firefly, because it's got That Vibe. The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet is about found family— a ragtag group of misfits finding a home together. Is there anyone who doesn't love that trope? There are so many great platonic relationships here; the two mechanics, Kizzy and Rosemary, and the captain and his second-in-command especially stood out in my mind. There are three good romantic relationships here, but none overtake the book. All three are between two different species, which I really appreciated. These characters are also incredibly diverse— there are normalized gender-neutral pronouns, major nonwhite characters (not even counting the aliens), and major lgbt characters who aren't treated differently by the narrative. Lots to love! I pretty much only had one complaint, which is incidentally the exact same as Pragya's major issue. Part of the ending seems out of place with the rest of the book. For three hundred pages, this story stays slow; definitely something to consume slowly, not in one session. But one part of the climax seems thrown in to orchestrate a sequel, which I didn't love. After so much buildup, this slightly underwhelming conclusion was disappointing. That being said, I definitely recommend this. Can't wait to read the sequel! Pre-ReadBR with Pragya.

Because oh boy, I loved a lot of concepts and ideas here. Odessa's story of grief and addiction, a romance I enjoyed, fantastic worldbuilding around change... and yet, I really feel like this book was a too-much-buildup beginning to what I'm hoping will be a sublime series... and yet here I am, giving this series as a whole a four and recommending it. ♚ THE CHARACTERSOdessa's character is the absolute star of this novel. Her arc around addiction and grief is so sublime and A+, I don't even know what to say. And not only that, but she is a badass. Some of the other side characters, like Valoria and Kasmira, were definitely interesting as well and I honestly wanted more pagetime from all of them. ♔ THE ROMANCEI want to avoid spoilers, so skip this if you really want to avoid knowing anything. But I also want to tell you that this has a major romance between two girls, despite first impressions. As for how that romance played out - I liked it. The two characters in question have a lot of chemistry and work well as a couple. All that being said, it took me a while to really the tension between them. Maybe the issue is I kept looking out for romance between Odessa and every other character, because this author is - as I've noticed since reading book two - so so good at writing side characters. An easy resolution? The endgame romantic interest should've shown up at least once towards the beginning of the book.♚ THE WORLDBUILDINGI loved the ideas here - a city of discriminated-against necromancers, dead returning, poverty and social dynamics - but I found the world itself forgettable as a certified fantasy map nerd. That being said, there were a few thematic elements within the worldbuilding I absolutely loved - the idea of change being considered a bad thing within this kingdom struck me as especially interesting. Just be aware that the focus here lies on themes, not detail. ♔ THE WRITINGQuite good. I expected the writing of this novel to be somewhat mediocre, honestly, considering it's only a second book, but I thought the writing here was lovely, with several moments that just made me INHALE. The opening line of this series is quite literally one of the greatest opening lines ever.♔ FIRST-BOOK SYNDROMEI've been a middle-book person since the beginning of time. I know, I know, call me crazy, but middle book syndrome is such a myth. If the second book doesn't reach farther, go deeper, push at boundaries more than book one, book three will almost certainly be worse. The Fifth Wave, anyone? Divergent? So honestly, I'm not surprised book one was a disappointment. But do I wish this could've been more developed and less full of buildup? Yes. I weirdly think this could actually work as a standalone; just, you know, a three-star one rather than a four-star, and I'm glad this series continued on.♚ RELATED - THE PLOTEh. I have to say, while I solidly enjoyed the plot of this book, it didn't feel like anything particularly special. There were several twists I completely saw coming, many of which seemed as if you're supposed to see it coming. On one hand, that's good - the author doesn't treat readers as if they're idiots. But on the other hand, it just felt like a very un-mindblowing read to me. BOTTOM LINE: Give it a try if the concept sounds interesting, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But don't raise your expectations too high if you're used to loving series more as they go on and less in their opening stages.

I almost felt the need to suspend my disbelief about the plotting here. But in the end, I don't know how necessary that was. While the plot has a few conveniences, in general it was more believable than most middle-grade action thrillers. Part of the humanity of this story comes from the great main characters. Mia is brave and likable, and she plays well off her older brother. I was really worried this would dive into the “North Korea, including its citizens, is just crazy” wavelength and end up as a published mess of racism. But it didn't go in that direction! O'Brien integrates short chapters from many North Korean citizens and doesn't stereotype. She also chose to write this from the point of view of a Korean girl, which I appreciated. It's not a perfect novel. It stays solidly in the middle-grade genre and never tries to step outside. It also suffers from flat side characters. But in general, I was fairly impressed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Feb 11, 2017","Feb 13, 2017","Feb 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33198198-in-the-shadow-of-the-sun

It’s a book that strips bare the outer machinations of a novel and heads straight for the emotional core of the protagonist. And it’s a book I absolutely loved.I actually totally get why a lot of people didn’t like this book; Like Water has a fairly small amount of action and relies primarily off your connection to the characters. If you’re not one for character-driven reads, this is not going to be a book you enjoy. I promise.Maybe my favorite part of this book is the protagonist, Vanni. She is a girl trapped in a small town and working as a mermaid and coming of age. But she's primarily dealing with fear of the future and struggling to repress that fear. Vanni’s dad has Huntington’s, and she is so scared of that future. She's also bisexual and hasn't figured it out yet. I found her such an easy narrator to connect to and I loved her.Leigh, her love interest, is also a remarkably developed character. Leigh’s arc is both around figuring herself out and also figuring out she’s genderqueer and I love it so much, I love it so much and I’m so happy for her. I'm thinking that I just want one thing to be good and right, because one good, right thing can be enough.And, oh, I love the main relationship. Vanni and Leigh are two very flawed people, and their relationship is too good for this world and too pure.This is a super character-driven, gritty, and emotionally raw story about finding love, and finding hope for a future when it seems as if there's none. I binged it in about two hours and I am so glad I did, even though it was… a year later than I planned. Lol.

And not in a good way.I know this is marketing itself as dark, creepy, and atmospheric, but I'm going to be totally honest: it's not. There is embarrassingly little atmosphere. The tone is uninteresting, but occasionally inconsistent. And truly, this book just doesn’t go dark enough. The only creepy thing about this book is something I'm pretty sure wasn't meant to be creepy - Jess' crush on Angie. I had a crush on my girl best friend once. It was deep. It was intense. It was not this obsessive. Guys, this crush is.... bad. I would actually be scared to have Jess as a friend. She unabashedly staring up Angie's crotch - twice. And honestly, yikes, that’s not okay. If the author weren’t a lesbian herself I’d call it the predatory lesbian trope, because that is totally how it feels. And unfortunately, I feel like Jess’ lowkey creepy crush on Angie is the only part of the book that actually gets fleshed out. Margot feels like a one-note villain. Angie feels like a blank slate pretty girl. Jess feels like a blank slate less pretty girl. Ryan feels like another one-note villain and a homophobe to boot. None feel compelling. The whole book feels as if it’s itended to be an exploration of intense sapphic girl friendship and the line between friends and lovers, but it just doesn’t go there. And the minimal exploration there is feels bogged down by the sheer creep factor of Jess’ crush. The other thing is that the mystery isn’t that compelling. This is the kind of mystery that needs to be driven by characters, and these characters failed me. Worse, the mystery doesn’t pop up until the second half, by which time I was already inwardly marking this down as a three at most. Oddly, the book is very clearly divided in half by a very messy switch from first to third person in the middle of the book, which honestly just made the book feel weirder.  The ending could’ve brought this to a three, but it honestly failed for me. SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!! (view spoiler)[It feels as if the ending is based off the assumption that readership has either invested in the characters enough to care, OR totally assumed Margot’s confession was real. Neither was true for me; Margot’s confession in particular felt way too obvious a red herring. (hide spoiler)] Perhaps I would’ve liked the ending if it had been explored in full in terms of how it effects these characters, but it honestly just kind of… happens. (view spoiler)[And then the book ends immediately. I am completely serious. (hide spoiler)]I will say that I’m sort of glad there are beginning to be more books with this much diversity so I feel like we can sort out the good from the bad? Maybe we'll get a whole string of YA-ish sapphic Asian girl thrillers next year. I fucking wish. But I’m super disappointed this fell into the bad category for me.

ELISE IDNF at page 306 and I almost feel bad because this book had some good elements, but on the other hand, I feel like lighting this book on fire. ELISE IS AN IDIOT WHO KEPT HOPING HOPKINS WOULD GET LESS BIPHOBIC: PART Ido you know how much i regret every life choice i've made? a lotSo here's a story about me and Ellen Hopkins. The first Hopkins work I ever read was the Tricks duology, which I absolutely loved. It was a harsh read, but seeing the characters work through these situations was emotionally cathartic. Even the characters who angered me got my sympathy. Tricks has a major bi character who is only slightly based off stereotypes and feels real and developed. Somehow, it was all downhill from there. Being a person who reads for authors, I read Impulse, and here's where my issues began; a character who has been established as gay decides he's straight, which would be homophobic and bi-erasive on its own, but was made even worse by the fact that his love interest implies that she would break up with him if he swung both ways. (More on Impulse's  thousands of problems here.) I was disgusted for obvious reasons. A year later, after seeing some positive s, I read Perfect, which unfortunately decried bi girls as fakers who are really straight. (More on Perfect's many problems, including a fairly gross storyline around rape, here.) ELISE IS AN IDIOT WHO KEPT HOPING HOPKINS WOULD GET LESS BIPHOBIC: PART IIBecause I am a complete idiot who doesn't learn from her mistakes, I decided to pick up another book by Hopkins, which mentions bisexuality in the blurb. The You I've Never Known started well, with a sympathetic character questioning her sexuality. It quickly broke down into a storyline where the bi main character is dating two people at once and cheating. That's blatant stereotyping in itself and I hate cheating storylines on principle anyway. But that's not why I didn't finish this book. I was going to stick it out to the end and hope the resolution worked. Sure, it's stereotypical and a bit off-putting, but I wanted to see where the book would go with it. I didn't finish this book for one reason and one reason only, and that is one line. Ariel just asked her boyfriend to “fuck her straight”.You think I'm exaggerating, but this is a literal, actual quote from this mess of a book. For those of you who are going to call me out for saying this and deny this quote's existence, it's right around page 295. Okay, but isn't even my main issue! Books can portray self-hatred in bi girls, and I'd even consider it an important topic when handled sensitively. It's not about her asking this; it's about the fact that he did it and the narrative romanticized him for it. Hopkins wants the reader to believe Gabe is a viable romantic option for Ariel, when he is so clearly not. A loving guy would not have sex with a girl who is barely seventeen and a virgin and an abuse survivor because she asked him to convince her she's heterosexual. Don't romanticize that in books people my age are reading. This kind of narrative is incredibly toxic. It romanticizes a guy who will have sex with a girl to prove to her she's not bi, and it spreads the idea that bi people find that attractive. Ariel's inner monologue even mentions that she finds his offer hot. To be entirely fair, there is some chance that Hopkins subverts these tropes and portrays ""fucking someone straight"" as a bad thing. But given the s I've read and her track record, I'm not willing to find out.NOTES ABOUT THIS BOOK NOT HAVING TO DO WITH BIPHOBIAbrief because i'm still saltyThe narrative verse style is still really powerful. Hopkins' style has always clicked with me, and The You I've Never Known was no exception. Maya's storyline does not gel well with Ariel's, and she comes off very one-note. Ariel, on the other hand, starts the book off as a well-developed character. That goes away once the cheating storyline pops up, of course. But she does begin the book likable and believable. Around page 150, this book began to go downhill quickly. It's clear the beginning section is written with more thought than the middle section, and the beginning totally fooled me. I guess this is obvious from my , but I don't really recommend any of Ellen Hopkins' books anymore....more",Notes are private!,0,93,1,"Mar 12, 2017","Mar 12, 2017","Feb 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30312837-the-you-i-ve-never-known

This sweet spot has produced masterpieces like Dare Me, Dangerous Girls, Allegedly, and now Genuine Fraud. These are stories about bad people who don't get their punishment, because that's not how the real world works. Real life is messy. Sometimes, bad people live on. First things first: I KNOW a lot of people are going to be comparing this to We Were Liars. Genuine Fraud is a very different novel, and I expect that plenty of people who hated We Were Liars's pretentious rich kids and poetic writing style will love Genuine Fraud's straightforward writing style and morally black main character. I enjoyed the former a fair amount, but this book blew me away. Weirdly enough, the difference between We Were Liars and Genuine Fraud is similar to the difference between Dangerous Girls and Dangerous Boys: they're both excellent books, but the first one of each pair is more concentrated on atmosphere and one final twist, while the second one is more about the why than the how. Genuine Fraud is the story of Jule West-Williams and her best friend Imogen. Anything else said here would spoil the plot. This book is told in flashbacks, with brilliantly subtle clues as to what's going on, and reveals that made my heart pound.

Basically: I loved the characters and I hated the pacing. The pacing here absolutely sucks for the first 50%. It took me until page 220 to truly get engaged, and that’s… not good. From then on, however, I was hooked. But don't worry, I'm going to complain about the dissonance between half one and half two as well; the second half feels like a different book. This transition is interesting and well-executed, but… it didn’t seem to fit with the first half of the book perfectly. They felt like two slightly different books. I almost felt the same about Daughter of Smoke and Bone, but I really felt it here. I don’t know, we’ll see how I feel about this in book two. Let’s talk about the writing. Now, I love Laini Taylor’s writing. I think it’s completely gorgeous. But here? Her writing was almost too much. In the first half, she got caught up in making her writing pretty and forgot to make her story compelling. There were pages and pages of pretty, dreamlike description. That might work for some readers, and maybe sometimes I could’ve enjoyed those, but it didn’t work for my reading slump. NOW, LET’S TALK ABOUT THE LOVEThis will be a very long section. First of all, I loved the opening. It's a little eerie and gets you ready for the book to start.I love Laini Taylor’s ideas surrounding humanity. She writes about the beauties of humanity and about the terrors. This book looks at hate and prejudice, themes which were executed quite well. The function of hate, as Sarai saw it, was to stamp out compassion— to close a door in one's self and forget it was ever there. If you had hate, then you could see suffering— and cause it— yet feel nothing except perhaps a sordid vindication.Lazlo Strange, the DreamerHe’s a dreamer and a librarian and a lover of fairy tales. And he’s flat-out adorable. I almost wished for more depth and darkness to his angelic, good-willed character, and somehow I feel like we’re going to get that in the sequel. Thank goodness. Sarai, The Muse of NightmaresOh my god, I loved her. She's so full of darkness and yet so full of goodness and care. This might sound weird, but I totally love seeing characters with major self-hatred develop out of it. But at some point... here in this room, Sarai thought... she had lost that capacity. Hate had failed her, and it was like losing a shield in battle. Once it was gone, all the suffering had risen up to overwhelm her. It was too much.It was then that her nightmares turned against her, and she started needing lull.All the side charactersThese side characters have a ton of potential. There are so many characters that intrigued me! Minya, Eril-Fane, Calixte, and Sparrow all made an impact on me even in this single book, and given Taylor’s trends of lengthy character development with characters like Liraz and Ziri, I am absolutely excited for our characters to develop in book two.Lazlo and Sarai, the dreamersLaini Taylor is such a hopeless romantic. I don’t think that’s a bad thing; in most cases, I think it's great. Her stories are full of love and the beauties and flaws of humanity. But I’m not sure her love for insta-romance is necessarily a good thing. Obviously, there weren't a lot of other options for slow development in this book or in DoSaB, but I'm still annoyed. Then there's my romance writing issue. Most of the time, I found Laini Taylor's writing easy to get caught up in and fall in love with. But some of her romance writing falls far too close to purple prose for me. No, wait, a few passages didn't fall close; they were purple prose. No one talks about kissing like Lazlo does. I get it; he romanticizes everything and his way of looking at the world is far more romantic than Sarai’s. I get the idea and I appreciate the idea, but it still annoyed me. Despite that one gripe, I really loved the romance. The idea of a dreamer and a manipulator of dreams falling in love is awesome, and I really did end up loving Lazlo and Sarai. They fall in a similar category as Karou and Akiva for me; instalove, but so compelling that I didn’t care. Side note about my trope preferences— Laini Taylor’s romantic couples are really made for me. One of my biggest issues with YA romance is the constant “hot alpha male and cute naive girl” trope. As an avid hater of the hot alpha male trope, I am so grateful that Laini Taylor does not write hot alpha males. Her main guy characters are usually fairly sweet and nerdy types, which is way, way more attractive to me. Since I can’t get caught up in the swoon session over a guy’s hotness, her personality-filled, sweet, loving guys really work for me. Her main girl characters also neatly avoid the naive girl trope. Sarai isn’t some dainty flower. Neither are Karou or Liraz from her other series. VERDICT: Despite my huge issues with the pacing, the characters and romance really redeemed this for me. Definitely recommended, especially to hopeless romantics at heart.

Before I Let Go is a cliche story that tries to be something more but is not fooling me. I'm going to full-out explain everything I disliked and liked about this book, but really, I should replace the whole  with “read Tess Sharpe's Far From You” written fifty-eight times down the page. That book is also focused on girl friendship with romantic vibes, but it's got far more developed characters to drive the story. Read Far From You!! Do it!!🌺 CAN YOU EVEN BE MORE CLICHECan I summarize this book for you? It's a mashup of ""dead best friend had secrets and may have been in love with live best friend, because bury your gays"" and ""girl moves to small town and discovers family secrets"", except if you leeched every single good thing about both those plots out of the book.Before I Let Go was especially disappointing for me because of all the comparisons it begs to every other suspense book ever. I was really hoping this would differentiate itself with a new take on all those tropes. Uh. Nope, it's not an original take. This is a mashup of a lot of way better books and also predictable. Here's the thing, though: any cliche suspense book can be saved. How do you save a cliche suspense book? There are two options: characters or atmosphere. Yeah, this book doesn't do either. Let's get into those two factors. 🌺 WE NEED CHARACTER WORK, KIDDOSWe all know that books in which the protagonist goes back to her small town are a bit of a cliche. But I do tend to enjoy them. Why? Because at its core, this trope is about the exploration of relationships and childhood. Yet this book doesn't explore a single fucking thing about our protagonist's childhood. (Do you know why I just called her our protagonist? Because it has been less than twenty minutes since I finished this book and I just forget Corey's name.) Moving on. For good character-driven suspense, we need to focus on all of the above: 1) the protagonist's character, 2) the former best friend's character, and 3) the complexities of their relationship.#1 - As I've already mentioned, our protagonist is incredibly bland. Informed traits do not make a character - what we need is an inner monologue. And unfortunately, Corey doesn't have any unique thoughts or reactions to the world. I feel as if she's a character I should adore, but most of her character is for the reader's emotional manipulation.#2 - I do think the author put a vague amount of effort into developing Kyra, the dead best friend. Kyra's BPD is represented well, at least, and the narrative is clear on the fact that she is more than her BPD. But, uh... she's textually not much more than her BPD because she has basically no personality. I do think, to be positive, that it comes from a matter of lacking effort on the part of the author rather than a genuine distaste for mentally ill people.#3 - Kyra and Corey's relationship just seems so... lacking in problems? Kyra gets rejected and is not that weird about it, they hardly fight, there's not much tension between them. There are one or two moments where past Kyra mentions feeling like no one, not even Corey, sees her as anything but her BPD. That was interesting idea I would've liked to explore. Yet their issues feel oddly glossed over, and more importantly, we don't get much of a sense that they have issues from Corey's narration. It feels like an informed character trait and loses all its interest within the narrative. Basically, I just felt like every problem and character trait was informed rather than shown. And like, I get that it's young adult, but listen, young adult can and has do better. Moving on. 🌺 WHAT IS A SUSPENSE? I DON'T KNOW HERThe book could've gotten away with its incredibly lacking characters if the plot weren't so fucking obvious. But there's no twist. I had the solution guessed from the blurb. The townsfolk start saying “it was her natural end” on page 50 and they stay on that exact same phrase right to the end and it is so, so obvious where it's going. There's not even a slow progression from normal atmosphere to creepy atmosphere, which could've replaced a slow-burn plot. And this is maybe what ruins the book the most.I am firmly of the belief that a good atmosphere can save an otherwise mediocre book. Nijkamp tries to add atmosphere, at least. There are a ton of minor touches where Corey thinks she's being followed by ghosts that echo gothic horror and are, in hindsight, kind of cool. But some of these touches feel superficial because they don't add to the story, meaning they feel a bit like a transparent ploy to scare the audience. The other issue is that any atmosphere created is ruined by the thrown-in chapters written in script format. This somehow feels both gimmicky and lazy. There were a few scenes written in script that honestly kind of felt like the author drafted a scene and couldn't be bothered to translate it into normal writing. But okay, let's say Nijkamp genuinely thought it would add to the book. Here's why it doesn't work: the epistolatory chapters and the flashback chapters fit in fine, but the play-script chapters completely throw you out of the story. I literally thought Nijkamp was planning on some kind of reveal about these chapters being fake because of how misplaced they felt. I did like the use of snow-covered Alaska as a method to create atmosphere - I happen to really like the cold-wintry aesthetic. Honestly, though, I've seen this done better. If you're looking for a book that uses Alaska to create a truly great atmosphere, look to The Smell of Other People's Houses instead. 🌺 OH MY DEAR GOD, USE GOOGLEOn the topic of representation. So this book is really diverse, first of all. It stars an ace lead, her dead best friend is pan and has bpd, there are two side characters who are mlm and people of color. And in my positives section I'm going to discuss the discussion around bpd and narrative depersonalization. But for now, let's talk about the ace lead. Though at one point Corey uses the word, the major plot point framed to show that Corey is ace seems to be Corey rejecting Kyra. Which is a major inaccuracy as to what asexuality actually is. The result is that asexuality is equated to aromanticism by the narrative. I expect Nijkamp was trying to make this book more palatable to readers who don't know what asexuality is, let alone aromanticism, but I am incredibly unhappy with this as a writing decision and to me, it undermines representation that would've otherwise been really revolutionary. 🌺 SOME LONE POSITIVES?So the main theme of this book is the trope of the magical mental illness - the idea that someone with mental illness is someone deeply other, the idea that mental illness will make your art greater or suffering will make you deeper. And this book, at its core, is about taking down that trope. That's a really compelling theme and I really appreciate it. [If you're looking for more with this, also with super-diverse leads, Final Draft by Riley Redgate is calling your name!!]I will say that Nijkamp has a very readable writing style. I finished this in only two sittings and it wasn't a struggle to get through. And while a lot of the book felt to me like smoke-and-mirrors meant to make the readership think things were deeper than they are, I think this could be a good book to consume quickly. It's not going to be a DNF. However, I think plenty of readers will find it easy to see through this book. I'm starting to doubt if I would like This Is Where It Ends if I read it today - Nijkamp is good at emotionally manipulative writing, but I don't think this book is trying to shoot for anything deeper that readers can truly connect to.

Maybe they should measure it in terms of people left behind.Uhhhhhh. This... was not terrPeople always measured war in terms of the numbers dead. Maybe they should measure it in terms of people left behind.Uhhhhhh. This... was not terrible. I'm seeing a lot of positive s for it, as a matter of fact. And holy CRAP if it isn't filled with potential!! But I gotta say, this wasn't nearly as good as I expected. I expected solid gold and I got... boredom with some missed potential here and there. In honor of the wasted potential, we'll be contrasting potential-filled aspects to bad aspects here.♔ // GOOD: The worldbuilding is super intriguing. Belleza blends in a narrative about racism and war, and I have to say, I think it's well-executed. The parallels to our own world are impactful and very politically relevant. There are also cubes which everyone uses to access memories, and while Belleza could've fleshed that concept out a bit more, it's an interesting piece of tech. ♚ // BAD: At times the connections to our world are sooooooo heavy-handed. I'm not saying they're bad - they're maybe the best part of this book - but jesus christ, I figured out the parallels to illegal immigration on page 15. It can be subtle! Your readership understands it! Use of the word “deportation” over and over for example, makes the already interesting parallels between this world and our world totally unsubtle. AND ALSO!! The planet index only mentions 50% of the planets, and doesn't explain how they orbit. I mean, what the fuck does the quadrant system mean? Aren't all these planets moving at different speeds, given that each is a different distance from the sun? Are they just in these quadrants temporarily? Either way, the story wasn't made that much easier to follow. ♔ // GOOD: The overarching plot is interesting. There are twists and turns and nothing is ever as it seems. ♚ // BAD: Unfortunately number one: I guessed the final twist. Unfortunately number two: the plotting is convoluted and confusing. It is so obviously meant to keep you guessing and keep you on your toes and it does not work at all because none of the twists ever impact the full plot!! Also, let's talk plot contrivances. The dropping of a pill due to clumsiness is used as an actual important plot point. Also, how the fuck did Aly survive that one event? I genuinely did not understand anything that happened in that one chapter. ♔ // GOOD: Rhee is the morally ambiguous badass we have all been wishing for and hoping for. She is badass but still not afraid to break down. She has so much opportunity for growth. She doesn't have a romantic storyline. Belleza has something great here with this character. ♚ // BAD: Rhee's character changes based on where the plot needs her. She keeps having moments of “oh, I had a realization and now I am More Mature!” and yet she never seemed to actually develop as a character. Rhee makes a decision around page 150 that contradicts both human logic and everything she plans to do in literally the next chapter. I am not joking. She does, in fact, change her mind twice in three chapters. ♔ // GOOD: I flew through the last 50 pages without even glancing at how much I had left. ♚ // BAD: It occurred after I spent three. hundred. pages. being. bored. Yes, I'm in a reading slump right now, but up until the last 50 pages, I felt NO motivation to keep reading. And you know what the problem is? The writing. Belleza has that debut-novel issue where it's in third person and the characters are talked about in this removed sort of “she knew this” and “he thought that” way. And it is exactly why this book feels so boring. ♚ // A FINAL BAD: The plot is convoluted, with genuine potential getting bogged down by confusing twists and holes. Get rid of all the unnecessary twists to the plot, and you have a 100-page book. ♔ // A FINAL, AND MAJOR, GOOD: But here's the thing: I would want to read that 100-page book.This book is not your typical cliche sff. Rhoda Belleza has a great setup, good worldbuilding, no romance, and a good main character to work with in the next book. She clearly has the talent to make book two a five-star read. Will she do it? Maybe.VERDICT: Great concept, great ideas, bad execution and wasted potential everywhere. If the sequel is better, this series could easily make my recommended list.

And here is where Mirage does something quite brilliant. Instead of simply focusing on Amani’s narrative, her kidnapping, and villainizing those around her, this book chooses to focus on how the Vath rule has fucked over everyone around her.Imperial prince Idris has grown up without his language, Kushaila, being taught to forget and to push himself into a narrative he will never be accepted within. And Imperial princess Maram, both Vathek and Kushaila, has attempted to mold herself into exactly what her cruel father wants in an attempt to gain his acceptance. For this, she is hated by her own people, trapped in a narrative that is not her own. And meanwhile, Amani is trapped in a situation where she is forced to play-act and do whatever she is told. But she never stops fighting to win back her own agency in a world that is desperate for her to have none.The point here is that I am absolutely totally in love with the meta-narrative here about colonization. I am not Moroccan and don’t have the specific cultural knowledge of how this book plays into the history of Morocco, but I would like you all to read this amazing explanation of how this book mirrors actual history by my best friend Chaima. And the setting really truly does take you there.The relationship between Amani and Maram is one of the best dynamics of the book. I feel like we’re often very low on amazing female antiheroines and especially antivillains [basically, a villain who is redeemed / doesn’t always take up that role within the narrative] and it was so great to see that dynamic here.And Amani has so much agency. Seriously, in a book that is about Amani’s loss of agency, it really amazed me how much space she is allowed to take up within the narrative. I love that she rebels. I love that she doesn’t lie down for Maram, even when she realizes she really does pity her. I love that she is aware of her feelings for Idris and yet careful and realistic about how she deals with them. She is such a sensible, well-written, well-developed lead, and I love her.Listen, in general, this book is one of the most feminist things I have ever read. It’s essentially about an indigenous girl learning to rebel against oppression, and about her friendship with a fabulous biracial lady antivillain. I was in heaven.And this might go without saying, but the writing and world… is gorgeous. It’s just so sensuous, and the setting is amazing, and I was so in the book. Lovely.There are other elements within the book, like the family dynamic and the romance, that intrigued me as well, and I’m excited to see where they go in the future. And while the romance almost felt like it should have annoyed me, Amani is such a fantastic lead and Idris is so sympathetic that I wasn’t at all bothered.This would be great for fans of sensuous, gorgeous, and theme-focused fantasy-adjacent space-opera. I have a good feeling this is going to be one of the best YA scifi duologies of our current time and I am so here for it.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube⭐Look out for my  of book two!

If I were to try and summarize this book, it would probably go something like this: A girl plays choose your own adventure at a mysterious mansion her aunt told her to visit, causing some really weird shit to go down. And there are girls kissing.If that summary doesn't excite you at least a little bit, this will not be your thing. But if that sounds cool? You are going to love this. Jane Unlimited is a far departure from the fantasy Kristin Cashore has written before, but it's got her trademark strong characters and clever plotting. This book is basically a masterpiece of creative storytelling. Jane Unlimited is split into six sections: an introduction and five stories, each one following Jane through a different paths and a different genre. Kristin Cashore is an absolute master at tying different clues and hints of a story together into one compelling mystery. This book instantly reminded me of her earlier book, the equally well thought-out Bitterblue, yet better paced. While Bitterblue was undeniably a bit of a slog, brilliant as it was, this book gets going even faster. I loved seeing every little thread get tied together over time. And while each section is clever in its own way, the true strength of this book is seeing how each section ties together: all of the weird reveals are true throughout the book, and you can tell. ♔ THE MISSING MASTERPIECE - Agatha-Christie-style mysteryThis chapter is interesting and builds up the rest of the book very well. Also, Ivy and Jane are adorable. ♚ LIES WITHOUT BORDERS - spy thrillerAgain, builds up the rest of the book very well. I liked the buildup of characters here a lot. Kiran's character especially got to me. ♔ IN WHICH SOMEONE LOSES A SOUL AND CATHERINE FINDS ONE - paranormal horror As an individual story, I loved this a lot, though I do think it's slightly unfitting for the book itself. This one is terrifying. I want to give points for the terrifying nature, but I want to take away points for the odd and unfitting nature. ♚ JANE, UNLIMITED - speculative sci-fiThis is probably my favorite individual story; it's so meaningful it could probably stand on its own. I can't say anything because spoilers but oh man, Jane and Ivy and Ravi and Kiran and Patrick and... everyone. I just love these characters so much. ♔ THE STRAYHOUND, THE GIRL, AND THE PAINTING - portal fantasyThe introduction to this chapter is so awesome once you finish! Honestly, my favorite part of this was the ending. I don't mean this as an insult to the novella; it's creative and interesting, although very weird. But the ending fits this book so perfectly and made the whole story worth it.What I loved most about this book, aside from the reveals, were the dynamic side characters. Tu Reviens is home to a host of odd ducks.➽ Our main character Jane, our slightly quirky and completely hilarious bi lead➽ Twins Ravi and Kiran, the children of patriarch Octavian with his first wife Catherine.➽ Their missing stepmother Charlotte, a character who's hard to pin down ➽ Ravi's girlfriend Lucy and Kiran's boyfriend Colin, who are... actually cousins. Imagine being someone's brother-in-law's wife and their actual sister at the same time. I honestly don't know, buddy. ➽ Kiran's old flame Patrick, a servant of the house ➽ Patrick's sister Ivy, one of my absolute FAVORITES. It sounds confusing, yes, but these characters are so individually compelling and mysterious that it's easy to fall in love. I'd read an entire book about almost all of the side characters.TL;DR: After around five years of waiting desperately for Kristin Cashore's new book, this didn't let me down at all. I don't know how talk about a book that's so close to perfect. No way did I get through this  without going all over the place; this is one of the most weirdly good books ever written. I definitely have to recommend this one to any fans of Kristin Cashore. With clever twists and brilliant plotting, it's a must-read.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,2,358,1,"May 08, 2017","May 12, 2017","Feb 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32991569-jane-unlimited

Of the seventeen stories in this book, I gave nine five stars [holy shit], three four stars, three three stars, and only two two stars, for my highest rating ever - an average rating of 4.12. This is a true anthology. All other anthologies can leave.Okay, so what is this book? All Out is a collection of historical fiction featuring queer characters being put back into their narratives. Most is romance between girls [relevant to my interests], feat. a few romances between guys, one [or arguably two] couple of stories that lack romance, and two stories with m/f romance where one character is queer. A lot of these are very speculative-fiction esque, which I found surprising but a lot of fun! And most of all, what this meant to me is something I discussed in my Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue  - this is historical fiction about people who don't get historical fiction. People love to declaim about how the historical fiction genre doesn't need diversity because, apparently, the only people who existed ""back then"" were white, straight, and abled. But unfortunately for those who don't like it, people like us have always existed.

Also maaaaaaybe a couple more visibly bi or visibly gay MCs, because I feel like a lot of these characters are indeterminate sexuality!

Liked this a little more than the last story, thought it was sweet - and then oh, it’s also really short? It’s not even the length, I just didn’t feel this went very far in terms of developing Dee’s arc, because it ended right after she got a chance to realize only holding hands for now was okay. Definitely on the positive side of a three, though.

Human Ella meets a wood spirit, Oria, through her dog, and then they fall in love. And it’s really sweet and creative.

Not to be this person, but honestly, the age gap was just too much for me. I’m seventeen and I should not be dating a twenty-year-old, much less a person a year younger than I am. The ridiculous amount of talk about kidnapping just makes it worse. Jesus, y’all. Points for a supportive family and a kind of sexuality crisis narrative, but that’s not really what I wanted out of this anthology - ya girl just wanted love stories for once. I’m so sorry.→ Walking After Midnight by Kody Keplinger← ★★★★★✔ 1952 NY | wlw, a-spec MCAwww, I love this. It’s about Betsey, a child actress on the way to New York for a play and a new future, and Laura, a girl she meets on the way.

Loved the detailed bits about 1999, which were missing from a lot of the recent-history stories. The story was kind of just good for me, though? It didn’t really impact me as much as I’d hoped; I just finished with a sense of basic happiness.→ Three Witches by Tessa Gratton← ★★★★★✔ 1519 Castile [Spain] | wlwThis story follows Violante, a girl in conversion therapy, and Gracia, the nun caring for her. This story is one about the nature of religion, and I think the reasons I loved it so much can be summed up pretty easily: 1) the writing and 2) the ending. The ending of this story is one of the most powerful endings in the collection and I just… gah. → The Inferno & the Butterfly by Shaun David Hutchinson← ★★★★★✔ 1839 London | mlmMagician’s assistant Alfie tries to save rival magician’s apprentice Wilhelm. This story is about believing yourself to be cursed and releasing yourself from that and it meant so much to me.→ Healing Rosa by Tehlor Kay Mejia← ★★★★★✔ 1933 New Mexico | wlw, latinx mcsThis is joining the list of things that were written so well they made me literally, actually cry. This follows a girl who falls in love with another girl, Rosa, and tries to heal her of the demon inside her.

I could have read this forever over and over again.This book follows... Elena Mendoza... and she causes an apocalypse is gifted the power to heal people by an unknown entity.  ✔Elena is a fucking master of sassing people, has a tendency to take her friends for granted, and is so utterly lovable and relatable. Her motivation to absolve herself - to feel as if she has done everything she needs to do - is written with so much realism and empathy.  ✔Freddie is a depressed cynic and a horrible driver who believes nothing is connected. Her arc involves her struggle with who she was before the shooting – is she different now? Did she deserve to be saved?  ✔Fadil is Elena’s rational and awesome ace best friend. He’s religious, but also not willing to give up logic or rationale, which I feel like I never see in literature? If y’all are looking for a non-negative but also-not-the-focus representation of religion – specifically Islam! – please read this.Something I like about Shaun David Hutchinson books is that every character is dimensional. Elena, Freddie, and Fadil, of course, but even the characters in here that I disliked managed to feel like fully dimensional people. Oh, I almost forgot to mention this romance! If you know me, you know I am 1) picky about romance, and 2) really really good at getting invested when I like both the characters. These were both true here, and with a really great discussion about crushes present as well:“The way I saw it, there were only two ways to get over my crush. Either I realized she was a horrible person not worth my time or I got to know the real Winifred Petrine and built new feelings for her on a solid, honest foundation. Of course, there existed a very real possibility that Freddie would never share my feelings. But friendship with someone you like isn't a second-place trophy; it's a win all on its own.”And I loved the dynamic between Elena and Freddie so much. I want an entire book about them sort of talking through hard issues via anger / sort of flirting as they do an immense amount throughout this book. Or I could just reread this?As is usual for Shaun David Hutchinson, who is Gay and Weird and I relate, this is an extremely weird book plot-wise. I mean, you have a miracle performed on a crush, strange lights stealing a person, and talking starbucks mermaid - and that’s literally just in the first 5%. And it is... so hilarious. There is a lot of what some Christians might consider sacrilege [yeah, sorry], but I actually found this element sort of delightfully snarky. Listen, talking unicorns making horrible jokes about Jesus while a sixteen-year-old girl becomes increasingly annoyed is basically my entire sense of humor. This book is about a Lot Of Things– existential fear, the realization that no one is who you think they are, the realization that death is never in our souls, the importance of making choices, and most of all, the importance of free will. All of those topics are handled in a way I found super compelling, and I think that’s what made this book worth reading to me – it’s a very funny book hiding a whole lot of serious discussions.Bonus points for thinly veiled jokes about U.S. President Cheeto. And an-honest-god-I-am-not-joking-about-this reference to that Name Game meme from three years ago. But listen, The Apocalypse of Elena Mendoza was such an amazing reading experience for me. I wish this book would never have ended and I want to reread it again and again.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,329,1,"Jan 05, 2018","Jan 12, 2018","Feb 06, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35297386-the-apocalypse-of-elena-mendoza

And that is exactly what I wanted, and exactly what makes this story so powerful. Feral Youth follows a group of campers stuck in what is essentially a punishment camp, and is written in a very unusual story format - Hutchinson writes a coherent story involving several characters, and several authors come in to add full stories that each of these characters tell. It’s an interesting format, although one that feels a bit clumsily executed - many characters with amazing stories have very little development within the actual story. Actually, the real story felt like not much more than a framing device, though it obviously tried to be more and at points succeeded. My average rating for this anthology was 3.78 Stars, which is pretty awesome and above my anthology average, which usually hangs out around 3.4. My absolute favorites from this one were Robin Talley’s Look Down and Stephanie Kuehn’s A Cautionary Tale, with honorable mentions to Suzanne Young’s Rule 16 and Justina Ireland’s hilarious Supernatural parody. The worst was the Incest Jokes and Bi Stereotypes One. (You’ll see.) Without further ado, a rundown!♔ The Butterfly Effect and The Chaos Effect by Marieke Nijkamp - ★★★★☆ 🇸🇱Jenna turns to pyromania as a solution to her problems, and god, if that doesn’t sound cheesy. I am so sorry to every author in this collection for typing that. I felt about this the way I feel about a lot of Nijkamp writing - it feel as if I should love it, but it feels juuuuuust manipulative of the audience enough that I couldn’t fully. Maybe that’s just my preconceived opinions of her writing and I wouldn’t have fully noticed if not for my experience with Before I Let Go. The other issue is that you can totally guess the story’s whole arc from part one, so the end feels anticlimactic. But overall, I did enjoy this story - Nijkamp really uses her talent for actual writing here and the theme and ending rocked. ♔ A Ruthless Dame by Tim Floreen - ★★★★☆ 🇸🇱Closeted teen Cody pulls a revenge heist on a pervert who’s screwed him over. I thought this was kind of awesome, but for some reason I didn’t have much of an emotional reaction to this – I find Floreen’s writing very pat, as a rule. ♔ Look Down by Robin Talley - ★★★★★ 🇸🇱Georgia tells ghost stories about her summer camp. This was horrifying on like eight different levels, whirling between supernatural and very, very human. I love how it touches on both the typical horrors of life and of homophobia AND touches on some just plain terrifying notes. ♔ Big Brother, p.1 and Big Brother, p.2 by E.C. Carter - ★☆☆☆☆This was just a vaguely unsettling story? Brother keeps hearing his sister masturbate. It’s weird as hell. It has the biggest nonending ever for no reason other than, apparently, the author had written themselves into a fucking corner. And doesn’t offer much insight into David’s character, who is essentially a joke. But my biggest issue is probably the fact that the book’s only bi character is – you guessed it – a sex addict. Please. ♔ The Subjunctive by Alaya Dawn Johnson - ★★☆☆☆ ☀️So… can someone explain what this meant? I love Johnson’s writing, and continued to in this story, but it didn’t grab me in the way her earlier A Hundred Thousand Threads did. And the confusing plot made the insight into Jaila’s character far less compelling. Overall… meh. ♔ A Cautionary Tale by Stephanie Kuehn - ★★★★★ ☀️Guys. This is the best story in the whole book. The exploration of privilege is so lovely. Honestly, though, my favorite was how terrifying this was. It was one of those scared-in-a-good-way stories. My one complaint would be that the story offers less concrete backstory for Tino than I’d hoped. ♔ Jackie’s Story by Justina Ireland - ★★★★☆ ☀️This story begins with Jackie retelling an obvious parody of Supernatural, which is just about the funniest thing I’ve ever read. Danny and Sean Williamson and some girl named Cass dating Danny. Listen, maybe my sense of humor is just shit, but that was awesome. Part two was… decent but not amazing. There’s an interesting three little pigs retelling with a twist, but honestly forgettable and offers barely anything into Jackie’s character. Would be a three if not for that damn parody. ♔ Self-Portrait by Brandy Colbert - ★★★★☆ ☀️I finally liked a Colbert again! I feel like I’ve liked but not loved all her recent books and it’s so annoying to me. Her style is very matter-of-fact and very slice-of-life, meaning an authentic feeling but a lack of dramatic tension or plot arc, but for a story with an established climax, that works. Thematic moments could’ve been built up earlier, but overall a success - guys, I adored Sunday as a main character. Seriously.♔ A Violation of Rule 16 by Suzanne Young - ★★★★★Lucinda fights back against the dress code in the most badass way possible. I don’t know, guys, I just really liked this? Young’s style is awesome and her girl protagonists are always fun. And for some reason the tiny romance element here stood out - know-it-all guy who happens to totally love Lucinda and make men are trash jokes. Honestly, the perfect man. Overall, I thought this book was super entertaining and fun and would love if you would all read it too.

And yes, it definitely would never have happened, but it was fucking awesome to think about the world if it had - to wish for a world without the legacy of decades of systematic oppression and scientific racism. This book has a fundamental sense of hope to it, a fundamental wish for a better world. It's fair to critique the book's fundamental erasure of the history of marginalization and colonialism; after all, the very idea of this world does erase the hardships of marginalized people. But honestly, all my concerns about this were wiped away by the tone of the book itself and the final note. I'd also highly recommend giving the author's note at the back of this book a read. Johnston's thoughts on the complexities of writing this book were exactly what I wanted. Though I don't come from a colonized country, and the impact of colonialism is something I will never fully understand, this book managed to come off to me as a celebration of diversity rather than an erasure of a legacy. To me, it felt like the best kind of escapism. Imagine being in Victorian England but not being, you know, despised for your race and sexuality and religion. I am so about that. It's as if we're putting ourselves into narratives that aren't our own, that never would be, and it made me so unbelievably happy. As a disclaimer, I'm a huge fan of E.K. Johnston and have basically enjoyed everything she's published. But I genuinely loved this book. While the first 35% is fairly boring, once I got past that initial slow section, the book picked up to the point where I finished in a day. My initial slow pace might not be the book's fault, though. I honestly think I would've liked this slightly better if not for Edelweiss' major formatting issues. (You know I love you all.)What makes this book stand out to me is the complex, interesting worldbuilding. I like the idea of a world with Victorian culture, but with technology and more modern social ideas. First of all, there's the diversity; character are described as wearing hijabs and kimonos to balls, which was lovely and creative. This world celebrates diversity in a big way. There are little details everywhere in the book that place it firmly into history. Alan Turing is mentioned at one point getting the recognition he deserved, rather than, y'know, being murdered for his sexuality. Basically, this totally fueled my history nerd self. (As near as I can figure out, after Queen Victoria, Victoria II ruled, and then her son Albert. None of this has to do with my , I just found everything really intriguing.) I want to reread this book just to catch every detail of the world.I also really enjoyed our ensemble cast of characters. That Inevitable Victorian Thing is narrated by three characters: Helena, Margaret, and August. Helena is a middle-class citizen staying in Toronto with her Aunt Teresa and her vivacious cousin Elizabeth. Margaret is a princess disguised as a more lower-class citizen for her debut. August Callaghan is Helena's fiancé, who has problems of his own. I really liked this trio of characters; they're all complex and dimensional leads to this book. I especially liked the ending. It's cute and feels very true to the characters. Again, I can't really spoil, but it's totally not what you expect in the best way. VERDICT: This is one of the most heartwarming scifi books I've ever read, and I can't recommend it enough. Definitely check this out for the less-terrible-yet-still-historical worldbuilding.

She ends up creating an Instagram account detailing her loneliness, @Vicurious, and discovers she might not be alone after all. Yes, it's a bit of a cheesy concept, but this book executed the premise very well. The best thing about this book is that no characters are completely unsympathetic. Even characters who seem standoffish are developed and realistic, which I loved, and Vicki ends the book with a group of truly genuine friends. Vicki's romantic storyline with Lipton doesn't overtake the book, and it builds quite genuinely. There are no declarations of love– this reads like a normal high school relationship, which I appreciated. Lipton is also a genuinely good guy, rather than being an asshole. Honestly, my main complaint was that the text messages kept switching fonts and Vicki's font wasn't consistent.

It's not this book's fault that I took so long to read it, oops. GOOD POINTS+ The plotting is awesome. The twist at the end was INCREDIBLE. I really wish the twists had been more balanced throughout the book, but all in all, this series is worth it just for the plot twists. + The worldbuilding is still great. The author clearly put a lot of work into the world and the religion. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of difference between the two countries, but altogether, good!+ Characters actually have motivations. Nobody is just working for the greater good here. Everyone has a motivation based on their desire to save their family or save their friends. There's no “I'm doing this because It's the Right Thing”. I really appreciate that. + The character work here is... good. I like the two main characters of this series a decent amount. Twylla was an interesting heroine in the last book, and Errin was interesting here, but for some reason neither of them couldn't carry the book for me. LESS GOOD POINTS+ The writing style is still way too subdued. Even in incredibly tense scenes, everything feels lethargic. While this style works for some of the more brutal scenes, the style absolutely fails during romantic moments. Everything falls completely flat. + There is still too much romance. This series suffers from instalove and slightly flat couples. Silas' romantic interest in the protagonist isn't emotionally charged. There's no reasoning for their interest in each other. All in all, while I enjoyed the first book, I was expecting much more out of book two. Yet while I still enjoyed this sequel quite a bit, it suffers from the same problems as the first book.

It's really the story of five different morally grey characters, all out for themselves, battling it out. This is a book that explores the hero / villain dichotomy and promptly shatters it to pieces.Someone could call themselves a hero and still walk around killing dozens. Someone could be labeled a villain for trying to stop that person. Plenty of humans were monstrous, and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human.I love books that subvert and explore tropes.Vicious sets itself apart from Schwab's other adult releases with a far faster pace. My main complaint about Darker Shade of Magic was the lack of character-driven plot; events happened to the characters rather than because of them. That's not true here. Every single plot twist is due to an action by a main character.In terms of characters, this book absolutely rocks. Schwab's characters have such clear motivation for everything they do. Not a single character here is particularly good; everyone is a solid chaotic neutral except for Eli, who's one of the best lawful evil antagonists I've ever read. Interlude: Me Ranting About How Much I Love These Characters“they're evil you shouldn't love them” we all have problematic favesVictor is the technical villain, but he's far easier to root for and empathize with. Eli is a believable, well-developed character, but his cruel fanaticism isn't a well-sold brand. Maybe Eli has a moral code and Victor doesn't, but Eli is lying to himself about his motives. Victor is evil, but he's absolutely aware of his place in the narrative, which made him easy to root for. Schwab's development of these characters makes the book's main conflict even more high-stakes. She also shows off her talent for relationship building here; the conflict between Victor and Eli is so dynamic and interesting. The difference between Victor and Eli, he suspected, wasn't their opinion on EOs. It was their reaction to them. Eli seemed intent to slaughter them, but Victor didn't see why a useful skill should be destroyed, just because of its origin.I'm always ready to read about friends-to-enemies relationships, and Victor and Eli's is especially cool. Even more so because they have genuinely touching moments. “Tell you what,” said Victor. “You remember me, and I'll remember you, and that way we won't be forgotten.”But they're not the only interesting, 3-D characters here. Serena and Sydney are two incredibly compelling characters, and their sisterly conflict makes them ever more interesting. Sydney is a 13-year-old girl who can raise the dead. Serena can make everyone around her follow her suggestions. Despite being on “evil” sides, these two girls are so believable and their motivations so clear that it's hard not to root for their respective sides. I hated Eli, yet I rooted for Serena, despite her being on his side. The other side characters are equally as developed. I especially loved Mitch; he's a criminal down on his luck. Possibly my favorite thing was the odd familial dynamic between Mitch, Victor, Sydney, and Dol the dog. The dynamic between Victor and Sydney is totally awesome. Safe had ceased to be a place for Sydney. It had become a person. Specifically, safe had become Victor.(Tell me you didn't cry reading that. You're LYING.)Mitch and Sydney and Mitch and Victor's relationships both stand out as well. “I don't need a bodyguard,” said Victor. “I noticed that,” said Mitch.Victor let out a cough of a laugh. “Yes, well. I don't want everyone else to notice too.”“So what do you want?” he asked.Victor's lips curled into that same dangerous smile. “A friend.”I don't know if I can pick a favorite character here! They're all so interesting and memorable. Definitely recommended for any fans of morally ambiguous antiheroes, and thanks to everyone who wouldn't stop recommending this.

There's an element of religion, and so many little traditions that make this world feel real. And there's not much infodumping, aside from a bit at the beginning. Information about the world is revealed over the course of the book, making for an interesting and compelling word. • Twylla's character was very well-crafted. Her emotional turmoil felt believable and completely relatable. She was never an idiot for the sake of the plot. Since we learn every reveal at the same time she does, her decisions make perfect sense given the information we have. • I liked both of the guys a decent amount! This is a fairly decent love triangle. And the love triangle is a bit of a sneaky one, in terms of how it ends. It's unexpected, let's just say that. We'll talk about my negative thoughts on this later. • The ending is so creative and so far from what I expected of this book! Even though I was spoiled about one of the reveals, there were several in a short period of time and it really killed me. WHAT I DISLIKED• I have one major complaint: nothing happens for most of the book. The plot's interesting at times, but at times the book is driven more by romance than by plot. The slow-building plot and emphasis on romance actually fit the story very well, it just... well. It got boring. Bear in mind, I'm not typically someone who likes romantic fantasy. I thought the story had moments where the romance was just emphasized waaaaay too much. I have this exact same complaint about books I've truly enjoyed like The Wrath and The Dawn, Divergent, Caraval, and The Selection. • I do have to mention that Merek and Lief, the two love interests, feel a little one-note. Lief especially needed far more depth. In fact, my biggest issue with the romance plot was that Lief's jealousy is never really addressed. He was never distrustful of Twylla, which made me happier, but I still don't find his dick-measuring contests with Merek at all attractive. • All in all, I just felt this didn't go deep enough. The ending left room for a very subversive take on a fairy tale, for a stronger realization scene and better ending to a fairy tale retelling. The Sin Eater's Daughter came close to that. But not quite close enough. • I read this mostly to get to book two, only to discover book two isn't really that much better. I was expecting a huge leap and I got none. VERDICT: While I did enjoy this a fair amount while reading, it's not a particularly memorable or fabulous book.

He's a posturing hypocrite. He's a dick. I wanted to hit him in the face for at least a hundred pages. We know this. But he's a character that, for some strange reason, resonates with thousands of people. Why? Well, simply put, it's because he's written like this on purpose. But I think that doesn't quite get to the heart of it. Holden is a fifteen-year-old kid on the verge of an emotional breakdown. He's an asshole. He's a liar. He's a hypocrite. And he's also... really relatable. See, as a preteen, I struggled with severe emotional issues. I had depression and anxiety, although I didn't know it yet. I was going through major emotional issues with my parents, ones far worse than teen angst. I was on the lowest rung of the social pole at school. And God, I was an asshole. I was whiny and I was a hypocrite. I knew it, too, and I cried myself to sleep thinking about it. In the daylight, I told myself everyone else was terrible and that's why my world was falling apart. I was just as hypocritical and torn up inside as Holden is. Holden is an asshole, granted. But he is an asshole that it's hard not to relate to. So all this is to say that I completely understand why so many hated this book. But it resonates with me, and with so many people I know, for the exact reason that it will be polarizing. This is the kind of book that's going to be incredibly divisive. This is the kind of book that should maybe be taught by a teacher who loves it (thanks, 9th grade English teacher who hated me.) And this is the kind of book that sticks in my head, a year after I first read it. VERDICT: I really do recommend this, even knowing at least half its readership will despise it. It's truly worth the read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,289,1,Jan 2016,Jan 2016,"Feb 02, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7933650-the-catcher-in-the-rye

I still don't really know what rating to give. First things first: the writing style is absolutely gorgeous. Nova Ren Suma uses commas to great effect, and it creates a gorgeous atmosphere and style. The magical realism element is well-done. Summarizing the plot of The Walls Around Us is impossible. It's a very complex psychological thriller about murder. But it's also a magical realism story incorporating themes of justice and group dynamics. It's often hard to know exactly what's happening. The Walls Around Us thrives in ambiguity. The book's main flaw, in fact, is its reliance in ambiguity. The ending isn't really explained, and in some ways, I liked that. I liked that there was a sense of closure but the ending was also thought-provoking. However, the ending is a little too ambiguous, verging on nonsensical. Further thoughts on character building Amber is a brilliantly crafted character, with her own secrets and her own inner sadness and moral ambiguity. She's got an amazing narrative voice which uses the plural first person. I really loved her character. The other main flaw of this book is the idea of justice as it's applied to Amber. (Major spoiler here:) (view spoiler)[Amber is a victim of physical abuse at the hands of her stepfather. At thirteen years old, she messes with the brakes on his car and is put in juvenile detention. And the justice she gets at the end of the novel? Poisoning herself and 41 other girls two days before she is to be released. This didn't work for me as a narrative choice; maybe it's just me, but I don't think she, or any of the teenagers in juvie for non-violent crimes, deserve to die. This ending is presented as justice, and it didn't work for me.  (hide spoiler)] Violet didn't draw me in nearly as much. Ori was a great character, but the fact she didn't have narrative chapters made it hard to empathize with her so much. Anyway, I really do recommend this for fans of suspense.

It wasn't the cannibal witch that bothered me. It wasn't even the selfish stepmother. For me, the real villain was Hansel and Gretel's father, a man so weak-willed, so cowardly, that he let his wicked wife send the children into the woods to die not once but twice. Don't go back, I would whisper as we approached the inevitable final illustration—happy father reunited with children, evil stepmother banished—and I was always left with a feeling of unease as I turned the last page.Above all, this collection subverts its source material in ways clever and creative and, always, compelling. If you're a fan of trope subversion, you'll love this.Also, please just look at the art. [image]// THE STORY REVIEWS# Ayama and the Thorn Wood - ★★★★★This is like a mashup of Cinderella and Beauty & the Beast. It's a story about the power of being heard in a world that wants to shut your voice off. It's brilliant, and all the stories within are even more so. # The Too-Clever Fox - ★★★★☆I can't believe a story this short managed to make my spine tingle. Here, Bardugo tells the story of a clever fox and a hunter who is just as clever. This novella reads exactly like a word-of-mouth-tale, with an archetypal trickster character and several minor plot twists. This gets a five because I happened to guess a major plot point.# The Witch of Duva - ★★★★★This is one of the best short stories I have ever read. I ended in near tears. It's filled with Leigh Bardugo vibes. You can read this here. # The Little Knife - ★★★★★Oh my god this was just beautiful? It's a story about agency, especially of women. And the last illustration is genuinely one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. # The Soldier Prince - ★★★★☆This story is eerie and heart-tingling and utterly fabulous. I adore how each fairy tale changes in vibe based on what country it originates from; this is a Kerch myth, and you can completely tell. # When Water Sang Fire - ★★★☆☆This was very good, and the artwork - especially the mermaids - was some of my favorite from the whole book. I also love the subversive nature of the retelling. But... idk, I feel somewhat baited? I thought the two girls were a couple for around ten pages when they're in fact just friends.

Both like girlsPulp is a book about Abby, a girl growing up in present-day Washington DC, and Janet, a girl growing up in the same area in the 1950s. Both like girls, and both like writing, and Janet, in the age of McCarthyism, risks it all to embrace her love of both. We follow Abby as she uncovers Janet’s past through a project on Janet’s first, and only, lesbian pulp novel. Pulp occurs in three distinct mediums, including the aforementioned lesbian pulp novel, which should feel a lot more disjointed than it actually does. It is the strong character work that holds it all together - Janet and Abby are each written as compelling characters (if not as well-rounded as I'd prefer). And yeah, some of the commentary is just a teeny tiny bit heavy handing, and yeah, the writing isn't anything particularly special, but there's something deeply special about this book in how it connects its story to the past. Our community is created by a decades-long shared experience that is as horrifying as it is beautiful and that is, in basic conceit, what Robin Talley’s Pulp attempts to explore.The thing I have discovered is that it is so easy to separate ourselves from the reality of the past that has come before us; as I typed this paper, I found myself considering which sentences to use third person pronouns for, and which ones to recognize as a part of my history. Because I was born in 2001, after Stonewall had occurred, as medication for HIV was coming into wide use, after homosexuality had been legalized in the United States. People like Janet grew up in an era where queer people were seen as perverts. Even being suspected of being queer could mean being fired from government jobs (the 1950s Lavender Scare). At the very least, it would mean being kicked out of your house. Being sent to conversion therapy was not an anomaly, but the norm — for some, it still is. And yet people like Janet still ran from home, wrote books about women loving women (though the women always had to die), found love, fell out of love, and most of all, found community. I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've realized that has to do with me, and my loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful. And so there is something so woefully and violently romantic about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others. There is something relentless and powerful about the heart it takes to be queer — to live in the shadows of the past and to work so hard in the present. To love someone in the shadows, to risk your social status and your job and your family simply to be yourself, to be alone no longer, is an inherently brave act; to be in love is brave, but to hide it and fight for it is braver. And yet at some point queerness is no longer about some grand romance, but about the freedom to be. It is so important to know our histories, but also so empowering to know our histories. I grew up among San Francisco opera singers, a fact that – yes, in fitting with stereotypes – meant I knew older gay people from a very early age. But this book, beyond any other, made me feel connected to queerness in the past and in the present — to who I am, and to my community. I think I just want to end on this note. To all of those who fought so hard in the 1950s for the lives they wanted, and all of those who fought their battles and waged their wars in the name of community – thank you. To the unnamed people who came before us, who fought wars in public and in private to find their own happiness, who found love and didn’t, who died for loving and who were arrested for being, we remember you, and we honor you: both in thought, and in having the courage to be who we are today. You last. We remember. Those who came before us could endure. And so will we.

It’s also - and this is a recurring motif in Emily Skrustkie’s work - really kickass. Hullmetal Girls follows Aisha, who sells her body to become a mechanical soldier for the chance to save her brother, and Key, a girl who wakes up in a mechanical body with no memory of how she got here - or whether she consented. As the two vie for a top spot with their squad of four, they become entangled in a vast rebellion on the ship, and are forced to question everything they know. This is a book that, first and foremost, plays off fear. And I think it’s really quite brilliant to realize such a base fear: the loss of bodily autonomy. So here’s a story: I am terrified of loss of bodily autonomy! I am also terrified of body horror. And of needles. This book presumably looked at my fears and was like “oh, go fuck yourself then” and it was a lot of fun. What’s funny is this is not a book that depends off plot - it kept me turning pages, especially at the beginning, but after around 50% of the way through, I didn’t feel totally confused as to where the plot was going - I just found myself enjoying the ride anyway. I would argue this is more of a worldbuilding-focused story. And can we just talk about how cool the world is? Very Pacific-Rim with the mechanically-enhanced copilots and the friendship focus. Very current-adult-scifi with the worldships. Very 2012 dystopia with the oppressive government and rebellion. Yet somehow, this feels like something very new; via a discussion of agency and a lack of tropey romance, it blends a mix of tropes into something that feels very original.And while the characters weren’t quite as in-your-soul as The Abyss Surrounds Us, I found them really compelling nonetheless. There are two narrators: Aisha Un-Haad, a hijabi aroace girl trying to save her sister, and Key Tanaka, a Japanese girl with her memory wiped. Key’s point of view tends to be less interesting, as she doesn’t really know what she’s trying for. Something I really like about this book is that Aisha and Tanaka are both angry, and the book does such a good job of humanizing and validating that anger. They are dealing with the loss of their autonomy, of their bodies, and with a classist system attempting to continue that takeaway. The narrative around their realization of this is brilliant, and I found myself rooting so much for them both. Although I’ll admit to liking Aisha more. Actually, can we just talk about Aisha? She is such a badass, but she’s mostly compelling because she is highly motivated - we know from chapter one of the book that she is trying for a good job so she can support her family, to the point where even if you barely give a damn about the plot, you remain desperate for her to achieve her goals. I also adored Aisha’s family. Her sister Malikah is one of my favorite characters, and her devotion to her and Amar is one of the best parts of the whole book.Hullmetal Girls is also a book primarily driven by friendship - there is no romance - and by the squad dynamic of the four scelas. And wow, I just love Aisha and Pravaa and Tanaka and Woojin’s squad so much?? Pravaa and Woojin each make for compelling leads - Pravaa is Indian, pansexual, and a trans girl, and Woojin is Korean. They’re all such likable characters that it’s hard not to get caught up in their journey.Also, I can't figure out where to put this, but Emily Skrutskie’s writing is awesome because it’s both very funny and colloquial and also has very dramatic, cinematic moments. She gets the balance just right for me. Overall, it’s a an excellent book, not just about a sci-fi world and an assortment of body horror, but about agency. The narrative is so interested in the agency of these characters, and in the loss they must experience, and in their struggle, at every moment, to wrest it back.→brief negative thoughts←So I was both… into and also vaguely disappointed by the queer rep? So at one point, it’s established that Pravaa is trans and/or intersex, which is not a source of prejudice in this world, except - and here’s the reasoning behind the and/or - it’s basically just done via saying the character had xy chromosomes and then never brought up again [my friend Acqua talked about this here]. The acearo rep is basically just as one-sided - in one scene, Aisha says she’s aroace, and Pravaa says she’s straight, and Woojin says he’s pan, and it was cool. I liked it. But I also really wish the fact that the cast is Very Queer were like. an actual part of the narrative. I think the author was trying to make all the queer rep really incidental and then went too far in the Quest For Casual Queerness and just didn't talk about it past that? I got the point, and I respect her intent especially as an ownvoices author [Skrutskie is ace and sapphic], but I wanted more :/Also, the middle is kind of boring compared to the very exciting first 25%. I guess it just didn’t quite make it to a five?But overall? Yes. This is a scifi book about agency driven by a friendship between two women of color, and I think that’s beautiful.

But a Soria miracle can only be triggered; the second step of the miracle comes when the pilgrim learns to acknowledge their inner darkness and learn from it.Maggie Stiefvater has a brand. If I were to define that brand, it would be in three things: 1) weird magical vibes and strange animal imagery, 2) small rural towns, 3) large casts of interesting side characters, 4) emotionally unavailable female leads. The main problem with this book is that it has all of her tropes, all of her best writing and imagery and some pretty decent character development, but it feels as if it lacks the emotion behind them just a little bit. ➽So… I generally think Maggie Stiefvater is absolutely great at crafting dynamic casts of side characters, and I think this trend really comes out here. I was a huge fan of the dynamics of the Soira family, but I especially adored the three Soria cousins:✔Beatriz - token emotionally unavailable female lead. Okay, no, Stiefvater keeps repeating this narrative, but it’s a really interesting narrative. Beatriz is a character struggling with acknowledging her own feelings; she is a scientist, and a talented one, but she refuses to let herself be anything else. Really liked her.✔Joaquin - an aspiring radio DJ on a pirated radio. Edgy boi who I would die for. Very amusing but also ambitious and would die for his family. I’m so proud of him.✔Daniel - the Saint and miracle-worker. An extremely caring and sweet character and I absolutely adored him and I love him.➽And besides the Sorias, there is a fantastic, compelling cast of side characters: the pilgrims. From a preacher with the head of a wolf to a woman who can do nothing but repeat the words of others, they are all here to cleanse themselves of their inner darkness, whether they know what it is or not.✔Pete - meh. I’m sorry, but of every side character in this book, I found him to be the absolute blandest.✔Tony - a former radio DJ on the run from fame and in search of a miracle. Fairly amusing.✔Marisita - Absolutely my favorite character in the whole damn book. Arc around self hatred and so much gorgeous imagery; she is covered with butterflies and tears as a result of her first miracle. I did really like all these characters. Marisita and Daniel’s romance was just freaking adorable, and the three Soria cousins have a really sweet bond. But it wasn’t enough. I guess I just didn’t really connect to any of the characters very much? They’re fine, but not amazing.I also… struggled with finding the actual heart of this story. okay, I really liked the message around generational trauma, and of course books can have the same message as each other. But I honestly kept internally comparing this to books like Wild Beauty and finding it… lacking. So let's touch on the Discourse™️. For those of you unfamiliar, a fairly serious campaign against this book occured before arcs were even released, and apparently we all just assumed it was bad because... Stiefvater wrote it? It has since come out that there were at least two lantinx sensitivity readers working on this book, and the early-on twitter claim that Stiefvater didn’t do research on latina people in the 1960s is both untrue and not backed up [especially as it was written before the books' officially release].However, while this is not blatantly awful representation, I do think it is… flawed. A major stereotype about latina girls is that they are cold & unemotional. The narrative in which an emotionally cold girl learns to love is a Stiefvater cliche [literally, an emotionally cold girl is the protagonist of both series I have read by her] and my guess is she literally did not consider the implications of using that trope for her latina lead. There is also another latina girl who narrates and does not fit this cliche at all. Beatriz is not oversexualized or fetishized, but as the lead latina girl protagonist, her being completely unemotional… does feel weird. It feels perhaps weirder because she’s learning to love via the blandest white boy in the world, which is uncomfortably white-saviory in nature. Yes, this is a Latinx story, but it centralizes white stories within its own narrative. On this topic, I completely second what Giselle said in this . I think in situations like this, we all need to find ways of discussing flawed representation with nuance and care. The systematic problem here comes not just with the desire of many non-marginalized writers to tell stories that are not their own, but with the dearth of those stories on the mainstream market. This post on magical realism and appropriation perhaps better tackles the systematic problem with white authors writing Latinx stories. And as someone is inevitably going to ask me what book does it better, this is just a friendly reminder to read Wild Beauty and Blanca Y Roja, two books by author Anna-Marie McLemore that tackle queer latinx identity and generational trauma. There definitely are better aspects. The imagery is really great. I absolutely adored the thing she wanted / thing she feared character intros: they were the highlights of the book for me. The audiobook fucking rocks; the narrator is latino, and did a fantastic job of character voices. And in general, there’s a very magical vibe to this book, almost otherworldly but grounded by characters we relate to. I loved the wide scope of the Soria family and how positive and loving their dynamic was. Yet they still feel like a flawed, dynamic family. The trio of Soria cousins are great. There are a lot of great ideas. I do really love how Stiefvater plays with language and metaphor; it’s a lot of fun, and I’m sure you could annotate this for just her wordplay till the end of time.But overall, I just found this to be… okay. And I definitely preferred The Scorpio Races and The Raven Cycle to this.

Unfortunately, I don't feel as if it deserves the full five - there were too many issues. But I want to make it clear to everyone that this comes as recommended as most of my fives. I want to get the issues out of the way first. The first half is really, really confusing. The pacing is just a little off; events feel slightly manufactured due to the confusion. But Hodge managed to keep me fairly engaged and interested, even when I was confused. My advice would be to push through the first 150 pages if they confuse you, because it is DEFINITELY worth it. The plot massively improves in the second half, with a few twists I didn’t see coming. Now, let’s talk everything amazing about the book. I LOVED RACHELLE. I cannot overexaggerate just how compelling I found her character. She has a good balance between overpowered and incompetent; she makes mistakes and she doesn’t always succeed, but she’s smart as a whip and tough as nails. She’s not merciless, but she’s also not afraid to kick ass or lie when she needs to. She’s confident and solid in herself, but also hates the darkness inside her. This is such an interesting, perfect balance. She’s very unlikable at times, but her character feels so realistic that it’s easy to ignore.“She didn't even look at me,” said Erec, his voice mock sad. “I wonder what I've done to offend her?”“Breathing, I think,” said Rachelle. “But also wearing that jacket.” I can totally understand why the romance plots annoyed some, but it drew me completely in. There is a love triangle, but it’s used entirely for character development. It is clear from the beginning which guy is right for Rachelle, and which one is wrong, but we also see why she likes both of them. (view spoiler)[I saw one  mention her quick jump in with the other guy as a negative, and I honestly have to disagree. That action absolutely fits into her character arc as I viewed it. (hide spoiler)]The plot between Rachelle and Armand was awesome. I feel the same way about this romance plot as I did about the romance from Daughter of Smoke and Bone; yes, there's a wiff of instalove, but their relationship dynamic is compelling. The author gives reasons for their relationship; they understand each other and work well together. I found myself invested only 200 pages in. I liked that Armand was disabled but it doesn't hold him back; it's always great to see positive rep. Hodge also deserves praise for her prose. She depicts setting very well. While the worldbuilding isn’t completely the focus here, the descriptions of the city and the forest worked perfectly for me. I almost wish more time was spent in the city, because my mental image of it was beautiful. VERDICT: Despite some disengagement in the first half, this book manages to land solidly on its feet with excellent character work, a twisty plot, and a sweet romance. While it's messy at times, I highly recommend this.

They’d sold their children a pack of lies: God and country. Love your parents. All is fair. And then they’d sent those boys, her brother, off to fight a great monster of a war that maimed and killed and destroyed whatever was inside them. Still they lied, expecting her to mouth the words and play along. Well, she wouldn’t. She knew now that the world was a long way from fair. She knew the monsters were real.I thought once books surpassed 500 pages, they just couldn’t be that exhilarating anymore. I have been proven very, very wrong. Though it's marketed as historical paranormal, I'd classify The Diviners more as a nonstop, action-packed suspense novel. One thing's for sure: this book is nothing like any I've read before. With gorgeous writing, compelling characters, and a creepy plot, The Diviners was so much fun. The people made idols and tore them down again, baptizing them in ticker tape parades, blessing them in long tears of profit and loss, throwaway tributes tossed with abandon from tall windows, a celebration of the good times that seem as if they will never stop, the land a fatted calf.What stands out to me when I think about The Diviners is the atmosphere. It's hard to build an unputdownable book out of 570 pages, but this book is so completely engaging. Despite the marketing, The Diviners is not a single pov novel - it follows a cast of characters, all with points of view. There's Evie, a flapper learning to grow up in New York City. Mabel, a loyal friend and source of future character development. Memphis, a black teen trying to deal with his own guilt over his past and protect his brother Isaac. Theta, a kickass and brazen dancer. Henry, her kind piano player roommate and definitely not her boyfriend. Sam, a fuckboy and thief. And Jericho, a very grumpy and very guarded angel. And with all these characters comes a great deal of theme work. With an exploration of racism, generational splits, feminism, and religion, this book is so meaningful. “There is nothing more terrifying than the absoluteness of one who believes he's right.”I am also, as is usual with first series books, super excited about this story's potential. I'm excited for the found family potential and for all the baited character development. A ton of characters, like Evie and Mabel, are clearly being set up for extensive character arcs. Depending on how I feel about Lair of Dreams, this might very well turn out to be one of my most recommended books.

Almost everything about this book is awesome, but the writing is stunning. It is ""I will remember this for the rest of my life"" stunning. I genuinely do not remember the last time I read a book written so beautifully. I wanted to highlight every other sentence but I didn't want to put it down because it was so. fucking. engaging. I am going to read every single thing Amy Rose Capetta publishes for the rest of her life. You can't stop me. // LET'S BEGIN ANALYZING THIS MASTERPIECE♔ OH MY GOD THE LEADS. Zara and Eli are both such well-developed and compelling characters. Zara is a surprisingly down-to-earth daydreamer desperately attached to her play. Eli is the more cynical of the two, with a passion for lighting and a deep love of the theater.Also, quick note about diversity - our two leads are a chubby Jewish bi girl who states that she's bi on the fucking page and a Puerto Rican lesbian with short dyed hair. Okay, okay, I just loved them both so much and I'm so happy about the rep being so good. ♚ God, the romance??Echo wants Ariston so quickly and so completely because she’s already fallen in love. She’s been hollowing out a place inside herself for years —and he fits.I've been thinking a lot recently about how to make a fast-flowing romance work, and I think this book has given me the solution. Up until now, the only instaromance I've ever truly loved has been that of Laini Taylor's Daughter of Smoke and Bone. You know what those books have in common? They establish why these two characters could possibly fall so fast. Here, we explicitly see the loneliness of the romantic leads, how they both want someone in their lives. Instalove isn't bad because it's instant - it's bad because it's unbelievable. And okay, yes, sometimes instalove is bad because it's forced, but trust me - this was not forced. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT STATUE SCENE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT LIGHTING SCENE. Zara and Eli have so much chemistry. There are so many tiny moments where you can feel the heart-arresting sensation of first love. The writing is just that vivid. [image][follow laya for more Extremely Gay Art!!]♔ I liked the And Then There Were None-esque whodunnit aspect. Echo after Echo builds up so many different characters that it's hard to know where to turn for suspects. Yet in a strange way, you don't want the culprit to be any of them. Not after the buildup. There's Roscoe, the eccentric soundboard operator. There's Etta, washed-up dame, and Carl, her first husband. There's Kestrel, Zara's bitter and mysterious roommate. There's Meg, the assistant director, and Adrian, the star-power male lead. And of course, there's the head of the whole show - Leopold, our mysterious director. I found all these characters super intriguing, and they certainly felt very developed for side characters. ♚ Art. I can feel Capetta's love for the theater world bleeding through the pages, and I am so freaking thankful for it. As a theater nerd myself, I've seldom felt the true joy and feeling of acting and performing conveyed so well. ♔ I touched on this a bit earlier, but I loved the parallels between the stage show and real life. The entire book just felt very meta and interesting due to all its symbolism. And thankfully, Capetta didn't feel the need to throw it in your face!! I've read several YA books recently that felt the need to explicitly run the reader through every single moment of symbolism, and damn, am I glad this book avoided doing that very thing. I felt far more respected by the author as a result. ♚ I do have to say that the pacing varied. This is very much a slow-burn novel, and I have to say that I never felt that true desperation to finish I'd expected in the latter half. It's not necessarily a bad thing - it just means more focus on character building - but it's something I wish I could've known going in. VERDICT: There's so much I loved about this - the character arcs, the atmospheric writing, the theatrical aspects, the romance. God, it was just so good. I hope all of you get a chance to read this, because it is truly one of the year's gems.

This is really all I want out of fantasy; developed characters, interesting subversions of done-before tropes, and sapphic girls.In terms of retellings, this is one of the more imaginative ones I’ve read. I can’t really spoil how!! But really, the new elements added were so delightful and creative, yet stick to the spirit of the tale. With one exception, obviously, for Mina and Lynet’s relationshhip. This book’s chief strength is the character work. Mina’s character arc is extremely well-written and developed. Her character isn’t so much morally ambiguous as troubled and self-hating but I found her combination of self-hatred and confidence so realistic. Lynet isn’t quite as fabulous a character, but she’s still easy to connect to and fun to see on page. I like her inner strength and bravery. There are two romantic relationships here, one of which occurs between two girls. Their relationship was cute and not instalovey, which is awesome, but I unfortunately wasn’t totally blown away. While they’re cute, it takes a lot of character work for me to really get invested. The secondary relationship actually enticed me more, probably because I liked Mina more. It’s not a new favorite book, sadly; despite my love for the characters, I found the actual plotline slightly underwhelming. I wanted something more, something darker. There's not enough worldbuilding or real intrigue for my taste. This book might’ve been able to get deeper with a full series. Standalones just can't get much deeper than this.

This book means the world to me.[Also, THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY. I literally do not remember the last time I enjoyed reading a book so much. Even my reading slump couldn't conquer this book. After I got off my slump-creating kindle and on to the hardcover copy I read at the bookstore, I read this in less than 24 hours. YES.]Just to be clear: I love pretty much everything about this book. It's fantastically paced, especially for such a long book - I mean, it broke my reading slump. It's hilarious - I laughed out loud multiple times. The romance is adorable and has some of the best development I've read in YA. Monty's character development was 10/10. The holy trinity at the center of the book is a ton of fun. Maybe I'll even talk more about this later and add something to this . But you know what? You can find a thousand s about how cool everything in this book is. I want to talk about why this book was worth reading for me. There are two things - no, three things - about this book that I think are really special. First of all, Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue is hilarious, but not so light as to be flimsy. Not to shade every other book ever but this is 1) my niche category of favorite book and 2) a balance I think most books fail at; either we get books that are nothing but fluff, or books that are nothing but tragedy. This book is neither. It's dark, but it's also hopeful. When a book feels too light, it's escapist; when it feels too dark, it's depressing. This book made me feel like the universe doesn't suck too much. Just because people are survivors of abuse or trauma doesn't mean we always need to be in a world of angst.Secondly - I feel like such a pretentious asshole - I love the themes here about not needing to be cured to be an important person. You have no idea how rare it is for chronically ill / disabled / neuroatypical people to be treated as whole, to be treated as real. This book really explores the fact that Percy doesn't want to be cured; he just wants to be treated like a full person. I have never read a book that even mentioned this feeling. It was... perfect. God, I can't put every emotion I felt about this into a full sentence. Just... if you're looking for this theme, please pick this book up. Third, and maybe most important; this is historical fiction about people who don't get historical fiction. People love to declaim about how the historical fiction genre doesn't need diversity because, apparently, the only people who existed back then were white, straight, and abled. Which is serious bullshit. People like us have always existed; we just don't get books, especially historical fiction. Seeing representation like this in historical fiction is seriously new and it means the fucking WORLD to me. The great tragic love story of Percy and me is neither great nor truly a love story, and is tragic only for its single-sidedness. It is also not an epic monolith that has plagued me since boyhood, as might be expected. Rather, it is simply the tale of how two people can be important to each other their whole lives, and then, one morning, quite without meaning to, one of them wakes to find that importance has been magnified into a sudden and intense desire to put his tongue in the other’s mouth.And yet simultaneously it's so sweet. Like, someone tell me why this book invented romance and being in love. This is a cute historical romcom focusing on people who don't get historical fiction because the world used to hate us. It's adorable and hilarious and important and I had so much fun reading it. And this part from the author's note made me cry:— Which begs the question - would a long term relationship between two English men during the eighteenth century have been a real possibility? I don't know. They likely would not have been able to be open about it. But the optimist in me likes to believe that the twenty-first century is not the first time in history that queer people have been able to live full romantic and sexual lives with the people they love.And if that makes me anachronistic, so be it.God bless.And yes, I agree with this.Blog | Goodreads| Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,521,2,"Mar 11, 2018Jun 30, 2017","Mar 13, 2018Jul 2017","Jan 24, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29283884-the-gentleman-s-guide-to-vice-and-virtue

Perhaps in its rush to be gritty, A Good Idea goes too far - given the s, I’m sure some readers were so bothered by the constant drug use and brutality that the story loses its full impact. And I have to say I understand that point of view - some of the brutality got overdone.But I love the questions asked here. As I said earlier, the mystery of whodunit isn’t relevant - the mystery of whydunit is far more important. And perhaps even more important - at what time do the good guys become just as bad as the killers? And in combination with our character weirdness - this story is so, so nuanced. We are not following the town heroes - we are following the town outcasts. Lead character Fin is a former member of the town, angry at the town, and does a ton of crap. New girlfriend Serena is a victim of conversion therapy possibly even angrier. Best friend Owen is the town drug dealer. And then there’s Calder, the murderer. No, that’s not a fakeout. But as the story goes on, we’re forced to question: was it Calder who killed her? Or was it the whole town?Having Fin as the narrator of this tale is a brilliant choice - she is the one character who was not there, the one character who did not witness Betty’s breakdown. And while I didn’t necessarily like Fin at every point of the book, she is definitely a compelling narrator for the tale - and I have to admit, by the end I couldn't help rooting for her. Perhaps what got to me most about this book was how it completely avoided narrative punishment. We see things from Fin's completely biased point of view, yet the narrative itself is strangely empathetic to every character. No character is a complete caricature, not even the book's technical villain, and it is this fact that makes the side characters so compelling. Big shoutout to Owen, Serena, Charlotte, and Calder for being horrible characters who I love so much. Possibly my one comment would be that there are a lot of mentions of a character who is Canadian and essentially is one of those white people who claims they are Native when they are definitely not. The commentary feels derisive, and the book isn’t exactly breaking form in using subtle criticism rather than explicit criticism. But I still think this commentary would’ve felt a lot less weird if one of the leads actually were native. But on the whole, I thought this book was brilliant, with an ending I absolutely adored.

It never feels like she's making fun of boy band fangirls or people who fight for social justice, even when she writes parodies. In fact, her two parodies so far have sent a positive message about their respective groups. Part of her positive message comes from the fact that she writes from the point of view of an actual character inside that sect of people. Her parodies feel like loving fun rather than fitting into the “lmao, those sjws” type of humor. That's what sets them apart. In No Good Deed, Moldavsky managed to poke fun at the more toxic elements of mainstream social justice culture... while also endorsing the social justice movement. Which is quite an achievement, honestly. She pokes fun at the way racism pops up in the movement. And her parody of the men's rights movement is perfect. But this is a poignant story too, with good characters and a great message. Ashley is a sweet character, and while she's a bit out there, she also comes off as very human. And Moldavsky really points out the importance of the social justice movement, which I was exceptionally pleased about. Basically my only issue was the book's weird pacing. This book transitions well from funny to poignant. However, there are thirty-page sections where nothing funny happens and then thirty-page sections where it's a laugh a minute. The pacing is just a bit messy.However, this book is absolutely redeemed by how fucking hilarious it is. The humor might not work for everyone, but it sure works for me. “I'm Poe.”“Like Kung Fu Panda?”“Like Edgar Allan.”Thanks to my local bookstore for allowing me to borrow the arc!...more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,"Feb 19, 2017","Feb 20, 2017","Jan 24, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32309404-no-good-deed

Please read this essay talking about Lila Bard and narrative agency it's smart and I'm exhaustedRhy's character development is so awesome. In the first book, he was an okay character, but in this second book I loved him with every fiber of my heart. He's got some hidden depths and he's so interesting and funny. The side characters killed me too, of course. Alucard is funny and a ton of fun. Holland is so morally bankrupt and yet I love him so, so much. God, I love every character in this book so much. Someone please punch me in the face. PART TWO: RELATIONSHIPSAlternate Title: mecryingharder.mp3There's kind of a love square going on here, and it makes the book even better. I know that sentence sounds contradictory. But trust me, there's no annoying love triangle here. There are complex dynamics between characters, but it's not for drama. V.E. Schwab does an incredible job with the platonic relationships here. I especially loved Lila and Alucard's banter. The romance is built up very subtly and not the major focus. But oh damn, is it well written. Lila and Kell are a very well-built couple, and V.E. Schwab drew out the plot enough that I was begging for them to interact. That's talent. Please just let them be happy. I just want all of them to be happy. Damn it. PART THREE: PLOTTING AND WRITINGAlternate Title: meSCREAMING.mp3V.E. Schwab's writing is gorgeous as always. Her talent for describing setting especially stands out here. Usually I can't picture any settings in books, but I have such clear mental images of every moment of this book. And it never feels forced at all! The plot is twisty and interesting. Saying anything about it is a spoiler, but I had so many emotions here. To be fair, I guessed one of the major twists, but I had been spoiled about an aspect of it, so that's not the books' fault at all. However, the lack of direction to the plot in the first half bothered me. On one hand, I loved the extended character work and worldbuilding in the first half. On the other hand, none of the characters had any clear goal until around page 250, and the plot felt slightly less driven as a result. This is a complaint I had about book one as well. All in all, I absolutely loved this. I worship Schwab to such a high degree.

I didn't enjoy it at all but... it was still a good book? How do I even explain this. The Art of Starving is an incredibly raw book about eating disorders. It incorporates magical realism seamlessly into the plot. The writing style flows well. Emotion drips from the pages. Each character is developed and intriguing. And yet... there's something missing here. Part of this must be the haphazard plot, with the protagonist changing goals and tactics on the fly. Part of this might just be the sheer oddness of the book. Whatever the reason, I felt disconnected from this story. SOME MORE SPECIFIC NOTESThe romantic storyline is somewhat cute. The two of them have good dialogue and relationship buildup. I had one major, major issue– at one point, one of the boys tried to pressure the other into sex. It's kind of addressed, but it's glossed over more than I was comfortable with. Also, a personal complaint: the body horror here went too far. I don't want to read about bleeding nails and pigs being skinned from the inside out. Don't pretend you do, either. A PERSONAL NOTE FOR DISCUSSIONI really like the trend of stories where protagonists get their happy endings but break up with the love interest. However, I've noticed that this almost exclusively happens in lgbt novels. This is actually the second book like this that I read this week (the other one being Little Wrecks). I can list far too many examples: Gallery of Unfinished Girls, If You Could Be Mine, Huntress, Tricks, and even Openly Straight. It fits into the “gay-people-don't-get-happy-endings“ trope far more than I want it to. I just feel like there's so little happy lgbt romance that sad lgbt romance isn't what the genre needs right now. This is by no means a complaint about either The Art of Starving, Little Wrecks, or any of the other books on this list; they are all books I enjoyed. Gallery of Unfinished Girls especially is one of the best books I read this year (add it to your tbr!!). It just feels like a trope at this point.

First things first: this book has weird prose. I still can't decide whether I liked the writing style. At points, there's almost too much purple prose and the metaphors killed me a bit, but there are also points where the prose personally murdered me and left me near tears. I think the writing style is going to be very divisive between readers. The thing is, the writing style can't bother me, because everything else about this book was so pitch-perfect. Little Wrecks stands out mainly because of the character work. Isabelle is reckless and independent and desperate to get out of this town no matter what. Ruth, my personal favorite, is desperate to avoid her mother's fate. She loves her mother for being kind, but hates her for being more like a best friend and less like a mom. Ruth does some terrible things, lives through the consequences, and comes out stronger. Her character arc is very, very strong. Magda wants to save her brother and her best friends from themselves. She comes off as stern and level-headed compared to her two reckless friends, but she's also desperate to be loved. All three of these characters are developed and relatable.These characters would've almost certainly made me give this book a 4.5, were it not for the unnecessarily sad ending. Keep in mind here that I usually prefer happy endings after dark character studies, and I don't like tragedy as a story format. The ending wasn't an explicit tragedy– it's really only terrible for one character. I just feel like a lot was wasted with that ending. These characters spend 300 pages growing and changing, and yet one of them ends up meeting a tragic end anyway. It doesn't work for me.Still, this book is absolutely recommended.div17: latinx mc...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Feb 17, 2017","Feb 19, 2017","Jan 24, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32497743-little-wrecks

This update is my constant everlasting mood.“Leo could turn a part of himself without losing the whole.Because there was no whole left.Nothing human.”But really, what makes this so great is the fact that the whole book, the entire thing, is based off the monster vs. human conflict. August is a monster who is ashamed of it and wants to be human. Kate is a human who has spent so long attempting to twist herself into something monstrous that she has lost herself.

Ignore my rating, because I am full of mixed feelings right now.It's not that this was a bad boo**Minor spoilers ahead, but I'm not naming any names. Ignore my rating, because I am full of mixed feelings right now.It's not that this was a bad book by any means. Maybe my expectations were too damn high. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood to have my heart totally broken. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that when I picked up this book, I was expecting a significant romantic aspect. Well... it's there. And it's good! Until the end. And then it freaking sucks and ruined this book for me. Because I'm annoying like that, let's start with the romance and all the ways it failed. • This is a 300-page book, and an entirely separate romantic plotline pops up at page 250. Do you understand how bitter I am typing this? This book spends at least 50% of page time on one specific love interest. Their relationship is slow-building and incredibly compelling. Except it all goes to shit in the space of about five pages, and suddenly another romance pops up out of fucking nowhere at the 250-page mark, as a plot twist. This wasn't me being unobservant, the existence of this other romance is literally a plot twist. This isn't even the first time this has happened in Silvera's books– romance-as-a-plot-twist happens in BOTH of them. After so much great relationship development with another character, it especially doesn't work here. This entire book focuses around two relationships, and then suddenly it's all about an entirely different relationship. • And that's not to say I didn't find the third romantic plotline sweet, because I did. I just felt incredibly let down. The twist should have happened earlier, or even better, the two characters should have interacted much more in the first half of the book. The two characters in question BARELY interact beforehand. It's such an ubrupt ship change, when I was already on board with ship #1. Who does this? There's also the fact that the THIRD love interest (yes, there are THREE) is not developed much. Of course, I can understand why that was; maybe because, as I've mentioned about five times now, HE SHOWS UP FIFTY PAGES BEFORE THE END. Not that the third couple weren't cute, it was just. so. abrupt. There's no relationship development. • The relationship with the second love interest breaks down rather abruptly after a lot of buildup. They fuck up their relationship, and this leads them to suddenly ignore their budding romance and their previous friendship. It didn't work for me. It seemed altogether too sudden. I don't even get the point of having a ship change at all. • Everything about this romantic storyline could've been ignored if the characters held up, but to me, Silvera's characters always seem more defined by their relationships than by their personalities. They're not uncompelling characters, but I don't feel about them the way so many others on my feed seem to. The relationships in this book will stay with me forever, but I don't think the characters are staying with me more than a week. Maybe Silvera's character work is just not for me.• I can't handle how Silvera's book endings. I'm a person who likes her sad books to come with emotionally cathartic endings, and the ending didn't deliver for me. My issue with the ending to More Happy Than Not was the tragedy. My issue with this book's ending is the anticlimactic nature of it. Partially, I was so disappointed in the plot twist that I couldn't even make myself feel happy at the ending. This ending didn't feel deserved. I don't know, that twist really did ruin this book for me. SO. Given how important to the story the relationship element was, I had a lot of complaints. But there were some incredible things about this book, and I don't want to give the impression this was a bad reading experience. GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK• The gorgeous writing! Adam Silvera's prose is just so good. It's gorgeous and understated and absolutely perfect for this story. • The representation of OCD was very sympathetic without romanticizing mental illness. Which is sadly kind of a rare balance. There's no curing Griffin's OCD, but there is treatment. That aspect of the book was great. • Silvera's relationship crafting is excellent. You know, when it actually happens rather than occurring as a plot twist.I'm especially disappointed because up to around page 225 I was REALLY loving this. But I just can't give this four stars when the romantic plotline disappointed me so much.

We'd rather have a lie than a question that we can never know the answer to.”This book is deeply psychologically terrifying. There aren't any jump scares; this book plays on your deepest fears, the fears hiding below ""getting your hands brutally chopped off"". There are worse things; being trapped, being abused, seeing your parents turn against you as you are the only one who can seem to see reason. The Sacred Lies of Minnow Bly follows Minnow, a girl who has just escaped from a cult and, panicked from her experiences, brutally kicked a drunk man she didn't know. She's told that if she tells the truth of what she's seen, she'll be allowed to go free. And it's also vaguely, according to the glorious Cait, a retelling of The Girl Without Hands by the Brothers Grimm. And that's... all I'm going to say, because this is a book that you need to go into mostly blind. It's a weird and enrapturing and terrifying book. Besides the deep psychological terror, what stood out to me about this book was Minnow. Abused, lying, manipulative, desperate Minnow. Needless to say, I adored her; I was so invested in her struggle by the end of my journey that I couldn't let go. “I think you should be angry if you're angry. But it's also true that hate has a way of hurting you more than the person you're hating.”It's interesting; I don't feel there was any huge twist or shocking reveal. It's just slow-burn terror leading to an ending that may not shock you, but will definitely leave you emotional. At its heart, this book is a claustrophobic journey of trauma and healing, and one that will stay with me for a very long time.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,90,1,"Oct 16, 2017","Oct 17, 2017","Jan 24, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17185496-the-sacred-lies-of-minnow-bly

I always love stories where the good guys triumph, but are pretty devious in how they actually win. I love stories that are terrifying and desperate but end with hope. I LOVED how many stories here fit that category. I loved how these stories were dark and terrible but didn't feel the need to be one-note about it. I really can't recommend this story collection enough.The Birds of Azalea Street by Nova Ren Suma - ★★★★☆ This seriously nailed atmospheric writing. Look no further for creepy. I liked the themes and honestly think the only problem was the short length. In The Forest Dark and Deep by Carrie Ryan - ★★★★☆ Carrie Ryan has a talent for suspense and dramatic tension; this just got creepier and creepier. It's also an interesting take on Alice and Wonderland. I think it was almost too odd for me. I still liked it a lot, though. Emmeline by Cat Winters - ★★★★☆ Again, weird, but I enjoyed reading this. There’s a very slow reveal of what exactly is happening, and the atmosphere is done perfectly, but I predicted the twist a bit too easily.Verse Chorus Verse by Leigh Bardugo - ★★★☆☆ There’s a celebrity mom and her daughter and some interesting themes about fame and of course I worship Leigh Bardugo’s writing, but the ending was not explained well enough for my taste. I was loving this so much and then the ending just... fizzed. Hide and Seek by Megan Shephard - ★★★★★I LOVED this story, about a girl who plays hide and seek with death. The ending is completely awesome. And the protagonist is also great! It's a fast-paced story that never lets go. The Dark, Scary Parts and All by Danielle Paige - ★★★★★I’ve seen a lot of people disliked this, but I personally loved the shit out of it. The beginning is not incredible, yeah, but it gets better. The brief character arc and the quotes were so GOOD. I especially loved the protagonist; she's an interesting take on the i'm-not-like-other-girls type. Haven't we all wanted to read a villain arc for a dislikable high school student? Maybe that's just me. The ending worked well in context, but I think I would have preferred if she had **chosen her own destiny**. The Flicker, The Fingers, The Beat, The Sigh by April Genevieve Tucholk - ★★☆☆☆ Boring and overdone concept. And I wasn't creeped out. I just felt really bad for all the main characters, horrible as they might have been. Fat Girl With A Knife by Jonathan Mayberry - ★★★☆☆Eh? I liked the ending of this, but it was kind of boring. The issue here is the total lack of atmosphere. There is no dramatic tension whatsoever. Sleepless by Jay Kristoff - ★★★★★Holy shit.M by Stefan Bachmann - ★★★★☆This one isn't nearly as creepy and atmospheric; it's more thematic and funny. There are some good quotes and themes about the blindness of the soul. It was mainly just flat-out fun to read. I liked Misha and Kirsten a lot. And the ending was!! The Girl Without A Face by Marie Lu - ★★★★★What the fuck is happening in Marie Lu’s brain and why does it turn out so brilliantly on page??The Girl Who Dreamed Of Snow by McCormick Templeman - ★★★★☆I liked this, but I can’t put my finger on exactly what made it good. It's a bit of a fantasy story with great atmosphere, but mainly it’s just a story that makes you think. Stitches by A.G. Howard - ★★★★★ I loved this SO MUCH? I loved how hopeful the ending was.

The utter wrongness of it, the way it won't fit in my head, keeps coming back to me again and again, as if I've only just learned about it. The Scorpio Races is about man-eating horses, but it's more about finding where you belong. Here, two very different people try to hold onto the things they love most, even as their world spins around them. Maggie Stiefvater's writing style is just as gorgeous as ever. She manages to fit so many emotions into such short paragraphs without having to tell anything. It's all shown. As is usual with her books, I only realized how invested I was in these characters when the book hit the conclusion. These two leads were both well-crafted characters. Puck is strong and sassy and utterly believable. The relationship between Sean and his horse, Corr, especially slayed me. Even side characters like Finn are instantly believable with strong voices. There's also a great romance between the two leads. No instalove to be found here– they go from reluctant friends to allies to something more. They fit together like puzzle pieces, and I love that– how they make each other better.  I think every now and then about Sean's thumb pressed against my wrist and daydream about him touching me again. But mostly I think about the way he looks at me — with respect — and I think that's probably worth more than anything.I've only recently begun to realize the importance of setting in books, and The Scorpio Races definitely benefits from setting. The island is at once rugged and wild and claustrophobic and terrifying and beautiful. These characters love the island so much that even in moments of fear and terror, the island is lovely. I had such a vivid picture of the island in my head by the end. Essentially my only complaint is that this book takes too long to get going. Yes, I love slow-build plots as much as the next person, and the slow-build plot works to its best here. But I still spent around half the book wanting things to just get going. Adjust your expectations— this story is a slow build to a brilliant conclusion, not a fast-paced ride. The ending makes every moment worth it, though. The last chapter genuinely made me cry. What an emotional, perfectly-written section. That section alone gets five stars from me. This is a completely different story than the Raven Cycle, but it worked for the same reasons the Raven cycle worked, so I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoyed that book....more",Notes are private!,0,120,1,"Mar 19, 2017","Mar 25, 2017","Jan 24, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15827344-the-scorpio-races

I just wanted to point out that it's very... typical. The first two scenes are the protagonist receiving of her magical powers and her training with a love interest. These scenes are in literally every book. She's the chosen one, of course, but her life is hard anyway. Why? A forgettable reason of some kind. The protagonist is kind of an arrogant ass. I don't know how to put it better. She comes off spoiled and rude, and not in an I'm-a-lovable-antiheroine way. She's just kind of a jerk for no reason, but she has the right to be because she's so special. like Mare Barrow if you took away any of her remaining interesting traits. The obvious romantic interest shows up on page ten, and of course he's a jerk, but there's still time to describe his appearance. That's bad in itself, to be quite honest. The romance might improve, but then again, it might not. The writing style is not that great. It's emotionless and flat-out dull. It could've just been the introduction, but I'm not someone who gets annoyed by writing style this quickly, and this drove me crazy. Again, all these flaws could be fixed. They could be.

Full disclosure: I loved this book with my entire heart two years ago. I don't trust 13-year-old me as far as I can throw her, but I have clear enough memories of this book that I feel confident in my assessment. POSITIVES• Young's world is genuinely frightening. There's an element of confusion here; yes, we want to “save” teens from depression, but how could that ever justify surveillance and stealing their memories? These characters have done nothing wrong; they're simply depressed. You're propelled to continue by pure anger at the unfairness of it all. • You're also motivated to continue by a series of creative plot twists. The plot here is tight from when Sloane gets into the center to when she leaves the center. Her gradual loss of memory is terrifying and poignant. The other sections of plot leave something to be desired, but given that 70% of the book takes place inside the hospital, Sloane's journey was exceptional. • The Program has a genuinely well-written romance. Sloane and James begin the book as a couple, but they're so sweet and loving towards each other that by the end, you really believe they love each other. • While the characters are nothing special, perhaps, Sloane is a likable and believable lead. She's a realistic teenager, but she never comes across as ridiculous or stupid. Her decisions make sense and her struggle is believable. • That epilogue! Not exactly a cliffhanger, but an incredibly enticing prologue to the next story. NEGATIVES• The explanation as to how The Program came into existence doesn't make ANY sense. You're telling me that teens just suddenly starting committing suicide? But WHY did they do that? How did that happen? Without any answers, this world becomes far less terrifying. • Love as a cure for memory loss is stupid. Not to call bullshit on an early 2000s romantic dystopian novel, but that's complete bullshit. • The love triangle here is terrible. There's a clear first choice; a kind, caring, funny guy who clearly loves Sloane just as much as she loves him. And then there's his competition, the shadiest dude I've ever met, who Sloane doesn't even seem to like. He likes her and that's it. It's gross and he's invasive to her privacy and I hated him. • This book is just so typical. What does this book do that a thousand other books haven't done? Maybe the scary worldbuilding and airtight memory-loss narrative could've made it worth reading, as in Lauren Miller's Free to Fall. Unfortunately, the plot holes take away much of the fear and subtract from from the emotional punch this book delivers. Recommended to anyone looking for a fun, action-packed dystopia. But not for anyone looking for their next favorite....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,Jan 2014,Jan 2014,"Jan 24, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16002428-the-program

Cute contemporary, romance between two girls, ownvoices racial rep... yeah, it sounded great to me too. But I had so many issues with this book. THE GOOD + The first half is genuinely really cute! I actually loved the first half. Jamie and Sana have some great romantic buildup before they get together. There's an insta-crush, but things progress very well from there. They exchange poetry and are just generally incredibly sweet. + There's a good portrayal of racism between different nonwhite communities, which is really rare in YA! This book did not shy away from heavy topics. I definitely appreciated that. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how well it was all executed. THE BAD + Half of the moments between Jamie and Sana have a time jump. Look, I'm sorry, but I'm here for the lesbians, and if that storyline isn't pulling its weight, what exactly am I here for? + The plotting and actual handling of issues is a complete mess, especially in the second half. The author wanted to fit several different difficult storylines in, and they didn't tie together, and some of the issues ended up coming off badly just because they didn't get enough page time. For example, Sana's issues with anti-latina racism are really not handled very well. Not because the author didn't have the best intentions at heart, but because they don't get enough pagetime. + I can't handle cheating storylines. As soon as the cheating popped up, this book immediately went from a solid 3 to a 2. I don't see why a cheating storyline was necessary in a supposedly cute and fluffy book about teens falling in love. I have issues surrounding cheating, and I am almost never willing to ship a couple when one cheats on the other. But you know what, whatever.

This is, in ahere I am ing this play exactly 420 years since it came out.... it's what Beatrice and Benedick would've wantedSo... the thing is. This is, in all honesty, the play that got me into Shakespeare. I saw that Kenneth Branagh / Emma Thompson movie of it when I was maybe eight years old and I loved it so much (although I will point out that no adaptation has really understood the vibe of these characters so well as the David Tennant / Catherine Tate edition), and so that's why you can hate on this play for making me so obnoxious all the time. I am, however, still particularly obnoxious about this specific play. This is a Shakespearean comedy that essentially has the central message ""respecting women is the only true way to be a romantic hero"" and also is still hysterically funny and also contains Unbearable Tenderness™️ and for that, we have to stan.“O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart in the marketplace” is absolutely one of the most fucking hardcore lines in any Shakespeare play and had more impact on me than the entire Star Wars franchise. It's a line that is powerful because it feels out of place: it is shockingly violent, impossible not to deliver with a snarl — quite literally — and perhaps most importantly, it is an uncriticized line said by a woman in a play written in 1598. Everything Beatrice says in this play Fucks. Beatrice invented feminism and made me the dyke I am today. At one point Beatrice accuses Benedick of having lost four of his five brain cells which, hilariously, means that Shakespeare was the original creator of the last brain cell meme. The plotline of this play is just Beatrice roasting everyone around her especially Benedick and it's wonderful. Must movies be good is it not enough to see Beatrice roasting everyone in the dark, huge. The other plotline of this play is that misogyny is awful and ruins your life.I'm not kidding. From this one Much Ado About Nothing analysis I think about a lot:Don John is not the true villain of this play; he is merely an agent. The real villain of Much Ado About Nothing is the culture of misogyny in Messina.This play begins and ends with the men assuming their wives are about to sleep around on them. Leonato jokes about his own wife doing so; Claudio allows this assumption to cloud his judgement; even Benedick jokes to this effect. So as soon as any implication of Hero's infidelity is made, rather than ask or confront or find alibis, Claudio assumes the worst: that she has slept with another man the night before their wedding. The captain of the guard agrees with him; her father, when he hears this, goes along with it as well. Benedick is the only male character in the play, including Hero's literal father, who defends Hero in any way from the false accusations. The romantic lead to Beatrice, a character who we have earlier seen making misogyny-tinged jokes to get a rise out of her, is the only man who believes a woman. But from that same analysis: ...“Kill Claudio” [is] less a demand that Benedick murder his friend and more a plea that he break with the toxic culture of male camaraderie. And Benedick agrees. In the midst of a play saturated with jokes about women’s volubility and defined by the rejection of a supposedly unfaithful woman, he then makes the monumental decision to trust Beatrice. He listens to her when she grieves and finally asks her a single question: “Think you, in your soul that Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?” When she replies in the affirmative, her word is all the proof he needs to part with the prince and challenge his best friend.Benedick's relevance as a romantic hero is proven narratively by the fact that he believes Hero when she says she hasn't been unfaithful, and believes Beatrice. He sees the wrong that has been done to the women around him and he steps away from it. So, can we talk about tenderness? It's time to talk about tenderness.First of all, Beatrice and Benedick's relationship is absolutely the ultimate romantic comedy and other romantic comedies can't fucking compare: ➽the first line that Beatrice says to Benedick is, not even joking, “I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior Benedick, nobody marks you”➽he's like “why Beatrice I thought you'd be dead by now”➽Beatrice gets her revenge by calling Benedick a dull court jester in disguise➽I mean if any girl ever roasted me that hard I too would risk it all➽everyone in the show is like “wow they keep roasting each other you know what's a good idea? make them think the other one is in love with them”➽of course this works➽they each hide very badly as other people talk around them and if your show does not play with the physical comedy of this it is weak and will not survive the winter➽seriously. one time i saw one where Benedick hid behind a plant and kept walking around. Catherine Tate dangled from a hook and David Tennant got flour all over his superman tshirt for this➽they get Benedick first and then Beatrice shows up to invite him to dinner and is like “i've come against my will to summon you to dinner” and he's like “there's a double meaning in that”➽you think I'm joking but no act two scene three line 260 fucking says hiAnd that's just the comedy part I haven't even started talking about tenderness yet!And Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,This line, from Beatrice's not-quite soliloquy after hearing Benedick is in love with her, is so fucking gorgeous and I think about it all the time and I can't even quite explain why, but the notion of telling someone to keep loving you because you plan to requite it immediately? Tender. I do love nothing in the world so well as you. Is not that strange?ladies, imagine this: it's the 1590s and your cousin's fiance accuses her of infidelity at the altar. everyone, including her father, abandons her, except for your crush who you hated until one (1) day ago. he tries to protect your cousin and then also professes his love to you. you ask said crush, who happens to be the fiance's best friend, to challenge him. he knows she didn't deserve that and he loves you and so he does so, as well as resigning from the famous soldier's company he's a part of, and then he writes a love sonnet to you and also shaves his beard and also plans a marriage proposalTarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.Hands. I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes—and moreover, I will go with thee to thy uncle's.Like this line is objectively really funny because Beatrice is just talking about going with Benedick to have a conversation with her uncle and he’s. being an overdramatic bitch again. and also it's partially a sex joke. but the other thing is that. this line is so unbearably tender. imagine you ask someone to go with you to your uncle’s and they seriously tell you not only do they want to do that but they also want to die in your lap and be buried in your eyes, sort of in a joking tone but also completely meaning it. i cant think about that too long or ill absolutely go insaneThey literally fall in love based on a practical joke. but they genuinely love each other because they respect each other. and each other's wit. the romantic heroine keeps threatening men with death and the the romantic hero drinks respecting women juice and also thinks being insulted is hot. Romeo and Juliet could never. god i want LOVE. YES, my love for this play is partly to do with my deep nostalgia. No, I do not care. And yes, the ending to the Claudio storyline is expected — Winter's Tale and All's Well That End's Well say hi, they want their plots back — but I think this play genuinely had something very important to say, something that is arguably still relevant. And it's also so wonderfully romantic. Every time I think about this play I kind of want to cry.If you would like to go feral for 3 hours straight I would like to direct you to the David Tennant / Catherine Tate version of this show, available free for your viewing pleasure on Youtube! This show is absolutely wonderful at all times but I think this particular version is fairly accessible even to those with no Shakespeare knowledge. Highlights include:➽Benedick riding in on a golf cart➽the fact that during the disguised-at-the-party scene Beatrice is wearing a suit and Benedick is wearing a jean skirt, women's shirt, and tights➽that scene in which Benedick is laughing at his friends for playing music and starts sarcastically doing pirrouettes➽the ensuing scene in which he accidentally sticks his hand in flour but then is so shook by someone actually liking him that he rubs it all over his face and shirt and somehow makes it look natural➽that part where Benedick drinks alcohol using a crazy straw➽the entire xylophone joke➽the scene in which they confess their love and they both start laughing really hard and dancing around the room and it's really funny but also so fucking tender. i havent stopped thinking about how much i love thatI love this play. This is my all-time favorite play and I care so much.

In all honesty, the whole thing just reads like the bad kind of fanfiction. It's full of the worst amateurish writing mistake: the characters constantly telling us how they feel rather than us actually seeing it. While this is certainly an addictive book, I felt unengaged in the story due to mediocre writing. This might have been also been due to the overly fast POV changes. Whatever it was, I immediately realized this was not going to be a compelling story. My main issue with the book was Eric's character. He's just... a spoiled dick. At one point, Eric muses:Well, assuming anyone actually listened to his music anymore... and had the mental capacity to understand a simple metaphor.This kind of quote seems incredibly condescending. I'd understand if this happened once, but quotes like this pop up almost every page of Eric's monologue. Some quotes even seem a tad misognystic, implying that Eric's ""female fans"" are crazy. At some point, I lost all interest in Eric's character. I didn't really love the portrayal of fandom this book has to offer. Every fangirl here seemed to be portrayed as shallow, which is odd in a novel with a fangirl as its star. In fact, it seems to be implied that boyband fans don't even like their heroes' music. Granted, I've never been a fangirl of a boy band, but I have close friends who are, and I do vaguely follow some celebrities on twitter. I don't think fangirls are portrayed very accurately here. If you're a pop star and you tweeted a link to your single and then a picture of your abs, I guarantee you would not get TEN TIMES the amount of retweets on the abs. People follow pop stars for their music! Yes, there's hotness involved, but popular boybands and singers have at least some talent. I'm not a 1d follower in particular, but admit it, you jammed to What Makes You Beautiful at least once. Ed Sheeran is extremely talented; I actually love his music a ton. Even Justin Bieber doesn't have a bad voice. There's just no way to become popular without some measure of talent, and the fans you have do buy and listen to your music. After all, girl groups have mostly-girl followings without a disproportionate amount of gay/bi girls. I also wished for a faster beginning; at 25% in, only one key plot point had occurred. For a suspense novel like this, you need to feel thrown in to the story. The interviews didn't really add suspense; in fact, they were underutilized. I also had trouble feeling the connection between Tessa and Eric. Their DMs lacked in chemistry towards the beginning due to the one-month time jump between their first contact and our next snapshot of them. This time jump seemed almost lazy, ignoring the need for buildup. More interactions towards the beginning of the book would've helped get me invested faster. I have to admit, I'm pretty disappointed.

It was entertaining, it was enjoyable, yet it was somewhat forgettable; a far departure from Marie Lu's usual morally grey characters and heartbreak. But the ending was so hardcore that I am now desperate for the sequel. So... a mixed bag?[The one vague spoiler is tagged and noted.]♔ WORLDBUILDINGThe worldbuilding is awesome, but it needs slightly more work. I really like the world created here, but I never felt very attached to it or even that I fully understood everything going on. Maybe it's that I'm not quite enough into video games - if you're a video game fan, you should love this.♚ THE PLOTTINGIn terms of plot, it's Marie Lu's usual fast-paced and twisty fare. I doubt you'll be bored. Definitely a good slump read. Buuuuuut I have to say that I was really not wowed by the plot, up until that brilliant ending.♔ THE ENDING - SPOILERS!The thing I love so much about the ending is that it misleads you. Usually, when I hear that there's some mind-blowing twist, I'm on the lookout for it and end up guessing it. So Marie Lu puts in two twists - one which I completely guessed, and one that I didn't even come close to suspecting.I think this book is setting up a much better sequel, and my experience with Marie Lu has taught me she rocks at second books. The point is I have high hopes the next book will be even better. ♚ CHARACTERSI liked the characters. I did not love the characters. Our protagonist, Emika, is interesting and pretty genuinely take-no-shit, but I just... don't feel that attached to her. I like her; she's not obnoxious or anything. But I should love her, and I just don't. The side characters were interesting, but I really wished they got more development. I liked Hamilton Jimenez, the team Thief and holder of a badass name, and Asher, who provides some great disability rep. I also really liked Roshan Ahmadi, whose relationship with his ex-boyfriend Tremaine promises to be even more relevant next book. Maybe I'll like them more next book, but for now, they needed more development.♔ WRITINGGuys, don't kill me, but Marie Lu's writing is only decent. There is a lot of showing and not telling, and it's something I think she definitely needs to work on in the future. ♚ ENTERTAINMENT VALUESomething interesting is how unpopular an opinion mine is. It's clear that most readers adored it. This was a buddyread with Ashia stan, my fellow Ravenclaw, angelic profile picture, and ignorer, and most of them adored it. Why did they love it? Because it is so much fun. The issue was simply that I expected more. I'd definitely recommend putting your expectations at ""entertaining"" rather than ""life-changing"" so you aren't disappointed. VERDICT: While not as amazing as I expected, I doubt anyone will be bored by this, and I'm sure many of you will like it a lot more than I did. Tentatively recommended if you like fun, fast-paced books. If not, please read Marie Lu's much better The Young Elites series.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,156,1,"Sep 23, 2017","Sep 30, 2017","Jan 20, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29385546-warcross

I don't think I've ever gone from loving to hating a book so fast. The SandcasI'm really sad I hated this book so much when pages 1-100 were SO GOOD. I don't think I've ever gone from loving to hating a book so fast. The Sandcastle Empire originally pulled me in with - and I'm not trying to joke about this - a completely awesome opening. We begin on a beach where Eden is waiting to execute her escape plan. Shit gets real very fast and Eden encounters Alexa, Hope, and Finnley. Both Eden and Alexa felt like characters with a lot of potential. There was a bit of infodumping, yes, but Kayla Olson creates a picture of an intriguing world. I was absolutely hyped to continue. Unfortunately, that beginning went completely to waste. This devolved into one of the messiest plots I've ever read in my life, with an added dose of instalove and no character development whatsoever. WORLDBUILDING: I feel like I should give points for effort here, but oh man, it was not good. The existence of the Wolfpack feels arbitrary, and it's not made clear exactly how much of the world they've taken over. Look, dystopia authors, I know you're cool and all, but here's some advice: America is not the only place that exists. And then there's the whole environmental theme. It's a great idea, but the execution is painfully mediocre. Somewhere in this novel, Olson had something to say about environmentalism and corporate greed. It's just not done well. After a while, the themes got lost in the sea of plot detail.ROMANCE: Oh boy. The two characters have no chemistry; they just get together because the author wants them to. They also get together far too early in their relationship, which takes any possible tension out of their interactions. Not that there was any; instalove ruins everything yet again. I also felt really annoyed that all the girl characters were reduced to their relationships with their boyfriends. CHARACTERS: Oh, this made for a nice transition, didn't it? Alexa and Eden both turn into generic stock characters who are obsessed with their boyfriends. I hate it when characters have no motivations, and these characters certainly did not. Hope, Finnley, and Lonan don't even pretend to have solid characters. Everyone is a stock character. AND WHAT ABOUT THE PLOT....?Oh yes, the plot. Well, there was one. I think? Maybe? It's there, and I'm sure it's what will get this novel a fanbase. But it's really so messy and confusing. The major problem with the action scenes is that everything revolves around setting, and the setting isn't described clearly. There's a lodge, and a lake, and a cave, and some kind of tree. The book didn't describe where they are in relation to each other, it's just kind of assumed that we Get It Already. I didn't understand anything about the setting, which made the plot seem even weirder. If the setting had been depicted well, I think I might have enjoyed this for a tropey-yet-atmospheric-and-exciting read. This could've been the next Caraval. The plot also felt completely manufactured and convoluted. I really think half of it was pulled straight out of a sci-fi film without anyone, including the author, thinking through what actually made sense. You could've cut over half this novel out and the ending would be the same. I am completely serious; the entire section from when the girls got to the island to when the Generic Hot Guys showed up could've been cut. This is partially because of the lack of character-driven action. These characters' plans changed at the drop of a hat. It's hard to get invested in a plot when it's so obvious that the author was pulling the strings. The writing style is good, but it's too subdued to hold the action. Eden's interlude chapters were well-written and somewhat intriguing as well, but they really weren't addressed in the book itself. VERDICT: I'm really sad I didn't enjoy this, especially when the beginning was so good.

But I also saw a complaint about flat characters, which is my #1 pet peeve, so my expectations weren't high. Weirdly enough, my low expectations helped my reading experience. I was expecting so little out of the characters that the little I got amazed me. In the first hundred pages, Scarlett is weak and totally cardboard. But she does get a lot better; in fact, her arc is pretty cool. It's a little one-dimensional, but her character towards the end is a complete improvement over her initial character. Why Caraval RocksThe best thing about this book is the plot. The plotting of this book is incredible. It takes around 150 pages to pick up, but at that point the story improves. There are so many twists, each one more creative than the next. I haven't been so reluctant to put a book down since Crooked Kingdom. I straight up screamed at one of the plot twists. It's seriously awesome. The second best thing is the writing. I can't believe this is a debut, because the writing is gorgeous. Scarlett describes her emotions as colors, which Stephanie Garber apparently did mean to be read as synesthesia. It sounds like purple prose, but it's somehow not. The writing instead makes the story more vivid. The setting descriptions are also well done; I could really picture the town where Caraval takes place. The Negatives; or, Why Do YA Authors Need To Do This With The Romancemy ass is TiredThe worst thing about this book is the first hundred pages' romantic aspect. In the first hundred pages, the romance really bothered me. There's too much focus on the romance rather than on the plot, and there's not nearly enough building of their actual relationship. Scarlett likes him because he's hot even though he acts like a complete asshole. I also had a lot of trouble ignoring that Scarlett and Julian were cheating, even though Tella had expressed she didn't really care for him. Julian did not know Tella's true feelings about him, And some of his behavior borders on harassment - the same when-girls-say-no-they-mean-yes trope as always. However! I really do not want to spoil things, but issues with the main romantic relationship are fixed to some degree. I'm not praising the twists and turns of this plot for nothing, people. If Julian and Scarlett bothering you towards the beginning, keep reading, because it really, really does get better. (view spoiler)[ Their relationship is later based more and more on mutual respect, and Scarlett calls him out for lying to her. (hide spoiler)]That can't really make up for my initial dislike of Julian, though. I still have an issue with how unbothered Scarlett seemed by Julian's initial harassment. Frankly, that's the one thing about this book that I didn't solidly love. Julian spent two hundred pages harassing her and it's just... accepted? That's not good. That's terrible. YA Fantasy needs to stop this before I murder someone. Recommended because I personally loved it, but more tentatively than most of my recommendations. I know that sounds weird because I almost gave this five stars, but this book is very polarizing and I would read some more s before deciding whether to buy this....more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"Jan 31, 2017","Feb 02, 2017","Jan 20, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27883214-caraval

When I picked this up, I was immediately drawn in by the writing style. The writing style is also just as gorgeous as every er says. It's lyrical, it's poetic, it's completely unique, and it's absolutely perfect. I'm someone who reads for characters, and this book succeeded at character work more than most. All the characters really touched my soul. So many characters who show up in only one chapter made me feel things. I have to say Viviane was my favorite character by far, but there were so many GREAT characters. And if there's one character you don't like, there are so many good ones that it really does not matter.There's a lot of focus here on the small tragedies of life. Almost every character's story has tragedy, and yet the book is so hopeful. I love that. I love stories where the characters go to hell and then come back stronger and better. I just wanted to cry throughout this entire book, especially towards the conclusion. The ending is very fitting for this story; it can be interpreted as tragic or hopeful, depending on your point of view. While I found one subplot of the last half of this book hard to enjoy, the heartbreak I felt towards the end made up for some of my horror. [major spoiler ahead] There is a fairly graphic rape scene. It is portrayed as wrong, but I honestly didn't enjoy reading this entire subplot. I found it slightly unnecessary to the whole of the book. I'd recommend this almost without exception.

Partially, I've read more at this point and have reduced a lot of my book ratings. Partially I just feel my opinion of this drop every time I think about it. This book was really so bland and so flat compared to the other two. Yes, it's a good conclusion, but I don't feel it added enough character development, enough plot, enough intrigue, enough anything. V.E. Schwab can do better. She HAS done better. This book offered me a fairly bad reading experience, and I can't ignore that, no matter how much I love this series. I really only have one complaint, and it's nothing new for this series, so I shouldn't feel disappointed at all. But I can't ignore that this... took me over a week to read. I NEVER take this long to read books. MY LOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH V.E. SCHWAB'S PLOTTINGI love so much about this series. The plotting is not one of those things. The plot is directionless. This is an issue I had with all three books of this series, and it's actually the one thing about this series I actively dislike. On one hand, I love the extended character work. On the other hand, there's no urgency behind the plot. That was tolerable in Gathering of Shadows, but here, the five main characters are trying to save the war, and yet they spend 400 pages screwing around. This book took me over a week, and I usually finish books in three days. That's kind of an issue. Usually, I'd ignore that ONE flaw, but I can't lie, I really hoped and expected Schwab would fix it here. Instead, it got worse. I just generally found the action of this book so meh, so lukewarm, so uninteresting. This conclusion felt like unnecessary drama that everyone was coming home from. It felt pointless. Without my love for the major characters, I don't know if I would've liked ANYTHING about this book.Also, and I'm nitpicking here, I still don't understand why Lila, Kell, and Holland don't just carry a ton of white and grey London trinkets with them. Why don't all of you just carry coins from Grey London? C'mon, wouldn't Lila have stolen enough from Grey London at this point? Do the trinkets have to be emotionally significant? BACK TO YOUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED I LOVE THIS SERIES MONTAGE* V.E. Schwab's writing style is incredible. It flows super well and manages to break my heart, but isn't annoying or pretentious at all. That's a hard balance and her books are worth reading for that reason alone. * Schwab's talent for describing setting especially stands out here. Usually I can't picture any settings in books, but I have such clear mental images of every moment in this book. * Kell is such a realistic character. He never seems like a caricature– he's a bit morally imperfect, not always the nicest, but loyal to the nth degree. He's just so interesting and fun to see on page. * Lila is STILL my chaotic neutral wife. She's a bit more mature here, but with the same reckless streak. I love her development. She's great to see on page– her dialogue is funny and entertaining. * Rhy's character development is perfectly executed. Again, he's such an imperfect person but he's still so lovable. And I cry. * Holland is so morally bankrupt and yet I love him so, so much. (view spoiler)[His ending made me both smile and cry. (hide spoiler)]* Alucard may have suffered a bit from I-have-an-archetypal-tragic-backstory syndrome a bit, but he was still a great character. I wished his sister could've been addressed a bit more. * I love the complex dynamics between all the characters. V.E. Schwab does an incredible job with the platonic relationships here. I especially loved Rhy and Kell here. And Kell and Holland have the best, most complex friendship ever. * The romance is built up very subtly and not the major focus. But oh damn, the romance is well written. I was so, so happy about Lila and Kell's relationship ending. Schwab knows how to write romance in a subtle but still swoon-worthy way. There's a sex scene in here that I actually genuinely kind of... enjoyed?? I hate sex scenes in books. Hate them. And yet... ya girl liked a sex scene. I know, I'm surprised too. * Also Rhy and Alucard were maybe one of the few new things in this book and they're really good?? This update is a complete callout for them.

This was a FAILED buddyread with Silv and Rin -links lead to their s. All of us DNFed which doesn't seem like a great sign?? ➽ The biggest issue here was the worldbuilding. The beginning of this book is incredibly frustrating. We are thrown into the middle of war with Tashi and their friend running away and it's not explained... at all. I think Julia Ember wanted to avoid info-dumping and made up for it by explaining... nothing. That's not a good solution. I can easily ignore info-dumping for two pages if it leads to some fantastic content later, but this... I want to say that I understood nothing about the war. I can't care about something I feel nothing for. ➽ The entire concept and reasoning behind tiger bonding. I wanted the book to focus on this and I expected Tashi and their tiger would be the focus!! And yet... no. I was left misunderstanding the entire concept of tiger bonding and why anyone would want to give up half their lives to bond to an animal. How does it actually advantage Tashi? ➽ This book is also, as should be expected due to the 180-page length, very rushed. Yes, it's a novella, and I've never been a fan of novellas. But I genuinely think Ember should market herself more as a writer of novellas than a writer of books. My expectations might've been adjusted and I think I would've enjoyed this a bit more.➽ I will say that Tashi, our protagonist, was maybe what I liked most about this. They do have a lot of moments of being slightly idiotic. However, it bothered me way less than it sometimes does. I tend to heavily dislike too-stupid-to-live type characters, which maybe doesn't reflect well on me. But somehow I still really liked them - their occasional naivety feels like a character trait more than authorial convenience, which is a decision I actually like. ➽ The nb rep also seemed pretty good so far!! I'm not nb and can't specifically say whether it's accurate, but it was done in a really casual way that I loved. I didn't feel like Ember was trying to educate, which I love - the whole ""let's explain someone's existence"" talk that happens in so many books often feels almost out-of-place. It's a part of Tashi's character but also doesn't define them. ➽ Unfortunately, they're also stuck in this incredibly cringey love triangle. It's one of those love triangles where there's a bad boy and a good boy. And as is usual for these love triangles, you know who they're meant to end up with from they're beginning. Thankfully, it looks like Tashi is going to end up with the best friend instead of the evil commander - that's definitely my preference in this type of love triangle. My question, then, is why does evil commander have to exist?I was just ranting about this trope yesterday. Y'all have got to learn the difference between morally ambiguous love interests and love interests who read like they're on the verge of physically abusing their partners for 90% of the book. Xian is terrifying. His relationship with Tashi is one of the most cringeworthy and creepy things I've read this year. And as I mentioned above, even ignoring the ""this-isn't-enemies-to-lovers-it's-just-creepy"" thing, this relationship felt totally rushed. If they hadn't gotten together in this book and the tension had been drawn out until halfway book two, this could've led to some delicious tension. But Tashi gets together with Xian really quickly. And of course, you can also tell that Tashi is going to end up with their best friend anyway. What's the point? It's written in this way like it's meant to be somewhat creepy but also... sexy?? And I'm not feeling it at all. VERDICT: Maybe the second half is better, but honestly, I'm not sure I want to find out. If you can get past the terrible love triangle and the confusing plot, Tashi's character is fun and the possibility of a well-done friends-to-lovers trope is promising!! But for now, not so much.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Jul 26, 2017","Aug 13, 2017","Jan 16, 2017",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/28489382-the-tiger-s-watch

They had every acre to let out the blooms that had been waiting in their hands all winter.I have never, never, never read anything more deeply beautiful in my life. Something about it just hit me. The characters, the love story, the writing, the atmosphere, the imagery. I don't even know how to articulate it, but I don't think it's a coincidence that the other two members of this buddyread - my faves Melanie and Destiny - both loved this as well. And that this book ended up being my literal favorite book of 2017. This book is worth so much.Wild Beauty follows a family of women who lose everyone they fall in love with. While they live in a gorgeously decorated set of gardens, the Nomeolvides women are incapable of leaving, and under control by a family called the Briars. ♔ Estrella - One of the youngest of the sisters, and the protagonist. And my icon in every way possible. Her story is one of personal agency and self-hate. Her starflowers appear when she sleeps, unwelcome, unlike those of the rest of the family, and I loved how McLemore balanced this. I literally adore her and I connect to her self-hatred so much. Also, I ship her and Fel so hard. ♚ Fel - Fel's story is, again, one of agency. I won't spoil his exact character arc, but I really appreciated that he's SoftTM and loves Estrella's boldness.♔ Dalia - I just really appreciated her, as a side character. Again, no spoilers! But the narrative around recognizing those you love as people was so powerful.♚ Bay - a genderqueer icon! She was just absolutely lovely. I love her narrative about being an outcast and having to find herself. All these characters are so well-written and easy to connect with, which is something I think is hard to achieve in magical realism novels. All this beautiful imagery and lovely prose can easily be used to cover up a situation in which not much is happening, but that's not the case with this novel. The prose is beautiful, but the story itself is just as important.For months, Bay had been choking. Her flourishes had grown stiff, her smiles more nerves than charm. But with every meal in the Nomeolvides women’s stone house, with every plate of mole poblano, Bay sat up a little straighter.This is an interesting book because it's not explicitly about racism or about the oppression of queer people. But those themes are there, woven throughout every aspect of the book. It's such a quintessential queer fairy tale, and I adored it. So, so much. They had pretended they were there to clean it, and because men who stood so proud in pressed slacks and wrinkled shirts were used to having brown-skinned women wait on them, he seemed not to notice.I love that we can have books like this now: books that aren't explicit coming out narratives or Issue Books - not that those aren't important - yet still manage to fundamentally tie all of these issues in. It may not be the explicit conflict, but marginalization is at the forefront of this book and this narrative. This is a narrative marginalized people have been writing for years and years. Look at so many narratives about agency or forbidden love - A Streetcar Named Desire, even Beauty and the Beast - and you'll discover marginalized people behind the scenes, writing those narratives. But it's a narrative we have never gotten for ourselves. And it means so much to me that we finally have these. The robbery of agency of queer women and colonized peoples is right there, right at the forefront, and this time, we get to star. I am so grateful for how far we've come. It's a book about generational trauma, the way in which our family's past changes us. In which our legacies hurt us, and help us, and irrevocably change us. This article said it perfectly. Hearts that loved both boys and girls were no more reckless or easily won than any other heart. They loved who they loved. They broke how they broke. And the way it happened depended less on what was under their lovers’ clothes and more on what was wrapped inside their spirits.(Can we talk about the fact that this quote manages to decodify bisexuality as being dependent on gender without implicating other people as shallow? Because it's lovely and I love Anna-Marie McLemore.)This book speaks to so many different things, from environmentalism to agency, but all I can say is: you need this. It is such an important book, but it never ceases being enjoyable. And while I'll admit this took me a long time to read, I adored every minute, and the last 30% sold me completely on a new all-time favorite. I'm sure not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did - the lyrical writing isn't for everyone - but personally, this is one of the best books I've ever read.

This book had some really good stuff going for it, which was ruined by some really horrible treatment of rape victims and lgbt people. The writing style is good, as long as you like Ellen Hopkin’s writing. I happen to find it easy to devour. Usually, her verse style gives good character insight, but I didn’t totally feel that here. Now, the characters themselves were not as much a strength as I usually find they are. ~ Kendra’s character spent 600 pages in the throes of anorexia, and did not develop at all. Sure, people do sometimes not conquer anorexia. But her ending was 1) too open, and 2) her character ended up being kind of a pointless inclusion in this book. What impact does she have on this story? Why is her non-arc there at all?~ Cara’s character is… hmm. I went in really expecting to love her, and I just… didn’t. She’s supposedly trying to live a perfect life, but I didn’t feel that. I didn’t connect to her on any level, despite the fact that her character’s situation should have felt relatable. Her relationship with Dani is also pretty instalove and I never felt for them. ~ Andre’s character was better. The connection between his character and the others is not well built. Three of them make sense: Cara is dating Sean, who used to be dating Kendra, who used to be dating Cara’s brother. Andre’s connection to the group is that he dates Kendra’s sister for a little while. Andre is very disconnected from the other three characters, which was a bit frustrating. Overall though, I could tolerate this because his arc was compelling and he got a great ending. ~ Sean’s character is just a complete mess, and that’s the main reason this book is getting only two stars. After his girlfriend Cara says she wants to sleep with him, partially to convince herself she's not gay, she realizes that she does not want to and says no at the last second. He then rapes her. She, obviously, freaks out and breaks up with him. He then stalks her, going so far as to peek into a window to watch her have sex with her girlfriend and compare it to pornography. (Yes, she cheated on him, which I do not condone, but that does not even come close to justifying these actions). He then takes photos of them having sex and spreads them around the school, outing her and also putting her in an incredibly horrible position. And Sean did not develop at all. At the end of the book, he is still going to Stanford and has suffered no consequences for being such a shitstain on the face of humanity. He wasn’t even outed about his damn steroid usage. And to be quite honest, his narrative has nothing to do with trying to be perfect. He doesn’t belong in this book and frankly, he deserved to fall off a cliff. This book also utilizes some minor problematic tropes. For example: the rapist was the representation of mental illness, which I really didn't expect from Hopkins. Jenna (Kendra’s sister) dates Andre to make her racist father angry, and he doesn't mind. How does he not mind? How would anyone not mind that? Lastly, this book had some issues with biphobia — the exact same issues that Impulse had, and now the You I've Never Known As Well. (More on these two books here and here.) Cara does not once bring up the option of being bi, and her girlfriend immediately calls her a ""a full-out dyke"" despite the fact she’s still questioning, as well as implying being bi would make her lesser. Again, this is never called out. I am so confused as to how Ellen Hopkins wrote such good bi representation in Tricks, and then proceeded to perpetrate biphobia in so many other series. I'm not planning on picking up any more of her books after this. I enjoyed two of her books, but given that I've now hated two more, I don't think continuing to read her books is a good decision....more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,"Jan 15, 2017","Jan 22, 2017","Jan 15, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9917945-perfect

This book is freaking amazing and REALLY underrated. Gallery of Unfinished Girls is an intensely beautiful magical realism story: not at all what I expected, but somehow everything I needed. Karcz manages to pull together themes about growing up, moving on, and being an artist into the same book. And it works perfectly. The message of the book develops over time and the writing builds. Don't expect a romance here; this is more of a coming-of-age story. Honestly, the lack of romance was probably my least favorite part. I know that sounds ridiculous and out-of-character for me, but it's true. I wished for more of a love story to bring the book together. Yes, the lack of actual romance is realistic, given the situation: no, I still don't particularly like it. But honestly, I have no other complaints. The characters of this beautiful little book are going to stay with me for a long time. Mercedes' arc is subtly built and has a stunning conclusion. Karcz doesn't neglect her side characters, though. Angela, Vic, and Lillia were all layered and multifaceted. Everything about this book was great, really. There's an emphasis on friendship and family in a very mature sense. There's this emotional quality to the writing that made me feel. I don't know how to quantify emotion or tell you why I felt that way, but I got Mercedes. We're not similar, yet I connected to her in such a real way. She felt like a real person. I cannot be stopped in the beginning of everything. I cannot hide forever.The writing style in general is just gorgeous, especially considering Lauren Karcz is a debut author. I did have one nitpick here; she could have used more contractions, especially when they helped sentences flow better. A few stray sentences came across as fairly abrupt or out of place due to this issue. VERDICT: All in all, Gallery of Unfinished Girls was a great look at art with magical realism and interesting characters. I can't wait for this to be published and for everyone to love it like I did.

She has that special something in terms of fantasy writing. The Two Princesses of Bamarre focuses on two sisters, the good girl and the brave girl. But when her heroic sister gets sick, Addie, the good girl, must save her. Levine seems to have a talent for subtly subverting fairy tales. She takes typical fairy tales and makes them better. The heroine here begins as a shrinking violet, but ends as a self-realized character. She's not unrealistically brave or smart, and she's not some character you can put on a pedestal. No, she's just clever enough to be admirable. She's universally relatable, not too smart or too brave or too clever but still admirable and heroic. She's got a character arc and growth of her own. This is definitely a feminist tale; focusing on sisters and their bond, rather than any romance. There's a bit of romance in there. Rhys and Addie develop a close bond that could lead to romance. But it's not the focus of the story; in fact, it's barely an element in the middle section. Addie is dedicated to saving her sister. This is a personal journey, not a romantic journey.The ending is both brilliant and heartbreaking. You have to respect Levine for writing that ending into a middle grade book.

She wore men's clothing because it was freeing for her at a time when women wore dresses. When I picked up the book and saw the entry, I was ready to read about her having feelings for a woman or stating that she felt like a man internally or something. But no, her dressing in men's clothing to fight was all the evidence. Usually, I'm all up for interpreting every single person in history as lgbtq, and I'd love to read some kind of alternate history about her. But there's just no evidence in her entry. It really takes down the credibility of the book.

There's no popular mean girl, thank god. Riley Redgate sticks to interesting, flawed main characters. However, and this is partially a flaw of the blurb, it's implied that the protagonist goes through gender confusion, and that issue is really not touched on. She mentions the possibility of being trans twice but only once does she consider it seriously. I kind of wish the author had explored this a bit more. The author did explore, to some degree, the different ways guys treat other guys, and her own desire to be one of the guys. That I loved. It was just a case of incorrect expectations. That being said, this book did portray bisexuality pretty well. Jordan got to actually say the word! Multiple times! It's kind of sad how rare that is. Jordan ended up with the guy, not the girl, but this wasn't presented as rejecting her nonstraight identity so no complaints! The seventy pages of the book didn't really do much aside from throw in a romance, which wasn't great.

Speculative fiction, to me, is meant for emotions, and meant for exploration and discovery. This book is a story of a last chance and a last day for two very different people, but it's a story that's best observed personally - this story asks you to reinvent yourself every single day.The strength of this book is that somehow, everything here feels so natural and personal. The amount of side point of views here is perhaps the best part of this book - it's hard to ignore how personal this story is when you feel as if you could be dropped into the book at any time. I can't go on being the kid who keeps his head low because all that did was rob and being out there with you- maybe I could have met some of you sooner.Emotionally, this story is fantastic. The characters are lovely and well-developed. And as an added bonus, the diversity is fantastic - Mateo is Puerto Rican and queer, while Rufus is Cuban-American and bisexual. Let’s talk characters, because hey, this is a character-driven book primarily. ➽ Mateo Torrez: My nerdy, character-development-full son. Mateo is a homebody and a bit of a nervous wreck trying to have one final day. ➽ Rufus Emeterio: The fact that he put down “Professional Time Waster” as his job in his deathday profile is all you need to know, honestly. In contrast to Mateo, Rufus has accepted his fate. Oh, and he's also hilarious. What's odd about this is the romance plotline is this book comes sort of out of nowhere, but I loved it anyway? Mateo and Rufus do not have a meet-cute. They do not have sexual tension for the first eight hours before they kiss. And you know what? I think the lack of slow burn is perfect. It works very well as a desperate, last-ditch relationship, between two characters who aren't in love yet. But they could be. Basically, this book was worth the hype and Adam Silvera can go fuck himself for writing it. This buddyread with my oncoming depression was an absolute success.

I was not myself.”“I apologize for shooting you in the leg,” said Lila. “I was myself entirely.”Actual Rating: 4 1/2 Stars, but honestly every time I round this down I end up putting it back up a day later. So you may notice this book is kind of polarizing within the adult sff community; a little bit And for me personally it is.... such a fave. I keep returning to this world and these characters and I doubt I’ll ever stop.For the approximately five people who don’t know, A Darker Shade of Magic is about a world with four parallel worlds, all very different but sharing the same London. There’s Grey London, aka our world. Red London, a land of magic and peace. White London, a land of turmoil and war and an overuse of magic. And Black London, the land where magic went wrong and burnt out. Only a few people can travel between worlds, and when one of the only two left, Kell, discovers a magic stone that could destroy his world, he and non-magical Lila go on a journey to put it back. Let's get the problems out of the way - the plotting is a mixed bag. Pro: fast-paced and never boring. This book is a 400-page wild ride. Con: literally no driving force behind the plot. The characters don't even have a quest until around page 200, and it makes the entire book feel just a bit messy. This is a problem Victoria Schwab tends to have a lot [she’s my favorite author so I’m allowed to say this], where her characters just meander around in search of an end goal. This.... kills her series conclusions. Like, it’s killed both of the series enders I’ve read by her for me personally, and this is coming from the bitch who has five starred every single other book I’ve read by her. But it doesn’t really hurt the plot that much here, so it’s fine, and we’ll just address that more in the ACOL . “What are you?” she asked. “A monster,” said Kell hoarsely. “You'd better let me go.”The girl gave a small, mocking laugh. “Monsters don't faint in the presence of ladies.” “Ladies don't dress like men and pick pockets,” retorted Kell. Her smile only sharpened. “What are you really?” “Tied to your bed,"" said Kell matter-of-factly.“And?” His brow furrowed. “And in trouble.”The main thing I always come back to about this book is that it is deeply, deeply magical. It was nigh-impossible for me to not be engaged in this story. The writing style is SO GOOD, lyrical and gorgeous and with a really nice flow to it; one of my good blogger friends discussed her sentence structure, and it is so fantastic. The worldbuilding is creative and intriguing and perhaps best of all, makes a surprising amount of sense for such a wild concept. Also, I would die for these characters. Oddly, they didn't totally grow on me until like... 2/3 of the way into the book? While I could recognize from the beginning that the leads were well-developed and interesting, it took me a while to feel as if I had a concrete concept of who they are. And then we got to the ending and I was screaming in agony at the thought of these characters dying, and I was like ""oh shit"" and realized how much I love Kell and Lila and Rhy and how much I care about their relationships. V.E. Schwab does a lot of showing, not telling, which makes the character development a bit more subtle; these characters are based off their motivations perhaps even more than their actual traits. And both of these things mean you’re less invested in the beginning and then.... more invested in the end. Slow start, flawless payoff.I actually want to talk a little more specifically about these characters because when I think back on this series, they are always what come to mind. Kell is a grumpy child who we love anyway. Lila is a fucking badass genderfluid thief with a soft side and I love her. Rhy is a bisexual prince [literally] who spends half his time dragging people. Even Holland, the sort-of-villain, is a super dynamic and intriguing character. Oh, and then the relationships: Kell and Lila, y’all. Kell and Lila are my ride-or-die book couple and I love their dynamic and I love how they’re constantly dragging each other and just. fuck. I love them. I also really really like Kell and Rhy’s relationship, which is so ridiculously loving and caring? They are perhaps two of the most different people ever and they love each other so much it's beautiful. I also kind of love that 98% of the dynamics in this book kind of read like everyone has dated everyone else and it’s now Really Awkward [this is both Kell & Holland and also Rhy & Holland and it later becomes the canon dynamic of Rhy & Alucard, and it's hilarious]. If anyone wants to come for me about this, I point to That Time Victoria Schwab Said That Every Character In This Series Should Be Read As Queer. No, that is not the only reason why I like this series, and yes, they’re all bi icons and you can’t take that away from me. Anyway. Super highly recommended for fans of creative, engaging fantasy.

What's saIt's been eight years since I've read this this, and the message of this book still might be one of the most moral repugnant I've ever seen. What's saddest is that A Mango Shaped Space could be a great book, were it not for the terrible moral of the story.So. A Mango Shaped Space is about a girl who begins a journey to learn who she is and accept her own synesthesia. Along the way, she makes friends at conventions for people with synesthesia. She even learns that acupuncture feels really good for people with synesthesia (which is really cool and something I didn't know). This is where everything about this book goes wrong. Along the way, she starts to abandon her family. Her new friends turn out to be false. (view spoiler)[And then she forgets to close the door because she was distracted by learning about her synesthesia, causing her cat to die. (hide spoiler)] All of these things are portrayed as direct results of her synesthesia. It's even weirder when you consider that she starts talking to her family less because they didn't accept her synesthesia, even though it was their choice to not accept her synesthesia, not hers. The message that comes out, intentionally or not, indicates that learning who you are is a bad thing. The narrative punishes the main character for 1) being different, 2) liking the things that make her different, and 3) wanting to know who she is. That's a really messed-up narrative. That was the message I took from this book is sixth grade or so. And that wasn't a good message for me to internalize, or for any kid to internalize. The author also does not have synesthesia herself, and there are several other s on this page talking about how that negatively affected the book. Wendy Maas overexaggerates the issues that come along with synesthesia, making it seem like a blessing that makes the protagonist better than everyone else. Not only does this book have a fucked-up narrative around our differences, A Mango-Shaped Space doesn't even portray that difference correctly. So. I can't recommend this book, no matter how much I enjoy the writing style or the characters. I just can't. This is a really messed-up narrative and I can't believe anyone has the nerve to sell this to kids....more",Notes are private!,1,35,1,Jan 2011,Jan 2011,"Jan 05, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/171020.A_Mango_Shaped_Space

It's good, but there's nothing setting it apart. Of course, I should be fair: some of that disappointment comes from my nostalgia. The Lost Kingdom of Bamarre focuses on a princess who becomes a warrior after discovering she's part of her family's hated race. There's a hint of romance and a hint of badassery and a hint of Carson's lovely writing. As is typical for Levine, though, this isn't just any princess story. There's a real focus on family, both chosen and born to. Levine develops both complex sibling relationships and complex parental relationships. These complexities are unfortunately still a rare find in fantasy.

This is the author of maybe my all-time favorite teen contemporary book and now TWO of my favorite thrillers?? How does she transverse genres like this and still write such good books??This is going to be a very hard book to  without spoiling anything. Strangely enough, though, being spoiled about who lives or dies wouldn't have ruined this experience. Half the intrigue of this book is trying to figure out how the end went down. And that ending did not disappoint. The book begins with a fairly simple concept: Chloe wants to escape her small town, but her mother develops severe depression, so she can't leave for college. She begins dating good guy Ethan as she tries to make the best of her situation. And then in comes bad boy Oliver. Please don't sigh and stop reading this now. Because Chloe finds that Oliver brings out her inner side. And that inner side isn't so much a good girl; her inner side might be even darker than Oliver expects.Fair warning: this book is messed up. I honestly don't want to know what's going on inside Abigail Haas' head. This book speaks to the dark sides of human nature. The manipulative sides willing to do what it takes. And it's so fucking well done.There are s of this book saying(view spoiler)[ Ethan deserved better and they didn't understand why Chloe cheated on him. (hide spoiler)] I usually don't say this, but I think that complaint is totally missing the point. This book isn't about Ethan, and it isn't about Oliver. It definitely isn't about which one you prefer. This is about Chloe. Neither love interest is meant to be the right choice. (view spoiler)[Come on, guys - Ethan is controlling and infantilizes Chloe, while Oliver is a sociopath and a borderline sexual harasser. (hide spoiler)] Abigail Haas is both using and sidestepping many popular romance tropes.So now that we've established this book isn't about the love triangle, let's figure out what it is about. This book is about the good people we pretend to be and the bad people we really are. This is a character study of an incredibly terrible person. Chloe is evil, yet there wasn't a moment I didn't relate to her. It's almost uncomfortable to relate to such a despicable character, and therein lies the brilliance of this novel.Haas' writing is insanely addictive. She keeps dramatic tension in every moment, growing a sense of dread as to what exactly is going to go wrong. Her writing is so readable that by page 100, I could barely remember starting. It felt like I'd been reading for five minutes. It's very rare that authors can be addictive.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Jan 02, 2017","Jan 03, 2017","Jan 02, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19732381-dangerous-boys

I completely expected to hate this duology, and now it's making it to my fantasy favorites shelf. While this isn't quite as incredible a sequel, it's a worthy ending. The Wrath and the Dawn was almost entirely a romance. Usually an emphasis on romance to this degree would bug me a lot, but Adhieh writes romantic banter very well. Khalid and Shazi are still such a good couple and I loved their banter. The Rose and the Dagger is more of an actual fantasy book, which usually would make me love it more. However, the plot seems thrown in and lackluster. The first book was so lacking in plot that the sudden plot didn't... make sense. I felt disconnected from the action. There are one or two nice twists, but in general, the plot is predictable and clearly only there to create romantic drama. Another issue is that the action takes quite a while to get going. The middle of The Rose and the Dagger is straight-up boring at times. It lacks in plot, romance, AND character-development, which is unforgivable. There are also far too many plot conveniences. Even the twists never seem truly terrifying, because we know everything will work out happy in the end. It doesn't seem like Shazi and Khalid really needed to fight for their happy ending. You may be surprised, after all this plot ranting, that I still enjoyed the book. I'm a little surprised too. Maybe it's the writing style; Ahdieh writes such gorgeous descriptions. This is one of the few books I've read where I can visualize the scenes and settings so well. And I truly found these books so engaging. There's something about the way Ahdieh writes; I feel so engaged in this world, even when I find the plot overly convenient. And while this series isn't winning any romance awards from me, I still enjoyed Shazi and Khalid as a couple.

This is my favorite of Ellen Hopkins’ series mostly because it doesn't just read like torture porn. A lot of her books don't even have hopeful endings: someone dies or doesn’t make their way out, every single time. Tricks allowed the characters to leave and improve their lives. With emotional and physical trauma, but not dead. This book was ultimately hopeful, which is very different from many of her others. The characters in here remain just as awesome. Ginger is just as awesome, with an even better recovery arc than last book, and continues being realistic and likable. Eden's arc was frankly wrapped up pretty well in the last book, but it's still good to see her be happy FINALLY. Seth's storyline is frankly a bit of a repeat, which is incredibly boring. Whitney goes through so much development in this book, and gets a truly fantastic character arc. Cody is maybe the weakest character here. He comes off as a bit of a fuckboy, frankly, although he did become more sympathetic later on. In terms of plotting, this book suffers from the same pacing issues as many of Hopkins' books. But ultimately, that can be forgiven due to the excellent character work and prose.

I do not at all agree that this book “drives away male allies.” Given the content of the book Kirkus was referring to, I am of the opinion that this is a really gross opinion. If you think “calling out a person who's victim-blaming a rape survivor” is the same as “driving away male allies”, please consider blocking me. This isn't even an accurate concern. The dude we're referring too, the main character's boyfriend, is given a chance to learn from his gross comments and begin working through his own misogyny. God, I don't even know if I would've given someone a chance to redeem themselves from some of the things said in this book. No, the main character does not consider it acceptable that her boyfriend implies rape is the victim's fault. You know why she's not okay with that? Because it's a gross belief and it's not one anyone should accept in a boyfriend. I'm trying to be sympathetic to other opinions here, but Kirkus'  is not a different opinion on a book or a different viewpoint on how feminism works. It's an ideology, and it's a fucking terrible one. It is perfectly acceptable to dislike this book - we all like and dislike stuff - but the fact that you don't give a shit about rape victims, whether they be men or women, isn't one of them. Thanks. WE'RE DONE WITH THE SEXIST BULLSHIT - LET'S REVIEWOkay, basic premise: A bunch of girls join together to protest sexism at their school. The book starts out without a ton of character depth, with the obvious feminist girl and the obvious naysayer girl and the obvious boyfriend. The book proceeds to smack down all of your expectations for how this is going to play out. The best friend isn't vilified for not starting out as an ardent feminist. The boyfriend's occasional problematic actions are called out in a really healthy way. Even the obvious popular girl who loves dating and guys gets a character arc and isn't slutshamed. I kind of love how unapologetically feminist this book is. The author touches on a lot of different feminist topics, and even mentions how those topics intersect with lgbt issues and with racism. I was expecting the book to be very one-dimensional dealing with those topics. But this book was better than that. There are characters who do sexist things despite trying their best, other characters call them out, and they grow and change. Yay for second chances and character development. I have to say, I would've appreciate a bit more actual intersectionality, rather than characters just talking about it. But in general, that aspect of the book was great. Aside from discussing the basic premise and etc etc etc, everything about this is solid contemporary material. The characters are well-drawn with good arcs, although none of them resonated with me in any particular way. The romance is sweet, the plot is interesting, the writing is quite compelling... I don't have anything amazing to say and I don't have anything particularly bad to say. What made this book stand out to me was the interesting and non-stereotypical dialogue around feminism. I would like to add a trigger warning for a lot of gross things being said about rape victims, which are called out, obviously. Do you want to read this yet? Because I loved it, and I hope everyone else will too.

Alex is a killer, but she's not a robot by any means: she is driven by pathos throughout the book. She even becomes a bit of an anti-hero, which was great. Jack is a well-developed character who wants to get out of the town most of all, and learns to treat himself and others better. Peaky is a victim who wants to move on with life. And you love all these characters. Branley, Sara, and Park all stood out as sympathetic side characters, despite the fact that none of them got points of view. Branley particularly gets a very complex character. This book does not avoid talking about the horror inflicted by sexual assault. Alex's character arc also focuses on the dirtier aspects of human nature. Basically, the author is not fucking around here. There are also some great takedowns of slut-shaming as to Branley's character. ""You shouldn't be that way about her,"" Alex says. ""I hear what people say and I bet half of it isn't even true. And even if it is - fine. She's no different from you and me; she wants to have sex. So let her… It wasn't Branley who hurt you. It was Adam.""Essentially my only quam about this book is the ending. Which is... stunning, on some levels, and frustrating on others. SPOILER: Basically, (view spoiler)[Alex dies after getting a happy ending. So there's a happy ending, and then it's blown apart. I don't love that decision. Sometimes, stories about recovering from mistakes you've made are exactly what's needed. I wanted redemption for such a sympathetic character as Alex. Her ending made me feel as if her character arc went to waste a bit. Sure, she died redeemed, but the entire town hates her now. However, the ending is also very well done and leads to good character moments for Claire and Jack. (hide spoiler)]But when looked at on a level of totality, this book was wonderful.

This is a✨While I only rated this four stars, I want to note that this book has stuck with me for several years at this point and I loved it so much. This is a book you have to stick with. I don't want to pretend Places No One Knows is fast-paced, and I don't want to pretend you'll fall in love immediately. You might. Or, like me, you might not. But even if you despise the first half of this book, I genuinely think you should read the second half. Because holy shit, I ended up adoring this. It's one of the most creative and character-driven books I've ever read. Places No One Knows is about masks. It's about the masks we keep, and the attempts we make to remove them, to adjust them, to tape them down. Most of all, it's about the attempts our faces make to push our masks off.// WEIRDNESS, MAGICAL REALISM, AND DEFYING GENRESIf you can't tolerate a lack of explanation, this book is not for you. Point blank. Barely any of the weird things happening in this book are explained. Does it detract from the book at all? Nope. Places No One Knows isn't about why these characters are switching bedrooms. It's about the characters. The weird backdrop to the story gives this book its power, framing the entire book in a veneer of suspicion and atmosphere so you barely notice how much you love the characters until they're already in your hearts.The writing style is around 75% of the build. Yovanoff is a brilliant wordsmith, and her writing flows very well, with some gorgeous quotable moments. There's this weird-but-intriguing tone to it. I don't even know how to describe it!! The whole thing feels somewhat surreal, yet also hyper-realistic at the same time. I don't even know how to describe it - all I know is that it was fucking awesome. // SOCIOPATHS, GOOD BOYS, AND DEFYING TROPESIt's really rare to write truly compelling characters. I don't mean likable characters, interesting characters; I mean characters that defy every trope and leave us awake far into the night. This book is one of the only contemporary standalones I've ever read that even comes close. This book is a dual pov, following main characters Waverly and Marshall. And uh, I've dedicated my life to both of them?? HERE ARE THE RANTS.Marshall is one of the only genuinely well-written ""bad boy is secretly soft"" tropes ever. He's goes from a bad boy to a good guy, and it turns out he was never much of a bad boy in the first place. And a host of side characters (Autumn, Ollie, Maribeth, etc) are all very fleshed out. Waverly is... holy shit, I can't put Waverly into words. She's described by a few characters as being an unfeeling sociopath, and while they're not entirely wrong, they're not right either. Waverly has shut herself down. She has made herself into this cold, removed, perfect girl, yet she's screaming inside. And oh my god, I adore her character arc. Now let's talk about well-written romance. I honestly could not care less about the tinge of instalove at the beginning; these two characters and their relationship are so compelling. Having a bad boy x good girl relationship that defies all the normal tropes and ends in them both developing into different people was brilliant. I really felt invested in them staying together by the end, in a way I just do not feel during some romance novels. OKAY, I mentioned defying tropes, so I'm going to spend some time on that!! Waverly and Marshall's relationship is so obviously based off normal high school romance tropes, and yet it subverts every single one of your expectations. One of my initial issues, which was Heather's constant slutshaming, was even taken down. It's just... so not what you expect in terms of content or in terms of character work. IT'S GREAT. Read this if you like to defy tropes. // FLAWS AND FAILURESAnd now, for the issues. There is no plot aside from the romance. And that leads to a lot of boredom before the characters can really draw you in. I even considered DNFing this at some parts from boredom, although I don't think it was ever very serious. But this book starts out slow and plotless enough that I took off a star, despite my love for these characters. VERDICT: I have to highly recommend this book to fans of character driven books and well-written romance....more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,"Dec 27, 2016",Jan 2017,"Dec 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/26067507-places-no-one-knows

A fantastic romance with gorgeous writing and a few flaws. Let's start with the bad because I'm obnoxious like that. THE BAD: + Shazi's character goes from point A to point B very quickly, which usually would immediately get rid of any interest I had in this book. I do like her, as a character, it just feels like Ahdieh is moving her character where she wants her to go. + The love triangle. Tariq's character was, in general, incredibly uninteresting. It felt like mindless drama. However, the love triangle worked out partially as a sideplot, which made his lacking character less of a major issue. Again, though, I don't see why this book needed a love triangle. Tariq could've been an old friend instead. Is there any reason I should care about him at all? No? Good. THE GOOD, OR IN THIS CASE GREAT+ The romance of this book is incredibly well-written and I was actually on the edge of my seat, despite not typically being the romantic fantasy type. While they develop initial attraction to each other quite quickly, their romance does follow a fairly typical and sensical track. Shazi and Khalid's banter completely won me over. I loved the tension between them. + Mainly, I just loved the writing style. Adhieh's style involves so many metaphors that actually work. It's gorgeous without being pretentious, which is the best kind of writing. + The book is just so readable. I ended up finishing The Wrath and the Dawn very quickly. I was reluctant to put it down, despite the fact that I was pacing for a plane flight while finishing it up. Even at sections where the plot slowed down, the story keeps the magic and dramatic tension. And this is ultimately the best part about The Wrath and the Dawn.

Johnston's pitch-perfect writing style is slightly muted by a meandering plot with no direction, but in general, the book still succeeds. So, to start with the good: Johnston's prose is gorgeous, as always. She is really so talented and I'm willing to forgo pretty much any flaw because her writing clicks with me so much. Zahrah's character is a strength of this novel. She is well-written and developed. I loved seeing a strong Sleeping Beauty with agency. Unfortunately, (view spoiler)[she only narrates one chapter (hide spoiler)]. She also doesn't make most of the decisions of the plot. One of my favorite things about A Thousand Nights was the strong heroine and her decisiveness. This book does not have that. Yashaa, the protagonist, makes decisions that seem abrupt and changes his mind on the best course of action at the drop of a hat. The plot was too meandering. The romance is sweet and likable. There's no instalove here; Yashaa and Zahrah's dynamic is far more interesting than that of Sleeping Beauty and the Prince. I'm not lying down praising it, but it wasn't bad at all.

The subjects are small moments: a final party, only significant to Adam. The discussion of homophobia in this was so much and I don’t even really know why it hit me that hard. But this made me cry a lot. Being gay, especially in a situation where your home doesn’t accept it, is a very distinct experience. Adam is a part of a preacher family with parents who do not really love him. His brother, Marty, loves Adam—with a but. Love between queer people is often the only unconditional love we get. Getting over someone when they’re not only your first love, but arguably your first love ever is a whole other thing. He doesn’t want to let go because he worries that Ezra could at any second come back.Adam is also in a new relationship with a new guy, Linus. It's very romantic. I'm thinking about how loving despite being told those feelings aren’t real is a radical act.This just… hit me really hard because it felt like a genuine reflection of feelings I’ve had that I’ve never really been able to put into terms. Falling in love is so hard. It’s especially hard when you’re told you only deserve bad treatment, as Adam is—both by his parents in general and by his sexuality. I think the reason this book hit me so hard is because it works through that grief, that grief of being told you are not loving right but never being shown any love yourself, in all its messy bits. Here are some quotes from this book that I think about a lot:→I don’t want this. I don’t want to be this person. I don’t want to always fight. I want to love. →“We don’t even know each other, Linus.” “I think maybe we do.”→He’d heard once that the only people who could effectively treat the trauma of surviving an airplane crash were other survivors of other airplane crashes. You could only instinctively trust someone who had been there.→Can I love? Can I? Can I be loved?→When I said to myself that I am not this thing I’ve been told I have to be, that I am this other thing instead, then the label didn’t feel like a prison… it’s not a refutation. It’s a key.→It was so much easier to be loved than to have to do any of the desperate work of loving.→(view spoiler)[“I want to love you. If you’ll let me.” (hide spoiler)]My only complaint is small. I will be saying absolutely nothing new when I say that the ghost chapters are sort of weird and don’t add that much to the actual narrative. They are meant to work as a parallel story about both misogyny and the way desire for the wrong person can work us into knots. The thing is, Adam’s chapters are so incredibly good that I gave this a five anyway. I am going to defend that decision to my dying day. The emotional catharsis of it all.

Rowell has a tendency to be incredibly long-winded. She also has a tendency to keep in fluff scenes. She also doesn't have too much talent for dramatic tension. All these things added together make for one really really long book. The character building here is good, but again, I have some issues. While Cath is a well-developed character, her character arc falls pretty flat. The ending is rushed and abrupt. Her issues with writing outside of Simon Snow's world are never resolved. What is the point of such a long book when you don't resolve your main character's arc? Rowell does succeed with the romance here as well. Their development is not too angsty or drawn-out. They've got good banter. But I was left a little cold. Sometimes books like this build up a dream boyfriend rather than a dream relationship, hoping to market the book to people wishing for a really cute, full-of-personality boyfriend, someone as sweet and genuine as Levi. It's a strategy that works for the most part, until anyone who doesn't want a Levi reads the book. This is all to say that I don't want a Levi, and it made the romance fall flat for me.  I would recommend this one, because it's a sweet book and it's a pick-me-up.

This is perhaps one of the most disappointing books I read in 2017. Psalm For Lost Girls starts out as a decent suspense novel with an especially nice writing style, but it falls apart quickly in the second half. Psalm For Lost Girls has a fantastic premise. Protagonist Katie tries to cope with the recent death of her sister, who is praised as a saint throughout her town. It's a book all about how belief can turn to idolization quickly. The first half of this book is, admittedly, high quality. The writing is gorgeous. The main character sometimes talks to her sister using the second person, and it works very well as a rhetorical device. The problem comes in the second half. While I was intrigued by the plot in the first half, the second half loses dramatic tension far too quickly. While Psalm For Last Girls begins with intrigue and interest, it soon becomes boring. The kidnapper was essentially revealed halfway through the book, and at that point, there immediately wasn't much left to look forward to. My impression was that the author attempted to focus on character development in the second half. Unfortunately, Katie's character arc focused more on romance than on her own personal change. I was also not a fan of romance; it's a bit instalovey, and I've never cared for dead sister's boyfriend x live sister romances.

And this book did do both those things. It completely screwed with my head. But now that I've seriously thought about this book, I have some seriously mixed feelings.Do you know why I feel so mixed? Because up until the ending, this book is fabulous. The characters are flawed, the message is extremely emotionally cathartic, and it's all topped off with a bucketload of tears. While the first 150 pages are solidly in the realm of “buildup,” the middle 100 pages of this book belong to a higher class of novels. And I can easily forgive a long buildup if it's a fantastic one. The buildup of this book was absolutely brilliant. Look, you can find a thousand s gushing about every single individual aspect of this book. I say this to get across just how much I loved this book. If the ending of this book had been even remotely hopeful, or offered a hopeful future, I would've given it five stars and a spot on my favorite-books-of-all-time shelf. But the ending is, bar none, one of the most needlessly tragic and horrifying things I've ever read. The message of this book, up till the end, is about hate. It's a reaffirming storyline about why you should never attempt to change your sexuality, how you can't. But the last 50 pages of this book... man, I don't know. They feel like some weird bullshit narrative punishment for questioning your sexuality. Here's the thing: we already got that being gay sucks. I don't see how this ending adds to the message. Isn't it more productive to end in hope for the future? Maybe give the queer kids reading this book something to look for? Why is it deeper somehow to end in sadness?To me, this felt like a prime example of Queers Die For the Straight Eye. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I really don't understand the point of the ending. What's the message? What's the moral in this outright tragedy? Clearly many readers of this book loved the ending. But frankly, I despise the ending. After 300-some pages of emotional catharsis over why you shouldn't change yourself, why should the protagonist forget everything about who he is?I'm just exhausted by how pat this all felt, how done-before. Unhappy books about unrequited gay love are not game changing. This is a very good book, but the sheer tragedy of the ending really stopped me from loving this book.

Malala Youfsazi is one of my forever heroes, and I love her so, so much. Unfortunately, this book and I didn’t click. Mainly, the writing style is just too clinical. Moments where she addresses incredibly important topics come off as detached. Other ers have pointed out the lack of emotion in the scene where she is shot. It’s understandable; I can’t imagine going through that kind of trauma and surviving. But this unemotional tone stays around for the entire book, and it’s tiring. The book also has major pacing problems. There’s some really interesting info about politics here, and there’s some really interesting info about Malala herself. But the story doesn’t switch between these two topics nearly enough. Two hundred pages will be spent on politics, and then a hundred on her, with no mixing. This is almost certainly due to the switches between authors, but it’s still unpleasant to read.This book is still worth reading if only because Malala herself wrote it. Her story is so inspiring and important. ...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,Jan 2015,"Dec 10, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17851885-i-am-malala

The two main characters, Lorelie and Jason, both read fairly real. It's got the perfect amount of optimism, but with some conflict beneath the surface.Really, the only thing about this that genuinely bothered me was the Emma side plot. Her character seemed very jammed-in, and altogether didn't prove anything. She was a stereotypical mean girl mean to cause meaningless conflict. Jason and Lorelie's personal struggles caused plenty of conflict without needing to add a mean girl character.

This book started with such potential and it really did not come to fruition. The first bit of this book impressed me a fair amount! Maria Dahvana Headley's writing was very good. The character work seemed filled with potential. Aza was sarcastic and funny in all the right ways, and her love interest, Jason, was genuine and sweet. Their relationship was cute enough that I genuinely rooted for them to get together. Some of us, the ones actually dying, are maybe less fascinated than others. Some of us, maybe, would rather not get stuck in rooms where people are regularly talking about celebrity death-y things, whichever kind you want, the OD, the car crash, the mystery fall apart…The main issue is the long and cliche middle section. The author takes this creative concept and shoves it into a typical ya fantasy book.—> This world sounds so fascinating and original, but really this ends up as a typical ""chosen one must save world"" plot. Complete with training montages. Also, some blatant use of the ""girl is cured of her disability because MAGIC"" plot twist. Also, girl meets long lost parent who is leader of magical world trope. ALL THE TROPES.—> There was no character development! This is such a huge issue for me. These characters had such potential, but they went nowhere whatsoever. Honestly, Aza seemed to develop in a negative direction. Aza's narration towards the beginning and end is sarcastic and funny, but in the middle section it's all about her two crushes.—> Let's talk about those two crushes. Yes, this has a love triangle. And it's a bad one. We already know who wins. Jason is a narrator, so did love interest #2 even have a chance? The love triangle is made even worse by the fact that love interest #2 is the archetypal bag of dicks. Please, don't do this to me. —> The one light at the end of the tunnel was the intriguing worldbuilding, but even that was barely explained. None of the setting is described in sufficient detail, so the magical world concept ends up barely even impressive. The plotting was messy. There's no dramatic tension surrounding the reveals; things are just not explained. There are also some massive pacing issues.

I share the Gray Man's opinion on who the protagonist is.)This book defies rating. I'd feel terrible about giving this such a high rating, because there's so much disappointment here. But I'd also feel terrible giving it any less stars, because, yknow, I shed actual literal tears. This last book is a bit of disappointment in some ways, and life-changing in others. So be prepared for a mixed . Let's be honest: this book is anticlimactic. Noah is sidelined basically because the author didn't know what to do with him anymore, and an entirely new character is thrown in. This doesn't work for a final book. Henry's addition would've been awesome if it didn't happen in the last book for no reason. He's actually a decent character but... why is he here suddenly? Does anyone actually... understand... As a book, The Raven King is a masterpiece. As a series conclusion, it's a failure.CONCLUSION FAIL: BECAUSE I'M AN ASSHOLE LIKE THATOkay, here's the deal. I loved Blue in the earlier books. I loved Gansey in the earlier books. I REALLY loved their relationship in TDT and in BLLB. They're both interesting characters. But they just kinda... weren't interesting here. Why? Because Blue and Gansey still didn't get any goddamn character arcs. WHY. If your main character and main character's love interest don't grow and change, but the two secondary (technically) characters do? I'm automatically going to like those secondary characters more, no matter how interesting the two main characters are. So much wasted potential. So, so much wasted potential. This is a sore spot because Blue and Gansey really needed arcs, in my view. Gansey has so much potential if he could realize his privileges and try to use them for good. Blue needed to develop through her friendships with the squad, because she clearly does, and it's not really touched on. I'm also a little annoyed that the squad didn't get their different quarrels worked out. Adam and Gansey's relationship especially strikes me as kind of toxic, and it's never addressed or fixed. Ronan and Gansey's friendship has issues too– Gansey acts as if Ronan can't do anything himself. These two dynamics each had a lot of potential, but because they're never resolved, they end up unappealing. ONE MORE CHARACTER ARC COMPLAINT. While I love almost all of Ronan's arc, I found his ending slightly unsatisfying. [spoilers ahead, maybe?] His ending revolves around the Barns and his father, and it's a little ambiguous, but I don't like the idea that Ronan is going to stay at the barns his while life. It's basically the sight where his childhood got so messy, and I'm glad he confronted his issues about it, but I feel like his character would have benefited from being able to leave. EDIT: Maybe this was just left open for the next trilogy. In general, three of these character arcs felt incomplete.Another complaint: moments that are supposed to be poignant are just confusing. I'm not even really sure what happened in the ending scene. All I actually remember about it is that Blue and Gansey finally kissed and I cried about Adam and Ronan for literally ten minutes. I'm pretty sure I almost put the book down because I was crying so hard. Again, that would be totally awesome! I love ambiguity. But this is THE LAST BOOK. Please explain things. In some ways, maybe those poignant memories are more important than knowing what actually happened. I don't know yet. THE BOOK AS A MIDDLE BOOK basically everything having to do with Adam. I love him so much I'm crying typing thisFirst of all, this book is a lot more fast-paced than books one and three. The faster pace, along with Ronan's point of view, harkened back to my glorious favorite, The Dream Thieves. Adam's character arc is even MORE my favorite. Like, this series would be worth reading JUST for his character. I've only read one other series where more than one character resonates with me this much. He's such a real character; he's flawed and angry but he's trying. His constant self-awareness, his self destructive ambition, his confidence contrasting with his self-doubt... it all feels like a callout post for ME. God, I can't talk about this without crying. Please just trust me that Adam's arc is one of the greatest character arcs of all time. In the end, it turns out I'm shallow and am willing to ignore any flaws in favor of character development. I'm giving this so many stars because I'm still in love with Ronan and Adam's characters arcs. And their love. I am very much in love with their love. I'm going to put some hipster-y quotes about them here later. Some of which I got spoiled on AGES ago. Thanks, guys. IN SUMMARY Here's a quick rundown of my thoughts about this book for posterity. ADAM AND RONAN (no, I'm not using the ship name, it's terrible): 10 starsADAM'S CHARACTER ARC: 10 trillion stars, more stars than I will ever give anything againRONAN'S CHARACTER ARC: 3 stars because I love it a lot but... I hate the ending. EVERYTHING ELSE: 2.5 stars. That clearly averages out to at least 4.5 stars. I don't CARE that Adam's rating is an outlier and therefore shouldn't be counted. I recommend this series to everyone simply on a basis of how much I LOVE the characters, despite my reservations about this specific book. PreReadIt's Time for Ronan and Adam to kiss.

Blue Lily Lily Blue is a totally different beast than the Dream Thieves, but it's so good. Even thinking about this book makes me... so happy. I think what's funny about this series is I keep having problems with it but I'm okay with it - these books are as messy as life, as fucked up and emotionally charged and full of errors that won't ever be resolved. As I've said in my s for The Raven Boys, The Dream Thieves, Blue Lily, Lily Blue, and The Raven King, I love all of these characters so much, on a level of my soul that most fictional characters do not touch. Because these books are genuinely magic.→why am I bitter?←I will be very honest and say I think these books deserve praise for characters, not plot. The plot of Blue Lily, Lily Blue, specifically was... eh? What happened in this book? Because I'm genuinely not sure I know. And yeah, some of that is Maggie's trademark style. But there wasn't not much tension because I never knew what the fuck was happening. Confusing, magical-realism-esque plot is Maggie's trademark. Apparently. I will also say that Ronan never narrated chapters, and that really did sadden me, because he has such a distinct narrative style from Gansey and Adam and Blue! Sad. Also, Blue and Gansey still aren't progressing as characters. Give them the character development they deserve.→why am I in love?←So first of all, adorable scenes with the #squad always get me going. I especially loved the courtroom scene. I want a friend group like the raven squad. Without the dead Welsh kings and excess testosterone, maybe.In general, I think this book is one of the best in the series for all the relationships. There is so much fantastic relationship building in this book. Blue and Gansey's relationship makes me more emotional by the minute. I care about Gansey and Adam's vaguely gay friendship so much. I am physically hurt inside by Ronan and Blue being bros.And I like to die!Ronan knew Adam, but Adam wasn't sure he knew Ronan at all.Also, side note, I stand by every update I made about this book.→why am I dead inside?←Uh, um, so there’s a character in this book that - literally - has my personality. So I want to talk about that. Why did he care if Gansey and Ronan saw this? They already knew. They knew everything about him. What a lie unknowable was. The only person who didn't know Adam was himself.There’s this thing this character does, where he is one of the most Outwardly Stable members of his friend group, and he is also going through so much and probably hasn’t slept since 1920, and yet he still manages to come off as a very pragmatic rational person. most of the time. but his internal monologue around himself just fucking drips with emotional tiredness and, below that, this sense of self-loathing. he compartmentalizes his feelings and also lets himself break down. there’s a scene in the third book of this series where he’s interacting with someone in his life who hurt him, so much, and he responds to it by completely dissociating for a full chapter and it read like my inner monologue in that. exact. situation.Oh, and he has my flaws. so that’s really fun! I love confessionals. he is… incredibly aware of his own flaws and yet completely unwilling to admit flaws, because he is so used to people turning around and throwing them right back in his face. that’s me. he is completely incapable of receiving gifts because he knows that at any moment, they can be thrown back in his face, with him as the ungrateful one. that’s me. and he worries, all the time, both subtly and unsubtly, that he is a danger to others, and he is on the verge of becoming his parents. his entire character arc is based around him realizing he isn’t. and that was so fucking painful and so fucking relatable and I don’t know how to handle it.His constant self-awareness, his self destructive ambition, his confidence contrasting with his self-doubt. every chapter he narrates felt like someone had come into my home and stolen my obscure thought processes and I hate it and I am so. invested. in it.I might lose my mind thinking about this.

I think I'm going with 3rd favorite ever. This book is mysterious and dramatic and weird as fuck, but it's undeniable how much it made me fall in love with these characters and how much their particular arcs stayed with me. // THE OPPOSITE OF SECOND BOOK SYNDROMEI didn't expect to love this book nearly as much as I did. I know a lot of ers say this, but I really want to emphasize how little I expected to obsess over this. If I'm being honest, I only somewhat liked book one. It took me at least a week to read, which is so not normal for me. So naturally, I figured picking up this book at nine on a school night would be fine. I'd put it down 50 pages later. No big deal. Flash forward to me, five hours before I had to wake up for school, crying on my bed after finishing the book in four hours flat. I usually am responsible. This book somewhat ruined that. It was definitely worth it. If you remember my  of The Raven Boys, you might know I actually had a ton of issues with that book. But I really think this book alleviated that, both by fixing my concerns, and by improving. The Dream Thieves is my fave by far, but Blue Lily Lily Blue is just as fabulous, and The Raven King has a lot of great stuff going for it too [though I think it's overall not as strong as the two middle books aka my loves]. So. Let's talk about why I love this book so, so much. // CHARACTER WORK AND UNRELIABLE NARRATOR: A STUDYI think it's safe to say that this book shines based on character development, not based on plot. That's not to say the plot is bad - I'd give it a solid four - but it's not worthy of a five-star gush. The characters, though, are maybe interesting than any I've read before. Ronan gave in to the brief privilege of hating himself, as he always did in church. There was something satisfying about acknowledging this hatred, something relieving about this little present he allowed himself each Sunday.♚ I adore Ronan's character arc. Ronan's goddamn character arc is the only thing I felt emotions for at least 48 hours after reading this book. It's so well built and written! His development is really subtle over the course of the book, and yet I got so attached to this character so quickly. This isn't even my character archetype!! I know all of you love bad-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold, but honestly, I've hardly ever seen this trope done well. This book does the trope well. Ronan's character is written as so powerful and deep. His arc was just... one of the most flawless character arcs I've ever read. I'm going to go into some other minor spoilers in this paragraph; they're actually things that I wouldn't consider spoilers in literally any other book, but I feel as if I almost would've preferred letting this specific character arc dawn on me. But if you don't care - Ronan's arc follows his struggle with depression, and his struggle with internalized homophobia. Can I just say that both aspects are done perfectly. oh my god, it's actually kind of upsetting how relatable this character was at some points. We are totally different people. And yet his experiences and thought processes are so relevant to me. I was... totally spoiled about that whole second secret thing. Thanks, guys. But you know what, that did not stop me from full-on sobbing at THAT reveal. (view spoiler)[  Adam was in the dream, too; he traced the tangled pattern of ink with his finger. He said, ""Scio quid hoc est."" As he traced it further and further down on the bare skin of Ronan's back, Ronan himself disappeared entirely, and the tattoo got smaller and smaller. It was a Celtic knot the size of a wafer, and then Adam, who had become Kavinsky, said ""Scio quid estis vos."" He put the tattoo in his mouth and swallowed it.Ronan woke with a start, ashamed and euphoric.The euphoria wore off long before the shame did.He was never sleeping again.(hide spoiler)]It was nothing, but it was Adam Parrish's nothing. How he hated and loved it. How proud he was of it, how wretched it was.♔ Adam... oh my god. I know some people don't like Adam in this book, and I have to admit I somewhat get it. But listen - in hindsight, his character arc here is fantastic. Yes, I'm aware he's always angry and scared this entire book, but it is completely reasonable at this point. His character gets far more dynamic and developed. He's so easy to relate to for me that it's hard to be annoyed by his shitty behavior. Probably check out my  for book three for more on How Much I Love Adam's Character Arc: the saga. His arc is actually the most flawless character arc I've ever read. Sorry, Ronan. You know how I said I relate to Ronan even though we're totally different people? Adam... I feel differently. This character and I are actually really similar. Like, I-feel-like-I'm-being-called-out-whenever-he-internal-monologues similar. And I actually adore that. I love how fucking real this character feels, how realistic and genuine. Just her and the pink switchblade. They were a good pair. Both incapable of opening up without cutting someone.♚ I think this is maybe the book in the series where I genuinely loved both Blue the most. [Okay, book three even more so.] I feel like Blue's character goes up and down for me. I love the potential of her character, and I love the contrast she forms towards some of the other characters. I also love that she's... just trying to get through life, in this way that's profound and fucked up and real.// MULTIFACETED RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS♔ I did really love Blue and Gansey's romantic buildup. It's not a spoiler because we all knew it was coming from the beginning of book one. They're destined for each other, yeah, yeah, we get it, right? But no. I am actually super annoyed at how many people write off these books as ""paranormal romance that I won't read"" just because of the destined romance thing. Because oh boy, that is so inaccurate. Marketing issue - their plotline is so much more interesting than just that. I really enjoyed seeing them develop and come closer; the late-night phone calls and sweetness just really work for me. I also enjoy that Gansey is such a non-archetypal YA boyfriend, and wow I love that this series' grand romantic love interest is an anxious pretentious nerd mess.♚ You want to talk about relationship development porn? Because oh my god, I do. You. All. Know. What. I'm. Talking. About. What a completely heartbreaking relationship dynamic.(view spoiler)[Sometimes Ronan thought Adam was so used to the right way being painful that he doubted any path that didn’t come with agony.The goddamn mask scene is literally one of my favorite scenes in anything ever. (hide spoiler)]“So what you're saying is you can't explain it.""""I did explain it.""""No, you used nouns and verbs together in a pleasing but illogical format.”♔ There's still plenty of hilarious banter between all the characters of the Raven squad. I love banter and I love group dynamics, so this was a plus. Friendships between all of the Raven squad are really built up here. Possibly the best moment of the book is when (view spoiler)[Blue kissed Noah (hide spoiler)]. It was heartbreaking in all the right ways. ♚ Every character of this series, including the side characters, are all so complex and individual on their own. This book gives Persephone, Maura, and Calla a lot more depth well. Just. Every character. ♔ Kavinsky and the Grey Man as the villains. Okay, you all know I adore having villains as narrative parallels, and I think Kavinsky is one of the most complex I've ever seen. I do want to say that I hate the guy. Can I say that. The Grey Man, though, was awesome. I heard someone call the end of his arc ""anticlimactic"" and I have to say it's genuinely one of my favorite scenes ever so??// PLOTTING IS MY FAVORITE♔ The plot of this book has nothing to do with Glendower, and I don't care at all. Honestly, this may be the best plotting of any of the books. The Dream Thieves gives an intriguing, well-drawn plot which never slows down. There aren't any moments where the book halts and stops progressing, despite some where nothing is explicitly happening. Every scene either builds plot, builds character, or does both. It's usually both. ♚ Of course, the writing style. Her style is super pretty, and it adds so much atmosphere and mood to this story. ♔ I LOVE ALL THE PARALLELS AND THE SYMBOLISM AND SHIT LIKE THAT. Maggie Stiefvater is really, really great at this aspect of writing, and I feel like these books are really great because you could miss all the symbolism and still love it, but you could also catch everything and then analyze it for 45 hours. There's a metaphorical sex dream in this book that parallels a scene two books later and honestly that's just wild on so many levels and I love it. (view spoiler)[I know what this is vs. I know what you are and “he was never sleeping again” aka the rudest fucking chapter of this book which I plan to cry about for the next 18 consecutive hours. (hide spoiler)] And there's also... so much more, including that one scene that I think about all the time, and okay I'm just going to fucking yell: (view spoiler)[the parallel... between the mask scene... and the scene at the end of book four... christ it's been six months and I'm still gay crying thinking about this!! (hide spoiler)]bold of you all to assume I could get through this  without keysmashing. // THEMES, MORALS, AND MORALITY Okay, there are actually a ton of things I want to talk about here at some point. I am writing a fucking essay. Someday. For now, I have this one singular thing written down:♔ I think it's really interesting that the grey man is redeemed but Kavinsky isn't. I think Stiefvater has an interesting kind of approach to morality, where it's not necessarily about what you do, but about why you do it. // SOME COMPLAINTS AND NEGATIVES♔ Here's a section I'm going to call Blue Sargent and Internalized Misogyny. There's even one moment where some borderline slut-shaming happens. Emma talked about this more in maybe the most popular three star  ever. Listen, don't tell me Militant Feminist Blue Sargent would really act like that. Her cousin is wearing a bikini. Why do we care about this. ♚ Also! The lack of diversity is a thing. I'm sorry, Blue literally does not know a single girl her age. And everyone's white or racially ambiguous. I think I also said at some point that the first book was obnoxiously heterosexual and full of random subtext with no payoff, but I'm taking that comment back. I'm taking it all back. I apologize I've committed slanderAnyway listen this is one of my favorite books of all time and it fucked me up and I love it. I adore the characters and the parallels and the writing all so much.Anyway.

So here's a  to tie up my thoughts. THE GOODThe writing style is gorgeous. Highsmith's prose drips with descriptions. At times it's almost too much description, but the story flows very nicely. Terese is a very well-drawn character. While her initial character is annoyingly timid, she has good character growth and becomes a much more likable character. THE BADThat's the end of my list of good things. The Price of Salt wraps around a romance, which unfortunately didn't work for me. Carol comes off as a fairly unlikable character in this book. She's incredibly condescending to Therese, and since we don't see her point of view, she comes off very cold. Which isn't true in the movie, since we do see her point of view! I know the book is always better than the movie, but this is a three-star book and a five-star movie we're talking about here. The Price of Salt is also slow-paced and the first half is extremely boring. Do I recommend?Not really. However, The Price of Salt is an extremely important novel in history– the first book published with a happy ending for a lesbian couple. I almost feel u should recommend it on that merit alone....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,Mar 2016,"Dec 04, 2016","Nov 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25622850-carol

I enjoyed this book a lot, it just didn't change my life. Characters: 4.5 stars. The two main characters were three-dimensional, and I've never read such a complex, well-developed friendship in a novel before. Bo and Agnes' friendship is interesting, and Keplinger's really examines the dynamics that make them friends. So many books I've read focus on romance, but this book truly does focus on friendship. Writing: 4 stars. There's nothing particularly special about Keplinger's writing style, but it flows really nicely down the page, and that's what it needs to do. Plot: 2 stars. This is the major weakness of this book. There is no plotting. This book honestly doesn't feel outlined. In the end, the book didn't feel quite as impactful as it could have due to the boring plot. Also, one last shoutout for the representation. One of the girls is disabled and one is bisexual, and both qualities are treated with respect, yet neither takes over the character.

And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why. Order of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius... It deals with the deep emotional stuff in a way that the first few books didn't, with the possible exception of Prisoner of Azkaban. This book will make you cry.⭐️Interlude: In Defense of Harry's Angst PhaseHarry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. Literally every single person who cares about him. You try being dropped in that situation and not being upset, especially as a fifteen-year-old. But what really stands out here is Harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. This book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant. Return To Actual ReviewJ.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts in this book. The darker tone really takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work. Order of the Pheonix is so dark and yet so hopeful. It's about resisting oppression in any way you can and it's just a perfect fucking book god I love this book so much The plotting is brilliant, incorporating one of the most terrifying villains I have ever read about in my entire life. She's so human and that's what makes her such a terrifying character. Also, the plot reveals at the end. The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville. The side characters and the entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. There's something incredibly powerful in Harry Potter, who has worked alone the last few books, needing to ask for help. Harry realizes that he doesn't have to be alone. This book also deals with the fact that adults aren't perfect, even when they love you and want to help you. Also, Ginny Weasley is fucking perfect. Why do all of you sleep on her verbal DRAG of Harry? “I forgo–” “LUCKY YOU” This book is also undoubtedly the funniest of the series. Fred and George. The school resistance to Umbridge.

The ending is mind blowing. My main complaint is that the sideplots are terrible. Harry and Ron and Hermione... were not at their bests in this book. There's too much drama between Ron and Harry and Hermione, in the first half, and while that drama is character-driven and well executed, it's not enjoyable to read about. And that's the only half-decent subplot. The Rita Skeeter drama is just flat-out skeevy to me, and I find it really difficult to read. And the entire SPEW movement is... not incredible.

Remember the reveals at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban? The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville? It's clever and built up books in advance. The side characters are so developed and interesting here. So many series barely bother with any characters other than the protagonist, yet this series doesn't miss that opportunity. The entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. And no, the movies are not as good. I have one major problem with the HP movies, and it has nothing to do with scenes being cut. No, I’m talking about scenes in the book being edited. Ron’s best lines are often given to Hermoine, examples including “you’ll have to go through us!!” Other lines of his are edited; a scene where he defends Hermione is replaced by one where he tears her down. The characters just don't come through well. No  can really sum this series up, but it's worth a read for everyone.

I empathized with Parker's character and felt that I was inside her head to some degree. HOWEVER. Not all girlfriends-in-the-way are going to be abuse victims, they just deserve to not be hated anyway. This was definitely not intentional, but the message comes off as “sometimes the other woman will have more going on under the surface” rather than “another girl doesn't deserve to be hated for being in the way”. It's an oversimplified message, and it undermines the book. The main problem with the book is that the very dark themes felt incredibly simplified, like the book was written for someone younger. It was all very Disney. I'd recommend this book for preteens, even though the characters are teens. That's not necessarily a bad thing! It just doesn't work in a book about high schoolers.

The character development here hasn't taken place, the relationships aren't quite there yet. That kind of thing. But please believe me when I say you need to continue. I've linked some of my series s below. // THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS SERIES♔ So, it's not a romance. It's Very Not A Romance. Honestly, a lot of the focus ends up being on friendship. And all the friendships are so good?? Even the main couples of the series are friends first before being in love which obviously I am A Slut for. ♚ The character work. Okay, granted, this is more a factor of books two and three - my FAVES - but it's uncontroversial that Stiefvater lays the groundwork here for some truly amazing character arcs. Every character here whirs with potential. Adam, Gansey, and Blue all come off as complex and developed, each with their own hopes, dreams, and fears. “I guess I make things that need energy stronger. I'm like a walking battery.""""You're the table everyone wants at Starbucks,"" Gansey mused as he began to walk again.Blue blinked. ""What?""Over his shoulder, Gansey said, ""Next to the wall plug.”♔ The banter. This falls into the category of friendship for sure, but I'm going to be honest, it's one of my favorite parts of this series. ♚ Maggie Stiefvater's glorious writing style. I really, really like her writing style. She has an interesting narrational style that somehow never seems pretentious. I'm sure some are going to despise it, but I think it'll be a slim minority; her words might take me a long time to read, but it is absolutely worth it. ♔ It just straight up gets a whole lot better?? I mean, any of you who know me know that book two is one of my top three favorite books of all time. As an individual book, I think it's as pitch-perfect as you can get. Even if you're not a fan of book one, give book two a chance. It's more adventurous, with even more character work and even less romance. Here are my s for the The Dream Thieves, Blue Lily Lily Blue, and The Raven King.// THE BAD ABOUT THIS BOOK, OR WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP READING EVEN IF YOU DON'T LOVE THIS♔ The Raven Boys is really slow, especially in comparison to the other ones. The plot here is downright boring at times, and the villain is laughable. Not in a ""ha, ha"" way, he's just not a scary villain. ♚ The characters aren't quite developed enough yet. They're already good characters, but the character work here is not nearly as unforgettable as in books two through four. This book really focuses on exposition on who the characters are now. Ronan doesn't have a defined character yet (which is definitely not a complaint I have about book two.) And Adam is a bit of an asshole in this book. Given what's going on his life, I actually totally understood his behavior. Unfortunately, he's also not nearly as dynamic and developed here. Also, Gansey is the literal embodiment of #richpeopleproblems. He's complex and I wanted to like him for that reason, but he ended up getting on my nerves, especially in his interactions with Adam. ♔ Love triangles stopped being interesting at least five years ago. Adam and Blue just... don't have much going on?? Okay, maybe I only felt that way because I know who the series' endgame couples are. Sue me. It was still a little painful reading a not-that-special romance when I knew they were going to break up. GENERAL PROBLEMS WITH THE SERIES AS A WHOLE♔ #Richpeopleproblems. Okay, genuinely, Adam is probably my favorite character just because he's such a voice of reason. There's some part in this book where Gansey buys, like, a pool table? And it's ridiculous, and the narrative knows it's ridiculous, yet also somewhat romanticizes it. Bad concept. Blocked. ♚ Blue and Gansey don't have full character arcs, and I get that it's kind of the point, but I still hate it. Blue is supposed to be the protagonist, yet she doesn't grow and change much besides falling in love. Gansey is supposed to be the protagonist, yet he basically doesn't change at all even though he has so much potential. oh my god. I mean, Stiefvater writes two AMAZING character arcs, so I can't really complain. Look, Maggie, I don't lie awake at night crying about Blue Sargent's character arc. I know you can make me lie awake at night crying about character arcs. Just try it more on your actual protagonists next time. ♔ Here's a section I'm going to call Blue Sargent and Internalized Misogyny. See, the thing is, Blue's misgyny seems like it's purposeful. I think Stiefvater makes it pretty clear that she doesn't necessarily agree - there's even a post on her blog about Blue's misogyny. But it's... never actually subverted, and oh boy, the not-like-other-girls here is strong. There's even one moment where some borderline slut-shaming happens. Emma talked about this more in maybe the most popular three star  ever. (ALSO HERE'S HER REVIEW FOR THIS BOOK YALL.) Point is, the not like other girls trope can die the death it deserves, thanks. also this entire series deserves a remake except every main character is a girl thanks for coming to my ted talk♚ Also! The lack of diversity is a thing. I'm sorry, Blue literally does not know a single girl her age and that's ridiculous and dumb as shit. And everyone's white or racially ambiguous. I think I also said at some point that this first book was obnoxiously heterosexual and full of random subtext with no payoff, but I'm taking that comment back. I'm taking it all back. I apologize. can I please point you all to that absurd tvtropes page where someone clearly thought they were being queerbaited the whole time it's the funniest thing I've read in my lifeVERDICT: On the whole, The Raven Boys is a good book, but it's not that special - it's the rest of the series that really stands out in comparison and solidified my love for this.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter (complete w related handle) | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,115,1,"Nov 26, 2016","Nov 27, 2016","Nov 26, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17675462-the-raven-boys

Except for the protagonist and her love interest. Shocking, right? At some point, the deaths are just no longer effective and add nothing to the plot. The ending also doesn't really tie up the main plot, only one character's story.

I do not have the Words To Convey how much this ending for a series meant to mehere was my lowkey spoilery initial list of what I wanted out of this sequel:• please let Radu be happy• you know exactly who I want him to be happy with• LET NAZIRA REUNITE WITH HER WIFE• Mehmed dying maybe • honestly I think Lada's going to die no matter what for historicity if nothing else• please just let Radu, Nazira, Fatima, and Cyprian be gay in peace. please Kiersten White I'm a nice persondid all of this happen? not necessarily. but did I find this conclusion incredibly satisfying and one of my favorite series conclusions ever? hell yes.Okay, so basic TL;DR: This book is my second favorite series conclusion I have ever read [after literally my favorite book ever] and nothing can ever beat it and oh my fucking god, I loved this.This series is political and character driven, which is... such a deep mood for me. This series is about misogyny, about internalized homophobia, about religion, about learning what you deserve in a world that wants you to accept nothing.It is a character and theme study that I just… adore. So much.Radu had been wrong all this time. He had felt guilty for the way his heart yearned for other men. But it was not his own love that was poisonous and destructive. His love destroyed nothing, hurt no one. Lada loved Wallachia above all else, and this was the result. What Mehmed and Lada did—because of what they set their hearts on with both people and land—was far worse than anything Radu’s love could ever lead him to do. It was an odd sort of thing to take comfort in, but he accepted it. Nazira was right. His love had no evil in it. He could not say the same for his sister’s.Radu's characterization has come so far since And I Darken - in Now I Rise, Kiersten White really made me love him, and I just... relate to him so much. I love how well Radu’s sexuality is written. He is so careful about expressing his love for other men, and it’s so realistic not only to the period, but also to my experiences in our current world. Kiersten White is really one of the few not-openly-queer authors I trust most with writing queer characters. There was something to be said for having his heart broken so many times. Broken things healed thicker and stronger than they were before. Assuming one survived long enough to heal.And then… there’s Lada. Lada, who I hate and empathize with at the same time. I love how cunning Lada is, how she does everything differently than expected. Every moment of planning she has made me want to scream with joy. And my favorite Lada quote is a spoiler, so I can't put it here, but I think she's one of the best-written antiheroes I've read recently and I really like it?I really feel like this series went so far past its original sort-of-fucked-up-love-triangle focus. The most important relationships here are predominantly platonic. Lada and Radu. Lada and Nicolae [I’d die for them]. And then there's Radu and Nazira, who I basically ship platonically harder than I have ever shipped anything romantically. “I am sorry, then.” “To be right?” Nazira laughed. “It is a heavy burden, always being right. But some of us must bear it.” “I am grateful you bear it for me, as I am not qualified to carry it myself.”Speaking of which, I AM GIVING RADU AND NAZIRA THE PARAGRAPH THEY DESERVE. Kiersten White is really out here givin the gays everything they want!! They touched cheeks! They held hands!!!!! They platonically love each other so deeply and it's fucking gorgeous!!!!! They are… literally worth the world to me and I adore them and I’d just die for them. Nazira and Radu invented mlm / wlw solidarity and that's so valid. Radu put a hand over his heart, wondering if he would feel her death, if he would know. They had been separated for so long. She had looked at him that night in Mehmed’s tent as though faced with a memory, not a man.Also… listen. Guys. Radu and Lada. Every time Radu and Lada think about each other I want to cry.But honestly, the most important thing about this whole book was the ending. Because, okay, I have a lot of thoughts, but I don't want to say them, because this book is not even fucking released yet, but also, I have to say them? So please, if you have not read this book, this is the end of the . Pretend it's the end. Bye.Nazira had not exaggerated her intentions. She let go of Fatima only when absolutely necessary. Radu leaned back on his cushion, smiling to himself as Nazira tried to navigate eating dinner while keeping hold of Fatima’s hand at all times.So... the found family ending of this is the best-ever subversion of the bury your gays trope I have ever read in my entire fucking life and I.... legitimately cried. You should have seen me and Chaima, one of my bffs on this hellsite, screaming in the DMs both reading this at the same time. We were such fucking messes and it meant even more to her, as a Muslim queer person, than it did to me, and I just... wow I'm a wreck?And also... Radu chose people over power.

People are realizing and shouOthers are fighting too, even in the garden, where sometimes it feels like there's not a lot worth fighting for. People are realizing and shouting and marching and demanding. They're not forgetting. I think that's the most important part.This book was just fabulous.The Hate U Give is about the black lives matter campaign. It's an ownvoices novel set from the point of view of a girl whose childhood friend is shot in front of her. She's the only witness to what happened, but for obvious reasons, she doesn't want the publicity. Starr is forced to choose between her own loyalties and her personal feelings. There are two things I look for in contemporary YA: 1) original themes, and 2) good characters. This book nails both. Angie Thomas spends so much time with her characters here. Starr is such a developed, multidimensional character. She's clearly written with so much heart and honesty. Her inner conflicts are so believable. Every side character is treated with just as much respect and honesty as she is. In terms of original themes, there's no book better. The Hate U Give doesn't just tackle the black lives matter movement. It also tackles the prejudice we, as a society, have against drug dealers. Khalil was dealing drugs so he could get the money for college, but Starr can't tell anyone that or public opinion will turn against him even more. It's a terrible predicament for him to have been in, and The Hate U Give really looks at the automatic disgust we feel when we look at drug dealers. The book also portrays the ghetto as something different from wholly negative. Angie Thomas also takes a look at subtle racism in interracial relationships, which is a topic I've never seen covered before. There's even a look at sympathy towards cops (Starr's uncle is a cop). Thomas juggles all of these different issues deftly. WE ARE GOING INTO THE DISCOURSE SECTION. If someone says that I'm hating my roots again on this  I am not going to be at all happy. Be civil, for the love of god. If you disagree, please comment nicely.This book doesn't exaggerate racism. I'm white, and I've heard people say things far worse than what's portrayed in this book. If I've heard this sort of thing said about black people as a white person, I can't imagine how bad it gets. And no! White people do not suffer from systematic oppression in the US. Xenophobia, yes, especially in Europe. Racism, no. White people can be discriminated against, but we don't suffer from institutional discrimination like black people and other people of color do. People who were born before the civil rights movement are still alive. I'm a white person and I've never faced systematic racism. That is all anyone is saying. This isn't about hating white people; this is saying that white people don't suffer systematic oppression and microaggressions for being white. I've seen a few people mention concerns about ""reverse racism"" in the book. I don't agree. The concerns offered in this book against white people aren't about their whiteness; it's about these characters' privilege. Starr doesn't have issues with Chris because of his skin color; she has issues with their relationship because he has far more privilege than she does. In context, these issues are handled with nuance and care. I understand why people were uncomfortable with a few of the joking comments about white people, but it's a realistic conversation - I've been in conversations like that with friends!! it's funny!! there is not societal oppression behind white people jokes - and leaving it out would make the book less real.I'm so excited for this book to come out. It's exactly what the world needs.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram<...more",Notes are private!,0,113,1,"Nov 20, 2016","Nov 21, 2016","Nov 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32075671-the-hate-u-give

Megan Abbott's perfect writing style and fantastic characters blend with a creepy storyline to form a near-perfect suspense book. You Will Know Me has an interesting, if somewhat overdone, premise. Katie and Eric's daughter, Devon, a talented gymnastics star. Their lives, and the lives of many at their gymnastics studio, revolve around her. Their gymnastics studio is in perfect balance... until a member is killed, and alliances suddenly shift. You Will Know Me blends together several interesting concepts at once into a tightly plotted murder mystery. It's like a suburban mystery drama, but somehow... darker. The plotting is very slow-burn. At times the book might be too slow for some readers. But every moment of detail and character-building comes to a close in the finale. The last 1/3 is absolutely spectacular, with twists and turns and a breathless conclusion. However, the plotting isn't what stands out here. In my opinion, the best suspense book is the type where the ending can be spoiled for you and the book is still worth reading. This isn't worth reading to see who is the killer; it's worth reading to see how the killing happens. This book brings up so many interesting themes, so many conflicting feelings, so many questions. The characters of You Will Know Me are especially brilliantly crafted. We see this story from Katie's point of view, which allows us to see into the obsessive nature of their family. Katie's narrative becomes darker and darker as she tries to figure out what's happening in her family. As always, Abbott's writing style and atmosphere is perfect for the story. Again, it's not for everyone; anyone who hated Dare Me may want to skip this one. VERDICT: In terms of suspense, it's hard to find a better book.

Well, to be quite fair, Okiku isn't totally out of the story - she's actually a ghost who murders child rapists and abusers. And she is fucking awesome. Not only is she the morally grey girl villain we all needed, but she's also vividly developed and has a brilliant character arc. This book is not outright terrifying, it's more just... unsettling. It's really creepy and atmospheric, with some good suspense. The first chapter pulls you in. Some readers might not like the book just because it's not very fast-paced, especially for a thriller. But I think the slow-burn story is exactly what works about this book. The terror just builds and builds and builds until you cannot stand the wait - it's so deeply tense.My main complaint would be about the other two main characters. To be quite honest, I found Tark and Callie flat compared to Okiku. Tark is built up to be some kind of angsty teenage boy, but man, he just comes off sort of pathetic?

They make us feel safe—at least for a while—knowing where we end and someone else begins. But they can also make us want, can make us bitter, wanting what lies on the other side of the line.” 2 stars. This is a half-decent historical fiction novel, but altogether isn't anything special. THE GOODThis book's one pro is that it addresses a little-covered topic: the Pakistan-India partition. This issue is handled with care and sympathy towards both sides of the issue. THE BADThe characters aren't at all memorable. They are all used exclusively as plot devices. The romance is, likewise, a plot device. There's instalove AND a love triangle, neither of which is well-executed. I don't even know what more to say. It's clear that Bradbury wasn't trying very hard with the character work here, and unfortunately, the otherwise poignant moments of this novel left me completely cold. THE UGLYA major white character is used as a bit of a white savior. She's an earl's daughter who is shown to really care about the savage Indian people. And her father, the rezoner, cares a lot too and knows better than every Pakistani resident. Bradbury clearly wanted to have a sympathetic white character, but she didn't execute the character and her narrative at all. The narrative of this book also punishes the major Muslim character for his ambition, forcing him to (view spoiler)[leave behind all his family for a life of poverty alone (hide spoiler)], while the major white character ends her life in India with no consequences for her bad actions. There's nothing explicitly bad about this, maybe, but the author seems to imply that the character deserved his fate. It comes off badly.

Short books often end up being a little forgettable; without room for a long character arc, they've got to be super emotional. I tend to enjoy short books only when they pack a punch. This book was just not impactful enough to justify such a short and lowkey underdeveloped story. Don't get me wrong, though– this was a very cute story. We follow two girls, Charlie and Taylor, as they navigate a con week. Charlie is a bit of a celebrity dealing with fan culture and a breakup. Taylor is more of a wallflower, but she's an A+ fan. Both these characters are well-crafted and fun. I liked that neither are made to be generically relatable; that's been one of my pet peeves in contemporary books recently. There are two romance plots here, one between Charlie and Alyssa, a fellow YouTube celebrity, and one between Taylor and Jamie, her best friend since forever. They're both adorable. I liked that there wasn't too much unnecessary drama, although I did feel I wanted the author to go a little deeper into their relationships. But all in all, the romantic element was definitely executed well.And of course, this is a fandom story!! Sometimes I find books like this a little cringey with their demeaning portrayals of fandom, but this was not at all. I liked the emphasis on embracing your weirdness and all of yourself. I felt the author's love for fandom, rather than disdain. Great, right? While the shortness may have been a complaint earlier, it's also a bit of a plus. Again, ignore the time it took me to read this: I read the whole book in two sittings. One of my major issues with contemporaries can be boredom stemming from lack of interest, and I didn't feel that AT ALL here. It was just all very readable. Also, wanted to give a HUGE shoutout for diversity. Taylor's autism and social anxiety are portrayed very well here. Honestly, portrayals of autism in literature are generally either stories about their selfish siblings or use autism as a way to create unreliable narrator. The author neatly avoids all the gross tropes around autism, thank god. Also, points for a non-confused bi character without a cheating storyline (do you even know how bitter I am? infinity). And a chubby main character who gets a love interest, doesn't only learn to love herself through a boy, and doesn't lose weight! And a Chinese main character who isn't stereotyped! Wow, I can't believe I'm giving this book credit for all this. Avoiding gross representation should not be this freaking hard. And yet, apparently it is. This book did everything well. Fight me, contemporary genre. Overall, a very cute story. Definitely check this out if you're into contemporary books or books focusing on fandom. I'm falling out of love with contemporary more and more, and it's making me a little sad. I should love books like this! Come on, brain!

Hutchinson is consistently good at making you feel the emotions of a piece, get caught up in the story: I was stressed and desperate to finish. I loved the strong prevalence of side characters; I think side character conflicts are an excellent addition to any book and are often sadly neglected. He’s also very good at dangling a mystery but giving it enough of a solid ending to be satisfying: The ending of this book felt like exhaling. In hindsight, I think this is also the first book I ever read featuring a character who used he and she pronouns, which is pretty neat. It used to bother me when I read books where the main characters fell in love or became best friends after only knowing each other a short time. I’d complained about it to Tommy once, and he’d said that’s how it happens in real life. Everyone we meet begins as a stranger, so we project onto them who we need them to be until we get to know them. He said we have to fall in love with the idea of the person before we can fall in love with the actual person.That being said, I feel like Hutchinson has fallen into a very clear formula, and this is just not as good an example of that formula. We Are the Ants, The Five Stages of Andrew Brawley, and to some degree The Apocalypse of Elena Mendoza all fall into a similar narrative: the apocalypse is threatened, the main character is depressed and generally not nice to other people, (view spoiler)[and it turns out to be a metaphor for mental illness somehow (hide spoiler)]. I don’t think that’s actually a bad thing. It’s an interesting formula. It’s clearly working for him. I just think this book does very little with that formula compared to his others (especially The Apocalypse of Elena Mendoza). The middle of this could have been edited far better: this is a 500-page book, and I could really feel the lag around the middle. A lot of the middle is filled with side character conflict. I liked the blend of stories: Calvin’s story, specifically, was very good. I did not think most of these side characters had their arcs resolved in a meaningful way. Lua’s character arc, or rather lack of it, also somewhat bothered me. He’s meant to be flawed but likable, and at some points he comes off this way. Her other actions include: consistently blowing up at friends, telling Ozzie “you’re mine” in a conversation I thought was DEEPLY uncomfortable, and way more relevantly, throwing a glass bottle at a significant other (it’s implied this is not an anomalous event). If any of these were meaningfully criticized I would not be bothered but as it is, one of these characters is casually participating in domestic abuse. For lols. I think the ending of this bothered me on a few levels, honestly. Though some er friends of mine felt it was a cop-out, I like the actual ending fine: I just thought it came too quickly without enough buildup. In a book where almost all of the side character conflicts, especially Calvin's major conflict, were wrapped up very quickly as well, this left me wanting more. I do think Shaun David Hutchinson is a very talented author and very good at drawing readers into a story: I also like that he addresses topics from his past in such an interesting way. But this just isn't all that satisfying to me as a full narrative. TW for statutory rape, child abuse, and domestic abuse.

But that book pales in comparison to this book. The first book was very enjoyable, but I didn't feel like there was much meaning behind it. It was fun, but I wouldn't consider it the best fantasy book ever. But this book. This book is a masterpiece. I cried so much and spent the last 100 pages biting my nails. Actually, I technically spent most of the book biting my nails, just especially the last 100 pages. My only complaint about the last book was the speed at which character development happened, but it was REALLY improved here. The characters are given time to build. However, there's still not all that much dramatic tension, probably due to the fact that shit is CONSTANTLY going down. The thing is, I care so much about the characters that I feel the tension anyway. Marie Lu's writing style doesn't click with me at all. But everything else is so perfect that the book rings true anyway.I love Adelina and how deliciously evil she is. She's so sympathetic and lovable and yet I totally should hate her. (I can't!! She's so good and I want her to be happy so much!!) I love how complex Terran is (he's definitely a love-to-hate). I love Rafaelle and his delightful evilness. I really love Maeve. None of these characters are black and white at all. They are all so complex and developed. I really recommend this for people who want interesting subversions of the hero's journey and of typical love triangles.I love how we don't really know what side we're on. I love how conflicted we feel. There's Adelina, who is trying to protect her country, but is also willing to kill people and in fact pleasures in it. We root for Maeve and the daggers, but they're willing to let people die too. We see their hypocrisy and their hidden wishes to take over the kingdom. There's no obvious hero here, and I LOVE that. The relationships in this book develop even more, which I love. I love Raf and Enzo. With every bit of my little black heart. And I LOVE Magiano as a love interest. I really was not expecting to be this invested in him and Adelina getting together. I love Adelina's relationships with Raf, Enzo, Gemma, and most of all Violetta. Adelina and Violetta have one of the most complex, well-developed sibling relationships I've ever read about. Anyway.

There's jealousy and resentment, but there's also love. — Raf and Enzo. Just. — Maeve is already the most awesome character of all time, and she's shown up for about ten pages. My only complaint is that Marie Lu is almost too brief when developing characters - all the action happens without a lot of buildup. For example, that beginning quote I love so much? Happens less than 20 pages in. It makes the book really fast-paced and entertaining, but also does away with a lot of dramatic tension. It almost makes the book feel like there's something missing.

The society portrayed is terrifying and described in intense detail. Unfortunately, this great worldbuilding is tempered by an exceptionally tiring plot and a lack of detail until the three-quarter map. Let me explain what I mean. Nothing happens until the three-quarter mark. And by nothing happens, I mean literally not a single thing happens. Atwood spends this entire first section trying to build up her world. This worldbuilding ends on a terrifying note, but for much of the book, it's more confusing than interesting. Nothing is revealed quickly enough. But all of this could have been redeemed with a good main character. There is not a good main character. Offred doesn't have any character traits. She's just such a forgettable heroine. Granted, I'm a person who needs interesting, 3-D characters to enjoy a book, and this did not deliver AT ALL. I know that's not what Handmaid's Tale was trying to do.

Honestly, it reminds me of the Lunar Chronicles in that it began with two characters and keeps expanding to a larger scope. With excellent plot twists, fantastic characters, and some of the most unputdownable writing in the world, this basically killed me.Here, let me just rant a little about Them Iconic Characters:➽ Kady Grant - this bitch is so cool and I adore her and I will continue to adore her for the rest of my days. a badass with emotional problems.➽ Ezra Mason - kind of didn’t do enough in this book? I like Ezra a lot, but I think he’s a bit lacking in depth and keeps remaining so. He’s such a Good though that I can’t help but care for his relationship with Kady [so much] and his relationship with Nik [their bro relationship was what I DESERVED].➽ Nik Malikov - I thought Nik was an asshole in the last book, but the more I read about him the more I love him. a burnt cinnamon roll, somewhat toasted but still iconic. ➽ Hanna  - SAME WITH HER!! I always liked her way more than Nik, but I was honest to god so invested in her here. Her diary entries really help her development. she could kill me and I’d thank her for it. ➽ Ella Fucking Malikova - got all the pagetime she deserved and is my wife whomst I would die for and kill for. probably would run the non-corrupt version of WikiLeaks in a modern au. disabled badass and chaotic good icon. definitely a lesbian and my proof is that every sapphic I know would date her in a heartbeat. [I am chief among them]. anyone who hates on her is dead to me. Ella Malikova marry me challenge➽ Asha Grant - I LOVE HER. I actually think this is where the authors succeeded most at getting me invested, because I adore her. Her relationship with Katya made me so emotional. Love that she’s not overtalented, just trying her best. What a gal.➽ Rhys Lindstorm - Boring archetypal love interest #400. Real name ACOTAR Ripoff LintStorm. what was his point in this book? why didn’t Asha and Ella become a thing or some shit, we already KNOW her and we got NO SENSE of Rhys. I do appreciate the kind of morally-ambiguous thing, but they don’t go for it and he’s kind of boring? We’ll talk about this later.➽ AIDAN - remains a really compelling villain. I adore the well-intentioned extremist trope and I think this character is a really good example. I don’t know why he has a gender. he is a computer. It is hilarious to me that they chose to make a robot a boy just so we know that his thing for Kady is Super Heterosexual. [I mean, at least one character mentioned her wife somewhere in here?]And then we can also talk about character dynamics, because how iconic are these relationships.➽ Kady and Ezra - Pure. Good. I honestly just think this couple is really sweet and soft and I just➽ Nik and Hanna - I love these useless trash kids. ➽ Asha and Rhys - Who gives a fuck.And also, let's give a spot for these babes:""McCALL, Winifred ****!!MALIKOVA, Ella: MIGHTY ****ING ********SMALIKOV, Nik: HOLY ****ING **** *** *****MASON, Ezra: ****ING HELL??ZHUANG, Yulin: ********!?!?GRANT, Isaac: People! LANGUAGE!""➽ the Illuminae Group - oh damn I love this squad. I love Isaac Grant being their Squad Dad; the notes from him on page 437 were… not at all okay. Fuck. Um, I love Ella and Hanna [and both of them feat. Kady], I really love Ezra and Nik, I love the idea of them being a squad as a whole. They're favorites. [You’ll see when you read it.]Listen, dudes, this book is not perfect. absolutely not. Let’s talk about why this was a 4 ½ and not a five. [But still a five because I love.]Okay, first of all. The entire thing has shades of emotional manipulation. Twists get untwisted really quickly. Spoiler alert, but: (view spoiler)[there are at least three death scares that are fakeouts and I’m sorry but. Seriously. We know these people aren’t dying. Come the fuck off. (hide spoiler)] And can I second something my amazing er friend Kaylin mentioned, because I didn’t even notice this one - in the previous books, characters were introduced via DMs, but here they’re often introduced via surveillance footage. Which feels kind of emotionally manipulative. And there was way too much surveillance footage. (view spoiler)[[Especially by 0089, who just does not have as hilarious a voice.] (hide spoiler)]And there’s a big thing - I have to admit, my biggest problem with this installment was my lack of investment in Rhys’s character. The last book of The Lunar Chronicles was 850 pages partially due to the need for developing two new characters on top of the other six. This story was trying to get us invested in two new characters on top of five other characters we are already invested in. And while they did do a fucking great job getting me invested in Asha, um… Rhys could have died and I only would have been sad because Asha was sad. To be quite honest, I do not care about Rhys that much; I don’t hate him, but he pales in comparison to the rest of these characters. BUT: I mean, I’m trying to complain about this, but I love this series. I adore the huge cast that I can complain about but still adore. I love the squad dynamic. I love the twists. I love that I can’t put it down. These books are so much fun and I recommend them highly.[also check out my s of Illuminae and Gemina!]Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,249,1,"May 04, 2018","May 06, 2018","Nov 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24909347-obsidio

I honestly wasn't expecting to like this all that much, but it won me over. Towards the beginning, I thought this was going to be an obvious YA thriller, and Bronwyn was the only character I even tolerated. But by the end of the book, every character won me over. Bronwyn's motives for what she did were understandable, and so were Cooper's. Addy was a girl who made a mistake, tried desperately to fix it, and ended up finding herself along the way. Nate was a guy without any other good choices, who was really trying. I only wish the book could've been longer, so we could really see the characters developed. But there was so much there. • I loved how Addy's character arc was, essentially, about realizing she didn't have to be in love to be happy. I loved that. I loved that she didn't end up with anyone. • Cooper was so relatable. The author really, really showed his internalized homophobia and how much he struggled with it, without making his story a tragedy. • Nate and Bronwyn's romance was also a strength, not instalove and very believable. They had some great quotes, too.  “I stole Jesus and you had to carry a bag wrapped in a blanket. Sorry about that.” My only complaint is the same complaint as I give to most contemporaries. Honestly, this isn't much of a thriller or mystery. The twist is fairly easy to guess. The strength here is in the characters. Essentially, the author was trying to condense this concept into an enjoyable contemporary. This is some really dark stuff being written about, and with a slightly darker novel, she could've really explored some of those concepts. Maybe I just personally like more serious writing style with more room for exploration. However, the book still works surprisingly well.In general, this is a really great YA contemporary and I'm glad to have read it.* I received a copy of this via my local bookstore.

The last half had me on the edge of my seat gasping for breath and desperately hoping the characters would make it out alive. This one also had characters you could root for. [image](source)I LOVED Ella Malikova as a character with every fiber of me being - she's sassy and funny, but still so real. She is a strange one. Small and frail... But in the code, the endless skein of ones and zeros, she leaves the pale atrophy of flesh far behind. Strides like a goddess across a binary topography, the heart of a lion in her chest.Nik and Hanna really grew on me as well, which was unexpected. Towards the beginning, both of them completely annoyed me. Rest assured that they get so much better. I appreciate it when characters I initially don't like become more fun to root for. [image]Hanna was such a badass, honestly. (source)Similarly, while I was initially not as invested in Gemina's romance plot as I was in Illuminae's romance plot, Nik and Hanna grew on me. Over time, their romance plot went from a slightly flat bad boy / good girl to a romance you can really root for. Yay for character development! [image]I frankly only have a few complaints. + That one IT guy needs to add slightly less commentary. I found those chapters far less engaging after a while; the format is just too gimmicky compared to some of the other styles of narration. His jokes just fall flat and aren't usually all that funny. This isn't a big problem, but I would appreciate if I laughed at those chapters, given that they're clearly meant to be funny. + There are so many side characters and yet every single one is straight. I'm not asking for any of these books to center on an lgbt romance, because I know the authors will not go there, but surely one lgbt side character isn't too much to ask. Or even just a mention of the fact that not everyone is straight and white. Ella Malikova's alleged ""best friend"" actually being her girlfriend wouldn't be too much to ask, would it?I stayed up really late on a school night to finish this one, and it was so worth it. I anticipate rereading these frequently.

There's romance with the Prince Charming, of course, but this isn't the instalove you're used to. She starts off hating Prince Charming, and develops slow fondness for him. I like how this tale takes typical fairy tales and makes them better. The heroine is not a shrinking violet. She's sassy, smart, and knows what she wants.

I'm surprised Free TOf all the dystopias I've ever read, I'm really surprised to say a standalone that I almost donated has been one of my favorites. I'm surprised Free To Fall didn't get more hype, given how tightly plotted and intriguing it is. So here I am, with yet another ""this-was-underrated-now-enjoy-it"" . I have to say, this isn't necessarily a character-driven book. There are no memorable, can't-get-it-off-your-mind characters. Yes, but man, if this wasn't one of the most exhilarating books I've ever read. I'm not lying when I say I could not put this down. I was desperate to figure out how it would all end. There are so many creative twists and turns, and I was desperate to know how it would all work out. The worldbuilding all feels believable despite the fact that this dystopia takes place in the future. This world didn't feel 5000 years away: Free To Fall terrified me so much because of how close this world came to being our world. And despite the concept of “technology controlling everyone”, the book didn't feel like a heavy-handed declaration of ~the dangers of technology~. Free To Fall might not have shined in any other category, but every other aspect of the book was quite solid. I liked the writing - there were actually quite a few standout lines that made me stop and think. The characters were good as well. While they were not as memorable as some other books I've read, these characters were developed, likable, and fun to read. Rory never comes off as overly pretentious or ~not like other girls~. In fact, this book puts a great emphasis on relationships between women. Hershey, who at first seems like she might become a vehicle for slutshaming, is developed well. I adored seeing her become close friends with Rory. I'm taking off almost an entire star simply because the romance plot felt quite forced at points. The boy wasn't actively disgusting. But oh man, what a cliche and boring romance. Girl meets a boy who makes her realize how bad her world is? That's  never been before. Really, I think the book would've been far stronger without a romance. But of course for a book published in this era, the guy is one of the major marketing ploys. VERDICT: Aside from a slightly annoying romance plot, this book shines. One of the most unputdownable things I've ever read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Nov 03, 2016","Nov 04, 2016","Nov 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18602289-free-to-fall

This is one of the most impactful memoirs I’ve ever read. Never Fall Down chronicles the true story of Arn Chorn-Pond, a survivor of the communist revolution in Cambodia. This revolution led to the deaths of around 1/4 Cambodia’s population, a higher proportion of the population than almost any other genocide. In terms of emotional impact, the book hits hard. We see the journey from relative peace to constant violence firsthand here, and it’s just as shocking as you’d expect. The writing style is a bit clinical, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. In one way, the clinical tone makes events hit harder. However, the narrative occasionally feels detached during incredibly horrific events. This style is completely understandable; I can’t imagine going through the kind of trauma Chorn-Pond went through and surviving. But the unemotional tone stays around for the entire book, and it’s almost tiring.

Georgia never feels that much more paranoid than the average person would be. I'd act almost as paranoid as Georgia did if I were placed in her situation. I just... don't see how this is schizophrenia. In general, using schizophrenia as a plot device for a suspense novel strikes me as... very easy to get wrong. It wasn't portrayed particularly offensively in this novel, but it still strikes me as a little weird. The main character, Georgia, is altogether quite forgettable.

I don't even ship them hard in the show but their relationship is fucking beautiful as a friendship too. Here, their relationship is creepy and based entirely on his abs.

Well, Glass sucks. In contrast Raven is my fucking wife• No subversion of a typical love triangle, meaning no takedowns of girl hate, meaning no book version of the Spacewalker episode, meaning no Raven and Clarke's gorgeous beautiful perfect relationship• Every single character is white and straight?? oh my god there are literally no characters who aren't straight and white• And of course it pulls the brutal-race-of-brown-people-trope out• god knows the show was not immune to this trope but the show at least has major nonwhite characters, and the “other” are sympathetic• Did I mention that there's literally no moral conflict?

There's an idea here for a parody of YA novels, and for an exploration of teen stress. And the book started out well! The first 25% of the novel has a ton of potential, and Reshma is a fun antihero with a ton of room for growth. I was completely pumped to see an awesome character arc for her. THE BADThis reads like the author shoved two half-written books together. The plot is a complete mess from 25% on. It's like the author totally forgot what the book had been about. The I'm-writing-a-typical-ya-novel-to-get-into-college plotline, which is the reason I picked up the book, falls apart quickly. Reshma's character arc is another weak spot. Honestly, I don't understand why no one looked at Reshma's character arc and said “wait, this doesn't make any sense.” During the first 25%, she has so much potential for a strong arc. But instead of improving, she becomes an even worse person, to the point where she's barely tolerable. And then ten pages from the end, the book suddenly takes us through an entire book's worth of character arc. The ending is genuinely terrible, with Reshma acting like she learned something from the entire ordeal when she clearly has not. Up to that point, she literally never shows any signs of growth. In fact, she becomes more of an asshole. And that's fine. Antiheros are enjoyable. Just don't act like Reshma's learned something somehow when she hasn't. This book is also just not that funny. The main character goes so far in her campaign for valedictorian that the book veers into the territory of having too much secondhand embarrassment to be funny. Secondhand embarrassment is not pleasant or funny, it made me cringe. But it's presented for humor. The book's message is supposed to be something about how kids care too much about grades... I think. But it ends up being “nonwhite people only win valedictorian because they sue.” I don't think the author actually believes this, but the book really heavily implies this. Yes, this book is a parody, but Reshma's willingness to screw over the poor white kids is not presented as a joke. Even though the author probably had the best intentions, it's kinda not fun to read. Ultimately, this parody novel took itself too seriously and ended up falling off the tracks. Also, I could write a better novel outline in a day than supposed valedictorian Reshma did in two weeks.

In the final chapters, he keeps dramatic tension high and pulls at the reader's emotional strings. Into Thin Air speaks to the dark side of mountain climbing in a concrete, interesting way. Krakauer asks if risking your life for such an endeavor can really be justified. Krakauer also clearly learned from his mistakes in the Outsider article, because he does not expressly assign blame to any single person. He works through showing the events, not saying exactly who you should blame.  My only issue is the amount of judgement he places on certain members of the team: not who he blames for the disaster, the people he just doesn't like. I can't imagine being Sandy Hill Pittman and reading this book. She didn't cause the disaster, and had no personal responsibility for what happened besides being slightly incompetent. Krakauer doesn't accuse her of causing anything, but still depicts her as shallow and annoying in places. The tone is quite arrogant in places, honestly. I just can't get rid of this feeling that in real life, I'd hate Krakauer. His writing is too arrogant. There's an implication in sections that no one but him has the right view of events. It's understandable, given his emotional state while reading this, but I have mixed feelings on the tone of this book.

Not necessarily bad, but the characters ruined it for me. This book suffers mostly from a heroine who rings false at every turn. Kristina seems naive and frankly kind of stupid. When authors write books about teens who get into bad situations, they need in general to focus on making the character feel relatable. Kristina's situation isn't terrifying because it feels avoidable; it should be a scary tale about the effects of drugs, but it's just not. Every other aspect of this book is clearly meant as a vehicle for the main character. The plotting is clearly meant as a vehicle for the character's descent into drugs, meaning it's not individually interesting enough to hold up the book. Hopkins' verse style is enjoyable, but without a good main character, the book can't be saved. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,Nov 2015,Nov 2015,"Oct 27, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/270730.Crank

After adoring this book and Lucky Girl, I'm beginning to sense a trend; Maciel writes incredibly unlikable protagonists, readers hate them, brilliant books get middling ratings. But man, I wish that weren't the case. If you've read the blurb, you'll know that this book follows a girl who teased another girl to suicide. I feel like it should be obvious why the main character is unlikable. But wow, I empathized with her so much.Amanda Maciel gets you so far into Sara's mind. Sara isn't exactly a likable character. Yet by the end, it's hard not to sympathize with her, despite all the despicable things she's done. The real success here is the fact that Sara has believable motivation. Every character here is a victim of a social structure meant to hold girls back. Maciel refuses to either decide Sara was right OR renounce Sara as a fundamentally evil person. This will anger many, but Maciel's ability to present truth without bias is what drew me into this book so much. I absolutely understand why some will take issue with the slutshaming. It litters this book, and many won't be able to get past that. But I did not get the impression that Maciel agrees with any of the horrible content in this book. This book is about how slutshaming can lead someone to commit suicide.

This series isn't perfect, but it's one of the few dystopias I read as a teen that I actually class as “good” in my head. I'm honestly surprised at the mixed s. This series is a little like The Handmaid's Tale: Slightly More Developed Version. Watch me get 40 comments disagreeing, but the worldbuilding in the Handmaid's tale is completely nonspecific. The worldbuilding here is creative, touching on many different themes. Yes, it's definitely similar to the Handmaid's Tale, but O'Brien gives her world its own special flair. Honestly, my largest issue is that some themes feel underdeveloped and rushed. O'Brien clearly had some ambitious ideas for the thematics of this series, and those themes only get realized about 75% of the time. The intent's there, and the themes are easy to spot under the surface, but I did wish for more specificity. In terms of character building, O'Brien had some of the same issues. There's so much potential, and it's not realized quite enough to satisfy. Gaia is a developed enough heroine that I enjoyed her anyway; she's strong, clever, and idealistic without being naive. Her love interest has dimension too.While it's not a perfect series, I enjoyed it quite a lot.

Y'all really want to continue writing The Fault On Our Stars v2: mental illness instead of cancer. Ugh. Can't we move past this phase of YA? Can't we move past using mental illnesses as characters? Can't we stop with this manic pixie everything bullshit? Can't we actually write some damn books instead of covering our lacking plots and lacking everythings with purple prose? Can't we write stories with some fucking plot?Are you ready for my controversial, maybe inaccurate theory? No one actually liked this. You all read this, were confused, and then gave it a five on the general principle because you thought you didn't get it. Look through the s and you will see a lot of ""I didn't get it but I recognize that it was good :)"" and no. no you do not.You know why you didn't get it? Because there is nothing here. Keep in mind, I genuinely enjoyed some of John Green's books. I've loved or at least tolerated a lot of books like this. But this one is trying to jump on the bandwagon and faking you all out. What kind of genuinely fucking pretentious bullshit was this. I'm sorry, but this is just such an unreadable book. I don't see how anyone can even read this. How can anyone not find this incredibly obnoxious and pretentious? I genuinely do not understand that. I don't. Let me talk a bit more about the characters, because this is maybe the most angering thing about this book. These are not characters. They are quirky traits. These characters are not based off actual personalities, they're based off idiosyncrasies. They're interesting because they're different, in some way, from “regular” teenagers. These. are. not. characters. They. are. props. God damn it, this just personifies everything I hate about the YA contemporary genre. Characters don't have to be “unique” for me to care about them. Honest to god, this angers me so much. This is lazy. It's lazy writing meant to look deep. Develop your damn characters beyond their damn idiosyncrasies!! I do not care if your twelve-year-old-character curses in a weird way. I don't fucking care and neither does anyone else. I care about who she is as a person and why she is that way.And what bothers me even more is the handling of trauma and mental illness. Because the Quirks that are being used in substitute of personality aren't even quirks - they're traumas or disabilities or physical differences or mental illnesses. That is so fucking tiring. Mental illness is not a character trait. It's not a character trait, it's not, it's not, and I am so fucking tired of authors pretending it is out of pure laziness. Okay. Can I talk specifics for a little while. I mean, Maddie is a depressed abuse victim and she does not act like one. That's not to say that every depressed abuse victim acts the same; they don't. And that's what bothers me. Maddie reads like a manic pixie dream trauma survivor, which is a new character archetype I just invented. Okay, I'm articulating this terribly. The point is that she doesn't feel real. Mentally ill people are still people. God. Damn. It. We are people. “Oh, so okay, no one but god can see that things are good? I see that things are good all the freaking time, for your information. Sometimes I see that things are very good, in fact.”To be totally fair to this book, I did feel like there was some heart behind a few scenes. There was one moment of genuine emotion between two characters addressing genocide. There's use of found family, which is usually my favorite thing to read about. It fails, but it's there. I also wasn't as annoyed by the romance as I usually am in books like this. Maddy is a huge manic pixie dream girl, but I suppose she has a trait? I mean, she's a depressed abuse victim. That's... I have my own huge issues with the handling of her character, but at least it's a trait. But unfortunately, all those genuine moments are so few and far between.

I ended it completely won over by the well-paced action scenes and terrifying cliffhangers. It's incredibly exhilarating. That alone deserves four stars. The issue is that this isn't a good mystery / dystopia novel. Matt De La Pena's style shines when he writes action scenes, but slow, creepy, atmospheric scenes come off flat in his style. This book seriously suffers in terms of atmosphere. There's another issue here, and it's glaring: the characters. Shy is one of the biggest fuckboys I've had to deal with in literature. It's only easy to ignore because of the action. His sidekick, Addy, is portrayed in a pornographic way, and doesn't get developed nearly enough. There's also a fairly pointless love triangle.

I did not expect either aspect to improve. I definitely did not expect White to fix BOTH of my issues with book one. It's not often a sequel can surpass my expectations so much, but this sequel is undeniably better than book one. Now I Rise both does away with the love triangle drama and far surpasses book one in terms of character work.Lada doesn't get any less fierce during this book; in fact, she gets even more brutal. Yet she's not heartless; she has some very compelling relationship development with several side characters. While she just doesn't have as far to go in terms of development, I still enjoyed her journey and conflict over duty to family. And then there's Radu, who I didn't particularly care for in the first book. Here, though, he got an INCREDIBLE character arc. I am still reeling from this character arc. I cannot get over how much Radu has grown and changed and how much I LOVE HIM. Radu's inner debate over which side truly deserves to win Constantinople really stands out throughout the book, in both his internal and external conflict. It's incredibly difficult to write characters on both sides of the fence, but White executed it brilliantly. How many ways could a man turn traitor in a lifetime?Possibly my favorite aspect of the character work were the complex side characters. Between Nicolae, Cyprian, and Nazira, my absolute wife and favorite character of maybe the whole book, I just love everyone. None of these side characters are one-dimensional. Even my least favorite side characters never felt like plot devices; they're all morally ambiguous and they're all interesting. I want to give Nazira an entire extra paragraph. What a fantastically developed character; both an ambitious person who wants vengeance, and a supportive cinnamon roll at the same time. A true lesbian icon. “Hatred makes monsters of us all.”I have to say, Nazira and Radu's platonic relationship development is one of my favorite parts of this book. It is really hard to find such strong and developed platonic friendships in YA. I loved how many characters made comments about how they clearly love each other, but without passion. They're two people who don't always trust others, but they are always so real with each other. And of course, their banter killed me and knocked me into the ground, where I'm still lying full of feelings. I care about their friendship even more than any of the romantic relationships in this book. My favorite kids who mlm and wlw solidarity. “Side by side, and alone together.”There's some great relationship development in this book, too. Lada and Radu and Mehmed's relationships with each other are of course still significant, but the new relationships introduced really stand out. Again, let me mention how much I love Nazira and Radu. But there are so many more! Lada's relationships with her many soldiers and a mentor she finds. But let's be real here: (view spoiler)[Radu and Cyprian (hide spoiler)] are the absolute crowning gem of the whole entire book, with so many heartbreaking moments and one of the most incredible slow build relationships I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. But don't worry, this book focuses on romance far less than book one.I also LOVE the themes of Radu's section. Everything said about hate and islamophobia is so fucking on point and I love it. “I know it is not rational. None of the people here were responsible for what happened to Fatima. But their mindless hatred of us, their demonizing of Islam, is what let the men do what they did.”And all the themes about religion and its role. This series is so good at discussing religion in a non-offensive way. (Can we talk about how all of these quotes are from Nazira?)“I think that is Constantinople's problem. They look to a painting to save them. They argue and debate over the state of their souls for the afterlife, while letting the needy in this life go hungry.”The one issue with this book is that Lada's actual plotline is slightly less entertaining in comparison to Radu's. (view spoiler)[ Since she's already left the capital and become a fierce, brutal warrior, she spends a lot of the book biding her time, and not much forward motion happens at times. Radu's plot never goes two chapters without moving forward. (hide spoiler)] Part of this may be that Lada's character had her initial character arc last book, while Radu's character had almost all of his character arc in this book. Lada's arc here is slightly more external, where Radu's is both external and internal. It's not much of an issue, though; Lada's chapters would probably be my favorites in any other book. She's still so effortlessly compelling if only through her character development and her badassery. There are a few thematic aspects here that I'm really liking. First of all, I love the emphasis here on working through internalized misogyny. I'd ask anyone who wants even more detail on this aspect to read Simona's . I couldn't agree more with everything she says. And second of all? The queer rep is so important to me. Radu's struggle around feeling like a constant outsider is written with so much care and authenticity, and in this book, the development of Radu and Nazira's friendship just made my life. All the solidarity and all the queer genre fiction that deals with homophobia but isn't entirely about Pain, please. And also, thanks to Kiersten White for guaranteeing that no lesbians will die in this series. It's a really great guarantee to hear from an author in an environment where my immediate reaction to Nazira and Fatima's existence is ""they're going to die, aren't they"".And also, can we talk ending? That ending was, emotionally, too much. And I think Kiersten White might have actually added a few details during the arc-to-book transition. (view spoiler)[Forehead touching in the farewell scene? AND cheek touching? I WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT IF IT WERE IN THE ARC. (hide spoiler)]Basically, this was truly an incredible book, and I can't wait to see where the plot goes next. I love everything about Radu's storyline.

I think not. ...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,Nov 2015,Nov 2015,"Oct 22, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46799.Go_Ask_Alice

This incredibly important message reads like an articulate conversation at your dinner table. It's also an incredibly important book. We do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them. We stifle the humanity of boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside of this cage.

And yet, despite the fact that I barely remembered the plot of book three, this book still managed to make me weep. MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK• Connor and Risa's relationship is so sweet and genuine and they're such a good couple. I loved the scene with them curling up (view spoiler)[in Grace's basement (hide spoiler)]. They're so pure. Someone come punch me in the face. • Lev's scene towards the end. I'm not sure I've ever cried so hard at something before. Lev has had such incredible character development since book one, and I'm so happy for him. • Connor's character work is just as complex and interesting as usual. Nice socks. • Risa... my love... my everything... my ride or die• I used to hate Cam... damn you Neal Shusterman I CRIED about his character arc in this book. I shed actual tears. Fuck you• All the side characters, oh man. A running tally of side characters who broke my heart at some point: Miracolina, Una, Hayden, Grace, Bam... list continues forever• Worldbuilding still rocks my world. The moral issues brought up here, oh man. • Just in general, this book has incredible character work. I've only read one or two other series where the character arcs are so consistently interesting. MY LESS FAVORITE THINGS• Not enough kickass girl characters. Risa, Una, Miracolina, Grace, and Bam are all such incredible characters... but none of them are leaders. All the leaders here are guys, and it's not the greatest. Also, not a single lgbt character. #makehaydengay2k17• Too much backstory for villains I didn't care about. As usual. Sometimes amusing, but never emotionally gutwrenching.

It's got all the character work and depth of Courtney Summers, yet with a slightly less issue-novel tone and a less ""cliche unpopular girl"" protagonist. Our heroine, Rosie, is a popular girl. In fact, she's the “pretty” one in her friendship with Maddie. But after Maddie's new love interest tries to assault Rosie, she becomes the ""school slut"" and is abandoned by Maddie.I'm sure you'll have figured out by now that this is a book about slut-shaming and victim blaming. I particularly liked that this isn't a typical contemporary about a girl being assaulted and a boy making it better. Maciel doesn't base this book off a romance. It's all about the friendship here. I especially loved the ending, powerful and full of hope. Maciel touches on a ton sexual assault, shaming, and friendship and handles each theme with care. But that's not everything I loved about the book. Lucky Girl gets its real power from the incredible character work. Rosie is such a real character. There's her genuine depth of character, first of all. She's selfish but she's trying not to be. She's jealous but she's trying not to be. But there's also her character arc. I loved Rosie's internalized self-doubt, her feelings of guilt over betraying Maddie even though it wasn't her. Maciel does a good job of portraying her feelings without acting as if they're correct.I also appreciated that Lucky Girl accurately portrays the complexities of friendships between the “popular” girls. Maddie and Rosie are often somewhat unlikable, and yet it's hard not to feel sympathy and understanding for each of them. I'm seeing a lot of ers criticize Lucky Girl for aimlessness, and I'm somewhat inclined to agree. Yet I also feel that the novel gets its power from the lack of clear problem, clear solution. Maciel perfectly conveys the desperate, hopeless feeling of blaming yourself and having everyone else blame you, too. She's not in a situation with a clear beginning and a clear end. The aimless tone is appropriate for the novel, distinguishing it from a typical issues book.VERDICT: Highly recommended, along with Maciel's debut novel, Tease....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Oct 17, 2016","Oct 18, 2016","Oct 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25465103-lucky-girl

I love it in my soul. Buuuuuut this is a great example of a series where book one is a great setup but book two is where the payoff is. Even though I had some issues here, it should be noted that book two, Now I Rise, is one of my all-time favorite books, improving on every one of my issues with this book.. Top five-single-books-ever level. Feel free to drop on over to my . I admit that I loved this slightly more while reading it - I think time and meditation has somewhat dulled my opinion. THE BEST BITS♔ The worldbuilding is just beautiful. And I Darken is historical fiction, but it's not like historical fiction that you've read before. Honestly, it reads like excellent fantasy. It's cool that history classes about the Ottoman Empire can spoil you about a book. There's some awesome political intrigue in this one, which I REALLY loved. ""You see this...as a prison. But you are wrong. This is my court. This is my throne. This is my kingdom. The cost was my freedom and my body...So the question becomes, Daughter of the Dragon, what will you sacrifice? What will you let be taken away so that you, too, can have power?""♚ The tension was so palpable. I genuinely felt that these characters could die at any moment. Dramatic tension never faded, and the book is incredibly suspenseful. Yes, there are moments where the plot is slow and the book got boring, but for a 500-page book, this was incredibly engaging. And I Darken truly is very dark, as promised. There is nothing light and fluffy about this book.♔ I liked that White managed to have a misogynistic, borderline-Islamophobic main character, yet not portray either of those messages as positive. Neither of these traits are romanticized by the narrative. In fact, some of the major characters practice Islam, including Radu and later Nazira, and for them it is a consistent positive. I HAVE seen a few ownvoices ers mention they felt otherwise about the rep, so I'd check out some other s. ♚ The writing style of this blew me away. It's so engaging, and gorgeous in a very understated way. So kudos for achieving that balance! MY MIXED FEELINGS ON THE CHARACTER WORKNow, here's my real complaint. Lada, Radu, and Mehmed are... sort of well developed... but none of them are all that sympathetic, and they fall into archetypes more than I'd like. ♔ Lada is definitely a morally ambiguous and badass character. She's purposefully written as both hatable and sympathetic. She believes she's not like other girls and there's a religious taint to her dislike for the Ottoman Empire. Her dislikability is honestly one of the reasons I am so impressed with her character. Because I should hate her, but somehow, she's my favorite; she's just got a sympathetic edge to her. I did have a few issues, though. First of all, she's not in touch with her emotions unless that emotion is anger, which is fine, but I almost wanted her to have a true breakdown and show the cracks in her armor. That's just my preference in characters coming through, I think. The real issue is that she gets too distracted by Mehmed. Badass female character... until Hot Dude Appears. You know, creativity. To be fair, she keeps her badassery and characterization, even when the book gets too romantic for my taste; it's just frustrating. ♚ Radu is an interesting character in the abstract, but his storyline really annoyed me. His main job in this book is to be in love with Mehmed. Unrequited gay love. You know, creativity. This narrative does definitely improve in book two (one of the many things I loved about book two #IworshipNowIRise2k17) but for this book, I'll just say that it really didn't deserve the representation praise. ♔ While Mehmed is extremely likeable in the first half, in the second half I kind of hated him. He comes off as a misogynistic ass in some sections. Granted, this was purposeful, but I really just feel like he needs to get off Lada's case.♚ Complex sibling relationships (or rivalries) are the absolute greatest. Radu and Lada's sibling rivalry and contradicting close bond is an absolute triumph. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of their dynamic's relationship to that stupid love triangle. In general, there's too much romance; Lada and Mehmed's chemistry was completely nonexistent. Frankly, Mehmed had more chemistry with Radu, but was also portrayed entirely as heterosexual. Again, that unrequited love thing got old FAST. This love triangle is a super creative idea, and I really love it in the abstract, but it got old fast when I realized White had no intentions of portraying Mehmed as anything but straight. All in all, the character work here wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't quite as engaging for me as so many others have said it was.So, do I recommend this book? Yes, with every bit of my heart. This book was solid already, and then I read an arc of the sequel and it's maybe one of my favorite books of all time. This series owns my ass.

There's not much dimension to anything besides the plot here. The character development didn't make sense. The protagonist is petty, rude, and unlikable. There was also a romantic student-teacher relationship, which didn't work for me. Everything's a vehicle for the plot, which would be fine, but the plot doesn't work. Let's talk about nonsensical plotting. I know my opinion on the ambiguous plotting here would generally be considered a case of “it's not me, it's you”. But Conversion ends up boring, tonally dissonant, and lacking in atmosphere. The intention is there; there's a clear attempt at a creepy, small-town private school. Yet it somehow just ends up flat and boring. This book also flurries back and forth between being a high school story and a creepy story, with no across-the-board-tone. It ends up reading like a bad high school story with witches shoved in. In general, this just totally failed.

All I can say is that Ashes to Asheville is about the complexities of family. Our protagonist is living with her grandmother after one of her mothers has died. Her sister is living with her other mother. Each feels they have a claim on her, yet each truly do love her. Okay, it's an interesting premise and has a lot of potential. But honestly, this book succeeds mostly in the field of making you fucking cry. This book is written gorgeously. Emotion drips from every page. Every character feels real and genuine. Truly, though, this book succeeds the most through its themes of family and mourning. This story is so sad and yet so true to life, so real, so necessary. My one complaint might be the slowness of the plot. Conflict towards the beginning feels manufactured and often doesn't ring true, until we reach the ending.

And oddly enough, this Elise is one So, fun fact: this is the first book I ever read with a character named Elise who wasn't an Archetypal Mean Girl. And oddly enough, this Elise is one of the most relatable characters I've ever read about. She's so much like me, like any of us who didn't grow up popular, that it's almost terrifying. “Sometimes people think they know you. They know a few facts about you, and they piece you together in a way that makes sense to them. And if you don't know yourself very well, you might even believe that they are right. But the truth is, that isn't you. That isn't you at all.”So, yes, Elise is the stereotypical high school unpopular girl, but it's explored in a way that feels so much more real than any other books I've read about the topic. She's not unpopular because of one specific Mean Girl ruining her life - everyone thinks of her as fundamentally lesser. Her socially acceptable actions are framed as weird because she's the weird girl. She can't win. Elise is a character who is trying to be liked, but isn't good enough at hiding her inner self. It helps that the author conveys the school environment so well - the friends of convenience, the fake niceties. Even the school “mean girls” feel completely true-to-life, rather than being caricatures. Elise's struggles spoke to me on such a deep level. “You think it's so easy to change yourself. You think it's so easy, but it's not. True, things don't stay the same forever: couches are replaced, boys leave, you discover a song, your body becomes forever scarred. And with each of these moments you change and change again, your true self spinning, shifting positions-- but always at last it returns to you, like a dancer on the floor. Because throughout it all, you are still, always, you: beautiful and bruised, known and unknowable. And isn't that - just you - enough.” The most relatable aspect to me was Elise's need to escape herself by visiting a local DJ club. Maybe it sounds cheesy, but she needs to escape. She's trapped in her life and she just wants to be out. Above all else, I related to this. The author does such a good job conveying that feeling of wanting to escape and be someone else, someone above it all and on top of her life and far more personable, just to be her for a little while. And you know what else I liked? That she doesn't end the book by making the friends she needs and riding off into the sunset. The conclusion of this novel is far less Explicit Narrative Punishment than most would be. What stuck out to me most of all was how the author validates Elise's feelings. At no point do we get some decrying of Elise for being petty and leaving the school - that's not the story Leila Sales wants. Elise, as a character, is given far more narrative and personal agency than characters in YA contemporary often are. Above all else, This Song Will Save Your Life is a personal story. It's poignant and full of vivid characters, an easy read and a memorable one. One thing and one thing only bothered me here: the romance plotline. I can't deal with an underage girl x college age guy romance. Elise is sixteen. She is SIXTEEN. How is this even in the realm of okay? It's nasty, frankly. Yeah, their relationship is consensual and he doesn't know her age, but the age gap is still pretty gross. That disgust kept me from enjoying this book nearly as much as I wanted to. VERDICT: Aside from the one terrible romance factor, this book was near perfect. I think this would work for all ages, though teens will connect to it more. This Song Will Save Your Life is an absolutely amazing story about growing up on the outside, and I can't recommend it enough.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | About | ...more",Notes are private!,0,109,1,"Nov 26, 2015","Nov 26, 2015","Oct 14, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21469098-this-song-will-save-your-life

If a person who cut picked this book up, hoping to see someone like them, what message would they get? They would hear that cutting leads to death and there is no escape.

The protagonist is somewhat removed from the situation, but has information that could help the police and is unsure whether to speak up. The themes here are flat-out incredible. Hartzler emphasizes that being unable to say no is not the same as saying yes. The narrative isn't afraid to be realistic about the community's view on her situation. “Well, I just think it’s awful what that Stallard girl is doing to them. Dragging their good names through the mud.” It's hard to read, but it's also incredibly hard to look away.

Kindred is a subversion of the typical slave narrative and a book about the ease with which slavery can begin to feel acceptable. Sci-fi often works to imagine the future: This, however, works to reflect on the past. Dana works as the audience viewpoint; we see this as brutal and alien. Yet Kevin and Dana each struggle to avoid acclimatizing to their current brutal society. Kevin, who is not a slave in this society, does not witness the same daily horror as Dana does. “I keep thinking what an experience it would be to stay in it—go West and watch the building of the country, see how much of the Old West mythology is true,” he tells her. During one conversation between Dana and Kevin, they witness a group of slave children playing a game imitating slave dynamics. Kevin witnesses this as something sweet; meanwhile, Dana sees the horror in it. “I never realized how easily people could be trained to accept slavery,” she tells Kevin. Yet she too experiences this training: “Kevin and I became more a part of the household, familiar, accepted, accepting. That disturbed me too when I thought about it. How easily we seemed to acclimatize.”Later, she describes slavery as “a long slow process of dulling”: a process of wearing down until horrors seem acceptable. Something I really like is that Kindred functions as a questioning of the fantasy that there were ‘good masters’, masters who truly cared, so often peddled by films like Gone with the Wind. (view spoiler)[Rufus orders beatings and whippings, refuses to send Dana’s letters to Kevin but tells her he has, tells the mother of his children that he has sold them, and ultimately rapes two women. (hide spoiler)] He thinks of his actions as expressions of love; he thinks of himself as a kind master. Rufus falls in love with Alice, exhibits moments of decency and humanity in earlier chapters; it does not change him. He still views both as his property, to be conquered rather than loved. Dana, as a protagonist, is equally fascinating. Dana tries very hard to retain agency; she’s very good at moving around this society to get what she wants. She leverages Rufus’ fear of abandonment against him; she makes decisions that hurt Alice irrevocably. Yet she still remains empathetic and caring towards others. In a society where empathy is painful, it is, in itself, necessary to help her survive. I was not old enough to read the ending of this book at age fourteen, but here is my take: (view spoiler)[Dana cannot go home without scars. And Rufus’ eventual downfall is that he sees them as property, not people. (hide spoiler)]This is a novel I was not old enough to understand at the age of fourteen. And a novel, upon reflection and a much-needed reread, I really really love. Kindred's stark portrayal of the horrors of racism is to this day brilliant. Dana and her white husband, Kevin, are constantly faced with the pressure to go along. The questions being asked here of personal responsibility and bystanding are genuinely horrifying. I will not forget this.

At around the halfway I was actually planning to give this a two-star rating, just based off how addictive it was and how much I personally enjoyed it. But given how much the ending pissed me off, and given that after over six months (update: almost four years) I despise this book more every time I think about it, I'm not at all planning on changing this rating. This book deserves its rating. You're all waiting for the roast, right? It's at the bottom. Okay, first of all, this isn't a cool dystopia; this book is about romantic drama. Yes, there's a little worldbuilding, and it's interesting when we do see it. But the focus is on dating. Eris used to like Cord who likes Rylin, Avery and Leda like Atlas, but Watt also likes Avery. The only relationship I could bring myself to care about was Eris' relationship with Mariel, which was genuine and led Eris through some GREAT development and then gets ruined because of course it does. Every other relationship felt like a plot point for drama. Cord and Rylin weren't a horrible couple either, but unfortunately, they were clearly there for the drama. Atlas and Avery creeped me out. Look, I have a stepbrother. Siblings, even if they aren't biological, should not date. Yuck.✔ GOSSIP GIRL HAD MORE CHARACTER DEPTH THAN THIS⭐ Avery, aka Cersei Lannister, is a virginal blonde girl who lives on the top floor, and she's utterly insufferable. Avery slutshames, talks shit about all her friends, and is ridiculously hateable. That's her entire character. I feel like she has a lot of potential as a delicious antihero, but she's not portrayed as an antihero - she's portrayed as an innocent. Also, she fucks her brother. Yeah.⭐ Watt is a stalker. That's his only character trait. Besides a few weirdly racial stereotypes. ⭐ Leda... was a very frustrating character to follow. She begins the story as a former drug addict who's really trying to get clean and has some nice relationships with her mom and brother. She's loyal and into meditation, and really the only annoying bit about her is her dislike for Eris. She ends the book as a completely terrible person with no character whatsoever. Leda's character arc feels messy at best and false at worst. You deserved better, Leda. She, too, has a lot of potential as a delicious antihero, but she's not portrayed as an antihero - she's the villain. ⭐ Rylin is very protective of her sister, Chrissa, and is less rich than the rest - she lives on 32. Her character is a bit of a cliche, poor because her mother is dead, but she's less whiny than the rich kids. She had potential. HOWEVER. Rylin's character development is not positive, and she's reduced almost entirely to her bland romance plot.⭐ Eris annoyed me a lot at the beginning, but she grew on me. She is forced to live down on the bottom levels by a family tragedy, and her relationship with her parents was relatively well-developed. Erin is also the only character that really develops, which is like... sad.To some degree this book is enjoyable in that ""mindless drama"" sort of way. It's just too bad it was so, so problematic and angering. ✔ THIS BOOK IS YIKES AND IN CONCLUSION: I AM BITTER♚ While I loved Eris as a character, it should be noted that she's stereotyped too - it's time for us to end the trope of the one bisexual character who ""sleeps around"" and almost cheats.♔ Soooooooo much girl hate and slutshaming. Oh god, there was so much girl hate in this book in general. Aside from Eris and Mariel, who are dating, there is not one positive relationship between women, and worse, most of the issues in these friendships revolve around guys or slutshaming. This is just annoying. It's 2017. We can have normal friendships. ♚ Women are treated like sex objects and no one really does anything about it. You guys think I'm kidding. At one point, a male characters slaps a female character's ass - they are not dating - and it is literally just considered a flirty gesture by the girl. This is really just objectively shitty worldbuilding; we're living in 2150, and you're telling me treating girls like meat is still okay?♔ Pretty much all the dude love interests are somewhat hypermasculine and vaguely creepy in my reading. I think I'm supposed to want Atlas and Avery together, but honestly, their relationship read as somewhat... creepy... to me. And not even just because they're siblings [oh yeah, they're siblings] but Atlas is just a fucking creeper. He reads like every 30-year-old who's ever hit on me at the gym.♚ Rape was treated somewhat badly, at least in my reading. There's also something that happens at the end of this book where it's implied one character daterapes another character and it's fairly glossed over. It's possible that this was meant to be horrifying and will be handled better in book two; that being said, to me it came across as ""it's not real rape because it's a dude."" ♔ Some kind of... racial stereotyping. Yikes. One character is described as Middle Eastern, and has three character traits: socially awkward, computer nerd, and either can't get laid or is desperately trying to get laid. That's... a lot of major stereotypes about East Asian men, and he's not East Asian, but it still feels like a negative portrayal. The one dark-skinned character is addicted to drugs and also... you know, the villain of the fucking book. And the one other mixed-race character is a poor person who turns to thievery. Of the rich characters, two out of three are white, while both poor characters are not white. You can actually list the characters by wealth and the two wealthiest characters are white. If this connection were analyzed, it could be an interesting thematic element and parallel racism in real life. But it's not. And I recognize this could all be coincidence, but the fact that a lot of the characters here are racial stereotypes is pretty... uncomfortable. ♚ The most genuinely upsetting part of this is that Avery, a ""genetically perfect"" model created by her parents, is blonde and white. Let's just emphasize this. She's genetically perfect because she's white. Genetic perfection = whiteness. Yes, I recognize that this is the standard of beauty we know right now in America and Europe. Yes, I recognize that a lot of white authors haven't necessarily interrogated that. Yes, I recognize that this is probably an accident. But this is straight-up racist eugenics. In this supposedly racially diverse future world, making genetic manipulation with the specific intent of beauty lead to a white lead is genuinely horrifying. And on a related note, Avery is a far more terrible human being than most of the characters, yet she's given a lot of narrative sympathy other characters do not. (Arguably, any genetic manipulation is in and of itself eugenics, and I think any narrative wanting to talk about genetics should actually unpack that. But also, in 2016, I think unpacking felt like too much to ask from ya lit or lit in general to be fucking honest. So I'll just leave it at the bare-minimum standard of 'your genetic perfection being a white person has uncomfortable implications' and go. ♚ This is a major, major spoiler for the end and for book two, but it's also something I think sapphics especially will want to know before picking up: bury your gays. Severe. Because as we all know, burying BOTH of your queer lead characters for the development of your all-straight, all-alive cast is so creative. So never-before-done. So seldom-discussed. Anyway, point is, if you write a book with, oh, maybe seven straight main characters, and then two sapphics, and you choose to bury the bi girl in your first book and the lesbian in your second book and all the straight people are still alive? Your book has a fucking problem. VERDICT: I genuinely think this book is terrible. I really would like to imagine this was all intentional, and the author will subvert it all in book three, but I really don't think that's at all what's happening here. I'm tired and I'm angry and I am really done caring if people know it. I don't think this is a book or author that I want to support, ever.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,2,691,1,"Oct 08, 2016","Oct 10, 2016","Oct 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28218953-the-thousandth-floor

I genuinely like middle-grade novels; the genre has a more simplistic writing style, which can actually be nice, and doesn't usually lean on romance, which can only be a good thing. But middle grade realistic books often suffer from the same issue; they're unmemorable. Too simplistic and lacking in fleshed-out characters. While The Lotterys Plus One is a particularly good middle-grade novel, it still suffers from the same issues. The Lotterys Plus One is a diverse retelling of full house, but that's not all it is. It's a coming of age for kids who can't relate to the archetype, and it's utterly heartwarming. Even beyond that, this is a story about family, mixed-up as it might be.There's also the disapproving grandfather, a grump who doesn't approve of his kid's “lifestyle”. He's a very unlikable character, but his inclusion gives this escapist story a touch of realness, which was exactly what was needed. There are four parents, two dogs, and six siblings in the Lottery household, each with distinct personalities and characterization. These characters are certainly likable and relatable, although none of them felt all that fleshed out. There's a difference between likable and fleshed out. Most middle-grade novels forget to make that jump, and unfortunately this book was no different.

This book follows Jack and his foster brother Joseph, a 14-year-old boy who has a daughter he's never met. Usually I'd take issue with this kind of book for the emotional manipulation. However, the emotional realness of this one definitely stands out. It's quietly sad. The characters never tell you to feel– you just feel anyway. I didn't feel manipulated at all. The themes of friendship and love are so fleshed out. I couldn't look away. I have to admit this book is a bit too short.

You'd think that with such an incredible premise, no one could ever forget this book. But the issues end up seeming superficial because 1) it's not written that well, and 2) none of the characters are developed in any way. The second point is kind of a major issue. There's no reason to feel emotion for this story because there are no characters to care about. The main protagonist, Saba, isn't a bad character. She's not weak, and she had a TON of potential. But she's also not developed beyond being The Person Who Solved The Mystery. You might be thinking “okay, wait. But what about the racism issue promised in the blurb?” I wish I could add points for tackling racism in a good way, but the author didn't tackle these issues with enough dimension.

Nothing up in the sky or below the dirt or walking beside them on the ground. There were just people. Good people, like her and Maria. Assholes, like the truck driver who'd slammed into the minivan and screwed up Lily's legs. And random people, like the other kids at Acheron, who she guessed were somewhere in between.Well, I had a few problems, but guys: sapphic girl Macbeth. And really, really creepy. Definitely worth reading. The primary strength of As I Descended is probably the aesthetic of it all. I love creepy boarding school books, and the eerie gothic element of this one was definitely a hit - a few scenes are genuinely a bit terrifying. This is one of those books where the atmosphere gives the whole book its character, to the point where it's hard not to get engaged and forget where you are. While the book isn't exactly fast, I found it really hard to put down. And I really enjoyed all four of the lead characters. They're all terrible and gay and I love them. Maria, our bi Macbeth character, is ridiculously ambitious and probably would've won most likely to rule the world if she hadn't killed a person. Lily, our disabled lesbian Lady Macbeth character, is somewhat of an unapologetically terrible person and probably my favorite. Braedan, our Banquo character, is Maria's best friend and definitely did not deserve this. Mateo, our MacDuff character, is Braedan's boyfriend - which is possibly the best decision ever made in any Macbeth retelling - and enjoys dragging private school culture to hell and back. The thing is, though, As I Descended fails as a good retelling of Macbeth. In my mind, the main thing that makes Macbeth work is that humans are utterly to blame. While yes, there's a touch of the supernatural, Macbeth is the one to blame for all his actions. The touch of supernatural here, though, takes over the book to the point where it could be argued ghosts are to blame rather than people. It's as if the author took the plot and the idea of the characters, but totally messed up the subtle things that make Macbeth work so well. You know, I could ignore this, and say it's not a retelling of Macbeth but rather a reimagining - my favorite Shakespeare reimagining of all time is Exit Pursued By a Bear, a book nothing like the play that came before (and coincidentially authored by someone who blurbed this book.) But this one feels too close to be so far. I felt as if As I Descended bled out my favorite parts of Macbeth; the character depth, the search for the human soul. And I also thought the ending was disappointing. (view spoiler)[There's no point to the whole thing, and everything ends tragically for the one surviving character. I feel as if this ending just got lost in the midst of the book. I also felt Maria deserved a far longer death scene - after a book of development, this should've been her big moment. (hide spoiler)] Spoiler-free thesis? It ended too quickly.Okay, quick paragraph because I have discourse to mention. I'm aware people complained about bury-your-gays here, and it's fine if that bothered you personally - yes, some of the queer characters do die - but... um. guys. The entire cast is queer. The. Entire. Fucking. Cast. Bury your gays is an issue because it's always one already-tokenistic sapphic in an entirely straight cast who dies a super quick death written by some straight male author who immediately says questionably fetishistic things in some interview. This is not that. Also, hey, if you want all queer characters to be perfect angels, go read a contemporary and have a nice day. I, personally, enjoy my morally black characters. To be honest, I'm fucking ecstatic that we finally have queer characters who are morally grey too. Maybe some of this can be attributed to weird expectations - I love Robin Talley, but she doesn't tend to be creepy. But all in all, though I appreciated elements quite a bit, I think this could've been better. Would recommend this as a good creepy read, but with hesitation.TW for use of words like “cripple,” clearly called out, and a scene where a girl is essentially roofied.

I like the ideas here, but the execution is a bit lacking. The Good+ This series truly is a “classic”. The prose is good, the worldbuilding is good. This series is, in general, a model of subtlety in worldbuilding compared to many other dystopias. Of course, I often hate reading subtle worldbuilding, but that's my own bias. + There are some interesting moral conflicts brought up. Unfortunately, there's not enough depth to the writing to give them the airtime I would have liked. Now, to the one thing about this series that seriously turns me off. Like many of the early dystopias I've read, the characters in this series are plot devices. That's it. They aren't developed, their choices often don't make sense. And what's more, there's an EXTREME dearth of female characters. The one female character later in the books? Motivated to find a baby. And that's her entire character. All in all, I think the lack of character writing puts this book into the same category for me as many other “classics”: I see the appeal, but I don't care enough about the characters to really get interested.

Freakboy is a novel in verse about being nonbinary and trans.

I could have ignored these flaws and given this three stars just for the positive trans rep, were it not for the unnecessarily sad ending. I’m really tired of books about lgbt issues with sad endings. How many lgbt people want to read books where we end up sad and alone? Given that I have authority to speak on this topic, here’s the answer: no, no we don't. Books about getting dumped for being bi or trans or nonbinary aren’t what most lgbt people are looking for. Those books aren't what we want; we want books where we can be represented with the same happy endings as everyone else. Frankly, this book feels as if it’s written to educate cisgender people; in fact, it’s written by a cis author. We don’t want to be educated about the difficulties of being lgbt in our world; we want to see stories about ourselves in the same settings as straight, cis people get to see.

Yes, here I am again, shitting all over books everyone else finds incredible. This book IS important. Intersex issues deserve more recognition and the author is clearly trying to give these topics exactly the recognition they deserve. But first of all, it's kind of mediocre, and second of all, the rep isn't really all that fantastic? // ISSUES BOOKS DISCUSSIONSHere's the thing: this reads like an issues book where the ""issue"" is her being intersex. And that just feels... uh. I don't know, I really do not like issue books. I think there's a fundamental flaw in the idea of trying to write a book ""about"" some issue. No book can sum up all experiences, and I feel like books of this type are trying. I also somewhat disliked how the main character builds friendship. Everything feels very... I don't know, false? It doesn't come close to any experiences I've had as a marginalized person; in fact, it kind of feels like it's being written to appeal to people without any of these experiences. I'm not judging the author here, but this is... totally how I felt. There's a weird event with a hate crime that I've seen a lot of people discussing as a negative, and I have to say I don't necessarily find it quite so inauthentic, but it's also... kind of gross. ""Doesn't misgender you"" is not a good standard for a relationship or friendship. And there's also the huge overuse of slurs for shock value. Here is a longer  with examples of the overuse of slurs. Most of these are considered negative, but I honestly wish some of it had just been cut?// MEDIOCRITY, MEDIOCRITY EVERYWHEREOkay, beyond the rep issues: let's talk mediocrity. Despite some important discussions of gender issues, what does this book offer to the genre of ya contemporaries? Beneath all the good, important conversations, there's a protagonist who's hard to relate to - even when you feel sympathy for her situation, you feel one step removed from the book. There's also one of the most cookie-cutter romances I've read. Yes, here is a boy. He fell for this girl. He actually thinks of her as a girl. How kind. Is that it? Is that all their relationship is based off of? Because it felt that way to me. There's also a dissatisfying ending. It's happy, which is sadly kind of unexpected, but it's far too abrupt. Kristin isn't given the full time to recover and get back into her life. VERDICT: Again, the topics of gender and intersex issues are executed somewhat well.

But it's funny and it's sweet and that's what you need out of a contemporary, right?My favorite part of this book is the humor. Leila's narrative voice is absolutely hilarious. Her descriptions of each side character are so funny. Her inner thoughts are hilariously relatable. Even when the book gets sad or dark, Leila's voice brings it back into the realm of enjoyable. Despite the humor, Tell Me Again How A Crush Should Feel doesn't hesitate to occasionally get dark. Leila's personal struggles all feel very real. Her commentary on her life is often darkly humorous, funny when read but sad when thought about for more than a moment. She's such a relatable character and by the end, you find yourself really rooting for her and cheering her on. The second best bit of this book is the romance plot, which is absolutely adorable. The other character's name is a bit of a spoiler, but she and Leila have an incredibly sweet slow-build relationship. Their banter is incredibly endearing and they're so sweet together. I honestly don't have any complaints about this story. It's still not my genre– I rarely enjoy this kind of contemporary so much.

Indeed, most of the novel is specifThe first half of Cameron Post is set in Montana in the ‘90s, and is, at least at first glance, slow and plodding. Indeed, most of the novel is specifically written as a typical coming-of-age novel; Cameron is a typical ‘90s teenage character who (stop me if you’ve heard this before) has lost her parent, smokes and drinks, and falls in with wrong crowds. She is a normal teenager, that is, until she has the audacity to kiss her best friend Coley. The second half of Cameron Post takes place at a conversion therapy camp where Cameron has been sent by her aunt, after Coley reports to her parents that Cameron has forced herself upon her (their relationship has been entirely consensual). Cameron is blindsided, and betrayed, and increasingly reluctant to admit that to the audience — we see her as closed off and numb. She barbs at her aunt and rarely, if ever, exhibits any kind of character breakdown, making her progression hard to see. But her coming-of-age is inextricably wound with her accepting of herself as a lesbian, despite the hate she has been taught to have for herself. Cameron’s journey, thus, mostly surrounds internalized homophobia. In her first encounter with Coley, she puts words to the alienation: “Even though no one had ever told me, specifically, not to kiss a girl before, nobody had to. It was guys and girls who kissed in our grade, on TV, in the movies, in the world, and that's how it worked: guys and girls. Anything else was something weird.” Even in a world where queerness is more accepted, being queer is fundamentally alienating: you learn that you are other, and so you must make your experience consumable for others. Straight people are people; we are other.The second half of this text is incredibly painful to read; Aunt Ruth’s oddly well-intentioned homophobia is painful, because it comes so close to sounding rational. Even Cameron is caught up: “I felt like it could be that God had made this happen, had killed my parents, because I was living my life so wrong that I had to be punished, that I had to be made to understand how I must change, and that Ruth was right, that I had to change through God.” She learns to hate herself quickly because society has already taught her to hate herself: conversion therapy just extends it. When Cameron finally realizes, with the help of other queer people at the camp, that she is not the problem, she tells the audience this: “It’s supposed to convince you that you’re always gonna be a dirty sinner and that it’s completely your fault because you’re not trying hard enough to change yourself.”Cameron Post does not end on a happy takedown of the camp and all its ideals: rather, (view spoiler)[it ends on Cameron and her two best friends from the conversion therapy camp running away. (hide spoiler)] The homophobes in this book do not change their minds. The development is all in Cameron herself. “Maybe I still haven't become me. I don't know how you tell for sure when you finally have,” Cameron tells us at the end. Problems are not gone, but she finally understands that she is not the problem.There's a lot about this book that shines, honestly. Danforth's characterization is consistent and multidimensional; Cameron is a believable protagonist, unsure of herself but wanting to be, and with a strong internal voice. This strength of characterization applies across the board. The antagonists are as believable and complex as they are terrifying; I feel as if I know Aunt Ruth, and she terrifies me with her odd blend of well-intentioned homophobia. I also appreciated the gorgeous depictions of the Montana setting. I also actually think the conversion therapy section does a fairly good job skirting away from being torture porn; it has a clear point at all times. Essentially I only have two negatives about this book: 1) despite the worthy first section, it is just a bit too long. At least a hundred pages could've been cut here; descriptions of the setting can't keep me interested forever. 2) several comments made by Cameron and friends are somewhat biphobic and not criticized; I think it's meant to echo the '90s, but in such a deep-into-human-psyche book, it's just out of place and I struggle to respect it. But overall, I would highly recommend this - it is worth the read. TW: severe homophobia and transphobia, conversion therapy.

It's just not... anything more. While Ash isn't a bad book by any means, its emotional content is lacking compared to Huntress. First of all, I really didn't think the romance moved beyond “sweet” to me. This is such a typical girl-meets-girl story, and it's got a touch of instalove. Maybe part of my lack of care for the romance comes from my hatred of Cinderella. No, I'm not heartless; no, I don't like Cinderella. Moving on. Ash is also fairly plotless. While there is some plot, the conflicts seem flimsy up until the ending. As a result, this 250 page book feels like a 400 page book.

Currently a solid part of my “not bad, but not good either” collection. Main problem: I never felt true emotion for the main characters. I don't know who they are as people. Emma Trevayne makes no effort to develop the side characters or love interest beyond basic traits (and sometimes can't even be bothered with those. Why did I give this 3 stars?). The main character is defined by his relationships with these side characters, and as such, no character made me feel anything. In my original two-line , I said that the world building was interesting if a bit confusing. To elaborate: the concept for this book is actually very interesting. Everyone in their society is forced to listen to music that is slowly destroying their brains. This book should have really appealed to me as a musician, and Trevayne did, to her credit, develop the protagonist's love of music. However, how they got to the situation they are in, where every person in the country is essentially being forced to slowly kill themselves, is never explained. That's a huge problem. The author also pulls a bury-your-gays. There's nice bi representation in the main character and I really wanted to give Trevayne credit for diversity, but I can't really give her that credit when she also pulled this trope out. Don't really recommend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Jan 2016,Jan 2016,"Oct 03, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15843071-coda

It's a book I'd only recommend to fans of existentialism and We All Looked Up-type books. Yet it's still so completely worth the read. I want everyone to read this and see how good the second half is. // THE FIRST HALF AND DISAPPOINTMENTSo let me get the bad over with. Mirror In The Sky does not deliver on its fantastic premise about an alternate earth. Yes, it improves later on, but so many people are going to be disappointed by this. Terra Nova is used mostly as a plot device for character development and feelings. In fact, the first half of the book barely mentions Terra Nova at all. But once you adjust your expectations, the book improves. It was a similar reading experience as We All Looked Up, but with better characters. This almost feels like two different books to . The first half is booooooring. Way too long-winded. In fact, I actually DNFed this. The characters don't stand out here either; they're all assholes and the romance sucks so much. If you read this, don't DNF in the first half - it genuinely gets so much better. // THE SECOND HALF AND DRMATIC PAYOFF♔ At this point, Khorana seems to finally understand what she wants to talk about, and she gets deep fast. She explores racism. She takes her annoying characters and uses them to explore what it means to be a good person. By the end, the characters had stolen my heart. This book is so raw and real. ♚ In general, there's a ton of character work in this section. Even the protagonist, who didn't impress me much in the first half, won my heart by the end. The side characters here stand out and break your heart. Except for that one love interest. He can go fuck himself. ♔ The romance... is still not great. Seriously, this is one of the most unromantic romance plots ever written. The amount of cheating involved just completely ruined this for me. However, even this horrendous romantic storyline gets an emotionally raw ending.♚ The ending is perfect. Khorana ends on a note that's an odd mix of tragic and hopeful. You'll have to decide for yourself. Either way, there will be tears.Recommended to fans (or people who anticipated but were disappointed in) of We All Looked Up, Places No One Knows, and Before I Fall....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Sep 22, 2016","Oct 09, 2016","Oct 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27130752-mirror-in-the-sky

Forman chooses to tell this story in a narrative way, telling rather than showing. This actually works for the story. Unfortunately, while Mia's emotional disconnect is realistic and well-formed, she is so emotionally cold that the narrative suffers. Her emotional coldness actually could've made this book even more powerful, but I had a hard time relating to Mia. She's too perfect, too talented, too beautiful.

Mia's being a musician is the one character trait of hers that really sets her apart, and I love how it's incorporated into the writing. The other flaw of this book is the romance's overtaking it.

More so than Park, but they're both very well-developed. This is one of the first contemporary books that made me believe in the main characters. They both have arcs, they both have similarities and differences and fleshed-out families. Oh god, the ending. The ending is exactly what I wanted, honestly. There's a possibility of happiness and a possibility of sadness, but either way, they've both changed each other. There's something so meaningful about it. I don't know whether to recommend this.

ELISE DRAGS YOUR FAVES: A MASTERPOST OF COMPLAINTS THAT APPLY TO AT LEAST TEN DIFFERENT BOOKSUnlike plenty of ers, I don't have an issue with teenagers being pretentious. I'm a 16-year-old and I know at least four people far more pretentious than Augustus Waters will ever be. I admit, I'm one of those annoying people who has an opinion on everything and will tell you the nuances of that opinion. Even if I my opinion is “both of you have a point” I can make an hour long speech about that opinion. Teens being smart is great. My issue here is that these teens don't feel like real people. They feel like mouthpieces of wisdom. No one is this brilliant all of the time; we all need time to relax with friends. Let's talk about emotional manipulation. This book does have a genuine emotional heart; it just gets blocked up by all the “let's make our reader cry!” These characters have a lot of potential, but instead of being given proper character arcs, they are used as plot devices to make a reader cry. Yes, I cried, but that doesn't mean I'm not aware that was the only point of this book. I suppose some of my distaste for this book is that I've begun to develop a distaste for books meant to make you cry. I prefer books that make you want to cry because you love and relate to the main character so much. I don't like books where the ending feels engineered to make me cry.People uphold books like this as showing the reality of life. I say books like this portray a depressing take on life in general. Life sucks and then you die, we get that. I read literature because I want to see life get better. Cheesy as it is, I want to see these characters live on, scarred from what they've been through but ready to take on their life. I want books to give me hope for humanity, for our resistance and our need to recover. I want endings that make me cry tears of happiness, feeling like life sucks now, but it will get better.Really, the worst thing about this book is that it started a trend of books that use mental illness and real teen issues as a plot device for reader angst. Some of the early books yielded by this genre were amazing; Thirteen Reasons Why and Perks of Being A Wallflower got to the emotional heart of things and offered developed characters with mental health issues. But from here, we've gotten books like All the Bright Places, Me Before You, and so many books using anxiety as a cutesy quirk that I don't even want to make a list.

Katniss is frankly never romantically interested in either for almost all of books one and two; she grows to care about Peeta in the general sense, not just the romantic sense. The eventual romance works for Katniss because it is safe for her. (What I’m saying is this was tenderness.)I more think this series is interesting in how it talks about the nature of power and the nature of uprising. The uprising, as a whole, is an upswelling of the people, a realization that there is strength in numbers. Yet some of the most revolutionary actions of this series are individual — it takes Katniss’ desire to save her sister to start a war, Katniss’ love for little Rue to create horror, Cinna’s willingness to sacrifice his life to create a symbol. Even during war, the individual lives of characters like Joanna and Haymitch and Finnick matter. They matter to the narrative, and thus they matter to us too. (view spoiler)[The ending of book three is essentially a moment in which Katniss realizes that in taking out an old source of power, a new dictator has sprung up in his place on the same level of authoritarianism. I’m going to say it: the moment in which she chooses to shoot Coin is honest to god one of the best moments in literary history. (hide spoiler)]Katniss Everdeen is still a deeply revolutionary heroine not only in that she’s written to be fairly gender non-conforming but also in that she is outwardly cold to all but her very few favorite people, and the narrative does not see fit to punish her for it, but to empathize with her and allow her to grow naturally in small ways. Her journey is not in becoming a Nice Person but in self-actualization. That is not a journey female characters are ever ever ever allowed to take and is arguably still something new. I almost want to case study this. It’s a similar dynamic to Lord of the Rings being blamed for the general problems of late-1900s fantasy... but worse, because criticism of the YA dystopian genre so often fell into somewhat misogynistic areas, and I don’t think there’s any point in denying that The Hunger Games, due to having an image as Something Young Women Enjoyed™️, received far more criticism than its equivalents in other genres. It's crazy that the first big ya dystopia is the best ya dystopia and one of the best series of all time, but this one is truly a classic and remains so incredible. Thank you to Katniss Everdeen for being one of the most interesting characters ever written and to this book for having such a dynamic story.

However, I think aside from Cress, none of them have really developed as much as I wish they had. + Cinder and Kai: Cinder is a likable, fun character. However, she gets more pagetime here (and in the other books) than most characters. It bothers me a bit. I felt her character overwhelmed the action in places. Maybe it's just that she had a book all to herself. Nevertheless, Cinder had an awesome story conclusion. + Scarlet and Wolf: Scarlet is such an awesome character. I'd willingly let her kick my ass. And her and Wolf are such a good couple. They had so much good development here, which I loved. + Cress and Thorne: My FAVORITE couple. They had awesome development here. And I have to admit, Cress' development is really special to me. I didn't like her much at the beginning of her book, but she's grown on me so much. What a fabulous character. + Winter and Jacin: Winter's a great character, but her development in this book felt underwritten. Yes, despite the fact that this is her book and it's 800 pages. And her romance with Jacin wasn't nearly as good as the other three couples'. In terms of plot, this was fine. There are a few twists, but nothing major. The ending was completely predictable, but that didn't stop it from being enjoyable.This book was also waaaaaay to long. Come on, some of this could've been put into Cress, which was too low on action anyway. Winter just doesn't balance with the rest of the series in terms of plot. All in all, Winter wasn't my favorite of the lunar chronicles, but it was by no means a disappointment.

The drama surrounding whether or not shall survive the damn series is overshadowed by the drama over which guy she'll pick. Sound familiar? Possibly the most creative thing this book does is kill off one of the major love interests and replace him with another guy of the exact same archetype. At least Julian was less of a dick. I have to admit, the series is entertaining enough. If you can look past all the tropes, which 12-year-old-me was very willing to do, it's fast-paced enough to be entertaining.

There's some great atmosphere and a feeling of wrongness throughout the book. The prose only helps; this story flows naturally and doesn't have major pacing issues. The main character here is clever and likable. She wants to believe that everything is okay, but she's not an idiot; she knows something's wrong with her family.

Keep in mind, I didn't even finish this, I stopped at 50% because I found it so terrible. But I still have a long list of complaints, so here you go. Don't say I didn't warn you. THE WORST PARTS OF THIS BOOKalternate title: female characters that were obviously written by menOkay, that alternate title is partially a joke. But in a lot of ways, I'm really not kidding. Cassie went from a five-star character to a one-star character somewhere between the first and last book. What on earth happened? Where she used to be such an interesting, 3D heroine, she's now a cardboard prop for a terrible romance. I hate seeing such a compelling character reduced to this. And I am not exaggerating when I say terrible romance. Cassie and Evan were never a good couple for me. There was too much instalove and Evan, while he was a somewhat interesting character, never gave enough indication of being good. But I actively hated them in this book. This is an actual quote from this book: My hands roamed his body, an undiscovered country, which henceforth I shall call Evanland. Hills and valleys, desert plains and forest glens, the landscaped pocked by the scars of battle, crisscrossed by fault lines and unexpected vistas. And I am Cassie the Conquistador: the more territory I conquer, the more I want. I'm sorry, is this supposed to be sexy? It's not. I've never been less turned on in my entire life. THE LESS BAD PARTS OF THIS BOOKalternate title: this book was so bad I had to have two sections of bad#1: The plotting is really boring. There's just no drive. It feels like a wandering journey rather than a deftly plotted book. #2: Ringer's storyline in this was not great. And this is coming from someone who ADORED Ringer's points of view in The Infinite Sea. Her chapters here very much disappointed me. Also, I've been spoiled about a certain plot point here, which strikes me as so sexist I don't even want to think about it. (view spoiler)[Teen pregnancy? Really, Yancey? Really? (hide spoiler)] #3: Ben Parish's chapters in here really didn't touch my heart nearly as much as usual. Maybe his plotlines were just too boring for me to handle. #4: The bullshit love triangle. #5: The writing somehow lost all its magic for me? Yancey's writing style has changed a lot since book one, and not for the better. THE GOOD PARTS OF THIS BOOKalternate title: nonexistentAgain, when I wrote that alternate title, I was joking. But now that I come to this section, I really can't think of anything good about this book. I legitimately cannot think of a single thing I actually enjoyed in this book. Um. I heard that Ben and Ripper get together, and since I've been shipping them since the beginning, I'm happy about that, I guess. But I didn't get that far because this book just pissed me off that much. AND FINALLY... SHOULD YOU READ THIS SERIES?Um.

Unfortunately, you can’t be that precise and selective. When you mess with one part of a person’s life, you’re messing with their entire life. Everything. . . affects everything.”I am... legitimately not entirely sure how I feel about this book. What I do know is that this is a book that deserves a lot of intercommunity discussion and not a ton of outside input. Because I honestly don't think you're going to get it if you haven't dealt with depression. Thankfully - or unthankfully, if we're being real - I have. So let's talk. 🌺 NON-DISCOURSEY GOOD POINTS: A RUNDOWNI'm at least 80% sure all of you know what this is about - and, of course, about the controversy - but before we get down to it, I do want to dedicate a brief paragraph to summary. Thirteen Reasons Why is about Hannah, who has sent tapes telling her life story to every person who has hurt her. And then killed herself, leaving everyone with the simple legacy of their wrongs. ✔ This book is certainly a page-turner. I found it exceptionally hard to put down. I genuinely think this book was one of the formative ones for me and the character-driven-suspense genre, which... credit where credit is due. ✔ I love the creative storytelling. There are essentially two narrators; the dead Hannah, and the point-of-view character Clay. It's a really creative choice and I like it. 🌺 REP OF DEPRESSION AND MENTAL ILLNESS♔ I know a lot of depressed people have said Hannah is a terrible representation of mentally ill people, and I've got to say that's true only if you're looking at all depressed people as a monolith. We're not a monolith and I don't care if I get hate for this - I really connected with Hannah. She's an incredibly flawed, yet incredibly sympathetic heroine. She's angry and bitter and has completely let her anger consume her. Yes, she’s a very flawed character, but she’s relatable and real in every moment. ♚ That being said, it's relevant that the author probably was trying to make this an accurate representation of all suicides. As evidenced by s, he didn't succeed.♔ You know what's really not good? The fact that the word depression is never actually used within the fucking book. That's relevant. You can't get away with just ""random mentally ill character."" Use your words, people. ♚ All that being said, if you're neurotypical, please do not claim to speak for depressed people on ""what depression is really like."" I am never going to support your right to tell me I ""don't know what it's like to have depression."" because I dared to enjoy a fucking book. Do you know how I know what depression is like? Because I fucking have it. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. I HAVE DEPRESSION. NEWSFLASH: You're not helping mentally ill people by telling mentally ill people they're not mentally ill because they enjoyed a book. Depressed people aren't a monolith. We have opinions. We blame and feel just as much as everyone else. So yeah, fuck that particular piece of discourse. 🌺 NARRATIVE FRAMING AND A LOT OF FUCKING BAD POINTSThe best s you can find about the problems here are definitely Emma's and Cait's (YOU SHOULD FOLLOW BOTH OF THEM). Please give those a read while I edit this section and try to come to terms with my many, many thoughts. Before I get started, two goods.✔ It's really relevant to point out that this was one of the first YA books that talked about suicide in a frank way. There is absolutely nothing revolutionary about this book now, but in 2006? There WAS. Despite the weird portrayal of suicide, there is a lot about this that was rare back in 2006 and I do appreciate that. ✔ While the portrayal of this is... somewhat messed up, I did kind of like the message about taking responsibility for your own actions while the person is alive. Let's talk about the issues with 1) its lack of focus on depression and 2) the romanticization of suicide. Especially with the advent of the TV show. It's relevant to point out that the book doesn't necessarily justify her actions, only demonstrates them. I know people are going to disagree with me here because it's being marketed to teens, but I like that this a book that thrives in nuance and not in simple black / white thinking. I know I was a lot more emotionally mature when I read this than most twelve year olds are (tragicbackstory.jpg), but I definitely did not take this a life lesson. The issue is the somewhat romantic light this book presents suicide. While Thirteen Reasons Why does not ever explicitly condone what Hannah did, her actions are presented as a sort of glorious revenge fantasy. And I don't love that. These people did horrible things to her, but they did not directly cause her suicide. What I don't love is that every other character is left to suffer in what they've done, when many of them did minor things. These characters are being blamed for a suicide. If the book were more nuanced on this point, it would be one thing, but a lot of them have their own things going on. It doesn't mean Hannah has to forgive them, but the narrative... agrees that they are directly to blame for her suicide. And honestly, aside from two characters in this book who I genuinely think are completely to blame for their own actions, most of these characters don't deserve that. I almost feel like the tenth anniversary ending was better? This ending is so, so ignorant of the feelings of any other characters, and considering Clay’s lack of guilt over what happened to Hannah, there’s no interesting message to be taken from the unnecessarily sad ending.VERDICT: A complicated book that sends some complicated messages. There's a part of me that really likes this book, but there's a lot of me telling you to run quickly. Honestly, I'd recommend checking it out for yourself if anything.

Let’s discuss. # SPOILER-FREE GUSH REVIEW SECTIONMary is one of the strongest characters I've ever read in YA. She's realistic and just as full of contradictions as anyone. She's been in juvenile detention, she's been up and down the block a few times, but she still wants a family and wants to be loved. In places, she doubts herself and thinks she's a bad person. All she wants is to break free from her mother, but she still loves her mother and wants her acceptance. All of these traits blend together into one of the most amazing character arcs I have ever read in a book.  The plot was engaging and I desperately wanted to find out what happened. The writing style is great, flowing so well that I lost myself in this book. Tiffany D. Jackson takes every opportunity to build dramatic tension. The different themes of both the book and Mary's character arc blend together perfectly. Every moment of the book is pitch-perfect. The only problem is that awful plot twist and ending.# WHY THE ENDING FEELS WEAK - SPOILERY DISCUSSIONMary's narrative is so strong that the ending feels weak and cheap.(view spoiler)[There was so much about escaping the cycle of abuse, and her abusive mother, and then in the end, it turns out she fucking did it. Way to abandon the premise and her entire character arc, which, by the way, was so much more brilliant than this nonsensical twist. Can we emphasize “nonsensical”? There are actual holes in whether or not the twist made any sense. THE TIMING DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AND SEVERAL OF THE THINGS SAID IN THE NOVEL NO LONGER MAKE SENSE BECAUSE OF THIS TWIST. I had a fifteen-minute discussion about how nonsensical and full of holes it was with another woman who read this book. Unreliable narrator is an interesting trope. But I'm sick of seeing it spoil good character arcs. If you can write a good character arc, don't. spoil. it. Unreliable narrator is interesting when it's a deviation from the norm, but I have seen it in at least four different YA novels at this point. This is a flawless book, one of the best I've ever read, without the twist. Mary deserved better. (hide spoiler)]The thing is, even with my hatred for the ending, I still have to give Allegedly five stars!

But this ending is just... bad. I'm sorry, it is. First of all, the worldbuilding. Oh my god, the worldbuilding. It literally makes no sense. At all. It blew up the entire world and made the first two books seem pointless. It's like no one ever read the plot to see if it actually made sense. How did no one notice that the plot makes no sense whatsoever?I also hate the reveal that Four isn't divergent. There's the fact that, again, it makes no fucking sense. (What's a plot?) But mainly I just hate that such an important reveal is shoved in this damn book. For drama. This reveal, which could be an excellent character moment, really just serves to make Tris more special and cause romantic drama between them. Listen, what was the point of the drama? They're together already. Why do they need to spend the entire book fighting when they could be, I don't know, carrying the plot? Third (yeah, I'm full of complaints), it tries to be extra dark by killing off the damn main character. Sorry, Tris. You deserved better. The thing is, this death could be so meaningful and interesting. But her death is absolutely pointless within the context of the book. Just like the deaths of literally every other main character except Christina and Tobias. Every. Single. Character. And again, the plot that got her to this point didn't make any damn sense. Last, and most unforgivable, the characters are not nearly as compelling as earlier in the series. RIP Tris Prior's incredible characterization. You shall be missed. Especially by me. Anyway. The divergent series deserved better than this. Tris and Four deserved better than this. Lynn, Marlene, Uriah, Christina, and Will all deserved SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS.

Behind the Beautiful Forevers is a story of hope and brutality. Katherine Boo follows four members in India's Annawadi slum, all struggling to get a leg up in the world. This book barely fits the boundaries of nonfiction; these are fictionalized portrayals of people Boo met in the slums. But all four main characters feel completely realistic, like real people. These characters are morally grey and willing to do what it takes, but they're not heartless either. This book goes right into the trenches of human selfishness, and it's beautiful. It's hard not to feel angry with the many people flooding the streets doing nothing for the residents of Annawadi. But then, Boo also brings across a feeling of hopelessness. This book made me feel like I was drowning in sorrow, especially as the story continued in its tragic direction. This book is not enjoyable, and it's not supposed to be.

Some of the comments about gay guys genuinely freaked me out. I've never read an lgbt romance that made me feel so sure the author was straight. Is this how the author thinks lesbians act around gay guys? Is this really how Sarah Tregay thinks? So there are two lesbian characters in this book. [No bi characters. What's a bisexual?] Both of them are obsessed with gay guys, and outright states that “everyone loves gay guys”. Never do they talk about gay girls, because they can't be too gay when they're props for the straight author!! Okay, Ms. Tregay. As a lesbian, I can tell you for certain that lesbians are no more obsessed with gay guys than anyone else. Also, being obsessed with gay guys and treating them like a fetish is... not good. They're real people! They're not props for jacking off! And okay, here's the worst part: you do not draw stuff about guys you know getting it on with each other and put it in the school paper. That's creepy and completely out of line. You can't frame this any other way; drawing comics about people you barely know dating is weird. Being outed to your entire school isn't fucking cute. It's really fucking not. Especially when you live in the goddamn Bible Belt. This could be legitimately dangerous for Jamie and Mason, and you want to have a laugh about it? That's terrible. Aside from all the legitimate issues with homophobia, Fan Art was just... bad. The characters are badly drawn and developed. the writing style wasn't great, and everything was so sickeningly sweet I wanted to vomit. And not in a good way. This is like if someone handed you a perfectly decent cupcake and proceeded to pour two pints of sugar syrup over it as you watched. That metaphor, by the way, wasn't nearly as terribly written as this book was. There were parts to Fan Art that weren't that bad. Jamie, the main character, is kind of a dick, but he had a decent friendship with one of the aforementioned terrible lesbians! Like, there were terrible parts to that friendship, obviously. But they had a scene where they danced and hugged and it was kind of cute! This entire book should've been about their friendship without the creepy-ass art concept, but noooooooo. In all honesty, this just read like the really terrible kind of fanfiction. I do not want to see weirdly fetishistic stuff in the gay section!! I go there to escape homophobia!! Not find more!! Please, Sarah Tregay, never write about LGBT characters again.

SUBVERTING TROPES AND BLENDING BINARIESIt took me a long time to figureThis book is about evil fairies and subverting genre expectations. SUBVERTING TROPES AND BLENDING BINARIESIt took me a long time to figure out why, exactly, this book captivated me so much. Yes, it's definitely a solid read, but what made this a five-star-favorite-book-ever read? I think in the long run what stood out to me was how Holly Black sees the tropes of this story and avoids them. Ben and Hazel are essentially a role-reversal of typical fantasy heroes. The boy is the one in love with a fair prince in the woods, the girl is the lionheart fighting for their lives. I also liked that The Darkest Part of the Forest is so... not heteronormative. I don't know how to describe it any better than that - Holly Black has this casual approach towards writing lgbtq characters that works perfectly. The entire world blends gender and sexuality binaries into this map that rings so true. All that being said, you need to have proper expectations for her writing. Black writes characters and relationships that are fucked up and doesn't always care to tell the audience “hey, this isn't okay.” There's this vibe of evil, of hate, that she's not trying to get rid of. CHARACTERS YOU HATE AND LOVEHolly Black is very good at writing unlikeable protagonists, characters you somewhat despise and somewhat love. She risks making you hate her protagonists so that you'll love her protagonists and I love it. The Darkest Part of the Forest has four main protagonists, two point of view characters and two somewhat-love-interests. I love all of them, of course. Black is very good at making you empathize with characters you feel as if you should dislike. Severin, for example, reads like he should be a villain. But the audience gets to decide whether he truly is. Hazel, though, is especially my favorite. She does not fit into any boxes; she is both the warrior archetype and a complex subversion of the warrior archetype. I felt as if I had a feel for her twenty pages in, and I never did give up that love for her. I also somewhat adore the way Holly Black writes relationships. She is this odd mix between a cynic and a hopeless romantic and her romance writing comes off exactly that way. Both romance plots here (I won't spoil with who!!) are understated but well-built all the same. And of course, there's the emphasis on sibling bonds. Ben and Hazel's sibling relationship is intricate and interesting. TENSION, FEAR, AND CLAUSTROPHOBIAHolly Black's writing is incredibly tense. You constantly feel as if you have to figure out what happens next. The environment is maybe one of my other favorite things about this book. Ben and Hazel's small town feels like another world, a claustrophobic hideaway cut off from all being. It makes a perfect setting, just eerie enough to make you feel on edge. She managed to make me feel small in comparison to this world, to this town, in a very visceral way. It's so engaging. VERDICT: This is one of my favorites and I REALLY recommend it to everyone. If morally ambiguous fairies in an eerie setting subverting genre expectations sounds like your shit, you need to pick this up.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,188,1,"Sep 17, 2016","Sep 18, 2016","Sep 18, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20958632-the-darkest-part-of-the-forest

WHAT MAKES THIS BOOK STAND OUT AMONG YA CONTEMPORARY—> Julia is an exciting, dynamic character who is far from perfect; she can be downright mean at times, although she's still good to her friends and family. She draws you in with her snappy, sarcastic narration. —> The book puts a good emphasis on friendship. This doesn't have romance, just a great relationship dynamic between Julia and her new friend, Yoga Pants (seriously). Julia's character arc is tied to her new friendship and letting people in, which was so amazing. —> This is one of the most diverse books I've ever read. Julia is a Deaf Indian girl with two moms, and none of these traits ever come close to defining her. Gardner analyzes the realistic impacts these traits have on Julia without stereotyping her or treating her as a stand-in for all Deaf people. Aside from these aspects, the story is a bit similar to that of a typical contemporary, which was slightly disappointing. Donovan's inclusion is completely pointless, and their relationship leaves a lot to be desired; that being said, the storyline is closed off relatively quickly.

Another forgettable YA suspense novel for the books.The largest problem is the lack of driving plot; it’s too long and watered-down. The entire book is mind-numbingly slow and packed with odd plot holes. The ending comes out of nowhere, without even a decent cliffhanger; it’s just flat-out not resolved. The characters have no personality traits beyond a lack of logical sense. They're boring and extremely flat. It practically doesn’t matter that the publisher forgot a person on the cover, because Candace and Grace are basically the same person. Paolo is practically irrelevant to the plot, and is essentially only there to be Lucy’s slightly creepy love interest. John has two traits: 1) gay 2) evil. Also, the fact that he was gay seemed to be tied to the fact that he was evil in a slightly odd way. I don’t even remember the rest of the characters. Or plot points. This book was just that forgettable. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 13, 2015","Sep 13, 2015","Sep 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22999141-emancipated

It's a great look at how a genuinely good person became a killer. Violent Ends doesn't excuse Kirby's actions, or even necessarily try to explain them. It just gives background, which makes the ending seem even more horrible. The fact that this is a collaboration makes this book better; the prose varies, and the stories come from people who differ in both their situations, and in their relationships to the killer. All the different character voices combine to create a terrifying narrative.My favorite story was probably Survival Instinct by Tom Leveen. Oh my god, this story made me cry. Zach, Kirby's best friend, lives with her emotionally and physically abusive father. Here, we see both I liked the sheer suspense and the impeccable writing style of this story; I was literally holding the edge of my seat, all because it felt so real. I read this book back in 2015, yet I still can't get this brilliant little story out of my head. I also really enjoyed The Perfect Shot by Shaun David Hutchison. It's one of the most powerful, memorable stories in this collection. There was some weird stalking going on; however, I liked this story a lot. My least favorite story was The Girl Who Said No by Trish Dollar. This book deserves a solid 1 star. Yes, let's blame a school shooting on a girl who turned down a guy for a date! Great plan! Not horribly misogynistic at all! Despite that one story, every other one was good. Definitely recommended.

If the book is boring, it'd better have some seriously awesome worldbuilding or character work. This has neither. The worldbuilding here is incredibly undeveloped. The idea of everyone dying at 20 is a good concept, but there's not nearly enough explanation and it doesn't seem relevant enough to our own world. There's no point to the world, no thematic lesson.

Very mixed feelings; this book and the second book don’t form a coherent enough narrative, yet the romance plot and characters are certainly worthwhile. In terms of character, this book absolutely suceeds. Rafe has a realistic, believable voice, and isn’t too perfect while also not being an asshole. Ben is a sweet guy while also not being a manic pixie dream boy. Their relationship is built up slowly in a great way. I hated the ending, but I understand why it was written. (Yay for their ending in the sequel!)Openly Straight has some great exploration of labels and what they mean. “We’re a pretty tolerant place,” Steve said, an edge to his voice.“Ah, interesting word. Tolerant. What does tolerant mean?”“It means we tolerate,” Steve said, flat. “We accept people.” “Actually, tolerance and acceptance are different. To tolerate seems to mean that there is something negative to tolerate, doesn't it? Acceptance, though, what's that?”“Well, if you need to accept something, that means it's not like it should be, right? Like you accept something as it is. Acceptance is an affirmation you're good enough.”Quotes like this landed perfectly. I also loved that Konigsberg never acted as if he had all the answers about sexuality and heteronormativity. However, this aspect fails in several ways. First of all, Rafe’s decision to closet himself is treated as a personal offense by both his best friend and his parents, and they are all presented as correct in their anger at Rafe. While he’s definitely denying himself, his closest friends all act as if he is personally attacking them by being closeted. That’s not a good message. Being in or out of the closet is a personal decision. Rafe wanted to make friends with dudebro guys without being judged. That’s an understandable decision; even many purportedly non-homophobic people really do treat gay people differently, conciously or not. You have no idea how many of my friends started cringing at hugs after I came out. Rafe’s motivations were understandable! He just wanted to be thought of as himself, rather than as “that gay dude.” I do want to applaud the realness of this narrative; unfortunately, the “lessons” Openly Straight teaches us about that desire aren’t exactly flawless. The narrative of the book seems to revolve more around whether Rafe is ""labeling himself” rather than closeting himself. It’s confusing and odd, because Rafe isn’t confused about his sexuality; he’s just in the closet for safety reasons. Again, being in the closet is a personal decision, and the way the narrative handled it… wasn’t perfect. I also disliked the resolution of the soccer sideplot. The ending essentially implies that gay guys actually can't be friends with the popular jocks. Why couldn't at least some of the soccer guys have been cool? The book also uses the word “retard” without calling it out, which strikes me as kind of terrible for being written in 2013. There’s also the quote “It was like when you approach a woman whom you think is beautiful and you see the caked-on blush and mascara, and you realize what you are seeing isn’t her; it’s her vanity.” That’s… um, a little sexist. Yes, these are nitpicks, but seriously, way to make me cringe.

It's probably a “me” thing, so don't worry too much. Honestly Ben focuses on sexuality confusion. Ben gets the chance to explore his sexuality in a productive way. While he doesn't end up deciding on a label, he does consider labeling himself as bi, and the book never decries bisexuality. It was nice to see a character not putting himself in a box without it coming off as an obvious way of avoiding the word bi. The romance was a major aspect here, and it didn't disappoint me. While Ben and Rafe spend much of the book disliking each other, their relationship slowly develops . I still question the need for this sequel; Ben seemed fairly convinced of his crush on Rafe in the last book, and while I totally believe he would be angry about the lying, I don't really understand why he would totally ignore his sexuality confusion. I did enjoy this one, but not quite as much as I'd hoped. Still definitely recommended to those who enjoyed Openly Straight and want a happy ending.* I received a copy of this via my local bookstore.

Because, as anybody who is not a complete and total moron knows, the heart does not have ears. This is the kind of s**t they make disabled people say all the time so everybody’s all “okay” with us. Soooo annoying.”See what I mean? It's the odd, offbeat, sarcastic kind of humor. Fans of Goldy Moldavsky's Kill The Boy Band or No Good Deed might especially enjoy this. The real strength of this book is that despite the comedy aspects, this book goes deeper. Beauty Queens is not a story about stereotypically bitchy mean girls - in fact, it's full of messages about finding yourself. There is also so much diversity in this book. Just among out leads, there are multiple women of color, a Deaf bi character, a trans character, and a lesbian character. “There is no I in “team.”“There’s no U in asshole, either, and yet …”VERDICT: If the offbeat tone works for you, this is completely worth the read.

And it won't be hard to undIf you look through bad s of this book, you'll start to see a common trend: a dislike for Samantha as a protagonist. And it won't be hard to understand why - this book is about a high school mean girl, and she does some incredibly messed up things within these pages. But here's the thing - Samantha's despicable nature is what makes the book so good. Because her story is one of redemption, of working through what she has done and making herself better. Some won't like it, perhaps, but this is undoubtedly one of the best character-driven novels I have ever read. Samantha's character arc is incredible. I'd go so far to call it one of my all-time favorite arcs. She starts out as a very typical protagonist, one you wouldn't even bat your eyes at, yet she develops into such an incredibly sympathetic character. Even at her moments of imperfection, of blunt evil, even, she wins your empathy because we have been there. The narrative is so effortlessly unbiased towards her - her mistakes are questioned, yet her redemption is given the space it needs. Even ignoring Samantha, every character feels so real and dimensional. It would've been easy to make Lindsey, Samantha's best friend, into a bland and pathetic mean girl. It would've been easy to make Juliet into a one-off unpopular girl. But Oliver avoids all these traps and makes all her side characters complicated. I read once that at the edge of a black hole, time stops completely, so if you ever sailed into it, you’d just be stuck there at the lip forever, forever being torn apart, forever dying.It's important to mention that this book isn't about logic. Lauren Oliver doesn't care how this time loop is happening, or why - she cares about how it's affecting these characters, and that's exactly what's so great about Before I Fall. Every sentence felt like a knife in my heart, making me feel so much for Samantha and for every other character. This book is about self-sacrifice and courage and doing the right thing. It's not preachy, yet it's not sugar coated. Every part of this book is so real, and so true to life, despite the unrealistic plot. You can feel every emotion. VERDICT: It is incredibly sad that Oliver has come out with so much which wasn't as great as this. However, this novel, her debut, is still absolutely worth reading - it's one of the most impactful books I've ever read.

Possibly my one solid praise for this series, with no qualms, is the writing. I really enjoyed the writing of this series. It flows very nicely and there’s something strangely beautiful about it. First of all, the Society is a little too abstract in terms of rules. This abstract worldbuilding could've worked to Condie's advantage, but she chooses to focus on the wrong ideas. Condie does CONSISTENTLY emphasize choice, which is great; unfortunately, the aspect of choice is emphasized too much through the love triangle and too little through creativity. The idea of choosing to be different because of poetry and your grandfather is amazing; the idea of changing your viewpoint because of a love triangle is far less so. This story could've been so much more resonant if Cassia were an artist wanting to make her work and the love triangle were lesser. Cassia isn’t an annoying character. She has moments towards the end of Matched and the beginning of Crossed where she is resonate and interesting. However, as mentioned, her character development is tied to the love triangle far too much. Xander and Ky are both good guys and good characters, but there's too much romance with them. That being said, I happened to really enjoy her and Ky's romance; they're sweet together. Cassia's family and a new character from Crossed, Indie, are all interesting and compelling, The next two books never realize this potential. Book two is way more boring, but redeemed to some degree by more thoughtfulness, Cassia's newfound character strength, and morally grey side character Indie. Book three is the worst book by far. It's just so... unemotional, and it's a letdown, a realization that nothing will end well. The character development promised in book two didn't occur, and I was left totally cold. The plot's also a bit nonsensical.VERDICT: There's some good stuff about this series, but it never makes that jump to greatness....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,Jan 2011,Jan 2011,"Sep 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7735333-matched

It's a book I'm left thinking about almost a year and a half after reading it. The Accident Season is magical realism, but I almost feel as if it should go into the suspense genre. This almost felt like a slow-burn version of Marcus Sedgwick. There are no answers as to what is going on for half the book, yet it somehow kept me turning pages. The plot is so odd that it surpasses odd and goes straight to good.There's something strangely unsettling about the writing, the characters, the atmosphere, the hints here and there. Along with Megan Abbott's masterful Dare Me, I'd call this the book that truly introduced me to atmosphere. Fowley Doyle does such a great job of bringing you into her world. I think what made this book stay with me was the character work. There are four narrators, and I kind of love all of them?? This book portrays an extremely tight-knit family, with a bit of a found family aspect. All the relationships twisting between them are so touching, but the teens are the true focus. There's one romantic plot that isn't really revealed until the last chapter, but at the end that couple's existence made me ridiculously happy. Their relationship is so well-built and so heartbreaking. If we're going to talk specific characters, Alice was my fav. Her story as an abuse victim especially is touching and well-written. There is one thing that really bothered me about this book - in fact, the only major flaw. The main romance plot is between a stepbrother and stepsister. Again, as a professional stepsister, this plot is such a big turn-off. While some may have no problem with it, especially since the characters did not meet until age ten, I found it very unsettling as someone with a stepbrother. I will never be able to handle plots that follow this line, sorry. VERDICT: If you can ignore that one thing, this book is a suspenseful and creative magical realism story. Can't recommend it enough. ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Feb 09, 2016","Feb 09, 2016","Sep 09, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23346358-accident-season

Unfortunately, Impulse is a pretty terrible book, with severeI started Impulse with really high hopes for this after enjoying Hopkins' Tricks series. Unfortunately, Impulse is a pretty terrible book, with severe issues of mental health being tackled sort of horribly and a shitty love triangle no one cares about. And besides that, it contains the most homophobic storyline I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I am not joking or exaggerating when I say this storyline genuinely reads like someone's conversion therapy manifesto. Let's talk. ✔ Before you call me an SJW keyboard warrior so you can feel morally vindicated in your opinion: Please at least read the damn ? I'm not complaining about this just for the sake of complaining or whatever you'd like to believe. This isn't some kind of minor ""negative tropes"" thing. If I had less self-confidence, I genuinely cannot imagine how I would've taken this and where this book could've taken me. Like, feel free to love this book – books are always subjective. But please do let me despise this book in peace. 🌺 IT'S REALLY JUST NOT A QUALITY BOOK Okay, this is the section where I'm a bitter salty person and I feel the need to explain why this book is just kind of generally bad ignoring all the stuff that is Problematique. Because that's who I am! Basically, it's super fucking obvious that this book wasn't outlined well or like, at all. Each one of the characters goes through so many terrible events that Hopkins cannot possibly resolve them all. She took on too many issues with only three characters, and it quickly approached a point where she didn't even bother exploring these important issues in an inoffensive way.In terms of character, I had some major issues as well. All these characters could've been redeemable, but they're really not fleshed out? I'm not sure anyone ever told Ms. Hopkins that trauma is not a character trait.✔ Vanessa has bipolar and kind of a judgemental asshole. That's it. I could've excused her bad behavior if she were redeemed, but she's not developed or fleshed-out, and she never really improves. ✔ Connor is a complete fuckboy and again, I could've excused it, but he's not fleshed-out. He's just boring and annoying. ✔ Tony's a decent character. Again, he's not fleshed-out quite enough, but he's a good guy. We'll talk about his arc later. 🌺 MENTAL HEALTH IS SUPER, SUPER ROMANTIC✔ I don't think Hopkins did her research on mental health facilities. Every adult in this facility was either a villain or incompetent. Again, this is a toxic message to teens who want to help their own issues. Mental health facilities can be toxic places, yes, but they can also be great rehabilitation centers. Sticking with a negative view of rehabilitation places in every book strikes me as a bad message. This can be realistic on some occasions, it just didn't seem like the greatest plot decision. ✔ Suicide should not be used as a plot device. (view spoiler)[Connor dies essentially so Tony and Vanessa can get together without feeling bad. His death is an easy way to get tears from the audience, but the constant use of suicide simply to get tears seems incredibly insensitive to mentally ill people. (hide spoiler)] Do depressed people need stories about how they are doomed to commit suicide anyway, despite their attempts to get better? I don't speak for all depressed people, but reading a book like this or All the Bright Places in a really depressed phase would've been extremely toxic for me. “You eventually will commit suicide” is a very bleak message to give teens who feel their very existence is bleak.✔ I'll never stop cutting, lithium or no lithium. Only love can make me stop.I saw this quote in Octavia's awesome , and I had to look it up because I almost didn't believe it. I'd forgotten how bad this was. Love is positioned as a cure for mental illness. Trust me, romantic love can't cure depression. ✔ There's also this whole undertone of “our illness makes us better” running through the book. I really don't feel like complaining about this because so many other books have this same exact message, but I have a post about this on my blog, if anyone's interested in general thoughts on this topic. ✔ Generally, I feel like this isn't a book for mentally ill teens. I feel like it's a book for neurotypical teens who want to feel like their life doesn't suck. There's a quote from this  that I think sums it up best. This book would be great to read if you think your life's shit. No matter how bad it gets for you, these kiddies have it so much worse. And if you think your life's worse than this, I recommend writing to Hopkins as you'll probably feature in her next book.That's... well. It's just that these books don't portray the reality of being depressed or bipolar, to me. They portray the horror of it all in this way that's meant to shock you, without actually interacting or talking about mental illness in a productive way.🌺 GAY CONVERSION IS NOT A GOOD FUCKING THINGSo here's probably my biggest issue with the book. My lifestyle has caused me a lot of pain. I hope to change that when I get out of here.This doesn't look too bad; Tony has been a prostitute, so that's probably what he's referring too, right? Well, no. He's actually specifically referring to being gay here. Let me repeat that: his ""gay lifestyle"" caused him pain. His gay ""lifestyle."" Caused him pain.His redemption is becoming straight.I cannot begin to explain how harmful ""positive character development in the form of learning you're actually straight"" is. A narrative implying sexual assault caused him to believe he is gay, implying that had he not been gay, he wouldn't have been sexually assaulted as much, is victim blaming and absolutely disgusting. The idea of a gay character “realizing he's straight” has some kind of gross connotations in the first place and I don't think most straight authors have the nuanced understanding of queer experience to tackle it, but it is technically a thing that can happen to people. It's also technically likely he'd just realize he was bi, not that the possibility is ever mentioned. It's a lot rarer than homophobes would like to believe, and it's far rarer than straight people realizing they're actually gay, little as said straight people would like to believe. (I'm kidding. Mostly.) But the entire sexuality-change storyline is portrayed in an incredibly homophobic way here. It genuinely reads like fucking anti-gay propaganda. It is disgusting and it is horrifying to read. 🌺 FINAL THOUGHTS AND A WRAP-UPAgain, and I feel like a broken record at this point: Hopkins' prose is great, and I like that she's trying to speak to teens without mincing words. However, she needs to stop stereotyping neuroatypical and lgbtq people. She's not being great and representing us. She's being shitty. I can feel her fucking disdain for me through her pages and I'm so, so tired of it. I really wish I hadn't given her another chance. And again, this  isn't meant to be an attack on you. The book is in places well-written, exceedingly emotionally manipulative, and who knows, maybe Vanessa's storyline resonated with some readers. But I'd really ask anyone who's recommending this to consider the storyline for themselves and really, genuinely consider the canon of the book. Because this is really gross.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,302,1,Nov 2015,Nov 2015,"Sep 09, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/270805.Impulse

I blew through this one just to find out what would happen next. The story flows so well I barely realized I was closing in on the end. Patrice Kindl writes with so much humor and wit that suspension of disbelief becomes easy. While Morgan isn't exactly likable, you're almost forced to root for her anyways. She's so unabashedly manipulative and terrible but man, is she funny. Kindl does a good job making the reader feel torn; you almost want her to win in the end, just because of all the effort she's putting into this con, but you also desperately want to see her get taken down.I also appreciated Kindl's ironic storytelling tone. In the hands of a less adept author, Morgan might have been completely hateable, yet here, she's almost funny.

That being said, I think this sequel did some good things. I was excited to see Rhiannon developed more, and I wasn't disappointed on that aspect at least. Her character is multilayered and feels very real. There's a good portrayal of an abusive relationship here. However, Justin remained, to some degree, a prop for romantic angst. An emotionally abusive boyfriend shouldn't just be a romantic obstacle. Levithan definitely tried to remedy this issue, but my feelings on Justin's presence in Every Day still remain, and influenced my feelings on Rhiannon in this sequel. I frankly wasn't that invested in Rhiannon and A's romance in book one, so further development for them as a couple didn't initially pique my interest. I think this book specifically clarified exactly why Rhiannon fell for A. If I still don't call them my favorite couple of all time, I'm at least invested. Unfortunately, despite the development, I can't shake the feeling that this was an unnecessary sequel. Every Day hit the right note for me, and writing a sequel for it seems unneeded.

Despite their conflict in this book, they still remain close.MY ACTUAL THOUGHTSOkay, so maybe these books aren't necessarily the pinnacle of literature. But I have so much fun reading them. They're humorous, sweet, and well-plotted. •Emily Skrutskie has a talent for humor and dialogue. This book made me laugh so many times, I couldn't even keep track.•The moral conflicts surrounding rich vs. poor here were even more amazing than book one. I talked about this on my  for book one as well, but it really just keeps getting better. •This specific book deserves a shoutut for getting me invested in some side characters. Chuck and Varma are both so great, and I’d love to know even more about them. Santa Elena, the first book’s villain, has believable motivation, and it’s hard not to sympathize with her. VERDICT: This duology stands out from a sea of typical YA sf because of its awesome main character, humorous and banter-filled romance plot, and moral conflict. Absolutely cannot recommend this enough.

Fire is set in the Dells, a land beyond the borders of the Seven Kingdoms. The Dells have no gracelings, but plenty of colorful monsters. Fire is the last remaining human monster, renowned for beauty; she lives in fear of both others and of herself. Cashore’s worldbuilding is incredible, with complex politics and an interesting narrative around discrimination and sexism. The political drama here, unfortunately, got a bit boring in places for me? Cashore’s books have always succeeded primarily because of their character work and introspection, not their plotting, but this book’s plot just did not have me vibing. Fire’s character is undoubtedly the strength of this novel. She’s more mentally strong and fierce in her convictions, rather than physically strong as Katsa was. She’s just as wonderfully complex as the other two heroines. Unfortunately, I personally didn’t connect with her nearly as much as I did with Katsa and Bitterblue. Considering the strong impact of character work on Cashore’s books, my lack of connection to Fire really hampered my enjoyment of this book. That being said, I still absolutely think Fire is worth reading. All three of these books are worthy favorites; it just depends which heroine you happen to like best. And therein lies the brilliance of Cashore’s writing. This entire series is brilliant and gets a high recommendation from me.also here are the receipts....more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,Jan 2013,Jan 2013,"Sep 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6137154-fire

Starring a biracial and ambiguously queer woman of color, it follows Bitterblue as This book is a narrative about how colonization can fuck you over. Starring a biracial and ambiguously queer woman of color, it follows Bitterblue as she tries to bring back the traditions, culture, & liberty her dictator father took away from the country of Monsea. Along the way, she must come to terms the legacy of a genocidal, terrifying monster as a ruler, one who wiped away every detail of the country and replaced it with his own imagined world. But she must also come to terms with the legacy of that monster being her father. Never heard it pitched that way before? Me neither. But I’m serious about this, and I’m ready to write a serious fucking literary analysis here. Good morning, guys. “But that's how memory works,” Bitterblue said quietly. “Things disappear without your permission, then come back again without your permission.” And sometimes they came back incomplete and warped.So, what is Bitterblue about, you ask? Well, I don't think it can be fully summed up. In one way, it's a mystery– Bitterblue spends this book trying to discover what really happened during her father's reign, to both her people AND herself, and what is happening now. In one way, it's a character journey– Bitterblue's journey of agency and growing up. But in another way, it's the journey of a whole world– the story of an entire country's journey to free itself from a legacy of colonialism and brutality. I've seen many say they had trouble with this book due to boredom. While I found this story incredibly compelling, it should be said that the first half is somewhat slow. And yes, there are a multitude of sideplots in Bitterblue, but here's the thing: I think the book works because of the pace. The slightly slow beginning of the first half is nicely offset by the slow-build mystery and character development of the book, and it completely pays off towards the second half. And with all these different interlocking plots, the book still feels tied together and coherent. Why? Primarily because of Bitterblue's character. Bitterblue is one of the realest characters I've ever come across. She's not the type of fighter we tend to see in the role of a strong female character, but also not the type of sweet and simpering character we tend to see in weaker female characters. Bitterblue is clever, manipulative, and willing to fight for the people she loves, yet is given moments of being reckless, underconfident, and petty. This isn't a simple plot device; she's sixteen, and the narrative both explores that and lets her be a character beyond it. I also adore how her character connects the narrative; her inner conflict and outer conflict form a gorgeous map.Hoooooo, boy, so I guess it's time to talk about the narrative now, huh?Monsea’s dictatorship all but mirrors the legacy of colonial dictatorships. It is a world in which a culture of openness, a wealthy economy, and a structure of living tested for years has been completely overturned by a despicable, tyrannical leader, and now the people of the realm must pick up the pieces. And it’s all the more frightening because of the legacy of Leck - as a monster who could cloud the judgement of others, he has left the country’s old traditions all but forgotten. This is something neither Bitterblue nor much of the country has any way of being aware of, especially as the older generation has died out. The country’s old culture of casual queerness is something few are still aware of. The architecture is forever changed. Freedom of the press is nonexistent. I've been sitting in front of a computer screen for around ten minutes because I truly do not know how to begin this . This book is so, so deeply important to me, in so many ways. I've read very few books in my life that made me feel every emotion on the spectrum, and this is perhaps one of the best. This book is many things, but above all, it's a story of hope; a story of joy in the face of so much pain. So let's sum it all up: Butterblue features a cast of well-written, compelling side characters, a hilarious appendix written by an actual character, a cast that is around 70% queer and 90% characters of color, a fucking glorious slow-burn mystery, a fucking glorious character arc for a young woman in a tight space, and a narrative around colonialism that sticks out in my mind to this day. I cannot get past how much I adore this book.

When I was ten through when I was twelve, I used to travel to see extended family multiple times a year, flying across the U.S. to do it. I owned Graceling, and a collection of other YA fantasy books, on Kindle. I would reread this book every single time I flew because it meant so much to me. This is one of my most reread books of all time, and it was such a big influence on both what I write and what I love to read, and I love and appreciate it more every time. Graceling opens as Katsa, a character graced with the skill to kill people—literally, actually murder them—puts a group of guards out cold rather than killing them while trying to rescue a falsely imprisoned old man. She then returns to her palace, where she is thought of and treated as a weapon for a cruel king. She thinks of herself as a dog, and a brute, and an idiot, until she and a new friend move to track down the answers to a mystery dogging a nearby kingdom. Katsa prizes her mind: it is the only she has ever had to herself. One of the first things we learn of her is her hatred for mind readers, and while this serves a plot purpose, it also ties in well with her other fears: Her body and power has for so long been Randa’s, as a weapon. But she is not a weapon. Though Katsa could, and would, kill the bad guy to survive a horror movie, she also does the right thing, or tries. She cares for other people, in her own stubborn and angry way. To move anywhere beyond her own self-image, she must go from thinking of herself as a killer, a monster, a weapon, to thinking of herself as a justice-seeker. She must find love (Po), and allow herself to care for those around her (Bitterblue). And she must go from thinking of her talent as a curse to thinking of it as a tool. The graces are a neutral element—both good and bad, depending on their use.The thing about the climax of Katsa's character arc is that it isn’t defined by violence: it’s defined by Katsa regaining power over her mind. SPOILER: (view spoiler)[It isn’t a great feat that she kills; we know all along that she can kill anyone she wants. It is the fact that she kills someone as he tries to control her mind that is so important. Her conflict is never about her physical power but about her love for Bitterblue and Po. And she wrests back mental control not through her grace, but through her love for other people. (hide spoiler)]It’s a bit of a subversion of the chosen one narrative, because though her power saves her many times along the way, in the final moment, it isn’t her grace that saves her but her mental strength. Herself. Katsa is a genuinely funny narrator, who causes problems on purpose, and has absolutely no people skills except when she tries really, really hard. I think traits like this can be frustrating in a narrative because so often they're used as lazy plot devices. Katsa’s badness with people is never a plot device, never something we see her as stupid for. She’s just hilarious. “Wonderful,” Po said. “It's quite boring really, the way you beat me to death with your hands and feet, Katsa. It'll be refreshing to have you come at me with a knife.”♖ The romance is pitch-perfect. Some of you may know that I'm a bit picky around romance plots, but Katsa and Po are... frankly the book couple. Their interactions are hilarious; Po is a genuinely good guy, rather than being a Tough Scary Bad Dude, and he's a dynamic character on his own.Cashore also does so well by all her side characters. Bitterblue is an entertaining and dynamic character, and in fact, she gets her own book later on. Po, Raffin, and Giddon are all incredibly vivid characters [and they all get more later]. It's kind of incredible how human all of these characters are, how they never feel like plot devices. ♜ I love an engaging narrative. I think the plot is really interesting - it's not exactly twisty, but you never jump ahead of the characters in what you figure out - and although much of the book is spent on a journey, there's so much character and relationship building that I never got bored. (I have literally read this book, what, over twenty times?) I also love Cashore's writing; it feels so classic fantasy in a good way? God. Fucking love it. The Graceling series also contains a character who I consider to this day to be one of the most genuinely terrifying villains in the YA canon. His presence stalks all three books of this series in different ways—in one after he’s dead—but he never ceases to terrify me. ♖ This book features a genuinely strong and developed gender non-conforming woman as a protagonist, who does not get married, with a really great lady friendship at its heart. I would love if people would stop being upset by the first two of those points.To be quite honest, the fact that some ers have decided Katsa not being feminine is a problem rubs me the wrong way. I love that you lend your support to feminine heroines, but identifying having any women who don’t conform to femininity as “the not like other girls trope” is actually just misogynistic. It’s also not an accurate view of what that trope is. First of all, not-like-other-girls is meant to denote heroines who actively shit on feminine women (which does not happen in this book). But more importantly, I hate so much that literature for women is a double-bind: you have to be feminine, but also hate femininity and those who express it. Katsa is genuinely not feminine-presenting. I wrote a whole post about this. Gender non-conforming women are not taking over your literature; feminine women who also hate femininity are. “But no amount of humility or respect made it any less horrifying to lose control.” Katsa, as a character, does not want to get married. She specifically does not want marriage, as stated in the text, because any freedom Po could give her would be just that: given. She’s a character who is terrified to cede control of herself to someone, not when she has just escaped that, and the narrative—and her lover—don’t force her to do so. I have seen far too many people complain about this book's “raging feminist agenda”. Okay? A woman makes choices that are realistic to her character? Deeply lukewarm take. ♜ On a side note, remember in like, 2010, when YA was a hellscape and you had to like, beg for just one side character of color? Let me run this book, published in 2008, down for you: gnc woman helps save a biracial woman of color from persecution while falling in love with disabled man of color because he recognizes that she will always feel the need to be the strong one. [I will also note that after getting criticism for the use of a slightly ableist trope surrounding one blind character, she apologized in her author's note and improved his treatment in later books.] Book two: bi black woman, survivor of abuse and rape, falls in love with black man because he's good to her and treats her like a person rather than a possession. Book three: biracial woman dealing with ptsd tries to rule a kingdom while falling in love with a bi man of color and also, fighting for a return to her old culture and to freedom of the press with the assistance of her many gay friends [including three side characters from this book and two lesbians who run a print shop]. ♖ Oddly, one of my favorite parts of this series is how different and awesome each book is. Graceling is an action-adventure story about redemption and self-hatred. Fire is a political story about agency, rape culture, and abusive relationships, both domestic and parental. Bitterblue is a slow-burn mystery, character study, and bildungsroman about a nation growing up and letting go, all wrapped in one. All three of these books are executed so well that your favorite will depend mostly on what themes touch you the most. For me, Graceling and Bitterblue [which I ed here hey hey hey] are the standouts to me personally, but they're honestly all great. The love I have for this series is so neverending. In summary: this book honestly still has me by the throat in 2020, and is one of my favorite books of all time, and I wish that we could pay it its dues.

I'm going to be honest - this was just an utterly forgettable read for me. I keep looking for great f/f romances and YA contemporary just... isn't... delivering. That's not to say the book was terrible - there were a few good points here and there. First of all, Maeve's severe anxiety was never played for laughs, which is rarer than I'd like it to be. I adored the focus on healthy relationships in stepfamilies. As someone who lives with a stepfamily, I've really noticed that YA doe a crappy job portraying stepmoms and stepbrothers especially. Stepmothers are always evil, and stepbrothers are always romantic interests. Neither of these stereotypes hold remotely true in my family, thankfully. And they didn't hold up here either. And the romance, while totally using the manic pixie dream girl trope, was definitely sweet. The problem is I didn't feel anything for the characters. In the midst of all the catastrophic events happening to the main character, I felt nothing. I closed the book saying “that was fine” rather than “OH MY GOD I'M CRYING???” I just didn't feel a single emotion this entire book. I read this book less than four months ago, and I remember barely anything about it, including character names. Another issue is the use of the manic pixie dream girl trope. Salim doesn't even feel like a character - she feels like a perfect girl created to fix all of the protagonist's problems. Especially her anxiety. I'd like to say that the anxiety rep was great, but I really can't give that much credit when this narrative focused so much on her getting through it. I'm also going to be honest and say that I didn't connect with much within this narrative, despite having anxiety myself. However, Maeve's anxiety is far more severe than my own, and obviously every person has different experiences with anxiety. Maybe this was just a me problem. Maybe some people will be able to connect with the characters on a more concrete level. But I couldn't.

While the other two books succeed from slow-build plot and smart thematic work, this book feels like a flat book of action.

Pearson's action work is fairly boring, in my view, and without interesting characters or themes, there's nothing appealing about the book. WORLDBUILDING AND PLOTTo be totally fair, I think this had some good plot work and worldbuilding. It's easy to get through, at the very least. It's just ultimately forgettable. The worldbuilding here is good, just not good enough. There's more telling than showing. Mainly, it just feels very disconnected from book one because it takes place so much later.The plotting is... decent. Pearson certainly has a talent for dramatic tension. I just don't like Pearson's action scenes much; they're dry and boring. Her strength is in character work, but this book doesn't focus on any character in particular. CHARACTERSThis is where my main problem with the book pops up. This is a trilogy focusing on three friends, but the books only focus on two, Jenna and Locke. Those two characters are both great. Locke is a likable enough narrator, but he's slightly flat here. He's far more interesting and developed in book three. Jenna is as cool as ever; I really love her as a heroine. Kara's character is actively terribly written, and perhaps my biggest problem with this book. She's used as a plot device, not a character. This should've been Kara's book.

This is weirdly enough probably my favorite book of the Jenna Fox trilogy. Yeah, the second book is relatively crappy, but this third book is fucking awesome. THE CHARACTERSAlternate Title: The Adoration of Mary E. Pearson's character workLocke is a complicated character. One of his better traits is how much he wants to be better. He yearns to be a better person and feel like he's justified in living on this earth. It's so believable and it  works for his situation, where he's not even a legal human. Raine is one of my all-time favorite characters. No, seriously. She's so flawed and harsh and closed-off and I really connect with her need to escape. She's kind of brought in to be a love interest, and yet she ends up totally driving the book in such a great way. This is the one book of the series with a bit of a romance plot, and it works so damn well. Raine and Locke have a pitch-perfect buildup, but the best part about them is how they're genuinely good for each other. A lot of YA couples are people who don't work well together, or fight a lot. Raine and Locke have a perfect balance because they call each other out but they make each other better. I love that. THE THEMESThe thematic work of this book is so... perfect? There's a lot to unpack, but there are messages of redemption and hope here. And as we all know, I'm a slut for horribly angsty books where the end message is super hopeful. And the ENDING. Made me cry in anguish and in happiness at the exact same time. The definition of authorial talent. THE BAD PARTSI know I've pretty much only talked about good points in this , mainly because I have such fond memories of this book that I can't identify many flaws. But in fairness: I do think the plotting of this book isn't very good. You need to suspend disbelief a bit. But the character work and thematic work is so completely worth it.  FINAL THOUGHTSThis book absolutely redeemed the series for me from the second book. Actually, this book could probably work as a standalone (it focuses on specific characters and events), although the world would be confusing towards the beginning. (view spoiler)[And additional shoutout to Kara, who totally deserved to travel the world with Jenna. I don't know why you were screwed over in the second book, but you deserved better.

The Book Thief is by all means a creative and enticing book, but suffers from an extremely slow first half. The Book Thief is a tragedy narrated by death, as he follows the life of a girl with a book. Liesel is a complex heroine; a thief, but a loyal one. Along her journey, she bonds with a loving family, a boy she knows, and the Jewish man hiding in her basement. Throughout it all, death tells us that not everything will turn out well for this small town. This story goes beyond the general themes of war literature; this is not just a story about how fragile life is. Yes, that theme is present, but this book is about so much more; found family and the power of words. Liesel steals books to bond with her papa and to find herself, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of subtle storytelling, and this ended up boring me to tears. Yes, the ending was worth the time I spent struggling through this. That being said, it's worth noting that this quite literally took me eight months to finish. Essentially nothing happens until the end.

This is one of those dystopias entirely made up of romance, and it's one of the worst romances I've ever read. Let's address my first point. Article Five tries to build up a world where women are oppressed by an evil government of conservatives. I like the idea, but it doesn't work out for a few reasons. First, we get no idea how the world got this way. I think in most cases, that could've been a forgettable detail– “world where women are oppressed” is a fairly typical idea. Unfortunately, this novel acts as if it's about to show some feminist knowledge and goes on to stereotype women as weak and stupid. Take our protagonist Ember. She's naive and constantly has to be saved by her boyfriend. She's also the only significant female character in this book. If you're writing a novel about the need for feminism, don't make me spend my time with a lead who's weak both mentally and physically. I don't understand this. Ember is also just a flat, undeveloped character. Her story is supposed to revolve around saving her mom, yet we never see their relationship. Also, she's a complete idiot. [image]If we're really going to talk about how this book steps on women, we're going to need to talk about the romance. Full stop, I think this is the worst romance I have ever read. Chase spends the entire book ordering Ember around. She has every reason to distrust him, yet he is cold and unfeeling towards her without trying to resolve their relationship. At one point, he physically shakes her in anger. Ember describes him as physically terrifying, and yet somehow, in a world where the threat of rape is around every corner, she falls for him anyway.I read this book in a period of time where I actively disliked approximately 2% of books.

Revolution is a genre-bending masterpiece with two likable heroines and a twistingThis book is undoubtedly one of the most creative I have ever read. Revolution is a genre-bending masterpiece with two likable heroines and a twisting plot that never stops moving. By genre-bending, I truly mean genre-bending. This book is one part contemporary, one part suspense, one part speculative fiction, one part scifi, and one part historical fiction. It doesn't matter what genre it is - it matters just how great the blend is. The plot is fascinating, with twists and turns and story threads that are only pulled together towards the end. In the end, however, perhaps I'd class this as a contemporary, because the focus here is on character development. There are two heroines here, present-day Andi and 1700s teenager Alexandrine. These characters are both so developed and interesting in their own ways. Alexandrine is ambitious and driven; she goes out for what she wants, even if she has to break a few necks along the way. Andi is incredibly angsty for a good deal of the book, yet her arc is so well thought out that it's hard not to empathize with her and love her. Andi has severe depression, which she combats through her music. That aspect was great. I did take issue with the slight anti-medication tilt this book took; with the severity of Andi's depression, medication shouldn't be shameful. However, I loved that she's never really ""cured."" The narrative around her depression doesn't end in it being fixed, or in her being better suddenly. It's quite hard to explain exactly what about this book is so brilliant. I suppose it's best summed up in that I have never read anything like this before, and I doubt I ever will again.

There's a lot to love about this book, but there are one or two issues here that really took away from my desire to love this. It's 1888, era of both Jack the Ripper and Joseph Merrick, known to history as the Elephant Man. Somehow, these two elements are blended together and the blend actually works. Evelyn is disfigured from working at a phosphorus plant, and she acquires a job working with Merrick as his maid. This book focuses on the friendship between Evelyn and Merrick, which was very well-written. They bond partially over being ostracized from society due to their differences, and their dialogue is heart-wrenching. This friendship benefits greatly from the strength of their characters: while neither is quite as fleshed-out as I'd prefer, maybe, they're each just likable enough to hold my interest. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the conclusion at all, and it honestly kind of ruined the book for me. First of all, the mystery's ending is very anticlimactic. But it's also just an unsatisfying solution to this mystery in terms of the (view spoiler)[gender of jack the ripper. I've read that a big part of the historical motivation for these killings was that they were women who didn't have very savory jobs. Changing the killer to a woman removes an important element of the story, which is even more relevant with a female main character.

There is nothing truly horrifically bad about My friend Claire commented that “Red Queen” is a genre now, and I think that is a sadly accurate point. There is nothing truly horrifically bad about this book. There's just nothing good either. It's fascinating to me that a book with nothing new or special has become such a hyped fave. The concept Aveyard came up with here is solid - dark, gritty, full of morally black characters. The lead is somewhat of an antiheroine. So what, exactly, is wrong here? First of all, there is very little actual plot to this book. The main conflict of this book is that Mare's opposition, Evangeline is a Mean Girl who is dating Mare's True LoveTM. Mare's other enemy is the queen, who is also a Mean Girl character and who lacks any actual role in the book. We are set up for something scary and eerie and full of twists and turns and we get the literary equivalent of white bread. Which is sad, because there are some entertaining moments, and the story isn't bad, but all the drama seems petty, rather than manipulative and high-stakes. There's one exception to this whole rule: the ending twist is pretty good. I genuinely don't get surprised by twists very often and I think I found myself expecting a twist that didn't happen rather than the one that did. The twist is the only thing that ever would have convinced me to continue on in the series. As a character, Mare is somewhat less terrible than some ers find her. She's just not... actively interesting. She's a bit too arrogant and unlikable to be a super-easy-to-root-for compelling lead. Which is weird, because generally I prefer unlikable leads. It's just that her characterization serves no narrative purpose; her moral ambiguity is barely acknowledged, to the point where I'm not sure the author actually understands she's writing an antihero. Mare would make a supremely compelling antihero; unfortunately, she's not written as one. My other problem with Mare is that she's a more passive than active character, meaning she's not nearly interested enough in saving her life. I think this tends to be a problem with young adult female protagonists of around 2012, and I'm sort of fascinated by it as a phenomenon, but the point stands: Mare needs more self-preservation instinct for her fighting for her life to be compelling. In terms of romance... ugh. First of all, I don't even hate love triangles, and I frankly don't think most of us really hate love triangles on principle! They just need to be interesting ones, right? But all the characters here are too flat for anyone to get even slightly invested. The romance plot with Cal is forgettable, made even more so because he's not remotely likable. Maven has some potential (view spoiler)[but then the thing happens (hide spoiler)]. And Kilorn is in love with her essentially as a side plot. It's like the love triangle from The Selection, except with two princes AND a small-town boy. Who does this, and why should I care? Honestly, this book is just... ridiculously forgettable, sort of boring, and it's all fine, but it's not really worth your time.

Undoubtedly the best parts of this standalone are the thematic moments. This book follows a group of people who are not the chosen ones, but live in a town chock-full of them. There are even interludes touching on what the heroes get up to, some with a hilariously sardonic tone. These sections are awesome and funny and just like Ness' best. While I did have issues with the theme work, it is undoubtedly the best part of the book. While we're on the subject, though, I think the ending ended up reinforcing tropes rather than throwing them down. The way the ending was executed reinforced the chosen one trope, rather than doing something new. One particular character basically got screwed with their ending, and it really undermined some otherwise good theme work for me. Unfortunately, the thematic work is also where the fabulousness ends. This book has no plot. I could forgive it for plotlessness if anything else about it were standout, but there's nothing there. As a coherent book, this doesn't do enough to warrant a better rating.The character work suffers from the same problems: great concept, but nothing happens. Here's the good part: the characters all feel real and tangible. They're a truly diverse group of teens, including one character with OCD, one who's bisexual, and one who's black. Here's the bad part: none of them have character arcs. The main character barely develops, and in a book meant to be driven by characters, this aspect made the whole thing fizzle. Even the romance feels off, wandering between an instalovey and flat romance and the far more interesting subtexty relationship between the main character and his best friend. Maybe subtexty is the wrong word; it's more like “text that is somehow never talked about or resolved.” At one point, those two characters literally have sex. Is it ever mentioned again? Nope. I mean, the main character still identifies as straight, not bi, and the idea that he could be bi isn't really touched on either. I honestly found myself confused as to which relationship I was supposed to care for. As for the actual relationship, I liked that the couple was interracial, but I honestly didn't care for a second of their interaction. The romance here is instalovey and boring. There's no conflict. Not once did I find myself caring. Why was this even a necessary plot? It's just another case of great concept, mediocre execution. Oh well.

Ripple has a lot of potential with its characters, but ended up as a simple bad boy meets good girl romance. This book doesn't really have a ton of positives, but it did manage to avoid outright slutshaming. Tessa's sleeping around is a specific issue because it involves cheating, not because she's sleeping around in the first place. Now, for the issues.The romance promised to be two troubled characters finding solace in each other. It didn't work out, and it's hard to point to why. They've got a hint of instalove, but that shouldn't have stopped me from believing in their connection. The main fault of this book is the lack of character work. Tessa and Jack are so cliche. Neither of them had any personality beyond “good girl letting loose” and “bad boy with heart of gold”. Which sounds pretty good, right? Unfortunately neither of these characters are interesting unless you develop them well. There were some good character moments, but they were few and far between. No character made me feel connected, and no book can survive when I don't connect to the characters. In terms of other factors: the writing was nothing special, the plot is paper-thin, and with no interest in the characters, I couldn't forgive either of these things. There were moments where I believed in the characters and their connection. But all in all, this book didn't make me feel anything. Not recommended. Although shoutout to this being my first-ever arc!

Fairest is disturbing and depressing, but those aspects resulted in a resolution of TLC's chief flaws— the Disney shine and focus on romantic relationships— and led to an exceptionally well-written, character-driven book. Marissa Meyer is a very creative author, and she's quite talented, but some of her books work too hard for that Disney shine. This one does not. Horrible things happen, and they are not ever ignored or glossed over in favor of romance (which I feel is a flaw in Winter especially). Levana's romance plot is itself massively fucked up, which helps. Meyer also does some great character work here. You feel genuine sympathy for Levana despite her being such a horrible person. She's so tortured and clearly not entirely mentally stable, it's hard not to feel for her. I really highly recommend this book for fans of TLC....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 19, 2016","Aug 19, 2016","Aug 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22489107-fairest

Cinder, despite being my least favorite of the Lunar Chronicles, is a great take on Cinderella.

She's not a damsel in distress, and yet her story sticks well to the original Cinderella take. She's sarcastic and knows what she wants. What an enjoyable character. The romance was really sweet. Kai isn't a perfect romantic interest, but he comes off as sweet and real. They're a great, healthy couple. In terms of plot... this book is fast-paced, but predictable. I guessed the big plot twist halfway through, and my guess is I wasn't the only one. Also, I wanted to give this series a shoutout for diversity. This series has multiple characters who aren't white (including Cinder, which is outright stated in the book *side eyes discoursers*). In terms of sexuality though... this series is probably the most heterosexual I've ever read. Every single character is straight, and most are paired off.

It's going to be hard to explain exactly why I love her so much but I'll try. I think my favorite thing about her is that she's scared of everything but she still gets it done. She's a badass, but she's also shy and nervous. Talk about a trope-breaking character. And I love how she learns to develop real relationships. She's such a realistic, interesting character. Cress and Thorne's romance plot is well-developed and swoon-worthy. Cress firmly believes Thorne is a better person than his crime records. But in the end, Cress falls in love with Thorne for who he really is. It's a really great take on the lovable rogue trope. In general, the character work in Cress completely blows all of Cinder and Scarlet out of the water. There are so many new arcs and so much real development. That one scene with Cinder's stepmother made me a LOT more invested in her character as well. This is also the book that really got me in board with Cinder and Kai's relationship. The squad dynamics rule here. Thorne and Cinder's banter, Iko's comic presence, Scarlet's take-no-prisoners attitude. Everything here is based on character and the dialogue between different characters often made me laugh. The plotting of Cress also gets stronger. This book isn't always fast-paced, but the pacing is much more balanced than Cinder and Scarlet. It's clear that Meyer's writing has only improved over time, and I can't wait to see where she goes next....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Aug 18, 2016","Aug 18, 2016","Aug 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13206828-cress

This is a very creative, atmospheric book of fairy tale retellings, with some of the best writing I've ever seen. I love how three-dimensional some of the tales are, and how she got these lovely characters developed in so short a time. The Tale of the Shoe: 5 stars. I don't think anyone can ever understand how much I love this Cinderella retelling. It's about being who you're supposed to be, or being who you truly are. And then, because I asked, she took me to the ball. Isn't that what girls are supposed to ask for?The Tale of the Bird: 4 stars. This is a story about freedom and making your own decisions. It ties in much more smoothly with its predecessor than many of the stories tie together. He would never let anything hurt me, but he would never let anything touch me either. The Tale of the Rose: This retelling of Beauty and the Beast gets five stars simply for its last line, which is one of my favorite quotes of all time. Aside from the last line, I suppose this isn't much of a retelling, but it's enjoyable and emotional nonetheless. I can't say the quote because it spoils everything, but I loved it so much I accidentally memorized it. The Tale of the Apple: 5 stars. A pitch-perfect retelling of Snow White with far more strong girls. This almost reminded me of Once Upon A Time's morally grey queen. Also, it connects nicely to its predecessor. Say that I am queen, she said, her fingers whitening around the scepter.If you really were, I told her, it would need no saying.The Tale of the Handkerchief: 5 stars. This isn't a typical retelling; I suppose you could call it The Goose Girl, but it comes from the point of view of that story's villain. This is an odd, yet strangely enticing story. The ending is especially beautiful. And then the tears did come, and I hoped they were for her, a queen dead in her prime, and not just for my own treacherous self.The Tale of the Hair: 3 stars. I don't love this story; it's not very strong thematically, and the main character is slightly obnoxious. That being said, it's interesting and enticing and definitely worth a read. You should've known better than to give me what I asked for, I whispered. Now the wind is scented with lavender, and the wolves howl because they cannot have him, and when he blows his horn, I will go to him.The Tale of the Brother: 4 stars. I have no idea what happened in this story but I enjoyed it. It's sort of a retelling of Hansel and Gretel but not... quite. I have never been content to be nothing but a girl.The Tale of the Spinster: 3 stars. A retelling of Rumplestiltskin. This one is interesting, although not the strongest thematically. If I have trampled you, it was to mesh your fibers into something useful. The Tale of the Cottage: 2 stars. The voice is just too weird and disjointed here. I understand the point, but this retelling of Hansel and Gretel just falls flat. The Tale of the Skin: 5 stars. A princess who runs to become a pauper, a pauper who fails at getting the prince. There is something so unspeakably beautiful about this story. It's so messed up and so gorgeous. It's also the source of one of my other favorite quotes from this brief book. See this leaf, little girl, blackened under the snow? It has died so it will be born again on the branch in spring time. Once I was a stupid girl; now I am an angry woman. Sometimes you must shed your skin to save it.The Tale of the Needle: 4 stars. A retelling of sleeping beauty that discusses the darker elements of the tale– for example, that the parents keep their daughter locked away for her whole life.  I was innocent of all effort; I was blank as a page.The Tale of the Voice: 5 stars. This retelling of The Little Mermaid addresses the fact that a woman must lose her voice to get the man of her dreams. Here, the witch is not the villain; the girl's own worshipful love is.  Perhaps we get not what we deserve, but what we demand. The Tale of the Kiss: 5 stars. This story is a show-stopper, written with such a gorgeous voice. I love the main character here. Power I had to learn how to pick up without getting burnt, how to shape it and conceal it and flaunt it and use it, and when to use it, and when to still my breath and do nothing at all.

Does this book actually care? And of course, let's not mention the homophobia. Alec and Magnus are literally just here to be the token gays.

It's really really fun and I can feel my brain leaking out of my ears whenever I see Inej and Kaz interact with each other. __________________________Five solid stars. This book pulled me in from the beginning, to the point where I knew I'd found a favorite before I was halfway through. Here, Bardugo integrates a creative plot, interesting and morally grey characters, group dynamics and banter, a great writing style, and some really, really prime romance plots. Goddamn, can Leigh Bardugo write romance. There are very, very few books that I love so wholeheartedly. This series truly is my favorite fantasy series of all time. There's no competition whatsoever. PLOTTING AND WORLDBUILDINGBardugo tosses you right into the main plot from the beginning and keeps you engaged all the way through, even when her focus is on character work. Her plotting is incredibly engaging, with so many twists and turns that the book is hard to put down. This book focuses on mind games and clever plotting. The dregs need to have a thousand backup plans, and everything is brilliantly planned by Bardugo. The Grisha's worldbuilding is very engaging, even though we're thrown in without context; I remember thinking that I would have appreciated a proper map of Ketterdam, and then we GOT a good map in book two! Bardugo's prose is awesome, and there are some truly gorgeous quotes from here. Then again, it doesn't feel as if she's trying too hard or using purple prose. CHARACTER WORK OF PERFECTIONA gambler, a convict, a wayward son, a lost Grisha, a Suli girl who had become a killer, a boy from the Barrel who had become something worse.Bardugo nails character work here. Every single character grows, every single character develops, every single character owns my heart. okay maybe not Matthias quite as much but w/eInej is a member of a gang and a murderer, but she desperately wants to do the right thing and liberate slaves like herself. She's gone through hell and she's come out strong and in control. She feels so real on page; she has a heart but she only lets it out around the people she cares about. I like that combination. Kaz is the most manipulative, terrible, morally black protagonist I've ever read about, and I love him to pieces. He's absolutely an antihero; yes, he's on a mission to save the world, but does he care about saving the world? Nope, he cares about getting his cash. He still manages to be a complex, dimensional character, who genuinely cares about his friends not dying (though he'd never admit it). Jesper is witty and an absolute delight to get a POV chapter from, but he's also incredibly sympathetic as a former farm boy who fell from grace. He likes living on the edge, and he's aware of the pain his own actions have caused him, and he's trying to work through it. Nina is hilarious and idealistic and clever and can go from flirting to making speeches within ten seconds. She's such a great character because she's so earnest and positive despite everything that's happened to her. She's also one of the most badass characters ever.  Wylan doesn't actually have pov chapters here, but he's getting a shoutout from me anyway because of his pov chapters in CK. He's entertaining here, too, coming off as a blushing do-gooder but with rumor and intrigue swirling around his actual past. Matthias is honestly my least favorite. He's dynamic enough and he's got a great character arc, but I don't feel as if he's nearly as original a character as my five. Whatever, I still like him. BANTER AND DOING CHARACTER DYNAMICS RIGHTThe Dregs are such an amazing squad all together. Their banter owns my heart. Jesper and Inej especially have one of my favorite friendship dynamics of all time; their banter and their genuine trust in each other and their lowkey joking about their mutual crush on Kaz. Inej and Nina stand out as well; extra credit for passing the bechdel test with flying colors. Also, the dialogue here absolutely rules. You have no idea how many times I had to hold in laughter. “When we get our money, you can burn kruge to keep you warm,” said Kaz. “Let’s go.”Jesper consulted his compass, and they turned south. “I’m going to pay someone to burn my kruge for me.”Kaz fell into step beside him. “Why don’t you pay someone else to pay someone to burn your kruge for you? That’s what the big players do.”“You know what the really big bosses do? They pay someone to pay someone to …”HOW TO WRITE ROMANCE: A GUIDEBOOK BY LEIGH BARDUGOSeriously, I felt the need to give this an entire section of its own, because the romance here is SO good. But the romance plots never overtake the book; I have an annotations list for these books, and there are twice as many good character moments and gorgeous quotes as there are romantic moments. Kaz and Inej are one of my all-time favorite book couples. I used to consider them my third favorite, but they've quickly become my favorite of all time. They have so many small moments and such slow-build romantic development. And then, as if I weren't invested already, they have that one declaration scene which honestly made me swoon. I will have you without armor, Kaz Brekker. Or I will not have you at all.Jesper and Wylan are just cute for most of the book. They got some cute relationship build, but I wasn't that invested. And then that One Line at the end of the book shows up and they KILLED me. Really, Bardugo? You could've left me heart intact instead, but?? not so much. Also, side note, but I don't understand how anyone was surprised they're a thing in book two. I know heteronormativity is a thing that exists, but how can you read ""not just girls"" and mutual blushing in a heterosexual way? Matthias and Nina were honestly not that big a ship for me here. I absolutely understand what's appealing about their dynamic; they're sweet and have amazing relationship development. But they don't appeal to me personally; I don't have to lie down for twenty minutes when I read their scenes. DIVERSITY: YOUR FAVE COULD NEVERSomething that gets ignored a lot is how diverse this series is; not just in terms of nonwhite characters, lgbt characters, and badass girl characters, although it does have all of those. But Six of Crows also has some of the best rep of a disabled character EVER. It helps that this is ownvoices disability rep. Kaz' disability affects his life in a realistic way, and there's no magical cure for it, BUT he's still a huge badass and the disability never becomes a consuming part of his character!! There's also the fact that a chubby main character is portrayed as the most beautiful member of the group, while also not being reduced to her appearance. There's even a dyslexic character (in FANTASY!) and part of his character arc is learning that his learning difference doesn't make him stupid. There's a major character with ADD as well. This series handles emotional and physical trauma in the best way. Some of these characters have trauma and it's never portrayed as a detriment to who they are as people. It's an aspect of who they are as people, but their background never takes over their characters. It's a balance. Recovery is also portrayed in a great way; none of these characters can be ""fixed"" but that's okay.

A lot of potential and good writing style, but ultimately just another boring, archetypal historical fiction. When I was in my preteen stage, I went through a historical fiction stage, and I read countless books about witch hunts. Almost all of them share some major traits: a main character who is a misfit, usually because she's particularly unreligious, and a boring beginning. Unfortunately, this book doesn't break that mold. Rees breaks no boundaries with her sometimes-boring plotting. Besides the unoriginality, this book fails due to bad plotting. Witch Child is far too drawn out. The first half was completely boring, and the author only manages to develop dramatic tension towards the end. This book does do some good things. Celia Rees' prose flows very nicely, making even the boring bits easy to read. And the main protagonist here was genuinely likable, which is definitely a redeeming factor. But altogether, there was nothing special about this book. It was just okay....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jul 23, 2016","Jul 25, 2016","Jul 26, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/803120.Witch_Child

My big complaint was the boredom I felt in the first 150 pages. I couldn't connect with the story or characters. And then the scene comes where Darcy proposes and Lizzy exposes him and drags him into the next century. In one scene, Elizabeth and Darcy go from my least favorite archetype, “asshole dude is hot”, to my favorite archetype, “they're both assholes and they bicker constantly but they slowly fall in love”. Take notes, every YA book romance from here on out; I'm going to need a scene where the girl drags the guy. From that point on, I was completely engaged. Lizzy and Darcy are my favorite couple archetype, and they were done SO WELL. I understood why they fell in love. I loved how their characters paralleled each other in flaws. I LOVED their banter. I loved how he realized his flaws and fixed them, not for her but because he wanted to be a better person. Again, take notes, YA book writers. Can't believe I got emotional about a couple from the 1800s.

But this book... man, this book is something special. The Glass Castle may be a memoir marketed as high-quality literary fiction. Yet it's somehow so much more stirring and emotionally real than much of what I've read in this genre. There's meaning behind every word, yet it never feels tedious or forced. The symbolism is far more purposeful than many books in this genre, far more poignant, far more meaningful. Walls writes with ease, and her words flow beautifully across the page. I hardly ever felt bored by this story. The characters, however, are the aspect that really elevated this book. These people all feel so real, so sympathetic and so vivid. Walls pulls you into her world, pulls you past her walls, and makes you see what she sees, what her siblings see, what her parents see. The Glass Castle is a memoir, but it's also a bildungsroman. I felt as if I were there to see Jeannette, Lori, and Brian grow up. This is a story that I think will be highly personal to any er who has gone through problems with their parents. It's hard not to feel every emotion these characters feel, understand, remember feeling that way yourself. Even when I couldn't relate to the specific situation, I could feel exactly how I would've felt in that scenario. And you could relate to every one of Jeanne's feelings even when they were in situations I could hardly imagine. You almost find yourself/ in Jeanne's words and in her life. Maybe my favorite part of this story was the inherent sense of hope. It's really important to see stories of characters working through their pasts and moving on. Yet Walls also doesn't shy away from the strong mental and psychological impact of having unreliable, manipulative parents. I loved getting to see the three main characters grow up and move on.VERDICT: This is an unforgettable story that I would recommend to anyone and everyone.

But I want to mention that I took this off my shelf and ended up rereading the entire thing in one sitting and it made me tear up because I think I see even more in this book now than at age fifteen: the idea of caring so much about one person that you wait for them even when they've given you nothing to depend on. I don't really understand why that resonated with me when I was twelve. But it's something that resonates so hard with me now. “So how are we suppose to win? On the one hand, the world tells us that capital-L Love is epic, and all-conquering, and the meaning of everything, but on the other, it drills us with this message that we shouldn't make any sacrifice or effort to pursue it, because that would make us weak, unempowered, desperate, silly girls.” I know what you're all thinking right now, having looked at the cover and blurb: Elle, what the hell, why do you keep telling us that you don't really like contemporary and you don't like romance and then boosting your  for this ya contemporary romance? And okay, you have a point about the not-liking-contemporary thing. But you're wrong about point number two because THIS BOOK IS NOT A ROMANCE. It is adorable and it is funny and it is important, but it is not a romance. What it is, instead, is a funny, feminist subversion of all your least favorite tropes.Getting Over Garrett Delaney is about a girl named Sadie, who starts out as... basically that cliche ya contemporary protagonist we all know and do not love. She looks down on everyone who doesn't read classic literature or listen to the Smiths or drink black coffee. She has probably [definitely] used the phrase “I’m not like other girls.” And she's in love with Garrett, who's even more pretentious and condescending and oh my god Augustus Waters ripoff than she is. But he's framed as perfect, because he’s Hot, and Sadie likes him, but of course he doesn't like her back (or does he?). And to make matters worse, he's going away for the summer. You know. Fifty pages in and yikes, why do I want to read this again? And then it proceeds to smack down every single expectation you‘ve formed based on previous experience. From this point on, the story focuses on how she's given up her personality for a boy and become someone different from who she is. And that's not evil; it's just a mistake. I adore the themes about loving things because you love them, not because they're meaningful. There's a deep current of self-expression and self-love to this book that I adore. Sadie's realization that she's built her personality around Garrett is done so organically. She takes so long to realize it, but it’s a very honest portrayal of the realization – how she's ditched things she loves because he doesn't love them, how she's given up her old best friend because she was “that dumb blonde”. Speaking of which: There is such an incredible takedown of girl hate here. Kayla, the lead character’s ex-best friend, is very blonde and dating a football player. But she’s also an intelligent, supportive, and personality-full best friend. Oh, and then there’s the whole art squad, who are just all so cool. Getting Over Garrett Delaney is so much about finding your people and not looking down on them because they're popular or because they, what, went to a pool party some time?This is the type of book you can enjoy without seeing anything deeper, but when you look deeper, you find more. The characters are interesting, all with their own lenses on relationships and love and being their own people. And this book is also just really fun. The humor is genuine and the dialogue feels very natural. These characters feel like real people. And again, no romance, besides a hint of one at the end. This is what I want contemporary YA to be: lighthearted and fun but dealing with real issues of growing up.Two quotes from this book that I think about a lot:♔ “Great with a capital G great?” Aiko asks, head tilted to watch me. “Or great because you found it moving, and inspiring, and it made your life better somehow?”♔ “You’re not in love with me, not really, you just love the way I always made you feel. Like you were the center of my world. Because you were.”(In case you needed another reason to believe me about the quality: Abby McDonald is also the author of Dangerous Girls and Dangerous Boys under the pen name Abigail Haas. Are you in absolute awe over the fact that Abby McDonald can write such incredible books in both suspense and contemporary? I am too. I live my entire life in awe over how talented this woman is.

Cherry touches on nonstraight sexuality, the fact that the concept of virginity is inherently flawed, the fact that girls shouldn't have to lose their virginities to be valid, and even masturbation. It's surprisingly and happily feminist, especially for a book with this kind of blurb. This so easily could've come off childish and silly, but through good messages and good characterization, Cherry stands out. It helps to have developed characters; Emma, Zoe, Layla, and Alex ALL come off as likable, flawed people. The fact that Lindsey Rosin gave all four points of view a good character arc speaks to her talent as a writer. My favorite thing about the book was the major girl squad at the center. These four girls are so caring and loving to each other. It really is sad how many contemporaries don't even pass the bechdel test, but this one did with flying colors. The main friend group was so supportive that it warmed my heart. Even the romance plots aren't annoying. Zoe's romance and Emma's romance, if I'm remembering right, were both really great. One of the girls even ends up without a boyfriend, but it's not a shameful thing – it's what she wants. Actually, two of them end up without a boyfriend because positive gay girl rep happened :') VERDICT: A fun contemporary about growing up and finding yourself.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,Jul 2016,Jul 2016,"Jul 07, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27206527-cherry

She could not bring up these two without mentioning that they were believed to be in a romantic relationship. That's honestly at least half the reason I picked this book up, so thanks, Magistra Vasquez, for being so extra. Can't wait to have you again next year for AP Latin. Can probably wait for the rest of my life before I translate the entire Aeneid, but that's okay. The Song of Achilles is a romantic retelling of the Illiad. It's written with gorgeous prose, but that's not what really stands out about this novel. Emotion drips from the pages, making it impossible not to at least tear up through the book.For the first 150 pages, this book is a simple romance. While these two main characters are well-built and interesting, I didn't feel much emotion. That all changed over time. As the war begins, Patroclus slowly begins to realize and acknowledge Achilles' faults, leading to a steady character change for him. Both these characters developed so much and were so flawed, yet so interesting. The mythology of this is fairly accurate and interesting– sure, some of the plot points around Briseus were far-fetched, but nothing here is disproved by the mythological canon. That made me really happy, although I know many won't really care. For those of you who need reference on key players:✔Agamemnon, an asshole, abandoning his wife Clytemnestra✔Menelaus, another asshole, missing his wife Helen✔Odysseus, a mixed man, missing his wife Penelope✔Helen, a daughter of Leda and Zeus but raised by Tyndareus, and deeply in loveHighly recommended just for sheer emotion and character development.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,392,1,"Jul 05, 2016","Jul 05, 2016","Jul 07, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13623848-the-song-of-achilles

Hades is a little flat and far less evil than you'd expect. Persephone isn't full of personality, but her character arc as she goes from a woman without much agency to a woman in full control of her own destiny makes up for her initial character. The ending of her character arc is especially powerful. ♚ The main couple here are built up in genuine, lovely way. There's a torch of insta-attraction, but from there, their love grows slowly enough. They are two women who have both been downcast from the gods, each for different reasons, and want to find their own agency. Their relationship is truly lovely. ♔ The Dark Wife does offer some interesting interpretations of classic Greek myth. The concept of the Elysian Fields felt especially fleshed out and interesting. I also appreciated that Zeus was a villain; it was refreshing. ♚ Writing style. The writing is full of telling, not showing, which unfortunately takes down the quality level quite a bit.

The main character, Sam, is one of the most realistic, developed characters I've read in contemporary YA. Holmes incorporates both a sympathetic portrayal of anxiety and a sympathetic portrayal of having issues around food. All the side characters are equally as developed, with believable motives. All the character work here contributes beautifully to the emotional journey of this book.

While it was resolved well and ultimately contributed to Sam's narrative, I question the need for so much emphasis on Andrew in the first half of this book.

I don’t consider myself a Hopkins fan; I’ve read many of her books and hated most of them. But I actually genuinely love this book. This is my favorite of Ellen Hopkins’ series mostly because it doesn't just read like torture porn. A lot of her books don't even have hopeful endings: someone dies or doesn’t make their way out, every single time. Tricks allowed the characters to leave and improve their lives. With emotional and physical trauma, but not dead. This book was ultimately hopeful, which is very different from many of her others. The characters in here are very well developed. Ginger is the best character by far, with a great character arc and a likable personality. She’s so realistic and she feels like a completely real person. Her resentment for her mother and love for her grandmother contrast well with each other. Also, that “four straight one gay” thing which seems to ignore bi people exist? (view spoiler)[Yeah, that’s bullshit, and Ginger is bi as hell. (hide spoiler)]The other characters stand out as well, although not to the same degree as Ginger (for me personally). Eden has a bit of instalove in her plotline, but her desire to escape her parents is very well portrayed. Seth wants to be accepted for his sexuality. Whitney comes off as whiny and annoying for much of the book, yet Hopkins gets you to feel immense sympathy for her. She wants to be loved, and that leads to her downfall. Cody is maybe the weakest character here. He comes off as a bit of a fuckboy, frankly, although he did become more sympathetic later on. In terms of plotting, this book suffers from the same pacing issues as many of Hopkins' books. But ultimately, that can be forgiven due to the excellent character work and prose. I highly recommend this duology....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,Jan 2015,Aug 2015,"Jun 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5510384-tricks

You Know Me Well is a story about friendship and being yourself and pride parades, and it's freaking awesome. Mark and Kate are two straight-laced teens who happen to see each other at a gay bar in San Francisco. They immediately click. I've seen s bemoaning their insta-friendship, but it felt fairly realistic to me; I became friends with each of my two best friends in less than a week. Mark and Kate's relationship is great because they mirror each other while each being their own people. Kate's story is about running away, or maybe not. The relationship between Kate and her possible girlfriend, Violet, is heartfelt and real. Sure, there's a touch of instalike, but it's remedied by the lack of random i-love-yous and by the fact that Kate and Violet really click. And sure, there's drama and miscommunication, but the miscommunications occur because of who Kate is as a person, and are remedied as she develops. They are both flawed people who make mistakes.Mark's story is about wishing for something that might be out of reach. He's in love with his best friend, who doesn't like him back. I liked that this wasn't a story of ""boy in love with straight friend""; rather, it's a story of a boy who's friend doesn't like him back, it just happens to star two guys instead of a girl and a guy. I found it really refreshing. His character arc is believable, despite only taking place over a week. One other thing deserves a shoutout; the writing. Nina LaCour and David Levithan both have beautiful prose; I've read and loved books by each of them. Neither use purple prose; everything stays clean and flowing, just beautiful. Two quality character arcs, tons of lgbt rep, gorgeous writing, and a developed friendship - this book is just as amazing as promised.

His writing style is very natural and flows well. A Monster Calls gives Connor a unique voice and a believable character. The plotting here is simply inspired. It's tense, creepy, and unputdownable. I love the idea of a monster being used to confront your demons, so kudos to Siobahn for this idea. There's a vague sense to the story. We don't really know what's real and what's fake, and in a way it's never cleared up. There's an element of magical realism and of contemporary. I didn't absolutely love the ending. Ness seems to be a fan of open, ambiguous endings, and sometimes I think it works. Here, I don't think it worked.

I have such incredibly mixed feelings on this book. It's written well and full of emotion, and yet... something about The Five Stages of Andrew Brawley makes it fall a bit flat. There's not much to say about plotting, because as anyone who's read Hutchinson's We Are The Ants knows, logic isn't the point. This story is meant to bring up emotional reactions, not entertain you with plot. Honestly, contemporary fiction works best when it's low on plot, high on emotion. The Five Stages of Andrew Brawley is full of metaphor, with every character being something more than what they seem. Perhaps metaphor is used too much here. Every character seems to represent something; some aspect of the life Drew left behind, or some specific type of grieving. It gets to the point where no character feels like a real person; the side characters feel like chess pieces used to get tears out of you.But maybe that's going too far. Drew's character arc here is truly special. This is a book about going through terrible pain and surviving. An important message and one I still can't get enough of in literature. This narrative works very well in this book, and it's why I can't complain about the unrealistic ending. The love plot between Rusty and Drew is... complete instalove. Drew falls in love with Rusty while he's asleep. That's not an exaggeration; the main couple quite literally originates through the protagonist's one-sided staring at a guy's sleeping form. While Rusty and Drew have a well-developed relationship later on, their relationship's beginning made them ultimately fall a little flat to me.

With his brother in prison for assault, and his father loving but haunted by the Vietnam war, his main solace is in his friendship with a boy named Dante. Friendship would be his description of their relationship; when Dante kisses him around halfway through, he tells Dante it does not work for him. His internal narration in this scene cannot tell us differently, as it completely disappears. Aristotle and Dante begins with Ari believing he must become a man in the patterns of masculinity that have come before him: he must be violent, protect himself and his friends by physically fighting back against bullies (as he does) and denying his feelings the chance to get in his way (as he attempts). “The problem with my life was that it was someone else’s idea,” Ari says in the first chapter of the book, encompassing the conflict: how is he meant to find his way as a man when there is only one path, one he does not fit? In Ari’s mind, love is vulnerability; loving a man is both vulnerability and hurt, meaning violence from others. (His brother, as we find out towards the end, is in prison for a hate crime — the violent assault of a trans woman.) Loving a man does not fit the role of a man, and so he represses. As Dante tells Ari: “I guess I'm going to tell my dad. I have this little speech. It starts something like this. Dad, I have something to say. I like boys. Don't hate me. Please don't hate me, don't hate me don't hate me.”We, as the audience, can see everything clearer; we figure out quite soon into the story, when he jumps in front of a car to save Dante, that Ari is falling in love. In fact, it is clear that some readers found it frustrating to read Ari deny himself feeling so completely; the Goodreads s should point to that. Yet for me, and for many other queer youth, seeing Ari’s self-denial rings true. Falling for a best friend is a uniquely devastating experience, and one most of us experience early on but are quick to repress. (I say us, here, to mean people who are not heterosexual. My data pool for this statement is almost every queer person I’ve ever known.) But for Ari, this is not a devastating experience; it is an experience in learning love and trust before even dating someone. Their friendship begins by a pool, joking about two ridiculous first names; it progresses into talking about everything under the sun. “He was the first human being aside from my mother who had ever made me want to talk about the things that scared me,” Ari says of Dante (although, of course, only in his head). Aristotle and Dante ends with Aristotle realizing his feelings for Dante and confessing to him that he loves him: in other words, his ending is to realize that love is not a weakness. The conflict is his development into a man, but Ari’s realization that he likes Dante, and boys in general, is inextricably wound with his development into a man. Finding himself through the perils of toxic masculinity, in other words, is his coming of age. I mean, don't get me wrong, this book is gorgeous on every level. The prose of this book is excellent without being overtly pretentious. (I swear it flows across the page like music - it's like John Green except less forced and never tiring.) I feel like I've explained this, but the character work outshines at least 99% of literature - Aristotle's character development is amazing?? Incredible?? Changed me as a person?? Also, I could go on and on for this point, but the main characters have such a beautiful slow-build relationship - I could go on and on about how perfect Ari and Dante are together, and how sweet their interactions are. I also generally think this was one of the first books that taught me about narrative weight and narrative critique - there is homophobia deeply buried in this book, beneath the surface and on the page, but Alire Saenz is careful to acknowledge and understand it. It's an exploration I doubt I'll ever forget. I think it's, above all, that this is a book meant for us. It's a book meant for our specific experiences, it is a book meant to be an exploration of us, not for anyone else. This is a deeply important book, for me, on a personal level. And I think it will be for many other readers. **I want to note here that Alire Saenz's behavior towards ers has not been ideal; sending emails to ers because you disagree is genuinely never okay, and though I believe there was a public apology for this (that I can no longer find) it's something to be aware of when reading and ing his work.

Cheesy in places and not particularly new, but definitely an enjoyable, psychological read. TO START WITH: THE BAD It's cliche. I think we've all read plenty of books with slightly naive leads and evil opposite characters. Anyone who's read YA suspense of this type will know the approximate direction the plot is headed. This didn't affect my enjoyment of the book, especially since I read this before becoming tired of the cliche, but YA suspense veterans, be warned. Another complaint: June's character has moments of development and interest, but she comes across a little too naive for my taste. She develops out of this to some degree, but not to my satisfaction, sadly. AND NOW: THE GOODWhile June was a little annoying, the complexity of Delia's character definitely stands out here. She's an interesting, morally ambiguous character - not all black or all white. In fact, many readers will view her in different ways. The pacing is a little off, but in a way, it actually contributes to the atmosphere  of the book. There's a constant sense that something is wrong, that disaster waits at every turn. The plotting feels haphazard, but I got the sense that it was purposeful. Whether or not this was a choice on the author's part, it worked well for me. Admittedly, the first half is a little slow, but the twists come so fast you're left reeling. I liked the balance between action and character development.

""You've got a bit of nerve, little scorpion. All I did was invent the bottle.”I think what truly stands out about this book is, to put it simply, how it goes around hitting dystopia tropes in the face. It's such a subtle subversion of everything I've come to expect from this genre. ♔ God, just... the use of tropes. The hot dude who changes things? He's not the love interest. The sudden disruption of life? Uhhhhh - no, it's pretty much a slow burn, actually. The rebellious hero? Definitely not the main character. Even if you dislike this book, you have to admit that Bow does a fabulous job subtly subverting tropes. This isn't just another tropey ya dystopia; it's something far more. ♚ This world is arguably more of a utopia than our world, which is exactly makes it so incredible. A slightly evil / slightly awesome AI controls the entire world and has prevented all war. Sure, it leads to a couple of deaths here and there, but ultimately there are far fewer deaths than there were during wartime. What I truly love is how this book doesn't have a clear good guy / bad guy distinction. Bow plays around with different viewpoints and moral ambiguity in an interesting way. ♔ Character work on point!! Greta is well-developed and likeable. So are all the side characters, especially Elian and Xie. Erin Bow also does a great job building relationships– Xie and Greta made me feel All The Things, and Elian and Greta's dynamic is interesting and multidimensional too. There's not really a love triangle, but Bow creates such an interesting relationship web. ♚ And to top it all off, there's the morally ambiguous and totally awesome villain. Talis is one of the most well-developed villains I have ever read, with believable motives and an interesting take on morality to back them up. You can genuinely see where he's coming from, while also seeing where the main characters are coming from. Bow portrays this dynamic so brilliantly. ♔ Yes, this book is quite slow. And you know what? I did not even notice. It is a purposeful slowness, a purposeful build. There's tension in every moment. And the prose flows really well. I understand that the slowness could bug some, and that some are going to really despise this, but I really urge everyone to give this book a try and read to the end - it just keeps getting better.VERDICT: Despite the incredibly polarizing s, I honestly can't tell you to read this enough. While there's of course the chance you might hate it - and you know what, I won't judge if you do - there's also a good chance it will be a new favorite that stays with you forever.

This book had a lot of potential, but was ultimately ruined by a focus on too many topics at once. The List is about standards of beauty and how they play into the friendships between girls. I liked the message the author was trying to get across. Unfortunately, the author touches on too many topics without adequate development or closure. In fact, the ending barely closes off anything. As an example, the author is clearly trying to call out slutshaming. Unfortunately, there are many instances of slutshaming within the book that aren't addressed within the narrative. Another example: there's an eating disorder storyline which is never resolved. The ending flat-out leaves it ambiguous as to whether Bridget will ever recover. Perhaps it's meant to arouse feelings in the reader, but I don't feel it works here. Rather than actively choosing this open ending, it feels as if the author simply couldn't be bothered to close off this storyline. I had mixed feelings on the characters. Abby and her sister were likable enough. Same with Danielle and her best friend. I absolutely loved Lauren and Candace's story and their friendship development. Sarah's character was a standout here as well. She's a loner girl who couldn't care less about typical beauty. Unfortunately, a badly-developed romance took away from the impact of her story. Bridget's storyline was touching and well-developed, although again, it lacked any form of closure. The two senior girls I found... completely unappealing. Jennifer is okay for most of the book, and it turns out that she (view spoiler)[decided to label multiple girls as ugly/pretty and in so doing, ruin their lives.

Altogether, the message of the book was good, and the author did a good job integrating so many topics and making all the characters memorable.

Chelsea Creek is just as claustrophobic and uncomfortable as you'd expect, and it's a lovely setting for this novel. She unfortunately doesn't use the setting nearly enough as a part of the plot. This is a subjective issue, but there is too much gore. One of the main characters is dealing with OCD, which at one point causes her to burn acid holes in her skin. It's described very vividly to a point where I was cringing. This will be a subjective thing, but anyone not okay with this kind of imagery should stay away. There's a sweet romance plot and a hint of family drama between Chelsea and her mom, but neither of these relationships are analyzed to my satisfaction. I can't believe I'm saying this, but add more romance next time. Chelsea's family relationships seem so complex at the onset, and yet they fall flat and aren't resolved. Everything else about this book was solidly in the realm of “just okay”. The main characters aren't actively annoying, but they aren't very interesting either. The writing is decent and fits this kind of book. There's just nothing special here. Not recommended. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 30, 2016","May 29, 2016","May 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18596578-mermaid-in-chelsea-creek

It's pure, calculated thought stripped bare of entangling emotions. It's cold, deliberate action.This is a book with not a lot below the surface. And yet it's an incredibly compelling and intriguing read. Honestly, I think this is a classic example of a book being saved by the mood and environment. Because if you think about it, the plot concept of a girl disguising herself to seduce some boy and then falling in love with said boy is not that original. But you know what? Atmosphere can make any story compelling. Daughter of Deep Silence has a similar vibe to Revenge, the tv show, which is perhaps what I loved most about it. I liked the main character a lot as well. Frances is compelling because it is so easy to get lost in her hatred. She's planning on murdering several main characters and yet here we are, rooting for her, wanting them to die. But I mostly just liked how cold and calculating she was. It was interesting to see when she did and didn't show emotion - it made for a compelling read. The main problem with this book, and perhaps the one that most ers have pointed out, is the terrible romance. And yeah, those s are right; it’s not my favorite. The somewhat love triangle does end early on, but the ensuing romance plot with Grey overwhelms parts of the book. I somewhat wished for the heroine to drop Grey at the end and move on. Every issue I had with the book could have been rectified by it being a little longer and giving some more development and more slow build to the romance.I once read about this interrogation tactic in which you break the person’s will in steps so small that they don’t even realize it’s happening. Here’s how it works: Imagine a suspect sitting in a police station, refusing to talk. Ask them something about the crime, they’re going to stay silent.But, instead, ask them if they’d like a glass of water and they’re likely to answer. Because not answering a simple question like that seems unreasonable—it’s a question unconnected to the reason they’re at the police station, so what’s the harm?Except now they’ve broken their vow not to speak. So getting them to break it again isn’t as difficult. It’s no longer about whether the suspect is going to talk or not, it’s about what information the suspect will be willing to share. Suddenly, the playing field has shifted.VERDICT: It could've been better, but I appreciated the development and mood we did get. If you can ignore some romantic flaws and character stupidity, this was a super compelling read.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"May 25, 2016","May 28, 2016","May 28, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23281652-daughter-of-deep-silence

Cade's character arc is told through a magical realism story about pirates. Creative concept and great execution. To start, let's list out some positives. The concept is brilliant, first of all.

In that manner, it's got the same degree of respectful portray as any ownvoices novel. It's definitely written well; Shusterman is such a talented guy.

Carry On is an entertaining ride, but can we be real for a second - it isn't the most quality book of all time. Rowell clearly based her worldbuilding off Harry Potter, with a few details edited. She makes her intentions to write a parody so clear that it almost doesn't matter how blatant a rip-off it is. She also does well subverting tropes used in typical fantasy novels. What she does with the Mage's character was fantastic. I only wish she'd done this more. Some of the tropes she did subvert almost felt superficial. It could've been more, is all I'm saying. She also succeeds in taking HP characters but making them totally her own. Simon, Baz, and Penelope were such interesting, developed characters. Agatha... I actually liked Agatha and her character arc, but I still have complaints. More on that later. Mainly Rowell succeeds with the romance. Their development is not too angsty or drawn-out. They've got so much awesome banter. It's some of the best romantic buildup I've read. SOME COMPLAINTSIt's slightly too long. In the first half, this is because of the straight-up infodumping. Yes, it's necessary for the worldbuilding of the book, but it's still not placed well. Rowell has a tendency to be incredibly long-winded and keep in fluff scenes. She also doesn't have too much talent for dramatic tension. This is mostly a fluff book, and it's a good fluff book. Just adjust your expectations accordingly. Agatha's character arc is just not well done. Rowell's intentions are clear; she wants a character who doesn't want to be a part of the Chosen One Angst (TM). It's a great idea, but the execution around Agatha's character is... meh. She comes off as a cheap romantic obstacle taking human form, rather than a well-drawn character.Jesus Christ, the bi erasure. Simon is established as being attracted to Agatha, but then at the end he's established as gay and there's no in between. The entire book is based around the idea that kids know modern concepts as well, and yet the word bisexual is somehow out of reach of their brains? Wait, nope, that's realistic.

With so many points of view, none of the characters ended up very memorable. None were badly written, but the author didn't take that extra step towards developing her characters.

And it's not terrifying because of some gory scene, or some every-fifteen-minutes jumpscare. There are really not that many twists. What's terrifying about this book is the mood.

The ending is fucking angering, but it's part of what gives the book its power.I do think the ending somewhat unwrites some great character development. But I also... don't think the character development was the forefront of this book. I think one of my main issues is going into this novel, I was not familiar with the suspense genre to any degree - only the mystery genre - and when this novel didn't hit the mystery novel buttons, I was expecting realistic fiction where the focus was character development. I do have to say that I cannot believe this was on an lgbt+ representation list. The ending is the only area of vague subtext and this was just... not good representation I've ever seen.

So at the end of the novel, we find out that part of this character's motivation in a literal murder was twisted love. Which the I-like-creepy-shit side of me actually kind of loves. Is it lgbt+ rep? Uh... nope. (hide spoiler)] Throughout the book, there's an obvious rich v poor setup - the kids are partying in Aruba - and the author apparently forgot to address this in the end.

There's no way to explain the plot beyond “they kidnap a boy band member” because from there, Moldavsky adds a twist a minute. This book is a weird, action-packed journey that never loses its grip on you. Yes, it requires suspension of disbelief, but it's a parody novel. Some absurdity is to be expected. Surprisingly, this book reaches moments of genuine emotion and sends some good messages. The unnamed main character has somewhat of a growth arc, which was fun. The characters are just the right amount of morally ambiguous and fucked up. I watched Breaking Bad. I know how to get rid of a body!Mainly though, Kill the Boy Band is just hilarious. Every moment made me laugh. There are well-done pop culture references and subtle situational comedy. There's something about the way Goldy Moldavsky writes parody novels. It never feels like she's making fun of boy band fangirls or people who fight for social justice, even as she parodies them to hell and back. Part of her positive message comes from the fact that she writes from the point of view of an actual character inside that sect of people. Her parodies feel like loving fun rather than fitting into the “lmao, those stupid fangirls” type of humor. That's what sets them apart.

This book has a great concept and interesting characters, but somehow it didn't grab me as much as I'd hoped. Basic rundown of the concept: Whenever Nolan closes his eyes, he sees all events from Amara’s point of view. Amara lives in a different world, where she's a slave to lost princess Cilla. Cilla suffers under a curse, and Amara is forced to take Cilla's pain onto herself whenever Cilla bleeds. Which is a lot. This relationship between Nolan and Amara has been going on for years in the same pattern, until Nolan's medication changes and he gains the ability to control Amara. I loved all the main characters so much and found them sympathetic and relatable. Amara's situation is horrible but her reactions to it always feel real. This book truly talks about how invasive Nolan and Amara's connection is, and how traumatic this connection can be for both of them. It never shies away from talking consent issues and power imbalances, either, which was AWESOME. The dynamic between Amara and Cilla is portrayed very well, and the issues between them are resolved before they ever begin a romantic relationship. This author really deserves an A+++ for diversity. Both of the main characters are nonwhite, one is bisexual, both are disabled. It flows very well in the story and their disabilities are treated really well. The main issue with this book is that it's a bit boring. The plot takes a very long time to come to fruition. It doesn't feel like a convincing slow-burn plot, however; instead, it just feels tiring. And frankly, the building of Amara's world leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Nolan and Amara's connection isn't explained by the narrative, which bothered me a bit. Expect character work here, not answers. Still, this book succeeds in developing its characters and relationships, as well as building up strong themes, so I have to recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,Apr 2016,"Apr 03, 2016","Apr 14, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16081758-otherbound

Pointe is a book about ballet and sexual abuse, but in some ways, it's really a book about finding yourself, no matter what you've been through. ♔ Theo is one of the most believable YA heroines I have ever read about. She's passionate and desperate to succeed. Shes insecure, but not in the “I'm beautiful and don't know it” way; her insecurities feel real, and would be relatable to any teen. She's not lying about her past– she is completely convinced that she was mature for her age and nothing bad happened between her and her boyfriend. She's a flawed yet likable character. ♔ Also, a brief shoutout for diversity: the aspect of Theo and Donovan's race is integrated into this novel perfectly. It's not the focus of the story, but it's definitely not ignored either. ♔ Colbert paces the plot and reveals perfectly. The story unfolds slowly, with flashbacks scattered throughout the book. Every reveal feels natural within the story, with no twists feeling abrupt or out of place. It's not a book about plot twists, but man, are the reveals powerful. ♔ Pointe also manages to neatly avoid common tropes. In any other book, Ruthie would be a rival and stereotyped as a bitch because she's competitive. But in this book, she's Theo's friend and supports her when she talks about her rape. I loved the attitude towards ballet and dance, it managed to avoid the usual ""they all hate each other and the teacher is crazy"" trope. ♔ I don't know how exactly to explain what made this story tick for me, but it's undoubtedly a character-driven and intriguing story. I can't recommend it enough. VERDICT: This book is polarizing, according to the s, but I think there is a huge chance this could be a new favorite for you. It is a character-driven masterpiece and I can't recommend it enough....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Apr 06, 2016","Apr 06, 2016","Apr 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28354933-pointe

There's exploration of the eye-for-an-eye mentality and how it can drive people to their limits. Kit only kills people when she feels that they deserve it, but how can she know that someone deserves to die? There's also a great exploration of a ton of different moral issues. Kit's inner conflicts speak to nature vs. nurture, and it's very well executed. This book doesn't attempt to answer all the different questions it poses, and while that won't work for everyone, I found it thought-provoking. ♔ Kit's character is also quite interesting. She's been raised as a serial killer, so her moral compass is completely skewed. Her perceptions of the world, and her cut-off view of the world, make her interesting and dynamic. While she's not exactly sympathetic, she's so fun to hate that it's hard not to enjoy her narration. ♔ The plotting is incredibly well-done. This book is completely unputdownable and addicting. Suspense is drawn out just enough. // WHY THIS BOOK HAS SUCH A FUCKING LOW RATING♔ First of all, there's a hint of unneeded romance. Although the relationship never really devolves into romance, there's a clear undertone to it. It doesn't work at all for a book this brutal. However, Kit's development is tied more to her relationships with a new friend, which made this less relevant. ♔ Second of all, it overexaggerates police stupidity to drive plot. This seems to be the major problem other ers had, and I absolutely agree with this complaint. The thing is, the thematics of this book are SO INTERESTING that I found this flaw easy to ignore. If you can suspend disbelief a bit, this book is much, much better. VERDICT: Recommended to anyone who likes suspense and can deal with hateable narrators. Yes, it has a few flaws, but if you're willing to deal with them, Dear Killer is a really interesting and fast-paced read. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,Oct 2015,Oct 2015,"Apr 02, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16179216-dear-killer

I don't know why it was so powerful or why it sat so right with me, why it left me crying at 12:30 am after I'd read the whole thing in one sitting. But holy god, if I didn't love it. What's important about this book, to me, is the emphasis on friendship between women as a process for healing. As you'll probably know from the blurb, this book focuses around sexual assault. But it is a very different narrative from some you've probably read - lacking in romance, focusing on healing from ptsd rather than how difficult being a rape victim is. I've seen a lot of people saying they disliked this because it underplays the bigotry people often face after being assaulted, and I understand that complaint. Though she does face hardship in this category, Hermione's arc is more focused on her own ptsd than on the hatred and bigotry she faces from others. But I honestly believe that's exactly what is so strong about this book: it's not about hate from outside sources, it's about the trauma itself and working through it. I actually think this book will be far more appealing to actual survivors of sexual assault than some of the edgier books on this topic. It's intense, but never loses its sense of hope.I also think that the character work displayed here is especially incredible. You get so far inside Hermione's head that you feel as if you know her. Hermione as a character shines as well; brave, but not to the point of stupidity, funny and smart and flawed and always sympathetic. VERDICT: This was my second of Johnston's books, and I enjoyed it immensely; perhaps even more than A Thousand Nights, which is one of my favorite books.

Now, I happen to really love parts of this book. But I have some serious issues with it too. First the good. Portraying abusive relationships3 stars. Now, I happen to really love parts of this book. But I have some serious issues with it too. First the good. Portraying abusive relationships in YA fiction is seriously important, and this book did a great job of that. Zephyr (okay, bad name, whatever) descends into this relationship pretty slowly. Her and Alex start out as a relatively good couple. Sure, he's overbearing, but they have a decent dynamic that seems to include respect and genuine love. Zephyr's character is developed enough that we see how lonely she is and how much she wants to be in love. The author really puts her all into developing this character, and this new relationship. We see how Alex becomes worse and worse and the relationship seriously darkens. I also really liked that Zee's mom and best friends helped her to escape the cycle of abuse, rather than the usual ""new guy in her life is the only one who cares"" trope. The only problem with this book is unfortunately quite a large one. Her new love interest, Gregg, is just as much of an asshole. And he's an asshole to her from the start, not just once they get into a relationship. HE is the one who stops talking to her after she gets together with Alex. HE is the one who ostracizes her and makes her feel unwanted in her own friend group. HE is the one who pushes her away, just because she doesn't like him back. And this is never, ever called out. Not once in the whole damn book. In fact, the author almost seems to imply that if Zephyr had just gotten with this friend of hers (who she didn't like!!) in the beginning, none of this would have ever happened. It's not victim blaming, exactly, but there's a hint of she-should-have-chosen-better. You know what, her new love interest is a fucking dick and their relationship is going to be just as horrible as the old one. Fuck that. So, conclusion. Despite the fact that Zephyr's character was depicted with genuine care, and I really did enjoy reading this, I can't in good faith recommend this book....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 20, 2016","Mar 25, 2016","Mar 28, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22864430-the-girl-who-fell

This book nails mood and tone. Charlie, Presumed Dead atmospheric in just the right way. Unfortunately, I think that's the only really solid thing that happened here. This novel is an exercise in how to waste potential. A story about two girls realizing they've been cheated on, trying to track down their allegedly dead boyfriend? Complete with morally ambiguous characters; one perfect trust fund girl, and one innocent-seeming other woman with a few secrets of her own? Complete with a complex understanding between them? Count me in. Unfortunately, despite moments of good characterization, neither Lena nor Aubrey get any good character arcs. They fall flat, just like this book. Besides that, this book's last few chapters are absolutely terrible. First, there's the racist portrayal of India. Second, there's the nonsensical cliffhanger with no good conclusions to either character arc. Here's how this book should've ended: Charlie confronts Lena and she tells him to fuck off and gets a nice conclusion to an arc that could've easily been about perfection. Aubrey kills Charlie for a creepy conclusion to her villain arc. The two girls run off together for an ambiguous, suspenseful ending that makes you think while also leaving the possibility for a sequel. So much wasted potential.

This is definitely a good book, but it really does not fit the blurb very well. This book seems to be advertised as a book about abuse and its psychological repurcussions. It is not that. This book is a very well-written, high tension thriller. It's just missing the psychological aspects I was looking for. However, the potential is not realized. This could be so much more than a cheap thriller. As a thriller, this book is not bad. There's nothing splitting it apart from other thrillers, though - no creative plotting and new ideas. The book does develop a good tense mood. This book ultimately succeeds as a thriller, which is why it deserves three stars. The main character was well-developed. However, her character work was shoved to the side in favor of the typical YA thriller work. There's not much discussion of her past parental abuse– in fact, it feels as if the author uses her ptsd to drive the plot.The romance was, as usual, not totally necessary. However, it was built realistically as the first relationship of an abuse victim. I did love that the author emphasized Charlotte's character development as revolving around not only her relationships with her love interest, but also Lily and Sanda and that mom (I'm blanking on her name).

This was actually my second attempt to push through this book, after a failed attempt last year at camp. I think it's clear at this point that this book wasn't for me. To get something out of the way: Levithan's character actually interested me to some degree. He's a little too emo, maybe, but definitely not your average ya protagonist. My problem with this half of the book is completely personal, yet took away any possibility of enjoyment for me. Everything is in low caps. I know this is storytelling medium, I know it's creative and interesting, but I cannot read something written in all lower-case without wanting to tear my hair out. I highly recommend actually trying to read in all lower caps for five pages before you actually buy this one. My problems with John Green's character, Will One, were easier to figure out. He comes off as homophobic. The word “gay” is mentioned six times in one paragraph, and that's not an exaggeration. Will thinks of his friend Tiny exclusively as “the gay one.” He is condescending and rude to Tiny. I'd believe that Green was going to subvert the “token gay friend” trope, had he not written Tiny as every gay stereotype in existence. Guys like Tiny exist, but they have personalities beyond being flamboyant. Trust me. The romance plot is between a guy and a girl who meet at a gay-straight alliance, which for some reason doesn't have a single lgbt+ person in it who isn't a gay guy. Has John Green ever been to a gay-straight alliance? Beyond the gross stereotyping, Will One also has no character. He's exactly the same character as every other John Green dude protagonist. This formula got old at least three books ago, and I don't want to read it anymore. When is John Green going to come out with a book as interesting as his YouTube channel on history? I'm being serious here. He's clearly a smart, interesting, funny guy, but all his characters are an idealized version of himself, and it's not enjoyable.

They allow us to escape and to dream and to gaze into the eyes that are impossibly beautiful and huge. They fill us with longing. But also. They tell us to remember; they remind us of life. Remember, they say, how much it hurts to have your heart broken.”Everything Leads to You is a book about movies and lesbian love, and even though it didn’t impress me as much as I’d hoped, it's a really incredible story and definitely worth the hype. The main character, Emi, is an aspiring film worker. I loved the descriptions and depictions of her sets. I’m not a movie person, but if I were, this would’ve been amazing. Anyone who loves movies will absolutely LOVE this book, but honestly, even without loving cinema, LaCour’s writing was visual enough that I could picture everything. Emi’s arc is about realizing she can’t idealize people, and that she can’t idealize the happy endings of movies either. It’s a well-executed arc; it ties in nicely with her new career and with her new relationship. There's a romance here between Emi and a girl she's just met, Ava. Ava is a likable character with a bit of mystery surrounding her past, and also, I'm realizing writing this that she shares a name with a girl I have a crush on! Tea. Unfortunately, I thought the romance here overtook things just a bit, which would've been fine if the romance were spectacular, but frankly, the romance was good, not great. Neither this particular romance nor the movie-star plotline were quite good enough to hold this up for me, which again, is primarily a personal problem. “They weren't cheap and I was almost broke. It was a choice between dinner and flowers and I chose flowers because it was a dark time in my life and my room was hideous and my heart was broken and I needed something beautiful.”I honestly don’t have many complaints about this book, but I somehow didn’t enjoy it, in my 2016 reading, as much as I probably should have. I liked it, but I didn’t obsess over it. That being said, I think this was a complete case of “it’s not me, it’s you” and I do want to recommend this to anyone who wants more books about gay girls and about the movies. I also think this is one I should probably reread soon, as I was incredibly uninterested in both film and romance at age fifteen and now... am a huge cinephile who is aggressively in love with love and would like to read 30000 books about girls kissing.

I played my cards, I lay in wait, I let myself be beaten and manipulated. If she keeps that promise she made to me, I’ll show her the truth I’ve learned on her boat. I don’t just raise monsters. I am one.So like, I know that I boost my  of this book every day and it’s annoying, but every single time there is someone who says they haven’t read it, or worse yet, have NOT HEARD OF IT. Which is a travesty, because The Abyss Surrounds Us is one of my personal favorite books ever. This book is about pirates, and sea monsters [and yes that makes sense in this world], and a really cool antiheroine, and also she falls in love with and kicks ass with a pirate girl who is On The Other Side of The Great Environmental Pirates vs. Sea Monsters Conflict. It’s the greatest.Here are five reasons you should read this book. →great characters←Oh my god, y’all, Cas Leung is the gaysian icon we need in our lives. She has such a classic antiheroine arc, going from from morally upstanding, mostly, to completely morally ambiguous – but also realizing the dimensionality of the world, and that maybe she was the villain all along. All the characters feel developed and real, especially for such a short book. Swift's character is equally as complex and wonderful and also, is kind of the ultimate sapphic dream girl. Even the book's villain, Santa Elena, is wonderful to read about. I’m terrified of her but I also kind of love her? Oh, and then there’s Bao, Cas’ Reckoner pup, who is so adorable and annoying and great. Also, Cas literally talks to him like we all talk to our cats. →fast-paced plot←This book is unbelievably unputdownable. Even in moments where the book slows down, it's never a remotely boring read. The book manages to be super fast-paved and also have a coherent plot arc and coherent character arcs, in a super short page space, and it’s iconic.→creative worldbuilding←This is about pirates and sea monsters. Is that not the most badass book concept ever? Do you not desperately want to read this? The brilliance of the worldbuilding here lies in the fact that it is believable without too much exposition or focus of the plot. The entire concept of this world is really out there, but it's never unbelievable; this world doesn't feel alien. It feels instead like a natural result of a world that remains based in making profit even at the expense of others. There's also a map of the world half-flooded, which as usual makes everything better. →morality conflicts←I love narratives where a character realizes the world is more complex than they thought and then have to figure it out. Here, there are conflicts set up between Cas' world of careful environmental regulations and Swift's world, where feeding her family is the main goal. These conflicts build into both Cas' character arc and her budding relationship with Swift. I'm hoping these get expanded even more in the sequel, because they're really fascinating [update: yes, of course]. →tense, angsty romance←THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK holy shit, I would completely give my life for Cas and Swift. They have so much tension between them, I swear it’s electric. Also, so many tropes, but they’re all good and they’re all used well. [BED SHARING. THEY GET HANDCUFFED TOGETHER. IT’S SO GOOD.] The narrative never ignores the power imbalances between Cas and Swift, but builds up their relationship all the same. They slowly transition from enemies, to reluctant friends, to something more. Their banter rocks my world. Truly the enemies-to-friends-to-something more sapphics we all deserved. Oh, and also, I have forced all my fellow sapphic er friends to read this, and literally almost all of them loved it. I buddy-reread this with part of my Gay Group, I.e. the nineteen year old and discrimination against sci-fi, and both of them loved it [YOU CAN READ THEIR REVIEWS.] Also, s/o to Melanie and Em and May and Sana and Jamie, none of whom I can link to because mobile, for loving this book that I never shut up about. I’d die for all of you. Oh, also, I met Emily Skrutskie once, and she recognized me once, and it was the best moment of my life. TL;DR: if you like really fast-paced books with genuinely healthy angsty romances but also a fast-paced plot and cool worldbuilding and two of the most developed antiheroines ever, you will like this, and you should read it because I need to scream at you about it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,257,1,"Mar 13, 2016","Mar 14, 2016","Mar 15, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24790901-the-abyss-surrounds-us

This book is so good, so different from anything I've ever read before. There's no way to truly describe this novel's plot; it's set in an alternate reality with a world interconnected to ours, with characters living years into the future. Each one of the five stories brings something new to this story, adding one element to the puzzle that is the end. Everything here is not only creative, but also well-executed. Peevyhouse's world is effortlessly interesting, and her writing pulls you in until it's ten pm and you're still reading. Her characters are developed even within their short stories. As I've read more books with the same “let's-blow-their-minds” goal, this book almost should have fallen down the chain. It blew my mind, yes, but so did books like The Ghost of Heaven. Yes, this book has great characters and a creative plot, but other books do too. What sets this book apart? The ending. This book ends with one of the most melancholy scenes of all time, an ending that I still can't stop thinking about. Not only is the ending effortlessly creative, it's also filled with emotion and depth of meaning. Vague spoilers ahead, but I want to say things about the ending. Because really, is really so satisfying just in terms of themes. The way it emphasizes environmentalism!! The way it subverts your expectations but also feels so right!! I just. Adored the ending. I actually got a chance to meet Parker Peevyhouse last year - she was randomly doing a talk on sci-fi at my school. She almost seemed surprised that someone had read her book. And I'm so sad about that. I want everyone to read this book. I want this book to get a fucking hype train and fanart and a FANBASE. It is truly that good.

I was wrong; I found this completely unforgettabI was never expecting anything from this but an entertaining and maybe a little bit forgettable book. I was wrong; I found this completely unforgettable. For being a trainwreck.To be quite honest, I think 75% of the hype for this series comes from nostalgia. Listen, I'm sorry, I know this isn't everything, but I really... don't get why these first three books are hyped, on any level. Not only do I have ten million problems with the tropey nature and the slutshaming and the etc etc etc, it's also just... boring and also, I hate every single character. I hated... almost everything about this, until book three, which I thought was okay because it didn't take me four months [you think I'm kidding?] and also for ending the incest plotline. [Yeah, that.]Listen, I am not opposed to fun trash. I read The Infernal Devices this year and it was fantastic, and books two and three basically emotionally killed me inside. But this was not fun for me. Okay, so first of all, because we've all talked about this, The Mortal Instruments is kind of based off Cassandra Clare’s Harry Potter fanfiction [no, I'm not kidding], and it is painfully obvious. There are basic things, like that humans are known as “mundanes,” while in Harry Potter they are known as “muggles.” But then there's also the fact that the characters kind of feel like not good fanfiction interpretations of various Harry Potter characters. Our redheaded lead character, Clary Fray, is a slightly stupider version of Ginny Weasley. Her love interest, Jace Wayland, is essentially Draco Malfoy if everyone excused his actions because he’s super hot. [I really don't like Jace.] Jace becomes a member of the Ripoff Death Eaters in like book two because his father is Ripoff Voldemort [his name is Valentine. which is actually hilarious]. Simon is... Harry [again, not a very good one], and Isabelle is Hermione, if Hermione were there exclusively to be slut-shamed by the angelic virgin protagonist. I mostly said this to point out how utterly fucking dull these characters are, but... listen, I'm not actually wrong about this. If you match the characters up to her fanfiction [which is not hard], the pairings fit. You know that thing I linked up above? Well, it discusses how the fanfiction trilogy [I mean, kudos for that dedication] is endgame Draco/Ginny and Harry/Hermione, with subtext between Harry/Draco [I'm so sorry, I'm laughing typing this]. The endgame of this series is Jace/Clary and Simon/Isabelle, with subtext between Jace/Simon. Do. you. think. I'm. kidding. But listen, you'd think that after ripping from fucking Harry Potter, Clare would’ve at least come up with something interesting? I mean, fiction doesn't have to be original to be good. But again, it's basically boring, boring, boring, offensive, boring, jace is hot chapter, boring. I... don't even know where I'm going with this, I just need you all to know that this originated as Harry Potter fanfiction. Although I will point out that the original fanfiction this was based off of got taken off fanfiction.net after plagiarism accusations. And then there were Sherrilyn Kenyon's plagiarism accusations. I mean, I think fanfiction and original fiction used to be considered very different things in a way they almost aren't today, but... it's important to know.Anyway. I've established at this point that the characters are flat, it's all painfully derivative, and the books themselves are... boring. But... there is so much more.Beyond the issue of Clary's I'm-not-like-other-girls thing, there's also the issue of messily handled lgbtq stuff. So, yes, it's 2005, and I'm willing to excuse this... a little bit Alec Lightwood's entire presence in this book is to Create Some Angst through homophobia and it feels... so much like a plot device, not going to lie. While it's fair to mention that Cassandra Clare has improved her lgbtq rep - severalsapphic friends of mine would like to notify you that The Dark Artifices is awesome wrt this - it's not good in this series. Alec is barely a POV character in the first three books of the series, despite being marketed as a major character, and feels super tokenistic. Also, just... his treatment. At one point in this series, his mother, who is a supposedly likeable character, tries to kill him and his boyfriend for being gay, which he forgives her for [how?]. There is later on a lot of explicit biphobia towards Magnus [who is my favorite. I love Magnus] that is not subverted or criticized at all, and in this book especially, there's an intonation of that slutty bi trope [though the character is allowed to develop beyond that, man, it is there.]“You're not gay, are you?""Simon's greenish color deepened. ""If I were, I would dress better.”this... is... not... funny...No, Cassandra Clare would rather focus on something else: a sideplot where Ripoff Ginny Weasley believes Hot Draco Malfoy is her brother for two fucking books. It is exactly as terrible as it sounds. For two full books, I had to live through Ripoff Ginny Weasley’s angst over her crush on her brother and about their forbidden love or whatever the shit. Yes, I KNOW (view spoiler)[they eventually realize they weren't related. But here's the thing; they're still in love when they believe they are. (hide spoiler)] They almost have sex while still believing they're related [book three]. That's not even the weirdest part; they do it in Voldemort Except Boring’s home, right after they almost physically die, and it's wild. Do you know how many hours I spent trying to wash my eyes out after reading this? Why, exactly, is sex between two people who literally think they are siblings an enjoyable thing to read about? The focus on Draco Malfoy’s bare chest was bad enough; I don’t need to think about incest sex too. Oh, and there are so many constant descriptions of Jace’s utter maleness. It honestly feels like an entire book jacking off to the thought of Draco Malfoy’s bare chest. It's not good. I don't know. I guess not everything is bad? The worldbuilding was possibly something cool ten years ago, but it's pretty typical nowadays. I'll also give Clare a bit of credit - she's pretty great at writing dialogue. The moments where the characters are chatting or hanging out in squad dynamics are a lot of fun. But overall... no. It's full of tropes, there aren't really any plot twists, and it's honestly just boring. I'm sorry, I really don't understand the hype. Like, come on, besides being an example of all the worst bits of YA literature, from the underdeveloped characters to the lackluster worldbuilding, this first book truly takes the cake as one of the worst I've ever read. Oh, and I'm just going to say it: Jace and Simon have huge crushes on each other. I am NOT giving up this opinion. I don't really give a shit about either of them or care about this relationship, I'm just saying that factually, they talk about each other like they want to have wild sex. I'm ALSO saying that the ending scene of book two reads like shitty vampire smut. I'm picturing it on fanfiction.net with the description m/m blood drinking kink erotica don't like don't read!!!VERDICT: This book is terrible. I'm somewhat shocked to say that it gets a little better later on, but this one is objectively terrible. Maybe just skip to book two if you genuinely want to read the series [listen, I like The Infernal Devices]. Or skim. Please just skim.

It is angry, yes, but it is also sad, and real, and deeply heartbreaking. All the Rage is one of the most excellent portrayals of rape culture I have ever read, in my life. Courtney Summers doesn't shy away from the godawful things that go along with being a victim. The feeling of claustrophobia here is so real. It's a raw, painful story, brimming with deep anger. I loved the main character here, Romy. She's a bit emotionally cold and unlikable, something many ers seem to have noticed, but it is this that makes the book even more impressive. She's fleshed-out, with the primary narrative agency in every moment, and infinitely sympathetic even at her worst. I felt her, and this is what makes her such a compelling, strong narrator. As for the romance... frankly, I was a bit annoyed, three years ago (I’ve been on Goodreads for over three and a half years?? Jesus), that Courtney Summers felt the need to add a romance plot. This romance plot is actually quite good. I enjoyed their interactions; it's a fleshed-out romance plot that handles her trauma with respect and dignity. I do, however, generally think modern media needs to not always portray a love interest as the answer to rape trauma. At this point, Romy needs friends, both boys and girls, and family, a good support system. She does not *need* a boyfriend. The narrative of ""the boy who builds you back up"" almost seems to imply the heroine is ""damaged goods"" until a boy dates her. On an individual level, however, this is not a complaint about All the Rage on its own.

And to think it's possible is a really big mistake. A life-ruining one if you're not careful.The Hate List is about perception - how we can look at someone and see them as all bad or all good when they have tons beneath. Valerie perceived her boyfriend, Nick, as good – before he shot up their school. And everyone sees Valerie as bad, except for Jessica, the girl whose life Valerie saved. This didn't feel like a transparent attempt at starting Important Conversations On School Shootings. In fact, as the author says herself, this book isn't about school shootings and trending topics. I'll bet if you asked ten readers what Hate List was about, they'd say a school shooting. But for me, Hate List was never about a school shooting. This was always Valerie's story. -Jennifer BrownTrue to the author's intent, Valerie's story is truly what makes this book stand out. She feels guilty for her role in what happened, however small, but she's not perfect. She still hates some of these people and she misses the one guy who made her feel happy, even though he was a monster. Her character arc is one of the most solid I've read in contemporary fiction.I also want to give this book a shoutout for a great representation of ptsd and an actually helpful counselor, which - at the point I read this book - I literally think I had never seen in a book before. As someone who sees a therapist, and has an excellent relationship with said therapist (especially now, with a new one) I think it's important to show audiences that therapy, with the right person, is actually a deeply positive thing. Jessica and Valerie's relationship is maybe my favorite part of this entire book. The focus on platonic friendship as a way of healing rather than a romantic relationship really improved this book. So many books feel the need to insert a guy who can ""teach the girl to love again"", and in this case, I loved that Val just needed a friend.VERDICT: The Hate List is an amazing, character-driven exploration of overcoming trauma that avoids the normal narratives of ~recovery boys~ in favor of friendship and primary agency to women.

At the time I finished this book, I apparently vaguely liked Eliza and Anita's chapters. But I forgot about both of them ten seconds after I closed the book, which says a lot. Eliza and Anita weren't good characters, they were just less bad than the two boys, who, as other ers have pointed out, had annoyingly misogynistic tendencies. There were bits where I felt the author was trying to deconstruct these cliches. But unfortunately, it doesn't really... get closed off in a circular way? I don't know how to describe my issue with it, but I don't think this book really did a good job reconstructing cliches. The plot is a bit boring as well. Actually, there's kind of... not a plot? Which would usually work, but with all these boring-ass characters around, why should I care? This book did make me think about the world. I found myself genuinely liking the deep thoughts inserted here and there. I also really enjoyed the ending. The existentialism here is very well-done.

She starts off with an intriguing concept, flowery writing, gorgeous atmosphere, and great character voices. And then she just... fails to deliver on any of it. The issue is that she often turns the focus onto romance and leaves character arcs and plot arcs to languish.  // BUILDING TO GREATNESSAs per usual, we start off with a cool concept and atmosphere. Everyone at Heather’s small-town high school pitches in money to form the jackpot, then compete for this money at the end of senior year. The anonymous judges set a series of challenges and life-risking events, in each round, one person gets out. As usual, the small-town atmosphere is pitch-perfect. I almost felt the claustrophobia and desperation of these characters. And yet again, as usual, Oliver nails character voices. It's hard to distinguish first person tense, yet Oliver does it perfectly here. Heather and Dodge do sound very different. And in general, I adore Lauren Oliver's character voices. The character voices were what made Delirium and Before I Fall so enjoyable to me. I also enjoyed the squad Heather, Natalie, Bishop, and Dodge formed.  // FAILING TO DELIVERThere are two issues here. Number one is lack of character development. Panic begins to succeed with character work, and then begins to fall flat by failing to truly make the reader remember them. Heather and Dodge do have distinguishable voices, and yet neither of them are really pushed to their limits. The issue is neither ever make that step into being life-changing characters. Number two is the plot lacking any sensical character motivation. As a result, the novel becomes completely confusing and nonsensical. I was engaged, but also totally confused. This novel is truly weird. It’s a strange blend of suspense and contemporary that actually somewhat works. Panic takes on this odd feeling of magical realism which blends perfectly with Oliver's writing style. It feels both real and removed. Lack of character motivation is really this book's biggest problem in terms of believability. While the game seems interesting at first, it truly doesn’t make much sense for this small town. Flimsy worldbuilding - strike one. But the real issue is that the characters joining Panic makes no sense. There’s no clear motivation for Heather to join Panic in the first place. $50000 should not be worth the risk for her, and she makes her decision too quickly. Dodge’s motivation of revenge is slightly more believable, although still kind of ridiculous. This lack of true motivation makes the characters seem flimsy when they’re actually pretty good characters.Panic should've been so good. It should've been an eerie story about small town life and what happens when people are pushed to their limits. But it just... didn't hit the mark.

And yet, here's Stephanie Perkins, making me take that back. This book It's really hard for me to enjoy books that I know aren't objectively amazing. And yet, here's Stephanie Perkins, making me take that back. This book has a lot of problems, but somehow it's super fun anyway.// CLICHES AREN'T THE PROBLEMI think you can figure out the plot of this story from the cover. An Eiffel Tower? A kiss? A girl with a very American name? Hm, I wonder if she's going to be naive, go to an English-speaking school in France, develop an instant crush on some dude, do stereotypical French things, and have the guy fall in love with her!! Let's make it clear that there's nothing new about this story.Also, let's all admit this book is meant to appeal to people because Etienne is a dream boyfriend. I know this is how contemporary romance is written nowadays, but I really dislike this way of writing romance. I'm really not interested in these Typical Hot Sensitive Boys. I want to know why the guy and the girl fit. I want to know why they should be dating, not why the girl likes the guy. I do have to admit that Etienne is pretty cute, as YA love interests go. I mean, I'm a lesbian and can't really appreciate sex appeal, so cute dorks are pretty much the only YA dudes I accept. Thank goodness Etienne fits into that category. Anyway, I'm rambling. Despite how I've talked about their use, cliches aren't even the problem here. You can have fantastic romances based entirely off cliches, as long as they're used well. Here, the cliches are used in an okay way, but man, it could've been better. Let's discuss how. // ISSUES: MAKE THIS LESS BAD AND MORE CUTELet's make something clear: there is emotional cheating going on here. And it really takes down the quality of the book. If Etienne hadn't had a girlfriend, this romance would've been way more appealing. Because as is, there are a few skeevy elements. Yikes. Let's also make it clear that Stephanie Perkins could've used the tropes she used far better. An example: bedsharing is an adorable trope. It's cheesy as fuck, but yes, it's cute. Unfortunately, it is also way less appealing when you keep bringing up that the guy has a boyfriend the whole damn time. Another example: really, we could've been more creative than best friend who she had an instant crush on. Why not have them become best friends and then fall in love? Why not make her fighting her feelings the conflict, rather than cheating?// I STOP COMPLAINING AND HAVE GOOD THOUGHTSBUT. But. We all need to read cute, fluffy books sometimes, and this is a good version of a fluffy book. It's never boring, easy-to-read, and funny– anything I could ask for. I also really like the use of Paris!! I am a Paris girl for life, and reading anything about characters going to movies in Paris really gets me going. Wish it had been used more, but honestly, the word ""Paris"" was said and I was already picturing everything. VERDICT: Not much substance, but a genuinely appealing romance... and this is coming from someone who almost never enjoys the Archetypal Heterosexual Romance(tm). I would've preferred less cheating and a better use of the friends-to-lovers trope, but this was a good and entertaining effort.

Her character voice is fantastic, mesmerizing in every way possible, and her drive to find her brother feels so real and relatable.The issue is I can’t give Yancey ANY credit here because she went from a five-star character to a one-star character somewhere between the first and last book. What on earth happened? While here, she’s a smart, 3D heroine, she later becomes a cardboard prop for a terrible romance. I hate seeing such a compelling character reduced to an annoying, boring prop. So unfortunately, I can’t give any credit for Cassie. Fuck off.Ringer and Ben Parrish are both far more decent characters. Ben is likable and somewhat amusing from the start; he only gets more complex as the series goes on and he's pushed to the brink. Ringer's arc comes in book two, as we get her point of view for the first time. I do have some complaints about their arcs over the three-book series, but... they're better than most.Aside from those main characters, the side characters are somewhat forgettable. Dumbo, who is forgettable. There's Cassie's brother, and what the fuck was even his name? Teacup, perhaps the most interesting, so of course she's dead. ✔THE ROMANCENope nope nope nope nooooooooope. Oh my god, is it terrible. Not “a little terrible” I actively hate the romance here SO MUCH. Evan is an asshole and the entire plot is riddled with instalove. ✔THE DRAMATIC TENSIONThe best!! I really think this book nails atmosphere and keeps everything suspenseful. I really felt Cassie's loneliness, her desire for human companionship. Unfortunately, that lessens quite a bit over the series, just as every other thing did. I guess my disappointment in book three is overshadowing my opinions quite a bit here, but this is by all means a fantastic book as a standalone. Oh well.

This is one of the most compelling stories I've read in my enthis book is problematic as hell and for some reason 2014 me loved itWhat do I even say? This is one of the most compelling stories I've read in my entire life. I could not put this down. I mean, look at the read dates - I read it in three hours. It was ridiculous. The biggest plus to this book - besides character work, as we'll discuss in a minute - was the writing. Talley uses a device where she lists lies these two leads are telling themselves every few chapters, and it works perfectly. I'm almost willing to recommend this just for the stellar writing. Historical fiction, for me, is generally an exercise in character work. If the characters aren't there, it's not going to work for me. Thank goodness this book delivers; Robin Talley crafts her two main characters with a lot of love and believability. Sarah, to me, was the most real of the two leads. I feel like I know her. She wants to fight against racism but she's also scared of what she needs to do. Linda starts the book completely racist, but her character arc feels... super believable. And I'm actually going to give this it's own paragraph! I liked the focus on her good intentions not particularly mattering because she was still hurting people. I also appreciate that Lies We Tell Ourselves is one of the only books I've ever read that didn't shy away from talking about internalized prejudice. The acknowledgement that Linda's initial “Sarah is the best black person” attitude is still incredibly racist was so worthwhile and necessary. I think Talley does a really great job of being conscious of bias and prejudice in this story and subverting concerning tropes. It bears mentioning, though, that I did see a few issues. I've seen it pointed out that the entire concept of a black woman and a formerly racist white woman falling in love shouldn't be written by a white author, which is a fair point. I think that if this were published in 2017, rather than 2014, the reception would be quite different. We've talked and learned a lot more about this trope now, and I don't think it's a trope I'm interested in. All that being said, I think... this was our standard for revolutionary back in 2014. Simply the fact that this book actively challenges racism and homophobia at the same time was enough then because we had nothing. It's not enough anymore. I'll leave you with that; if that's going to make you uncomfortable, skip this one. VERDICT: Um. The trope is something we should definitely discuss and talk about. But I'm going to be honest, guys- I read this book in three hours flat and I cried through the last 100 pages. And I don't think that's something I can ignore, to be honest. Personally, I would recommend this, but I would also definitely recommend some more reading on the tropes involved. and critique!!Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Feb 17, 2016","Feb 17, 2016","Feb 20, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32954321-lies-we-tell-ourselves

My sister fights for her home, and takes what risks she must. That is why I put myself before her today—why I would not let you have her. My sister burns, and she does not burn for you.It's been over two years now since I first read this book, and I still credit it as one of my original favorite YA books, and yes, I still think anyone who shares a book taste with me should read it.So A Thousand Nights is a more feminist, more thematic retelling of the A Thousand and One Arabian Nights stories. And, well, we all know how this retelling goes, don't we? Add a bit more romance, a bit less storytelling, and a bit more fantasy, and boom! We have an easy-to-market YA book. But not so fast. A decent amount of s on this page seem to have described this book as The Wrath and the Dawn's less attractive little sister, but I genuinely think these books are completely different to the point they shouldn’t even be compared. The Wrath and the Dawn is romantic fantasy [and in my opinion, pretty good romantic fantasy]. A Thousand Nights is more of a slow-burning, tension-filled, literary-fiction-esque tale of the power of women in a history that tries desperately to erase them.There's something to be said for books that do something new, rather than just remaking something old. This is a book that, somehow, does both.There's something so magical about the setting and story of this book. The entire book feels like the best fairy tale ever written, all with prose that I could just drop off my finger. And yes, it is a slow book, but it works - with such an utterly captivating atmosphere, I was completely addicted. I'd feel comfortable giving this to a ten-year-old, or to my mother. Okay, and now the real gush point - the unnamed heroine of this novel is one of my all-time favorite main characters. I love how strong-willed she is, how dedicated, and I love that she's clever without reading overpowered. Her dedication to her family never feels forced; so many books use “she loves her family !!” as a major motivation but fail at actually conveying a love for family, but no, the main character of this book feels so real and rounded. I don’t even know how to convey how much I love her and connect to her and would die for her instantaneously. No one paid any mind to the line of dark-haired, dark-skinned girls who came to the qasr, and met their end there. They were nameless and faceless under their veils.The heroine of this story remains unnamed, and as such, this story becomes one of the unnamed, the anonymous, the forgotten. In history, we tend to erase the legacy of women throughout history. A Thousand Nights chooses to play with it by never naming any of the women, but still giving them the legacy they deserve. And while many Thousand Nights retellings play with the romantic dynamic before all else, this book focuses on the women within the story - the heroine's relationship with her sister is the absolute touchstone of the book, and the love she feels for her falls through the pages. It's a cleverly subversive retelling, in the manner of Madeline Miller's Circe or Melissa Bashardoust's Girls Made of Snow and Glass. Listen, guys, this is one of my favorite books, and it has this beautiful cover, and it has so much heart, and the lead is such an icon, and you should all be reading it.

It's a complicated mess of wants and needs, boys and girls: soft, rough, and everything in between, an ever-shifting precipice from which to fall.This isn't a suspense book. Or, okay, let me edit that statement. This is a suspense thriller, technically, but I wouldn't recommend it as a suspense thriller. It's gritty and dark, yes, the mystery is interesting, yes, the plot is fast-paced, yes. But this book isn't getting my recommendation for its mystery. Far From You is getting my recommendation for its characters and emotional heart. And most of all, it's getting my recommendation for Sophie. I am not exaggerating when I say that Sophie is one of the most interesting characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. God, how do I even put this complicated and lovable character into words? The thing I love most about Sophie is her mental strength. She has deep-seated emotional issues. She's a drug addict. But she's TRYING to do better. She is struggling every day of her life and she is winning. The way this story talks about mental health and addiction and trauma is so lovely and perfect. “Her fingers bite into my arm, and I squeeze her wrist tight where I'm holding on to her, because this is what we're good at: hurting each other.”And here's the other thing - this book made me cry with both sadness and joy. The emotional range and tenor of Sharpe's writing, of Mina's relationship with Sophie - it's really something I am about. Also, can I give a quick shoutout for rep? It's really sad that I have to devote a paragraph to this, but this book, guys. This book. Far From You is flat-out one of the best media portrayals of bisexuality I've ever read. Sophie is bi, she's not in a crisis about it, she's not in a love triangle, and she's not confused. Bonus points for actual on-page use of the word bisexual, being owned by her. And I really love how this book touches on homophobia but doesn't become about homophobia. Sophie's bi. She's confident about it. She was in love with her dead best friend. She's solving a mystery. I was so excited by this rep when I first IDed as bi, and it's still some of the best rep I've seen in my life. It's so rare for books to avoid the typical tropes around bisexuality, and this book does it perfectly. Aside from the emotional heart and the characters, there's nothing particularly shocking or particularly bad here. I will say that I loved Sharpe's writing - it has a very nice flow to it and I remember highlighting a few fabulous quotes. There's an interesting mystery to keep you entertained, although it's nothing you'll remember in a year. To be honest, I just don't remember enough about the plotting to judge. I do remember feeling the reveal was nothing special. If I had to say anything, I'd say that I almost wanted a bit more out of the plot. But Sophie's character arc is just everything to me. One of the most resonant character in arcs in recent YA. I'd recommend this book just for her, even if everything else is terrible, but can I just say - this book is so underrated.

And it's definitely going to be polarizing. But holy shit, for me, this book was fantastic. It's not necessarily a book you'll enjoy, but oh my god, does it stay with you - this book along with Abigail Haas' Dangerous Girls got me interested in the suspense genre. It has been over a year now since I read this book and it still haunts me. Dare Me is about obsession. It's about dedication and coming-of-age in a brutal world. It's about power plays and hatred. It's about the drive for competition, and how boyfriends and dating play into that competition in the teen world. It's about the twisted kind of love. The writing is gorgeous without being purple-prosey. All of this incorporates itself into a brilliantly suspenseful novel that is impossible to put down. I read this book in midwinter at Lake Tahoe, yet the atmosphere of this book drew me in so well that I was totally lost. Megan Abbott's mood and tonal shifts are genuinely remarkable, keeping you on the edge of your seat. I love mood books; I love books that make me feel, even when I don't know what's happening. This book is confusing and screwed-up and flat-out weird, but it's utterly amazing. The ending is almost unclear - I don't think I liked it when I first read this. But in hindsight, I think the ambiguous and odd ending worked perfectly. It's the reason this book still stands tall in my memories, and always will. Beth and Addy are both deeply awful, and yet I sympathized with their complex characters completely - even when they're dislikable, they interest you, keep you reading. The relationship between Beth and Addy is deeply messed up by the forces of competition and codependency and yet they remain so interesting to read about.We're all the same under our skin, aren't we?We're all wanting things we don't understand. Things we can't even name. The yearning so deep, like pinions over our hearts.There's something I wanted to talk about in terms of queerness in this book. In Dare Me, relationships between men and women are a weapon, used for power and for sex. The only relationships that do not revolve around sex are those between women: Addy and Coach, and Addy and Beth. Yet both of these relationships are influenced by attraction, from the one-sided attraction between Addy and Coach to the two-sided attraction between Addy and Beth. It is simply that these are the only relationships into which the characters pour real emotion and genuine love.This gets a high recommendation from me to anyone who enjoys suspense novels and ambiguity.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube...more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,"Feb 13, 2016","Feb 14, 2016","Feb 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12982393-dare-me

The temper and cadence of Glory's voice is awesome. Her style flows like water. Glory's character arc and the plot, however, just disappointed me. Neither of them make a lot of sense. The book feels messy and thrown together; clearly not outlined in any way. It's incredibly depressing for no clear reason. The feminist themes should be interesting, but for some reason they don't offer any interest.

But that's not always as easy as it seems. “The more you love something, the harder it is to lose,” side character Natalie says to our narrator, Laurel. The writing style of this book is nice, most of the time, but there were times when I'd read a line and it would just hit me. The book is not perfect. Laurel's character, in particular, seems to be a sticking point for many negative ers on this page. This is because she is deeply naive, on a level that is meant to feel true to being 15 but honestly comes off as sort of annoying. This is as opposed to her significantly less naive best friends and her sister. It is, however, somewhat alleviated by... the reasoning behind her acting more naive, which is trauma-related. Sky and Laurel aren't a good couple. I'm sorry. They're just not. Their writing is mediocre and they're not developed enough and Laurel's development is tied to Sky far too much. And the age difference is slightly weird. Not to stereotype, but Senior/Freshman relationships in high school do not usually end in romantic love. (This is something I apparently felt comfortable stating in freshman year and it is something I, as a graduating senior, completely stand behind.)I mean, what I'm trying to say is that there is a love story between a boy and a girl in this book, a very nice love story, one I’m sure many enjoyed and appreciated. This is not the love story from this book that I remember.Around 100 pages in, it is revealed that the main character’s two best friends, Hannah and Natalie, are sleeping together. But refusing to admit any sort of feeling for each other. Natalie lives without parents, and Hannah lives with her brother, who hits her. This is not notable. What is notable is that Dellaira uses these two backstories for character development in a way I still find really arresting and memorable. Even though these two are side characters, their story is given a lot of narrative weight. Basically, Natalie and Hannah have the most romantic fucking relationship I have read about in my entire fucking life. They're both such well-drawn characters and they work so well together and their love changed me as a person and changed my standards for ya book couples. I'm not just saying this because I'm gay and weak, I swear they're actually a really good couple. I've been trying to think up a way to actually sum up how I felt about this book, and I've landed on this: I think this is one of those YA books that is full of genuinely deep thoughts but hiding it all under a lot of bullshit romance. Here, though, I think there was honestly more good than bad. You know what theme I'm currently spotting in my own s? I love every single angsty book with a hopeful message. Despite all the sadness here, the ending is so hopeful for every character. Again, I did read this over two years ago, but holy shit did I love this book.

It honestly broke my heart. WHY I DISAGREE WITH OTHER'S COMPLAINTSI've seen a lot of people complaining about how the shooter is portrayed as all evil, but I actually liked reading a book where the focus was the victims. The shooter might not be all evil, but he also murdered twenty people. Why are we so concerned about him? We should be concerned about the people he shot. If you wanted more focus on the shooter, I would recommend Violent Ends. MY ACTUAL THOUGHTS ABOUT THE BOOKThe main romance plot felt really genuine, not forced in at all. One of the major relationships and three of the main characters were interesting and real. There was unfortunately one character, Claire, who felt a little flat to me. I enjoyed her nonetheless. Sadly, this book's main selling point is the tragic subject, not the character work or plot. It's a gripping book, but it’s nothing particularly special. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Jan 02, 2016","Feb 10, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/24529123-this-is-where-it-ends

It's a fantasy world for lgbt kids — escapism with a good message. In 2005, I can see this book having been a lighthouse for scared lgbt kids. Unfortunately, it really hasn't held up with the times. Over time, I've become less convinced of this world's relevancy, I suppose. When I reread this one in 2016, I felt like it was almost too much. And I don't mean “too much gay;” it's depressing how this utopia isn't even close to a reality. It's depressing that having a trans girl as a cheerleader is unbelievable; it's depressing that accepting straight guy friends are rare. It's depressing how different this is from our reality. It was a utopia to me last year, but now it's just a reminder of what isn't.As always, David Levithan's writing is poetic and gorgeous. His writing is probably the best thing about this book. Unfortunately, I don't feel it's quite as good here as in later books like Two Boys Kissing. Unfortunately, the slightly flat characters made it a less enjoyable experience. There's a romance here, but it's no different from any other. It feels as if Levithan didn't bother to build anything once he had his concept.It wasn't terrible, I enjoyed myself for sure, but I wouldn't bother. If you want to read Levithan, go with Two Boys Kissing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,Jan 2015,Jan 2015,"Feb 10, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23228.Boy_Meets_Boy
