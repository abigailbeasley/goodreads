On one hand, the descriptions of life as a nurse in the Vietnam War are fascinating (though horrifying) and quite reminiscent of the old TV show MASH. The sympathetic characters and compelling, well researched story will keep you turning the pages. On the other hand, Kristin Hannah includes every single cliché and dramatic experience that could possibly have happened to any nurse from beginning to end, especially when the protagonist returns from the war with undiagnosed (and not even a recognizable condition at the time) PTSD. Coincidences abound; romantic love interests and betrayals -- it's all there in spades.

As a former single mom and a mother to another, I related to and understood her frustrations and challenges. Her choice to live as a college ""kid"" at times when she was no longer of the age to do so was hard to relate to, but I could understand that the overwhelming responsibility of her child and huge worrisome troubles with her ex had been factors in that. I questioned the need for the graphic sex as it opened a window onto a place I felt would better remain private. So happy for Stephanie that she landed on her feet. I liked her and her kid a great deal. Her choice to go ahead with her pregnancy in this book was a head scratcher. I know she hates judgement, but it appears she assumes the judgment would be about whether she was ""allowed"" or ""deserved' to have another kid in the eyes of society. That was not my issue with it but instead the severe money issues she already had and her adding to her enormous burden. Happy it all turned out well and will listen to the next if she writes one.

Nellie Bowles from the New York Times said this in a : ""It’s a strange thing to write a devastating memoir with damning details but demand that these things are not, in fact, damning at all. Yet that’s exactly what Ms. Brennan-Jobs has done in a new memoir, “Small Fry”... and I completely agree. In one anecdote after another she displays Jobs' vindictiveness, his controlling personality, his lack of empathy toward his own daughter and others, (indeed publicly denying paternity for a long time) his manipulative nature, and his incredible arrogance. Yes, by the time he dies, she has forgiven him. He has cried and apologized for not being there for Lisa. But for the reader, (or in this case, the listener) there is no closure there. It is interesting to me that Lisa says she wanted to write a nuanced portrayal that showed both sides of Jobs, yet in her book she gets her licks in over and over -- how he was unsupportive of her activities and talents, how he kept her from her mother when he finally decided to invite her to come live with him, how he was downright cheap with financial support, and how he could cut her and others to the bone with his comments at any time depending on his whims. Lisa's mother comes across well, despite their fierce mother/adolescent daughter struggles, with one glaring exception: her complete lack of financial acumen. She is simply not responsible with money AT ALL, and that ends up making Lisa's life quite tough in many ways. But her even-handed responses to, her accepting off and on friendship with, and her tolerance of Jobs' lack of assistance with their daughter are admirable. (Naturally it was her her best interests to stay in Job's good graces, but still...) As a reader I was happy to hear that she and Lisa have remained close. Jobs simply and clearly did not have the emotional maturity and wherewithal to be a compassionate dad. I was aware of these shortcomings, but never so much as when I read this book purporting to be a loving and forgiving portrait of a complex man. Was this Lisa's unconscious intention? As a final aside, I wish the editor had directed Lisa to cut her uses of similes and sensory details (colors, light, leaves, scents, sounds, and comparisons) by at least half. Too much!!!...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,Jan 2023,Jan 2023,"Jul 22, 2023",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/41822692-small-fry

Mystery, imagination, research, and emotion propel the story forward, and the reader feels the damage and destruction wrought on the personality of the author's grandmother (who has lost two siblings and both parents) with her survivor's guilt, her desire to lie low and to keep her secrets safe-- all with tragic and far-reaching repercussions.In the other books I have read that grapple with the Holocaust, none have had the emotional impact of this one. The utter disbelief of French Jewish citizens that such atrocity could be happening, as well as the inability of many Jews to see the writing on the wall and get out of the country in time make complete sense in this context. How unimaginable to suddenly be subject to ""arrest"" for simply existing...to be taken to ""work camps"" but given no food, no water, no accommodations, and no medical care along the way... only to realize the captors' real aim is to destroy an entire people. Particularly moving is the scene where the author and her mother discover their family heirlooms in the home of a town official's son and can do nothing to reclaim them. France's efforts to repatriate its Jewish citizenry after the war look hypocritical after its utter failure to protect them and the Vichy government's cooperation with the Nazis. Indeed, to get her mother's death recorded as having occurred at at Auschwitz, where she was sent by the French government, proves impossible for the author's mother long after the war. The courage of the French resistance, the quiet acts of micro-aggression Jews face to this day, the struggle over what it means to even be a Jew when the tradition and inclination in your family is to hide and self-protect are all delicately delineated.Particularly disturbing is the backdrop of the fact that anti-semitic acts are undeniably on the rise in this country. That this tragedy played out under the noses of the rest of the world only 80 years ago in the modern and sophisticated world of the mid 20th century is a cautionary tale....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 02, 2023","Aug 12, 2023","Jun 04, 2023",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/170475197-the-postcard

Harry spares no one in his family from an honest recounting, as is the norm for memoirs, and Spare is certainly well put together with J.R. Moehringer as ghostwriter, whose own memoir The Tender Bar  was a solid and compelling read. ""I'm tired of his whining,"" is a common response, as well as ""For people who want privacy, they sure share a lot,"" and ""Must be so awful having to go live in a mansion in Montecito."" All understandable, but as this book makes clear, Americans have no concept of the British tabloid culture nor the toll that the paparazzi takes on people's lives, offering large sums to neighbors, family members, and friends for photos and tidbits, harassing the royals and other celebrities and anyone who knows them absolutely mercilessly anywhere and everywhere. Another surprising aspect was how many even seemingly innocuous stories are completely made up out of whole cloth about conversations and situations that contain no truth whatsoever. Into this world comes Harry, whose beloved mother was hounded by paparazzi to her death. He watches as his fiancee and later wife is crucified for any and everything, in social media and newspaper stories that portray her as a villain for no apparent reason other than to take the spotlight off other family members who prefer their own reputations to be positive (Camilla does not come off well). Pretending to adhere to the ""don't complain, don't explain"" dictum, Harry's family offers not one word in defense of him or his wife, despite horrible and often racist ugliness that would crush any person, but especially one not accustomed to this madness. What I found in this book is a man who wanted to tell his side of a story that has been spun tightly and endlessly around him, a normal guy in a completely abnormal situation. A man from a wealthy family, born into great privilege with precious little agency or ability to act on his own, a man who has worked and used his fame to help others and to support good causes worldwide (particularly in Africa) and who finally escaped the insanity into which he was born. Does he overshare about his brother and father? This could certainly be argued, but as an American I don't see that the royal family has any particular entitlement to privacy, especially since it is not offered to them by their own press, and utter garbage about them all is printed constantly. What Harry and Meghan do with their notoriety now is anyone's guess, but I'm happy for them to have found some measure of peace....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62296528-spare
