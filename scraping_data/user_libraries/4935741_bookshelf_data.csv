There are many intriguing ideasA man's face is destroyed in an accident so he creates a mask, and slowly the mask seems to take on a life of its own. There are many intriguing ideas in this book--don't we all wear a mask? To use the language of Lacan, we navigate the symbolic world, adopting voluntarily or involutarily a symbolic form--a female, for instance, with all the accessories and assumptions. And then there is the experience that doesn't fit the symbolic. This is one thing the narrator discovers as he tries to find a way to belong in the world again. I love interior writing but there was far too much of it in this book for me. Things would almost happen, then the mind would intervene and the action would stop. Still, it brought awareness of the role of the face. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 24, 2023","Nov 18, 2023","Oct 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10000.The_Face_of_Another

Fulgentius, a Roman general, returns to the battlefield, though his primary motivation is not to conquer, but to perform the play he wrote when he was 12 years old. Each conquered city provides a new opportunity to cast actors and watch the play again. He knows the words by heart and as the actor recites, he recites, too. The play is self-referential in a prescient way, and it's absurd because, of course, Fulgentius and his soldiers must kill, pillage, and destroy a place to have it performed. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 17, 2023","Aug 23, 2023","Aug 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48919544-fulgentius

The ground rules are established early with Henry (there are two Henrys in this book) failing to sell his second novel. He wants to write a flip book--one part fiction, one part essay about the Holocaust. His editor, along with a bookseller and a couple others, summarily shoot it down. ""That terrifying event was overwhelmingly represented by a single school: historical realism. The story, always the same story, was always framed by the same dates, set in the same places, featuring the same cast of characters."" (p.12)Henry encounters a taxidermist who is writing a play-- a story about a donkey and a howler monkey--named Beatrice and Virgil. Soon, Henry is intimately involved with the taxidermist (also named Henry) and the initial set-up of the book is echoed in the play and his encounter with the taxidermist. I don't want to give too much away. But in the end, Martel wonderfully succeeds in using the imaginative space (fiction) to write about the Holocaust. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 17, 2013","Jul 30, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7176578-beatrice-and-virgil

Strout uses shifting points of view to capture both characters' interior. She makes a rather interesting decision, especially toward the end of the book to include more of the town, opening up the story.

I'm still mesmerized by the melody of voices, the high register and low register diction. If you are swept away by style, McCann is a great writer for you. He uses a story cycle to spin around the image of the tightrope walker who walked the wire between the two towers in New York during the 1970s. By shifting points of view, McCann displays his full range of voice and style. Inherent tension is maintained because of what happened to the towers. What keeps this rather dark book light is that compelling image of the tightrope walker, rising above it all, defying the odds. An image of triumph....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 07, 2014","Aug 07, 2014","May 28, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin
