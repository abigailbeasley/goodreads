For how can one know color in perpetual green, and what good is warmth without cold to give it sweetness?”This was such a lovely read. Filled with beautiful imagery of American landscapes and interesting perspectives of American life in the 1960’s. The chapters on the South and the story of Ruby Bridges were so compelling.

Many times in my youth I felt like there was no one like me - no one with a poor, dysfunctional, and (at the time) embarrassing family. Like Cody, I moved around a lot and never felt like any of those places were home. But Orillia itself was home. His descriptions of the mall, downtown, the Island Princess, Brewery Bay and more paired with his relatable childhood events made this a really powerful read for me.
